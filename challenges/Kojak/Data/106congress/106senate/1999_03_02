We thank You for the inspiring memory of Queen Esther who, in \nthe fifth century B.C., threw caution to the wind and interceded with \nher husband, the King of Persia, to save the exiled Jewish people from \npersecution. The words of her uncle, Mordecai, sound in our souls: \n``You have come to the kingdom for such a time as this.''--Esther 4:14.\n  Lord of circumstances, we are moved profoundly by the way You use \nindividuals to accomplish Your plans and arrange what seems like \ncoincidence to bring about Your will for Your people. You have brought \neach of us to Your kingdom for such a time as this. You whisper in our \nsouls, ``I have plans for you, plans for good and not for evil, to give \nyou a future and a hope.''--Jeremiah 29:11.\n  Grant the Senators a heightened sense of the special role You have \nfor each of them to play in the unfolding drama of American history. \nGive them a sense of destiny and a deep dependence on Your guidance and \ngrace.\n  Today, during Purim, we renew our commitment to fight against \nsectarian intolerance in our own hearts and religious persecution in so \nmany places in our world. This is Your world; let us not forget that \n``though the wrong seems oft so strong, You are the Ruler yet.'' Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2059-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank you very much. I will begin, \nalthough my colleague and my cosponsor on this measure is on his way \nover. Let me begin the discussion of this measure.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Bennett and Dodd, particularly for \nthe work of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem \ncommunicating to both the government agencies and the private sector \nabout the seriousness of the year 2000 computer problem. I look forward \nto their presentations to the Senate today on the potential economic \nand national security concerns that this problem raises. I also thank \nSenators Bennett and Dodd, and particularly my ranking member, Senator \nKerry, the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, for their \ncooperation and valuable assistance in the drafting of this important \npiece of legislation.\n  As my colleagues on the Committee on Small Business and the Special \nCommittee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem know very well, the year \n2000 computer problems may potentially cause great economic hardships \nand disruptions to numerous Americans and to numerous sectors of our \neconomy. I am very pleased that the Senate has decided to make this \nproblem one of its top priorities and has scheduled discussions on this \ntopic early in the legislative session this year. It is commendable \nthat the Senate is taking action on this problem quickly, and that we \nare taking action before the calamity happens, instead of after it \noccurs, which could otherwise be the case.\n  It is imperative that we move quickly on this measure. And I hope \nthat we can work with our colleagues in the House to pass it and send \nit to the President, because by definition, since this is 1999, the \nyear 2000 problem grows closer every day with the coming of the end of \nthis calendar year.\n  The bill before us is an important step toward ensuring the \ncontinuing viability of many small businesses after\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\nDecember 31, 1999. The bill will establish a loan guarantee program to \nbe administered by the Small Business Administration that will provide \nsmall businesses with capital to correct their Year 2000 computer \nproblems and provide relief from economic injuries sustained as a \nresult of Y2K computer problems. Last year I introduced a similar bill \nthat the Committee on Small Business adopted by an 18-0 vote and that \nthe full Senate approved by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the House \nof Representatives did not act on the legislation prior to adjournment. \nI reintroduced the bill this year because the consequences of Congress \nnot taking action to assist small businesses with their Y2K problems \nare too severe to ignore. My colleagues on the Committee on Small \nBusiness unanimously approved this legislation once again and I \nsincerely hope that we can pass this bill, and as I said earlier, that \nthe House of Representatives will act on this legislation promptly.\n  The problem that awaits this country, and indeed the entire world, at \nthe end of this year is that many computers and processors in automated \nsystems will fail because such systems will not recognize the Year \n2000. Small businesses that are dependent upon computer technology, \neither indirectly or directly, could face failures that could \njeopardize their economic futures. In fact, a small business is at risk \nif it uses any computers in its business, if it has customized \nsoftware, if it is conducting e-commerce, if it accepts credit card \npayments, if it uses a service bureau for its payroll, if it depends on \na data bank for information, if it has automated equipment for \ncommunicating with its sales or service force or if it has automated \nmanufacturing equipment.\n  Last June, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, held \nhearings on the effect the Y2K problem will have on small businesses. \nThe outlook is not good--in fact it is poor at best, particularly for \nthe smallest business. The Committee received testimony that the \nentities most at risk from Y2K failures are small and medium-sized \ncompanies, not larger companies. Two major reasons for this anomaly is \nthat many small companies have not begun to realize how much of a \nproblem Y2K failures could be for them, and many may not have the \naccess to capital to cure such problems before they cause disastrous \nresults.\n  A study on Small Business and the Y2K Problem sponsored by Wells \nFargo Bank and the NFIB found that an estimated 4.75 million small \nemployers are potentially subject subject to the Y2K problem. The \ncommittee has also received alarming statistics on the number of small \nbusinesses that could potentially face business failure or prolonged \ninactivity due to the Year 2000 computer problem. The Gartner Group, an \ninternational information technology consulting firm, has estimated \nthat between 50% and 60% of small companies worldwide would experience \nat least one mission critical failure as a result of Y2K computer \nproblems. The committee has also received information indicating that \napproximately 750,000 small businesses may either shut down due to the \nY2K problem or be severely crippled if they do not take action to cure \ntheir Y2K problems.\n  Such failures and business inactivity affect not only the employees \nand owners of small businesses, but also their creditors, suppliers and \ncustomers. Lenders will face significant losses if their small business \nborrowers either go out of business or have a sustained period in which \nthey cannot operate. Most importantly, however, is the fact that up to \n7.5 million families may face the loss of paychecks for a sustained \nperiod of time if small businesses do not remedy their Y2K problems. \nGiven these facts, it is easy to forecast that there will be severe \neconomic consequences if small businesses do not become Y2K compliant \nin time and there are only 10 months to go. Indeed the countdown is on.\n  A good example of how small businesses are dramatically affected by \nthe Y2K problem is the experience of Lloyd Davis, the owner of Golden \nPlains Agricultural Technologies, Inc., a farm equipment manufacturer \nin Colby, Kansas. Like many small business owners, Mr. Davis' business \ndepends on trailing an international information technology consulting \nfirm, has estimated that between 50% and 60% of small companies \nworldwide would experience at least one mission critical failure as a \nresult of Y2K computer problems. The Committee has also received \ninformation indicating that approximately 750,000 small businesses may \neither shut down due to the Y2K problem or be severely crippled if they \ndo not take action to cure their Y2K problems.\n\n  Such failures and business inactivity affect not only the employees \nand owners of small businesses but also their creditors, suppliers and \ncustomers. Lenders will face significant losses if their small business \nborrowers either go out of business or have a sustained period in which \nthey cannot operate. Most importantly, however, is the fact that up to \n7.5 million families may face the loss of paychecks for a sustained \nperiod of time if small businesses do not remedy their Y2K problems. \nGiven these facts, it is easy to forecast that there will be severe \neconomic consequences if small businesses do not become Y2K compliant \nin time and there are only 10 months to go. Indeed the countdown is on.\n  A good example of how small businesses are dramatically affected by \nthe Y2K problem is the experience of Lloyd Davis, the owner of Golden \nFields Agricultural Technologies, Inc., a farm equipment manufacturer \nin Colby, Kansas. Like many small business owners, Mr. Davis' business \ndepends on trailing technology purchased over the years, including 386 \ncomputers running custom software. Mr. Davis uses his equipment to run \nhis entire business, including handling the company's payroll, \ninventory control, and maintenance of large databases on his customers \nand their specific needs. In addition, Golden Fields has a web site and \nsells the farm equipment it manufactures over the internet.\n  Unlike many small business owners, however, Mr. Davis is aware of the \nY2K problem and tested his equipment to see if it could handle the Year \n2000. His tests confirmed his fear--the equipment and software could \nnot process the year 2000 date and would not work properly after \nDecember 31, 1999. That is when Mr. Davis' problems began. Golden \nFields had to purchase an upgraded software package. That cost $16,000. \nOf course, the upgraded software would not run on 386 computers, so \nGolden Fields had to upgrade to new hardware. Golden Fields had a \ncomputer on each of its 11 employees' desks, so that each employee \ncould access the program that essentially ran the company and assist \nfilling the internet orders the company received. Replacing all the \nhardware would have cost Golden Fields $55,000. Therefore Golden Fields \nneeded to expend $71,000 just to put itself in the same position it was \nin before the Y2K problem.\n  Like many small business owners facing a large expenditure, Mr. Davis \nwent to his bank to obtain a loan to pay for the necessary upgrades. \nBecause Golden Fields was not already Y2K compliant, his bank refused \nhim a loan because it had rated his company's existing loans as ``high-\nrisk.'' Golden Fields was clearly caught in a Catch-22 situation. \nNevertheless, Mr. Davis scrambled to save his company. He decided to \nlease the new hardware instead of purchasing it, but he will pay a \nprice that ultimately will be more expensive than conventional \nfinancing. Moreover, instead of replacing 11 computers, Golden Fields \nonly replaced six at a cost of approximately $23,000. Golden Fields \nwill be less efficient as a result. The experience of Mr. Davis and \nGolden Fields has been and will continue to be repeated across the \ncountry as small businesses realize the impact the Y2K problem will \nhave on their business.\n  A recent survey conducted by Arthur Andersen's Enterprise Group on \nbehalf of National Small Business United indicates that, like Golden \nFields, many small businesses will incur significant costs to become \nY2K compliant and are very concerned about it. The survey found that to \nbecome Y2K compliant, 29% of small businesses will purchase additional \nhardware, 24% will replace existing hardware and 17% will need to \nconvert their entire computer system. When then asked their most \ndifficult challenge relating to their information technology, more than \n54% of the businesses surveyed cited ``affording the cost.'' Congress \nmust ensure that these businesses do not have the same trouble \nobtaining financing for their Y2K\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\ncorrections as Mr. Davis and Golden Fields Agricultural Technologies. \nMoreover, Congress must deal with the concerns that have recently been \nraised that there may be a ``credit crunch'' this year with businesses, \nespecially small businesses, unable to obtain financing for any \npurposes if they are not Y2K compliant.\n\n  In addition to the costs involved, there is abundant evidence that \nsmall businesses are, to date, generally unprepared for, and in certain \ncircumstances, unaware of the Y2K problem. The NFIB's most recent \nsurvey indicates that 40 percent of small businesses don't plan on \ntaking action or do not believe the problem is serious enough to worry \nabout. In addition, the Gartner Group has estimated that only 5 percent \nof small companies worldwide had repaired their Y2K computer problems \nas of the third quarter of 1998.\n  The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act that the Senate is \nconsidering today will serve the dual purpose of providing small \nbusinesses with the means to continue operating successfully after \nJanuary 1, 2000, and making lenders and small firms more aware of the \ndangers that lie ahead. The act requires the Small Business \nAdministration to establish a limited-term loan program whereby SBA \nguarantees the principal amount of a loan made by a private lender to \nassist small businesses in correcting Year 2000 computer problems. The \nproblem will also provide working capital loans to small businesses \nthat incur substantial economic injury suffered as a direct result of \nits own Y2K computer problems or some other entity's Y2K computer \nproblems.\n  Each lender that participates in the SBA's 7(a) business loan program \nis eligible to participate in the Y2K loan program. This includes more \nthan 6,000 lenders located across the country. To ensure that the SBA \ncan roll out the loan program promptly, the act permits a lender to \nprocess Y2K loans pursuant to any of the procedures that the SBA has \nalready authorized for that lender. Moreover, to assist small business \nthat may have difficulty sustaining sufficient cash flows while \ndeveloping Y2K solutions, the loan program will permit flexible \nfinancing terms so small businesses are able to service the new debt \nwith available cash flow. For example, under certain circumstances, a \nborrower may defer principal payments for up to a year. Once the Y2K \nproblem is behind us, the act provides that the loan program will \nsunset.\n  To assure that the loan program is made available to those small \nbusinesses that need it and to increase awareness of the Y2K problem, \nthe legislation requires that SBA market this program aggressively to \nall eligible lenders. Awareness of this loan program's availability is \nof paramount importance. Financial institutions are currently required \nby federal banking regulators to contact their customers to ensure that \nthey are Y2K compliant. The existence of a loan program designed to \nfinance Y2K corrections will give financial institutions a specific \nsolution to offer small companies that may not be eligible for \nadditional private capital and will focus the attention of financial \ninstitutions and, in turn, their small business customers to the Y2K \nproblem. To increase awareness of this program, I have already \ncontacted the governor of each State to make them aware of the \npotential availability of the program. Moreover, so that we can state \nthat we directed our best efforts to mitigating the Year 2000 problem, \nI am seeking to find other ways that the Federal government can assist \nState efforts to help small businesses become Y2K compliant.\n  The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act is a necessary step to \nensure that the economic health of this country is not marred by a \nsubstantial number of small business failures following January 1, \n2000, and that small businesses continue to be the fastest growing \nsegment of our economy in the Year 2000 and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield to my good friend and \ndistinguished colleague from Massachusetts, the ranking member of the \nSmall Business Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague, the chairman of \nthe committee. I thank him for his work on this act and for his \nleadership within the committee so that we can proceed as he has \ndescribed.\n  Most of the media attention with respect to the Y2K problem has been \non big businesses, the challenges they face and the costs they are \ngoing to bear in order to fix the problem. But as my colleague has \nmentioned, small businesses face the same effects of Y2K as big \nbusinesses. However, they often have little or no resources available \nto devote to detecting the extent of the problem or to developing a \nworkable and cost-effective solution. That is why we on the Small \nBusiness Committee are proceeding with this particular response which I \nthink is most important.\n  It is in our economic best interest to make sure that all of our \nsmall businesses, some 20 million if we include the self-employed--are \nup and running soundly and effectively, creating jobs and providing \nservices, on and after January 1 of the year 2000.\n  There are a lot of questions about what the full impact of the Y2K \nproblem is going to be. Is it going to bring a whole series of \nnationwide glitches? Could it, in fact, induce a worldwide recession?\n  One hears differing opinions on the extent of that. I was recently at \nthe World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and there was a \nconsiderable amount of focus there from sizable numbers of companies on \nthis issue. I think it is fair to say that here in the United States we \nhave had a greater response than has taken place in Europe or in many \nother countries. But it is interesting to note that the Social Security \nAdministration, I understand, spent about 6 years and some 600 people, \nand spent upwards of $1 billion, in order to be ready and capable of \ndealing with the Y2K problem. Other Departments have spent significant \namounts of money as well and have had very large teams of people \nworking in order to guarantee that they are going to be safe. Compared \nto that, you have very large entities in Europe and elsewhere that are \nonly just beginning.\n  So, if you look at the numbers of people and the amount of money and \nthe amount of years people have been spending in order to try to put \ntogether solutions--obviously those experiences can be helpful to many \nother entities around the world as we cope with this problem. But the \nbottom line is, we know our economy is interdependent. We know that \nmost of our technology, interdependent as it is, is date-dependent, and \nmuch of it is incapable of distinguishing between the years 2000 and \n1900.\n  We have 10 short months now to become completely Y2K compliant, and \nnational studies have found that the majority of small businesses in \nthe United States are not ready and they are not even preparing. \nSpecifically, the 1998 ``Survey of Small and Mid-Sized Business'' by \nArthur Andersen Enterprise Group and National Small Business United \nfound that only 62 percent of all small- and mid-sized businesses have \neven begun addressing Y2K issues. The good news is that a greater \npercentage of small- and mid-sized businesses are preparing for Y2K \nthan last summer. The bad news is that they have only just begun that \nprocess and a significant group is taking a ``wait and see'' approach.\n  On a local level, Y2K consultants and commercial lenders in \nMassachusetts, from Bank Boston to the Bay State Savings Bank, tell us \nof reactions to the Y2K dilemma that vary from complete and total \nignorance, or complete and total denial, to paralysis or simply to \napathy.\n  I will give you an example. Bob Miller, the president of Cambridge \nResource Group in Braintree, MA, shared with us what he has observed. \nThough his company specializes in the Y2K compliance of systems with \nembedded processors for Fortune 1000 companies and large State \nprojects, he knows how real the technology problem is and how expensive \na consultant can be. He has tried to help small companies through free \nseminars, but literally no one shows up. One time, in Maine, only 2 out \nof 400 companies responded. ``Small businesses just don't get it. Many \nthink it is a big company problem, but it is not. It will bite them,'' \nsays Mr. Miller. He advises companies to start now, and to build a \ncontingency plan first, because it is so late in the game.\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\n  The owner of Coventry Spares, Ltd., a vintage motorcycle parts \ncompany, would not disagree with that. John Healy was one of those \nsmall business owners who thought it was somebody else's problem. It \ncouldn't happen to him. Luckily for John Healy and his business, he got \na scare and so he decided to test his computer system by creating a \npurchase order for motorcycle pistons with a receivable date of early \nJanuary 2000. So what happened when he put the order into his system? \nHe punched a key and he waited for his software to calculate how many \ndays it would take to receive the order. He got back a series of \nquestion marks.\n  Then he turned to the company's software that publishes its ``Vintage \nBikes'' magazine and he tested it with a 2000 date. His indispensable \nmachine told him the date was not valid.\n  Mr. Healy's computer problems are, ironically, compounded by his own \nYankee ingenuity. As his business evolved, he combined and customized a \nmishmash of computer systems. It saved money, it worked well, handling \neverything from the payroll to inventory management, but making these \nsoftware programs of the various computers Y2K-compliant is all but \nimpossible. As Mr. Healy said:\n\n       ``[These programs] handle 85 percent of the business that \n     makes me money. If I didn't fix this by the year 2000, I \n     couldn't do anything. I'd be a dead duck in the water.''\n\n  When all is said and done, Mr. Healy estimates he is going to pay \nmore than $20,000 to become Y2K-compliant, and that includes the cost \nof new hardware, operating system and database software and conversion.\n  So, how do we reach those small business owners who have been slow to \nact, or who, to date, have no plans at all to act? How do we help them \nfacilitate assessment and remediation of their businesses? We believe \nthe way we do that is by making the solution affordable.\n  According to the same Andersen and NSBU study that I quoted a moment \nago, 54 percent of all respondents said ``affording the cost [was the] \nmost difficult challenge in dealing with information technology.''\n  That sentiment was echoed by David Eddy, who is a Y2K consultant who \nowns Software Sales Group in Boston, and who testified before the Small \nBusiness Committee when we were putting this legislation together last \nJune. Mr. Eddy recently wrote:\n\n       ``Basically, all of our customers are having trouble paying \n     for Y2K. . ..The cost varies from client to client, but no \n     business has ``extra'' money around, so they are \n     struggling.''\n\n  So, Mr. President, cost is a very legitimate, albeit risky, reason to \ndelay addressing the Y2K problem--saving until you are a little ahead \nor waiting until the last possible moment to take on new debt to \nfinance changes. Those are strategies that many companies are forced to \nadopt, but those are strategies that can still leave you behind the \neight ball as of January 1, year 2000.\n  If you own your own facility, you have to ask yourself, Is the \nsecurity system going to need an upgrade? What will the replacement \ncost be? Will simple things work? Will the sprinklers in your plant \nwork? What happens if there is a fire? If you own a dry cleaning store \nand you hire a consultant to assess the equipment in your franchise, \nwill remediation eat up all of your profit and set you back?\n  These are the basic questions of any small business person in this \ncountry. Some business owners literally cannot afford to hear the \nanswers to those questions. It may come down to a choice between debt \nor dissolution, or rolling the dice, which is what a lot of small \ncompanies are deciding to do. They say to themselves: I can't really \nafford to do it, I am not sure what the implications are, I am small \nenough that I assume I can put the pieces together at the last moment--\nso they are going to roll the dice and see what happens.\n  There is another problem with waiting. Just as regulators have forced \nlenders to bring their systems into compliance, the lenders themselves \nare now requesting the same compliance of existing borrowers and loan \napplicants. In Massachusetts, for instance, the Danvers Savings Bank, \none of the State's top SBA lenders, has stated publicly that it will \nnot make loans to businesses unless they are in control of their Y2K \nproblems. The bank fears that if a small company isn't prepared for Y2K \nproblems, it could adversely affect its business, which could then, \nobviously, adversely affect the loan that the bank has made and the \nsmall business ability to repay the loan, which adversely affects the \nbottom line for the bank.\n  The Year 2000 Readiness Act gives eligible business owners a viable \noption. And that is why we ask our colleagues to join in supporting \nthis legislation today.\n\n  This legislation will make it easy for lenders, and timely for \nborrowers, and it is similar to the small business loan bill that I \nintroduced last year in Congress. It expands the 7(a) loan program, one \nof the most popular and successful guaranteed lending programs of the \nSmall Business Administration.\n  Currently, this program gives small businesses credit, including \nworking capital, to grow their companies. If the Year 2000 Readiness \nAct is enacted, those loans can be used until the end of the year 2000 \nto address Y2K problems ranging from the upgrade or replacement of \ndate-dependent equipment and software to relief from economic injury \ncaused by Y2K disruptions, such as power outages or temporary gaps in \ndeliveries of supplies and inventory.\n  The terms of 7(a) loans are very familiar to those, obviously, within \nthe small business community, and they have taken advantage of them. \nThe fact is, these loans are very easy to apply for and to process. \nThey are structured to be approved or denied, in most cases, in less \nthan 48 hours. So for those who fear paperwork or fear the old \nreputation of some Government agencies, we believe this is a place \nwhere they can find a quick answer and quick help to their problems. We \nexpect the average Y2K loan to be less than $100,000.\n  In addition, Mr. President, to give lenders an incentive to make 7(a) \nloans to small businesses for Y2K problems, the act raises the \nGovernment guaranties of the existing program by 10 percent, from 80 \npercent to 90 percent for loans of $100,000 or less, and from 75 to 85 \npercent for loans of more than $100,000. Under special circumstances, \nthe act also raises the dollar cap of loan guarantees from $750,000 to \n$1 million for Y2K loans.\n  Eligible lenders can use the SBA Express Pilot Program to process Y2K \nloans. Under this pilot, lenders can use their own paperwork and make \nsame-day approval, so there can be a streamlined process without a \nwhole lot of duplication for small businesses, which we know is one of \nthe things that most drives small business people crazy. The tradeoff \nfor the ease and loan approval autonomy is a greater share of the loan \nrisk. Unlike the general 7(a) loans, SBA Express Pilot loans are \nguaranteed at 50 percent.\n  We know that many small-business owners also have shoestring budgets, \nand that they are going to be hard-pressed to pay for another monthly \nexpense. With this in mind, we have designed the Small Business Year \n2000 Readiness Act to encourage lenders to work with small businesses \naddressing Y2K-related problems by arranging for affordable financing \nterms. For example, when quality of credit comes into question, lenders \nare directed to resolve reasonable doubts about the applicant's ability \nto repay the debt in favor of the borrower. And, when warranted, \nborrowers can get a moratorium for up to 1 year on principal payments \non Y2K 7(a) loans, beginning when the loans are originated.\n  Mr. President, one final comment. As important as this Y2K loan \nprogram is, in my judgment, it has to be available in addition to, not \nin lieu of, the existing 7(a) program. It is a vital capital source for \nsmall businesses. We provided 42,000 loans in 1998, and they totaled $9 \nbillion. That is not an insignificant sum. What we do not want to have \nhappen is to diminish the economic up side of that kind of lending. \nWith defaults down--and they are--and recoveries up and the \nGovernment's true cost under the subsidy rate at 1.39 percent, we \nshould not create burdens that would slow or reverse the positive trend \nthat we have been able to create.\n  To protect the existing 7(a) program, we have to make certain that it \nis adequately funded for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. And because the \nY2K loan program is going to be part of the 7(a) business lending \nprogram, funds that have already been appropriated for the 7(a) program \ncan be used for the Y2K loan program.\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\n  Already this year, demand for that lending is running very high. \nTypically, the demand for 7(a) loans increases by as much as 10 percent \nin the spring and in the summer. So we are entering the high season of \ncyclical lending within the SBA itself. If that holds true for the \ncurrent fiscal year, the program may use nearly all of its funds to \nmeet the regular loan demand. There may be even greater demand for Y2K \nlending as people become more aware of the problem with increased \npublicity and discussion of it in a national dialogue.\n\n  Under these circumstances, we need to be diligent about monitoring \nthe 7(a) loan program to make certain there is adequate funding. I \nappreciate that Chairman Bond, who also serves on the Appropriations \nCommittee, shares this concern and has agreed to work with me to secure \nthe necessary funds targeted specifically for the Y2K loan program, and \nI thank Chairman Bond for his commitment.\n  I also thank Senators Bennett and Dodd and the Small Business \nAdministration for working with our committee on this important \ninitiative. We have tackled some tough policy issues, and the give-and-\ntake, I believe, has made this legislation more helpful for businesses \nthat face the Y2K problems.\n  I am very hopeful that all of our colleagues will join with us in \nvoting yes today and that our friends on the House side will act as \nquickly as possible to pass S. 314. It is, obviously, a good program \nthat will have a profound impact on the year 2000 and on the long-term \neconomic prospects of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member, once again. His \nwork on this measure, as so many others, and the work of his staff has \nbeen essential to assuring a product that meets the needs of small \nbusiness and also deals with legitimate concerns which were raised \ninitially by the SBA and others, and we are grateful to him for that \neffort. I thank him for his strong leadership and the very compelling \ncase he makes.\n  Obviously, all the members of the Small Business Committee believe \nvery strongly that small business needs some help, and we would love to \nhave more people talking about the Y2K problem, but I should advise my \ncolleagues, and those who are watching, that there is, as we speak, a \nhearing going on in the Y2K Committee where Senator Dodd and Senator \nBennett are exploring some of the other issues.\n  This is really ``Y2K Day'' in the Senate because, as I stated in the \nopening, when we finish the vote on this measure--which I hope will be \noverwhelming in favor of it--there will be a confidential hearing \nregarding the Y2K issue in room S-407, and at 2:15 p.m., we will begin \nconsideration of a resolution to fund this special committee dealing \nwith the Y2K issues.\n  I noticed on one of the morning television shows that we are getting \nsome good coverage and discussion in the media about the Y2K problem, \nand today certainly the Senate has explored in many, many different \naspects how we can help smooth the transition to January 1, 2000, and \nbeyond, when computers, if they are not fixed, might think that it is \n1900 all over again.\n  Mr. President, we invite Members who want to come down to speak on \nthis issue to do so. We hope they will have some time. We have 20 \nminutes more. And after, I may use some time on another matter, but I \nwant to find out if there are other Members who wish to address the Y2K \nproblem first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 314, the \nSmall Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. I also want to thank Chairman \nBond and Senator Kerry for their leadership on this issue. Without this \nlegislation a large percentage of the 97,000 small businesses in \nLouisiana and nearly 5 million small business nationwide would not have \naccess to needed credit necessary to repair Year 2000 computer \nproblems.\n  According to recent studies and information provided to the Senate \nSmall Business Committee, as estimated 750,000 small businesses are at \nrisk of being temporarily shut down or incurring significant financial \nloss. Another four million businesses could be affected in other ways. \nIn fact, any small business is at risk if it uses any computers in its \nbusiness or related computer applications. For example, any e-commerce \nbusiness or other businesses that use credit card payments, the use of \na service bureau for its payroll, or automated manufacturing equipment \ncould be affected. It is difficult to predict how serious the \nimplications could be. But it is clear that if the Congress does not \nact, millions of small businesses, so important to our national \neconomy, and millions of families dependent on these enterprises will \nsuffer greatly.\n  A recent survey conducted on behalf of National Federation of \nIndependent Business, NFIB, by Arthur Andersen indicated that many \nsmall businesses will incur significant costs to become Y2K compliant \nand are very concerned. The survey found that to become Y2K compliant, \n29 percent of small to medium sized businesses will purchase additional \nhardware, 24 percent will replace existing hardware and 17 percent will \nneed to convert their entire computer system. Then, when asked their \nmost difficult challenge relating to their information technology, more \nthan 54 percent of the businesses surveyed cited ``affording the \ncost.''\n  However, according to the NFIB, while these studies indicated many \nare worried, 40 percent of small businesses don't plan on taking action \nor do not believe the problem is serious enough to worry about. \nFortunately, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, tries to \naddress this problem as well as other credit issues, facing small \nbusinesses. First and foremost, it allows the Small Business \nAdministration the authority to expand its guaranteed loan program to \nprovide these businesses with the means to continue operating \nsuccessfully after January 1, 2000. Moreover, it will provide technical \nassistance in order to help educate lenders and small firms about the \ndangers that lie ahead. And, finally, this measure allows small \nbusinesses to use Y2K loan proceeds to offset economic injury sustained \nafter the year 2000, due to associated computer glitch problems.\n  Mr. President, with less than a year to go, and many small businesses \nnot prepared for the unforeseeable consequences, Congress must respond \nexpeditiously with the passage of this legislation. Without adequate \ncapital and computer related costs that could result in millions of \ndollars of damages, the economic consequences could be severe. This \nlegislation is a very positive step to help mitigate the potential loss \nof thousands of small businesses and the associated impact on our \nStates' and national economies.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this critical \nlegislation and know that the Congress will be able to send a positive \nmessage with the enactment of this legislation in the very near future.\n  Thank you, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there have been a number of hearings on \nY2K. One was held yesterday in the Judiciary Committee. And in that \nmeeting I offered a very simple and direct principle: Our goal should \nbe to encourage Y2K compliance. No matter how much we talk about \nliabilities or who is to blame, or anything else, the bottom line is \nfor people who want to go from December 31 to January 1, at the end of \nthis year, we should look for compliance. That is what we are doing by \npassing this, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, S. 314. It \noffers help to small businesses working to remedy their computer \nsystems before the millennium bug hits.\n  I want to commend Senators Bond and Kerry for their bipartisan \nleadership in the Small Business Committee on this bill. It is going to \nsupport small businesses around the country in the Y2K remedial \nefforts. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  We know that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, \nwhether it is the corner market in a small city, or the family farm, or \na smalltown doctor. In my home State of Vermont, 98\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\npercent of the businesses are small businesses. They have limited \nresources. That is why it is important to provide these small \nbusinesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems --but to do \nit now.\n  Last month, for example, I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help \nsmall businesses prepare for the year 2000. Hundreds of small business \nowners from across Vermont attended this conference. They took time out \nof their work so they could learn how to minimize or eliminate Y2K \ncomputer problems. Those who could not join us at the site joined us by \ninteractive television around the State.\n  Vermonters are working hard to identify their vulnerabilities. They \nshould be encouraged and assisted in these efforts. That is the right \napproach. The right approach is not to seek blame but to fix as many of \nthe problems ahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best business \npolicy--actually, the best defense against Y2K-based lawsuits--is to be \nY2K compliant.\n  The prospect of Y2K problems requires remedial efforts and increased \ncompliance, not to look back on January 1 and find out who was at fault \nbut to look forward on March 2 and say what can we do to fix it.\n  Unfortunately, not all small businesses are doing enough to address \nthe year 2000 issue because of a lack of resources in many cases. They \nface Y2K problems both directly and indirectly through their suppliers, \ncustomers and financial institutions. As recently as last October the \nNFIB testified: ``A fifth of them do not understand that there is a Y2K \nproblem. . . . They are not aware of it. A fifth of them are currently \ntaking action. A fifth have not taken action but plan to take action, \nand two-fifths are aware of the problem but do not plan to take any \naction prior to the year 2000.'' Indeed, the Small Business \nAdministration recently warned that 330,000 small businesses are at \nrisk of closing down as a result of Y2K problems, and another 370,000 \ncould be temporarily or permanently hobbled.\n  Federal and State government agencies have entire departments working \non this problem. Utilities, financial institutions, telecommunications \ncompanies, and other large companies have information technology \ndivisions working to make corrections to keep their systems running. \nThey have armies of workers--but small businesses do not.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, from the city \ncorner market to the family farm to the small-town doctor. In my home \nState of Vermont, 98 percent of the businesses are small businesses \nwith limited resources. That is why it is so important to provide small \nbusinesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems now.\n  Last month, I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small \nbusinesses prepare for 2000. Hundreds of small business owners from \nacross Vermont attended the conference to learn how to minimize or \neliminate their Y2K computer problems. Vermonters are working hard to \nidentify their Y2K vulnerabilities and prepare action plans to resolve \nthem. They should be encouraged and assisted in these important \nefforts.\n  This is the right approach. We have to fix as many of these problems \nahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best business policy and the \nbest defense against Y2K-based lawsuits is to be Y2K compliant.\n  I am studying the Report from our Special Committee on the Year 2000 \nTechnology Problem and thank Chairman Bennett and Vice Chairman Dodd \nfor the work of that Committee. I note that they are just beginning \ntheir assessment of litigation. As they indicate in the Report released \ntoday: ``The Committee plans to hold hearings and work closely with the \nJudiciary and Commerce Committees to make legislative proposals in this \narea.''\n  I understand that the Special Committee is planning hearings on Y2K \nlitigation soon. As best anyone has been able to indicate to me, only \n52 Y2K-related lawsuits have been commenced to date. Of those, several \nhave already been concluded with 12 having been settled and 8 \ndismissed.\n  At our Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this week we heard from a \nsmall businessman from Michigan who was one of the first Y2K plaintiffs \nin the country. He had to sue to obtain relief from a company that sold \nhim a computer and cash register system that would not accept credit \ncards that expired after January 1, 2000 and crashed.\n  We also heard from an attorney who prevailed on behalf of thousands \nof doctors in an early Y2K class action against a company that provided \nmedical office software that was not Y2K compliant.\n  Recent legislative proposals by Senator Hatch and by Senator McCain \nraise many questions that need to be answered before they move forward. \nI look to the hearings before the Special Committee and to additional \nhearings before the Judiciary Committee to gather the factual \ninformation that we need in order to make good judgments about these \nmatters. We heard Monday of a number of serious concerns from the \nDepartment of Justice with these recent proposals. Those concerns are \nreal and need to be addressed.\n  If we do not proceed carefully, broad liability limitation \nlegislation could reward the irresponsible at the expense of the \ninnocent. That would not be fair or responsible. Removing \naccountability from the law removes one of the principal incentives to \nfind solutions before problems develop.\n  Why would congressional consideration or passage of special immunity \nlegislation make anyone more likely to expend the resources needed to \nfix its computer systems to be ready for the millennium? Is it not at \nleast as likely to have just the opposite effect? Why should \nindividuals, businesses and governments act comprehensively now if the \nlaw is changed to allow you to wait, see what problems develop and then \nuse the 90-day ``cooling off'' period after receiving detailed written \nnotice of the problem to think about coming into compliance? Why not \nwait and see what solutions are developed by others and draw from them \nlater in the three-month grace period, after the harm is done and only \nif someone complains?\n  I would rather continue the incentives our civil justice systems \nallows to encourage compliance and remediation efforts now, in advance \nof the harm. I would rather reward responsible business owners who are \nalready making the investments necessary to have their computer systems \nfixed for Y2K.\n  I sense that some may be seeking to use fear of the Y2K millennium \nbug to revive failed liability limitation legislation of the past. \nThese controversial proposals may be good politics in some circles, but \nthey are not true solutions to the Y2K problem. Instead, we should be \nlooking to the future and creating incentives in this country and \naround the world for accelerating our efforts to resolve potential Y2K \nproblems before they cause harm.\n  I also share the concerns of the Special Committee that ``disclosure \nof Y2K compliance is poor.'' We just do not have reliable assessments \nof the problem or of how compliance efforts are going. In particular, I \nremain especially concerned with the Special Committee's report that: \n``Despite an SEC rule requiring Y2K disclosure of public corporations, \ncompanies are reluctant to report poor compliance.'' I have heard \nestimates that hundreds if not thousands of public companies are not in \ncompliance with SEC disclosure rules designed to protect investors and \nthe general public.\n  I hope that the Special Committee will follow through on its \nannounced ``plans to address certain key sectors in 1999 where there \nhas been extreme reluctance to disclose Y2K compliance.'' We should not \nbe rewarding companies that have not fulfilled their disclosure \nresponsibilities by providing them any liability limitation \nprotections.\n  On the contrary, after all the talk earlier this year about the \nimportance of the rule of law, we ought to do more to enforce these \nfundamental disclosure requirements. As the Special Committee reports: \n``Without meaningful disclosure, it is impossible for firms to properly \nassess their own risks and develop necessary contingency plans.\n  Disclosure is also important in the context of congressional \noversight. The Special Committee will continue to promote this \nimportant goal in 1999.'' The Senate should do nothing to undercut this \neffort toward greater disclosure in accordance with law.\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\n  Sweeping liability protection has the potential to do great harm. \nSuch legislation may restrict the rights of consumers, small \nbusinesses, family farmers, State and local governments and the Federal \nGovernment from seeking redress for the harm caused by Y2K computer \nfailures. It seeks to restructure the laws of the 50 states through \nfederal preemption. Moreover, it runs the risk of discouraging \nbusinesses from taking responsible steps to cure their Y2K problems now \nbefore it is too late.\n  By focusing attention on liability limiting proposals instead of on \nthe disclosures and remedial steps that need to be taken now, Congress \nis being distracted from what should be our principal focus--\nencouraging Y2K compliance and the prompt remedial efforts that are \nnecessary now, in 1999.\n  The international aspect of this problem is also looming as one of \nthe most important. As Americans work hard to bring our systems into \ncompliance, we encounter a world in which other countries are not as \nfar along in their efforts and foreign suppliers to U.S. companies pose \nsignificant risks for all of us. This observation is supported by the \nReport of the Special Committee, as well. We must, therefore, consider \nwhether creating a liability limitation model will serve our interests \ninternationally.\n  The Administration is working hard to bring the Federal Government \ninto compliance. President Clinton decided to have the Social Security \nAdministration's computers overhauled first and then tested and \nretooled and retested, again. The President was able to announce on \nDecember 28 that social security checks will be printed without any \nglitches in January 2000. That is progress.\n  During the last Congress, I joined with a number of other interested \nSenators to introduce and pass into law the consensus bill known as \n``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.'' We worked \non a bipartisan basis with Senator Bennett, Senator Dodd, the \nAdministration, industry representatives and others to reach agreement \non a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K \ncompliance. The new law, enacted less than five months ago, is working \nto encourage companies to share Y2K solutions and test results. It \npromotes company-to-company information sharing while not limiting \nrights of consumers.\n  The North American Electric Reliability Council got a great response \nfrom its efforts to obtain detailed Y2K information from various \nindustries. We also know that large telephone companies are sharing \ntechnical information over websites designed to assist each other in \nsolving year 2000 problems. Under a provision I included, that law also \nestablished a National Y2K Information Clearinghouse and Website at the \nGeneral Services Administration. That website is a great place for \nsmall businesses to go to get started in their Y2K efforts.\n  If, after careful study, there are other reasonable efforts that \nCongress can make to encourage more computer preparedness for the \nmillennium, then we should work together to consider them and work \ntogether to implement them.\n  Legislative proposals to limit Y2K liability now pending before the \nCommerce and Judiciary Committees were printed in last Wednesday's \nCongressional Record. Given the significant impact these bills might \nhave on State contract and tort law and the legal rights of all \nAmericans, I trust that the Senate will allow all interested Committees \nto consider them carefully before rushing to pass liability limitation \nprovisions that have not been justified or thoroughly examined.\n  The prospect of Y2K problems requires remedial efforts and increased \ncompliance, which is what the ``Small Business Year 2000 Readiness \nAct,'' S.314, will promote. It is not an excuse for cutting off the \nrights of those who will be harmed by the inaction of others, turning \nour States' civil justice administration upside down, or immunizing \nthose who recklessly disregard the coming problem to the detriment of \ntheir customers and American consumers.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Small \nBusiness Year 2000 Readiness Act, of which I am an original cosponsor.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Senator Bond, who serves as \nChairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, for his leadership on \nthis important issue. As a member of the Small Business Committee and a \nSenator from a state where virtually all the businesses are small \nbusinesses, I strongly believe that assisting small businesses prepare \nfor the Year 2000 must be a top priority.\n  So many aspects of our lives are influenced by computers. I believe \nthe Y2K computer glitch is an issue of such importance that it demands \ndecisive action on our part, because any delay at this point will make \nthis problem exponentially more difficult to solve.\n  The bill before us today authorizes loan guarantees for small \nbusinesses to help with Y2K compliance. Loan guarantees will permit \nsmall businesses to assess their computers' Y2K compatibility, identify \nchanges to assure compatibility, and finance purchase or repair of \ncomputer equipment and software to ensure that is compatible with Y2K. \nThe loans will also allow small businesses to hire third party \nconsultants to support their efforts.\n  Maine has an historical record of self-reliance and small business \nenterprise, and I am extremely supportive of the role the federal \ngovernment can play in promoting small business growth and development. \nSmall businesses are increasingly essential to America's prosperity, \nand they should and will play a vital role in any effort to revitalize \nour communities if we help them enter the 21st Century in a strong \nposition.\n  As we all know, this problem stems from a simple glitch--how the more \nthan 200 million computers in the United States store the date within \ntheir internal clocks.\n  Some computers and software may not run or start if the internal \nclock fails to recognize ``00'' as a proper year. The computer can \ncontinue waiting for you to enter what it thinks is a correct date and \nprevent you from accessing your records until you have done so. Without \naccess to your records, you will be unable to track your inventory, \nsales, or even your bank accounts.\n  I began to wonder what the effects would be on small business when \nthe Commerce Committee held a hearing on the issue last year. And after \nquestioning officials, specifically Deputy Secretary of Commerce Robert \nMallett, it became evident that many small businesses simply didn't \nhave the kind of time and resources that many larger business may have \nat their disposal to fix this potentially serious problem.\n  At the Maine forums I sponsored last year as a member of both the \nCommerce and Small Business Committees, I worked to educate small \nbusinesses on the Y2K threat, and it was a learning experience for me \nas well.\n  The impact of Y2K on the small business community could be \ndevastating. According to a National Federation of Independent Business \nand Wells Fargo Bank study, 82 percent of small businesses are at risk.\n  Fortunately, it doesn't have to be that way. With the benefit of \nforesight and proper planning, we can diffuse this ticking time bomb \nand ensure that the business of the nation continues on without a \nhitch--or a glitch.\n  From a technical standpoint, the necessary corrections are not \ndifficult to make. However, determining that there's a problem, finding \npeople qualified to fix the problem, and crafting a solution to fit the \nindividual needs of different computers and programs poses significant \nchallenges.\n  We must put ourselves in the position that a small business or \nentrepreneur is in. Consider that this problem effects more than just \nyour business. By checking your system you are only halfway to solving \nthe problem. You must also take time to ensure your supplier, \ndistributer, banker, and accountant are also ``cured'' of the Year 2000 \nproblem.\n  For example, if you manufacture a product on deadline, you'll want to \nmake sure your computers will be able to keep track of your delivery \nschedule, inventory, and accounts receivable and payable. If your \nsystem fails to do this, the consequences could be debilitating for a \nbusiness.\n  But think about this: suppose your suppliers aren't compatible, and \ntheir system crashes. You may not receive the raw materials you need to \nget your product to market on time--devastating if you're in a ``just \nin time'' delivery schedule with your supplier. And\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\nwhat happens when your shipper's computers go down for the count?\n  That is why it is so important that we take steps to fix the problem \nnow. The year 2000 is almost upon us, and each day that goes by trades \naway valuable time.\n  For the vast majority of businesses, there are five simple steps \ntoward compliance. First, awareness of the problem. Second, assessing \nwhich systems could be affected and prioritizing their conversion or \nreplacement. Third, renovating or replacing computer systems. Fourth, \nvalidating or testing the computer systems. And fifth, implementing the \nsystems.\n  The bill before us today will help small business address these \nsteps, and I urge my colleagues to join in an overwhelming show of \nsupport for our nation's small businesses by voting for this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee and cosponsor of this legislation, I am pleased the Senate is \nacting expeditiously on S. 314, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness \nAct. Making affordable government guaranteed loans available to small \nbusinesses to correct the computer problem associated with the Year \n2000, or Y2K, is a critical part of that the federal government can do \nto ensure that all businesses can become Y2K compliant by the turn of \nthe century.\n  As everyone knows by now, experts are concerned that on January 1, \n2000, many computers will recognize a double zero not as the year 2000 \nbut as the year 1900. This technical glitch could cause the computers \nto stop running altogether or start generating erroneous data. It is a \nserious problem that should be taken seriously by businesses, large and \nsmall.\n  Unfortunately, surveys show that many small businesses are not taking \nthe action they should be taking to fix the problem and as a result \ncould face costly consequences on January 1, 2000. According to recent \nresearch, nearly 25 percent of all businesses, of which 80 percent are \nsmall companies, have not begun to prepare for the serious system \nissues that are predicted to occur on January 1, 2000.\n  One of the reasons for this lack of preparedness by small businesses \ncould be the lack of access to funds to pay for the needed repairs. \nThat is why the Senate Small Business Committee reported by a unanimous \nvote this legislation to establish a special loan program for small \nbusinesses to pay for Y2K repairs. Our hope is to move this legislation \nexpeditiously through the 106th Congress so that the special loan \nprogram established by this bill will be available in time to do Y2K \nrepairs. The full extent of the year 2000 problem is unknown, but we \ncan reduce the possibility of problems by taking action now.\n  System failures can be costly and that's why it's better to avoid \nthem rather than fix them after failure. As we count down the remaining \nmonths of this century, let's give small businesses who have been the \nbackbone of our great economic prosperity access to the funds they need \nto correct the Y2K computer bug. For many of our small businesses, S. \n314 could help keep them from suffering severe financial distress or \nfailure.\n  S. 314 requires the Small Business Administration to establish a \nlimited-term government guaranteed loan program to guarantee loans made \nby private lenders to small businesses to correct their own Y2K \nproblems or provide relief from economic injuries sustained as a result \nof its own or another entity's Y2K computer problems. It offers these \nloans at more favorable terms than other government guaranteed loans \navailable to small businesses and it allows small businesses to defer \ninterest for the first year. The bill report language also includes a \nprovision I suggested allowing the favorable terms of this lending \nprogram to be applied to loans already granted to small businesses that \nwere used primarily for Y2K repairs but under less favorable terms than \noffered under this program. Since this loan program already passed the \nSenate last year as a component of a larger bill, some small businesses \nmay have already made the decision to take out small business loans to \npay for Y2K repairs based on the reasonable expectation that this \nprogram would be enacted into law.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 314, the Small \nBusiness Year 2000 Readiness Act. The bill establishes a guaranteed \nloan program for small businesses in order to remediate existing \ncomputer systems or to purchase new Year 2000 compliant equipment. The \nloan program would be modeled after the Small Business Administration's \npopular 7(a) loan program, which has provided thousands of small \nbusinesses funding to grow their operations.\n  Many small businesses are having difficulty determining how they will \nbe affected by the millennium bug and what they should do about it. \nMany of them face not only technological but also severe financial \nchallenges in becoming Y2K-compliant. This legislation will help \nprovide peace of mind to the small business community throughout the \nnation, which we must help prepare now for the coming crisis.\n  The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act would encourage business \nto focus on Year 2000 computer problems before they are upon us. A \nsuccessful program being operated in my State underscores the benefits \nto such forethought.\n  Through the efforts of the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership \n(MEP), a program funded through the National Institutes of Science and \nTechnology, small businesses have been successful in addressing their \nY2K problems. With the use of an assessment tool, the Maine MEP is able \nto provide small business owners road maps for addressing critical Y2K \nissues concerning accounting systems, computerized production \nequipment, environmental management systems, and supplier \nvulnerabilities.\n  Once the Maine MEP completes an assessment of technical Y2K problems, \nit instructs the small business owner on how to apply for a loan from \nthe Small Business Administration. As it turns out, this step is \ncrucial. Small business owners have commented that, while they need \nhelp in determining their Y2K exposure, it is just as important to have \na place to turn for funding so that they can take action to correct \npossible problems. Because businesses often do not budget for Y2K \nproblems, it is vital to give businesses some assurance that they will \nbe able to borrow the funds necessary to remediate their systems. The \nSmall Business Year 2000 Readiness Act does exactly that.\n  My home State of Maine has over 35,000 small businesses, which were \nresponsible for all of the net new jobs created in our State from 1992 \nthrough 1996. With their diversity and innovation, small businesses are \nthe backbone of our economy and the engine fueling job growth.\n  Mr. President, by their very definition entrepreneurs are risk \nmanagers. In the years that I have been working with small businesses, \nI am aware of countless experiences where the entrepreneurial spirit \nhas propelled business owners to overcome major obstacles to succeed. \nWith the financial assistance that this new SBA loan program will \noffer, it is my expectation that small businesses will indeed succeed \nin squashing their Y2K bug.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to see that the Senate \npassed S. 314, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, today. I \nintroduced this bill with Senators Christopher S. Bond, John F. Kerry, \nRobert F. Bennett, Christopher J. Dodd, and Olympia Snowe on January \n27, 1999. S. 314 establishes a loan guarantee program to help small \nbusinesses prepare for the year 2000. Because our economy is \ninterdependent, we must make sure that our small businesses are still \nup and running and providing services on January 1, 2000. This bill \nwill help ensure that that is the case.\n  I began warning about the Y2K problem 3 years ago. Since that time, \npeople have begun to listen and progress has been made on the Y2K \nfront. The federal government and large corporations are expected to \nhave their computers functioning on January 1, 2000. Good news indeed. \nBut small businesses continue to lag behind in fixing the millennium \nproblem. I am confident that the Readiness Act will help small \nbusinesses remediate their computer systems and I urge the House to \nconsider it forthwith. There is no time to waste.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, most small businesses in Vermont rely on\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\nelectronic systems to operate. Many of these businesses are looking to \nthe Year 2000 with apprehension or outright despair. Small businesses \nrely on microprocessors for manufacturing equipment, telecommunications \nfor product delivery, and the mainstay of data storage--computer chips. \nThese businessmen and women are concerned about the financial effects \nof the Year 2000 Computer Bug will have on their efforts to remedy the \nproblem, as well as those after-effects caused by system failures. This \nis why I firmly believe that the quick enactment of Senator Bond's \nbill, S. 314, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act should be a \ntop priority for Congress.\n  The legislation will go a long way toward providing vitally needed \nloans for the nation's small businesses. This bill serves three \npurposes: first, it will authorize the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) to expand its guaranteed loan program so eligible \nsmall businesses have the means to continue operating successfully \nafter January 1, 2000. Second, the bill will allow small businesses to \nuse Y2K loan proceeds to offset economic injury sustained after the \nyear 2000 as a result of Y2K problems. Third, the legislation will \nhighlight those potential vulnerabilities small businesses face from \nY2K so small businessmen and women understand the risks involved.\n  Unfortunately, while many small businesses are well aware of the Y2K \nMillennium Bug, recent surveys indicate that a significant proportion \nof them do not plan on taking action because they do not believe it is \na serious enough threat. This bill will raise awareness of Y2K risks so \nsmall businesses who may face problems will choose to upgrade their \nhardware and software computer systems. As costs of doing so could be \nprohibitive for small businesses the legislation will meet the \nfinancial needs of small businesses by ensuring access to guaranteed \nSBA loans.\n  The operation of this legislation will remain the same as the current \nSBA loan program, where the agency guarantees the principal amount of a \nloan made by a private lender to assist new small businesses seeking to \ncorrect Y2K computer problems. Those lenders currently participating in \nthe SBA's 7(a) business loan program will also be able to participate \nin the Y2K loan program by accessing additional guaranteed loan funds.\n  Mr. President, I commend the efforts of Chairman Bond on this \nlegislation and I hope for its quick enactment. While this legislation \nwill not eradicate the potential effects Y2K may have on electronic \nsystems, it will at least ensure that resources are available to those \nsmall businesses who try to protect themselves from the threat, or \nrecuperate following a Y2K-related difficulty.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning S. \n314. I am pleased that the Senate took a step forward today to help \nsmall businesses prepare for the Year 2000 Problem. I am very concerned \nabout Y2K's potential affect on small businesses and rural communities, \nparticularly in my home state of Nebraska where technology is \nincreasingly playing a vital role in all aspects of commerce. In \naddition to the many small businesses that use technology in everyday \ntransactions, Nebraska is home to a growing high-technology industry \nthat could be derailed if we fail to take additional steps to solve the \nYear 2000 problem.\n  High-technology companies account for a significant portion of \nNebraska's economic output. According to the United States Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, forty-four of every one-thousand private sector \nworkers in Nebraska are employed by high-tech firms at an average \nsalary of $37,000. Astonishingly, that's nearly $15,000 more than the \naverage private sector wage.\n  This rapidly growing sector of Nebraska's economy is a testament to \nthe ingenuity and work ethic that characterize the citizens of our \nstate. From the data processing industry in Omaha to the \ntelecommunications and technology interests in Lincoln to electronic \nretail commerce and agribusiness interests in the panhandle, Nebraskans \nare using and developing unique technologies to improve their lives. \nIt's clear that the information age has arrived on the plains as nearly \none-fourth of Nebraska's exports come through high-tech trade.\n  Currently, Nebraska ranks 32nd in high-tech employment and 38th in \nhigh-tech average wage. The hard work of community leaders across the \nstate has encouraged new technology companies to put down roots in \nNebraska. One of my top priorities is fostering the continued \ndevelopment of advanced communications networks and providing \nNebraska's kids with the math, science and technology skills they need \nto become productive members of this industry. Telemedicine, distance \nlearning and other telecommunications services offer exciting new \npossibilities for our businesses, schools and labor force. I mention \nthese successes, to underscore how important technology has become not \nonly to Nebraska's economy but to the nation's economy.\n  S. 314 provides a new resource to guarantee that the nation's small \nbusinesses, high-tech and otherwise, will have somewhere to turn to for \nfinancial help in solving this difficult problem. I hope the House will \nfollow the Senate's lead and quickly take up this important bill.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to take an opportunity to \ncongratulate the senior Senator from my home State for introducing and \nreporting the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. This is an \nimportant bill that I am happy to co-sponsor and support. The bill \nrepresents an important step in Congress' ongoing efforts to limit the \nscope and impact of the Year 2000 problem before it is too late. Last \nyear, we passed the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act, \nwhich was an important first step in removing any legal barriers that \ncould prevent individuals and companies from doing everything possible \nto eliminate Year 2000 problems before they happen. I was particularly \ngratified that I was able to work with Senators Hatch and Leahy to \ninclude the provisions of my temporary antitrust immunity bill, S. \n2384, in last year's act. However, as I said at the time, the \nDisclosure Act must be understood as only the first step in our efforts \nto deal with this problem. Senator Bond's bill, along with the \nliability bills working their way through the Commerce and Judiciary \nCommittees, on which I sit, are the next logical steps in this ongoing \neffort.\n  Countless computer engineers and experts are busy right now trying to \nsolve or minimize the Year 2000 and related date failure problems. Part \nof what makes this problem so difficult to address is that there is no \none Year 2000 problem. There are countless distinct date failure \nproblems, and no one silver bullet will solve them all. The absence of \nany readily-available one-size-fits-all solution poses particularly \nserious challenges for small business.\n  The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act addresses this problem by \nproviding loan guarantees to small businesses to remedy their year 2000 \nproblems. The act provides the necessary resources so that small \nbusinesses can nip this problem in the bud, so that the Year 2000 \nproblem does not become the Year 2000 disaster.\n  The act is narrowly targeted at enabling small business to remedy \nYear 2000 issues before they lead to costly damages and even more \ncostly litigation. Like the antitrust exemption I authored in the last \nCongress, this provision automatically sunsets once the window of \nopportunity for avoiding Year 2000 problems closes.\n  Finally, let me say, that like Year 2000 Information and Readiness \nDisclosure Act we enacted last year, this law does not offer a complete \nsolution to the Year 2000 problem. There are many aspects to this \nproblem--both domestic and international--and there may be limits to \nwhat government can do to solve this problem. These loan guarantees are \none constructive step Congress can take. Another constructive step is \nto remove government-imposed obstacles that limit the ability of the \nprivate sector to solve this problem. For example, Congress needs to \naddress the liability rules that govern litigation over potential Year \n2000 problems. That process is ongoing in both the Commerce and \nJudiciary Committees, and I look forward to working with my colleagues \non both committees to reach an acceptable approach that can be enacted \nquickly.\n  The remaining issues are difficult, but we cannot shrink from \ntackling the tough issues. Many have talked about the unprecedented \nprosperity generated by our new, high-tech economy.\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nI want to make sure that the next century is driven by these high-tech \nengines of growth and is stamped made in America. But we will not make \nthe next century an American Century by dodging the tough issues and \nhoping the Year 2000 problem will just go away. We need to keep working \ntoward a solution.\n  Resources to address the Year 2000 problem, particularly time, are \nfinite. They must be focused as fully as possible on remediation, \nrather than on unproductive litigation. This issue is all about time, \nand we have precious little left before the Year 2000 problem is upon \nus. I hope we can continue to work together on legislation like this to \nfree up talented individuals to address this serious threat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the failure of many computer programs to recognize the \n     Year 2000 may have extreme negative financial consequences in \n     the Year 2000, and in subsequent years for both large and \n     small businesses;\n       (2) small businesses are well behind larger businesses in \n     implementing corrective changes to their automated systems;\n       (3) many small businesses do not have access to capital to \n     fix mission critical automated systems, which could result in \n     severe financial distress or failure for small businesses; \n     and\n       (4) the failure of a large number of small businesses due \n     to the Year 2000 computer problem would have a highly \n     detrimental effect on the economy in the Year 2000 and in \n     subsequent years.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, every Congress in which I have served--I \nhave served here since 1975--has focused significant attention on crime \nlegislation. It doesn't make any difference which party controls the \nWhite House or either House of Congress, the opportunity to make our \nmark on the criminal law has been irresistible. In fact, more than a \nquarter of all the Federal criminal provisions enacted since the Civil \nWar--a quarter of all Federal criminal provisions since the Civil War--\nhave been enacted in the 16 years since 1980, more than 40 percent of \nthose laws have been created since 1970.\n  In fact, at this point the total number is too high to count. Last \nmonth, a task force headed by former Attorney General Edwin Meese and \norganized by the American Bar Association released a comprehensive \nreport. The best the task force could do was estimate the Federal \ncrimes to be over 3,300. Even that doesn't count the nearly 10,000 \nFederal regulations authorized by Congress that carry some sort of \nsanction.\n  I have become increasingly concerned about the seemingly \nuncontrollable impulse to react to the latest headline-grabbing \ncriminal caper with a new Federal prohibition. I have to admit, I \nsupported some of the initiatives. Usually, the expansion of Federal \nauthority by the creation of a new Federal crime is only incremental. \nSome crime proposals, however, are more sweeping, and they invite \nFederal enforcement authority into entirely new areas traditionally \nhandled by State and local law enforcement.\n  In the last Congress, for example, the majority on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reported to the Senate a juvenile crime bill that \nwould have granted Federal prosecutors broad new authority to \ninvestigate and prosecute Federal crimes committed by juveniles--crimes \nnow normally deferred to the State. In addition, it would have \ncompelled the States to revise the manner in which they dealt with \njuvenile crime, overridden all the State legislatures and told them to \ncomport with a host of new Federal mandates. I strenuously opposed this \nlegislation on federalism and other grounds.\n  Even the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court went out of his way \nin his 1997 Year-End Report of the Federal Judiciary to caution against \n``legislation pending in Congress to `federalize' certain juvenile \ncrimes.'' The Meese Task Force also cites this legislation ``as an \nexample of enhanced Federal attention where the need is neither \napparent nor demonstrated.''\n  The Meese Task Force report chided Congress for its indiscriminate \npassage of new Federal crimes wholly duplicative of existing State \ncrimes. This Task Force was told by a number of people that these new \nFederal laws are passed not because they were needed ``but because \nFederal crime legislation in general is thought to be politically \npopular. Put another way, it is not considered politically wise to vote \nagainst crime legislation, even if it is misguided, unnecessary, and \neven harmful.'' We all appreciate the hard truth in this observation.\n  While the juvenile crime bill was not enacted, we have not always \ngenerated such restraint. The Meese Task Force examined a number of \nother Federal crimes, such as drive-by shooting, interstate domestic \nviolence, murder committed by prison escapees, and others, that \nencroach on criminal activity traditionally handled by the States--\nalmost reaching the point that jaywalking in a suburban subdivision \ncould become a Federal crime because that street may lead to a State \nroad which may lead to a Federal road. You see where we are going. The \nTask Force found that federal prosecution of those traditional State \ncrimes was minimal or nonexistent. Given the dearth of Federal \nenforcement, one is tempted to conclude that maybe the Federal laws do \nnot encroach and that any harm to State authority from passage of these \nlaws is similarly minimal. But the task force debunks the notion that \nfederalization is ``cost-free.''\n  Federalizing criminal activity already covered by State criminal laws \nthat are adequately enforced by State or local law enforcement \nauthorities raises three significant concerns, even if the Federal \nenforcement authority is not exercised.\n  First, dormant Federal criminal laws may be revived at the whim of a \nfederal prosecutor. Even the appearance--let alone the actual \npractice--of selectively bringing Federal prosecutions against certain \nindividuals whose conduct also violates State laws, and the imposition \nof disparate Federal and State sentences for essentially the same \nunderlying criminal conduct, offends our notions of fundamental \nfairness and undermines respect for the entire criminal justice system. \nThe Task Force criticizes the ``expansive amount of unprincipled \noverlap in which very large amounts of conduct are susceptible to \nselection for prosecution as either federal or state crime is \nintolerable.''\n  Second, every new Federal crime results in an expansion of Federal \nlaw enforcement jurisdiction and further concentration of policing \npower in the Federal government. Americans naturally distrust such \nconcentrations of power. That is the policy underlying our posse \ncomitatus law prohibiting the military from participating in general \nlaw enforcement activities. According to the Task Force, Federal law \nenforcement personnel have grown a staggering 96 percent from 1982 to \n1993 compared to a growth rate of less than half that for State \npersonnel. The Task Force correctly notes in the report that:\n\n       Enactment of each new federal crime bestows new federal \n     investigative power on federal agencies, broadening their \n     power to intrude into individual ives. Expansion of federal \n     jurisdiction also creates the opportunity for greater \n     collection and maintenance of data at the federal level in an \n     era when various databases are computerized and linked.\n\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\n\n  Finally, and most significantly, Federal prosecutors are simply not \nas accountable as a local prosecutor to the people of a particular \ntown, county or State. I was privileged to serve as a State's Attorney \nin Vermont for eight years, and went before the people of Chittenden \nCounty for election four times. They had the opportunity at every \nelection to let me know what they thought of the job I was doing.\n  By contrast, Federal prosecutors are appointed by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate, only two Members of which represent the people \nwho actually reside within the jurisdiction of any particular U.S. \nAttorney. Federalizing otherwise local crime not only establishes a \nnational standard for particular conduct but also allows enforcement by \na Federal prosecutor, who is not directly accountable to the people \nagainst whom the law is being enforced. The Task Force warns that the \n``diminution of local autonomy inherent in the imposition of national \nstandards, without regard to local community values and without regard \nto any noticeable benefits, requires cautious legislative assessment.''\n  Distrust and dismay at the exercise of Federal police power fueled \nthe public outcry at the tragic endings of the stand-offs with Federal \nlaw enforcement authorities at Ruby Ridge in 1992 and at Waco in 1993. \nI participated in the Judiciary Committee oversight hearings into those \nincidents, and was struck that both of those standoffs were sparked by \nenforcement of Federal gun laws. The regulation of firearms is a \nsubject with extraordinary variance among the States and requires great \nsensitivity and accountability to local mores.\n  Vermont has virtually no gun laws, and we also have one of the lowest \ncrime rate in the country, but our laws reflect our needs. We should be \nvery careful not just about federalizing a prohibition that already \nexists at most State levels, but also creating a Federal criminal \nprohibition where none exists at the State level, like mine.\n  Proposals to create new Federal crimes that run roughshod over highly \nsensitive public policy choices normally decided at the local level \nprompt significant concern over Federal overreaching and the exercise \nof Federal police power. For example, the majority on the Judiciary \nCommittee reported in the last Congress a bill that would have made it \na Federal crime to travel with a minor across State lines to get an \nabortion without complying with the parental consent law of the minor's \nhome State. This law, if enacted, would invite Federal prosecutors to \ninvestigate and prosecute the violation of one State's parental consent \nlaw even if neither State would subject the conduct to criminal \nsanction. Establishing a national standard through creation of a new \nFederal crime to deal with conduct that the States have addressed in a \ndifferent manner is a dangerous usurpation of local authority.\n  The death penalty is a good example. Congress has increasingly passed \nFederal criminal laws carrying the death penalty, even though twelve \nStates, including Vermont, and the District of Columbia have declined \nto adopt the death penalty. Federal prosecutors in those States are \nfree, with the Attorney General's approval, to buck the State's \ndecision and seek the death penalty in certain Federal cases which have \nresulted in murder--for which every State has overlapping jurisdiction. \nIn Vermont, for example, we are for the first time confronting a \nFederal death penalty case. These cases always present facts that could \nhave been prosecuted by the State, and often involve high-profile cases \nthat have generated press attention.\n  In the aftermath of a heinous murder, the public may cry out for \nblood vengeance. But the considered judgment of the State against the \ndeath penalty should not be easily bypassed, and Federal prosecutors \nshould not be encouraged to find some basis for the exercise of Federal \njurisdiction merely to be able to seek the death penalty.\n  The Task Force report concludes with a ``fundamental plea'' to \nlegislators and members of the public alike ``to think carefully about \nthe risks of excessive federalization of the criminal law and to have \nthese risks clearly in mind when considering any proposal to enact new \nfederal criminal laws and to add more resources and personnel to \nfederal law enforcement agencies.'' This is a plea I commend to all \nSenators as we return to the business of legislating and are asked to \nconsider any number of crime proposals in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to think very carefully. We should not \nfeel that the only way we show that we are against crime is to suddenly \nfederalize all crimes and basically tell our State legislatures, our \nState law enforcement, our State prosecutors that they are \ninsignificant. Let us resist that impulse. Maybe we can pass a \nresolution saying that all Senators are opposed to crime--as we are. \nBut let the States do what they do best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a point of \nimportant history in our Nation; that is, to commemorate this day 163 \nyears ago, Texas Independence Day.\n  Each year, I look forward to March 2nd. This is a special day for \nTexans, a day that fills our hearts with pride. On this day 163 years \nago, a solemn convention of 54 men, including my great, great \ngrandfather Charles S. Taylor, met in the small settlement of \nWashington-on-the-Brazos. There they signed the Texas Declaration of \nIndependence. The declaration stated:\n\n       We, therefore . . . do hereby resolve and declare . . . \n     that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign \n     and independent republic.\n\n  At the time, Texas was a remote territory of Mexico. It was \nhospitable only to the bravest and most determined of settlers. After \ndeclaring our independence, the founding delegates quickly wrote a \nconstitution and organized an interim government for the newborn \nrepublic.\n  As was the case when the American Declaration of Independence was \nsigned in 1776, our declaration only pointed the way toward a goal. It \nwould exact a price of enormous effort and great sacrifice. For \ninstance, when my great, great grandfather was there, signing the \ndeclaration of independence, and then, as most of the delegates did, \nwent on eventually to fight the Battle of San Jacinto, he didn't know \nit at the time, but all four of his children who had been left back at \nhome in Nacogdoches died trying to escape from the Indians and the \nMexicans who they feared were coming after them. Fortunately, he and \nhis wife, my great, great grandmother, had nine more children. But it \nis just an example of the sacrifices that were made by people who were \nwilling to fight for something they believed in. That, of course, was \nfreedom--freedom, in that instance, of Texas at that time. But that is \nsomething, of course, all Americans cherish greatly.\n  While the convention sat in Washington-on-the-Brazos, 6,000 Mexican \ntroops were marching on the Alamo to challenge this newly created \nrepublic. Several days earlier, from the Alamo, Col. William Barrett \nTravis sent his immortal letter to the people of Texas and to all \nAmericans. He knew the Mexican Army was approaching and he knew that he \nhad only a very few men to help defend the San Antonio fortress. \nColonel Travis wrote:\n\n       Fellow Citizens and Compatriots: I am besieged with a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have \n     sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man.\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n     The enemy has demanded surrender at discretion, otherwise, \n     the garrison is to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. \n     I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag \n     still waves proudly over the wall. I shall never surrender or \n     retreat. Then I call on you in the name of Liberty, of \n     patriotism, of everything dear to the American character, to \n     come to our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or \n     four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected \n     I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die \n     like a soldier who never forgets what is due his honor and \n     that of his country--VICTORY OR DEATH.\n                       William Barrett Travis, Lt. Col. Commander.\n\n  What American, Texan or otherwise, can fail to be stirred by Col. \nTravis' resolve?\n  In fact, Colonel Travis' dire prediction came true--4,000 to 5,000 \nMexican troops laid siege to the Alamo. In the battle that followed, \n184 brave men died in a heroic but vain attempt to fend off Santa \nAnna's overwhelming army. But the Alamo, as we all in Texas know, was \ncrucial to Texas' independence. Because those heroes at the Alamo held \nout for so long, Santa Anna's forces were battered and diminished.\n  Gen. Sam Houston gained the time he needed to devise a strategy to \ndefeat Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, just a month or so \nlater, on April 21, 1836. The Lone Star was visible on the horizon at \nlast.\n  Each year, on March 2, there is a ceremony at Washington-on-the-\nBrazos State Park where there is a replica of the modest cabin where \nthe 54 patriots laid down their lives and treasure for freedom. Each \nday on this day, I read Colonel Travis' letter to my colleagues in the \nSenate, a tradition started by my friend, Senator John Tower. This is a \nreminder to them and to all of us of the pride Texans share in our \nhistory and in being the only State that came into the Union as a \nrepublic.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to continue the tradition that was \nstarted by Senator Tower, because we do have a unique heritage in Texas \nwhere we fought for our freedom. Having grown up in the family and \nhearing the stories of my great great grandfather, it was something \nthat was ingrained in us--fighting for your freedom was something you \ndid.\n  I think it is very important that we remember the people who \nsacrificed, the 184 men who died at the Alamo, the men who died at \nGoliad, who made it possible for us to win the Battle of San Jacinto \nand become a nation, which we were for 10 years before we entered the \nUnion as a State.\n  I might add, we entered the Union by a margin of one vote, both in \nthe House and in the Senate. In fact, we originally were going to come \ninto the Union through a treaty, but the two-thirds vote could not be \nreceived and, therefore, President Tyler said, ``No, then we will pass \na law to invite Texas to become a part of our Union,'' and the law \npassed by one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate. Now we fly \nboth flags proudly--the American flag and the Texas flag--over our \ncapitol in Austin, TX.\n  I am very pleased to, once again, commemorate our great heritage and \nhistory. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2070-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2071-S2084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INCREASING FUNDING OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE YEAR 2000 \n                      TECHNOLOGY-RELATED PROBLEMS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 30) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  As I have said somewhat facetiously, today is ``Y2K Day in the \nneighborhood.'' We have had a series of events with respect to Y2K \nlegislation, starting with the debate this morning on the Small \nBusiness Administration bill offered by Senator Bond of Missouri. We \nthen went into a closed session where it was my privilege, along with \nSenator Dodd, to make a presentation to Members of the Senate with \nrespect to the impact of Y2K on our national defense and our \nintelligence capabilities. And now this afternoon, we have 3 hours to \ndiscuss the funding request for the Special Committee on the Year 2000 \nTechnology Problems and, in that process, take the opportunity of the \ndebate to lay out for the Senate and for the television public exactly \nwhat we are dealing with.\n  To summarize ``Y2K in the neighborhood,'' I have a single chart that \nwe used in the press conference earlier that outlines what it is we are \ntalking about.\n  Specifically, as you see, Mr. President, it says, ``Y2K--What is \nit?'' There are some who think it is a rock band and we will make that \nclear. And then, Why are we vulnerable? Where are the greatest risks? \nWhat is being done? What should we be doing next? And what can we \nexpect? It is in the framework of those questions that I will be making \nmy presentation today.\n  In the closed session, we talked about national defense issues, \ninternational assessments country by country and the preparedness of \nthe U.S. intelligence community. I report to the Senate as a whole, for \nthose Senators who were not able to be there, that we announced these \nconclusions to the Senators who were there and, I might say, Mr. \nPresident, we were very gratified by the number of Senators who did \nappear. The room was full, and the Senators were very attentive, which \nI think is appropriate given the significance of this issue.\n  We believe that there is a low-to-medium probability of exploitation \nof Y2K by any terrorist groups. People in the press conference asked \nme, ``Well, can you be specific?'' And the answer is no. We know of no \nintention on the part of terrorist groups to exploit Y2K uncertainty, \nbut these groups are there, they are up to mischief, and so we say \nthere is a probability, but it is at the low end of things.\n  There is a low probability of a nuclear launch coming by accident as \na result of Y2K. Again, we cannot rule it out absolutely, but we think \nthe probability of it is very low.\n  There is a medium probability of economic disruptions that could lead \nto civil unrest in various parts of the world, and we will discuss that \nhere in the open session as we outline for you how vulnerable some \nparts of the world may be to Y2K interruptions.\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\n  There is a high probability of an economic impact with consequences \nunknown. Here we can only guess, but I think there is a high \nprobability that Y2K will, in fact, produce some kind of economic \ndislocation that we will feel.\n  As far as U.S. preparedness is concerned, the U.S. Armed Forces will \nnot lose their mission-critical capability, their war-fighting \ncapacity. The United States will remain the world's superpower, and the \nU.S. intelligence community will not lose its capability to carry out \nits duties.\n  To go to, first, the question--What is Y2K?--in case there is anyone \nwho really doesn't understand what we are talking about here, it goes \nto the inability of a computer to recognize the difference between 1900 \nand 2000 as a date if that computer is programmed for only two digits \nfor the date field for years. This goes back to the 1960s, maybe even \nthe 1950s when memory space was very, very expensive, very, very \ncrucial and, in order to save space, programmers said, ``Well, we can \njust drop the ``19'' off the year and go to ``69'' for 1969, ``70'' for \n1970, and so on. And when someone said, ``Well, what happens when you \nget to the year 2000 and you get two zeros and the computer will think \nit is 1900?'' The answer on the part of those programmers was, ``This \nprogram will be obsolete and abandoned long before we get to the year \n2000.''\n  They didn't realize the ingenuity of programmers. They figured out a \nway to preserve those ancient programs and to lay other layers of \nprogramming on top of them in such a fashion that the old programs look \nlike the new ones, but deep down in the bowels of all of that \nprogramming, you have programs that are scheduled to fail when they get \nto the crucial time when they go over from 99 to 00.\n  There are many other manifestations of it, going down to embedded \nchips, computers no bigger than my little fingernail that nonetheless \nhave in them the capacity to fail over this issue. But basically that \nis the issue. That is what Y2K is. The failure of computers, when they \nhave to transition from 1999 to 2000, those computers that are \nprogrammed with two digits for the annual date may fail--some of them \ncertainly will fail--and that is what Y2K is all about.\n  By the way, people ask, What does ``Y2K'' stand for? ``Y'' stands for \nyear, ``2'' stands for 2--that is fairly easy to follow--and ``K,'' \nfrom the Greek, standing for kilo, meaning 1,000. It is computer speech \nfor the year 2000. My wife says to me, ``Why do you use that acronym? \nYou just confuse people. Why don't you say `year 2000' instead of \n`Y2K.' '' And I say, ``Well, it's quicker.'' She says, `` `Y2K,' `year \n2000,' you only save one syllable. What is the point? You just do it to \nconfuse people.'' But I guess I have been in Government long enough now \nthat confusing people is part of the program.\n  So what is Y2K? I think that is the answer to the question.\n  Why are we vulnerable? We are vulnerable because at virtually every \npoint of importance in the modern economy and modern activity there \nstands the computer--whether it is on a chip or in a huge mainframe--\nwith the capacity to fail.\n  Let's take an event that we hope never happens to any of us, but that \nis a demonstration of a true emergency--a fire in a building--and see \nwhat happens. Here is a picture of a burning building.\n  In order to muster the firefighting capability to deal with this \nemergency, you have a number of people and a number of systems that are \ninvolved. There is the computer-aided dispatching system to send the \nfirefighter to where the challenge is. There is the telecommunications \nsystem where the telephone calls go back and forth to send the message \nfrom the dispatching system; the building security and fire detection \nsystems that make the phone call back to the dispatching system.\n  The firefighters jump in their cars or their trucks. The trucks have \nto be filled with fuel. And the pumps that control the fuel supply that \ngoes into the firetrucks all have computers in them--embedded chips. \nThe traffic control system that controls the ability of the fire engine \nto get through town all has computers in it. The water supply, when \nthey get to the hydrant, is regulated by computers. And, of course, the \npersonnel management systems that get the firefighters into the fire \nstation in the first place now are all managed by computers.\n  A single event we take for granted, all of the things that are done \nto bring to bear on this event--some firefighting capability, but there \nare computers at virtually every step of the way.\n  Now, just another example of how interconnected we are in this world. \nLet's take a single transaction that takes place this time across \ninternational lines. This will be, perhaps, a little hard to follow \nbecause the chart is relatively smaller and less dramatic than a \nburning building, but just let me walk you through this as to what \nhappens when there is a commercial transaction that goes across \nnational lines.\n  An import-export kind of transaction. Every red arrow that you see \nthere on the chart, Mr. President, is a transmission of information by \ncomputer. Every single time something takes place with the purchase and \ndelivery of an item across national lines --you start the contracts, \nthe negotiations by the Internet, a checking of credit, the contract by \nthe Internet--all the way through. The white arrows on the chart are \nwhere something physically moves, when you are moving a piece of \nmerchandise out of a factory onto a ship or out of the truck into a \nretail store or whatever.\n  Without going through all of the steps, I just point out that there \nare more red arrows than there are white ones. There are more \nopportunities for computer failure to ruin the ability of this \ntransaction to go forward than there are physical opportunities for it \nto fail. We are so heavily interconnected in this world now that we are \ncompletely vulnerable to a computer failure. And at every red arrow on \nthat chart right now there is a computer with a potential Y2K problem.\n  Someone once said to me, This problem is really very simple. You just \nget into the computer and find out where the date is and fix it; change \nit from two digits to four digits. And I say, yes, that is very simple, \nvery simple problem, very simply solved. The only problem is, you do \nnot know where that date field is, particularly in those old programs \nthat I talked about.\n  It has been likened to this kind of a challenge: Suppose someone said \nto you, Mr. President, the Golden Gate Bridge has some bad rivets in \nit, and if you do not replace those faulty rivets, the Golden Gate \nBridge will fall down. All you have to do is very simple: Knock out the \nbad rivet, put in a good rivet, and the bridge is made secure.\n  Now, one out of seven of those rivets in the Golden Gate Bridge is \nbad, and we cannot tell you which ones they are. You have to go through \nthe Golden Gate Bridge and check every rivet to see which seventh rivet \nhas to be fixed. And by the way, if you do not get every single one, \nthe bridge will collapse, and you do this remediation work at rush hour \nwhile the bridge is being used. That is roughly comparable to the \nchallenge that we face here. And that is why we are vulnerable. OK.\n\n  The next question is, Where are the greatest risks? Well, we can \nanswer that two ways. On our committee, we have decided to rate the \ngreatest risks in terms of which sectors of the economy have the \ngreatest importance to us. And when you rank risk by importance, No. 1 \nimmediately leaps to the top of the list; and that is power.\n  If the power goes off, it does not matter if your computer works \notherwise. The only computers that will work in the world, if the power \ngoes off, will be those that have batteries, and that is about 2 or 3 \nhours, and they are all gone. So we have put our first focus on power.\n  Second, telecommunications. If the telephone goes off, the power grid \nfails, because many of the signals that keep the power grid functioning \ngo over telephone lines. So once again, everything stops.\n  Third, transportation. If transportation fails, you cannot get coal, \nfor example, from coal mines into power-generating plants. If the \nswitches on all of the railroad lines fail--and they are controlled by \ncomputers--there is no coal in the powerplants. The power grid fails, \neverything fails.\n  You begin to see, again, how interconnected everything is.\n  Fourth, finance. If the banks cannot clear checks, if there can be no \ntransfer of funds, if the financial system collapses, then business \ncollapses. Once\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nagain, the chain starts, and you end up ultimately with no power, all \nthe rest of it.\n  Then, general government. We are so dependent on government services \nto keep the economy running that if the general government services \nwere to fail--in the Federal Government, for example, if the Health \nCare Financing Administration were to fail and be unable to make any \nMedicare reimbursements, it would ultimately destroy the health care \nindustry, because 40 percent of the health care reimbursements are \nMedicare reimbursements. And you simply could not keep a health care \nfacility going if you cut their cash by 40 percent and left it that way \nfor a while.\n  Finally, general business.\n  Those are the ranks of importance that we have looked at in our \ncommittee.\n  Let me take this opportunity to make this statement about what we \nfound. The committee has been operating for roughly a year now, and in \nthat process people who have looked at the list I have just recited \nhave gotten very excited. Indeed, they have begun to create a cottage \nindustry of panic.\n  You can get on the Internet and you can look up any kind of web site, \nand they will take the possibility of computer failure in any of the \nareas I have just outlined and translate that into what has come to be \nknown in the world of Y2K hyperbole as TEOTWAWKI. Now, TEOTWAWKI is the \nacronym that stands for ``The End Of The World As We Know It.'' They \nuse that phrase so often, they created an acronym. Now you can get on \nthe Internet and they will talk about TEOTWAWKI.\n  Mr. President, I am here to announce that TEOTWAWKI is not going to \ncome to pass. We are satisfied, as a result of the hearings we held, \nand the interviews we held, and the investigations we have undertaken \non the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, \nthat the world is not, in fact, going to come to an end over this \nproblem--certainly not in the United States. We will have problems. \nThere is no question, given the ubiquitous nature of the problem, that \nit will cause interruptions and difficulties in the United States, but \nit will not bring everything to a halt. It will not cause the shutdown \nof vital services. In our opinion, it will be a bump in the road for \nthe United States.\n  Now, people say: What does that mean? How serious a bump and how long \nwill it last, Senator Bennett? I don't know, and I don't know anybody \nwho does, because this is a moving target, there are so many potentials \nfor challenge, that we cannot quantify it with the kind of accuracy \nthat the press always searches for when they ask you these questions. \nIt will have an impact. It will be felt. But how long it will last and \nhow deep it will go I don't know. That is why the committee is going to \ncontinue, so that we can continue to study it, and as we get closer to \nit, we will be in a better position to make that kind of assessment.\n  Now, if we ask the question, Where are the greatest risks? --not in \nthe pattern of the impact on the economy that I have talked about, but \non our current state of readiness--we find that the greatest impact, \nbased on what we now know in the committee, is probably going to be in \nthe health care field. This is the field that we think is the least \nprepared to deal with the year 2000 problem in the United States.\n  One of the reasons for that is it so fragmented. There are so many \nhospitals. There are so many separate doctors' offices. Some of them \nhave done nothing to prepare for the year 2000. Frankly, some of them \ncan solve their problem in an afternoon. Some of them that are \noperating off of a single PC can get a patch downloaded from the \nInternet that can solve their problem. Some of them are going to \nrequire substantially more than that. And some of them, frankly, are \nfar enough behind the curve, if they are not on top of it by now, it is \ntoo late and they ought to start thinking about contingency plans. We \nsimply do not know. What we do know causes us to believe that health \ncare is vulnerable.\n  Senator Dodd, I am sure, will be addressing this in greater detail \nbecause he is the one who has focused on this to a greater extent than \nany other member of the committee.\n  Another area of readiness that we are concerned about is local \ngovernment. I gave this Y2K speech at a Rotary Club meeting in a small \ntown in Utah and people asked me, ``What should we do to get ready for \nY2K?'' I gave them the same answer I always give them, which is, you \nshould take charge of your own life; you should check with your own \nbank to make sure they are going to be Y2K compliant; you should check \nwith your own employer to be sure he or she is getting things under \ncontrol; and, among other things, I said, call your mayor to make sure \nyour water system is going to be all right in your local community.\n\n  I have done that in Salt Lake City. I have had some long discussions \nwith the mayor of Salt Lake, and she assures me it will be safe for me \nto be in Salt Lake on New Year's Eve because the water system will \nwork.\n  After I gave the speech, a man came up, shook my hand, and said, \n``You have caused me some problems.'' I asked why, and he said, ``I am \nthe mayor.'' I said, ``Mr. Mayor, is your water system going to be all \nright?'' He said, ``I don't have the slightest idea but I am sure going \nto find out.'' He said, ``It never occurred to me that we had computer \nproblems in our water purification plant.''\n  We have held hearings on this issue. I have been in a water \npurification plant. While I think most local governments are \nresponsible enough and will be on top of it, I am concerned that there \nwill be local governments where there will be critical emergency \nresponse systems that will fail--fire departments, ambulances, and so \non, water systems, federally funded services. Many of the federally \nfunded services are administered at the local level. Welfare checks are \nmailed out by county governments, not by the Federal Government, in \nmany instances. And in these communities, there can be serious \ndisruption even while the Nation as a whole is doing fine.\n  In the economy as a whole, the area that is at the greatest risk is \nwhere we find medium-sized businesses. The big businesses are probably \njust fine. Citigroup announced when we first got into this they were \ngoing to spend $500 million fixing their year 2000 problem. That went \nup to $650 million by the time we got around to drafting the report. \nNow, the day the report is issued, we are told they are spending closer \nto $800 million to get this solved. But Citigroup will get it solved. \nThey have the money and the muscle and the will to get it taken care \nof.\n  The very small businesses will probably get it solved because, again, \nfor them, they are dealing with a single computer that runs their \npayroll and maybe does their taxes, and they do everything else by \nhand. They can solve that problem in a short-term period of time. The \nmiddle-sized businesses that don't have the money of a Citigroup and \nthat have a much bigger problem than a mom-and-pop store are running \ninto difficulty. The surveys we are conducting tell us that these \ncompanies are where the problems are going to be.\n  Now you may say, so what? We should really care if an individual \nbusiness here or an individual business there should fail or should \nhave serious problems. In today's economy, we live in a world of \noutsourcing and just-in-time inventory. That means that General Motors \nhas literally tens of thousands of suppliers. General Motors does not \nmake everything themselves; they outsource. That is a fancy name for \nbuying it from somebody else. They are dependent on these medium-sized \nbusinesses for their parts. One of the scary things is that many of \nthese medium-sized businesses on which General Motors and other big \nmanufacturers are dependent are overseas.\n  I used to run a very small business, so small that it wouldn't really \nattract anybody's attention, but the key component of our business, \nwithout which we had no product, was manufactured in Taiwan, and if we \nwere unable to get that from Taiwan because of Y2K problems in Taiwan, \nwe were out of business. We sold our product to a much bigger company. \nThey were dependent upon us. They could have all of their computers Y2K \ncompliant and be unable to get product from us and therefore have to \ndrop a major product line for them. We couldn't supply it because we \ncouldn't get this product from Taiwan. You see the chain of suppliers \nthat runs throughout the economy in this just-in-time inventory world.\n  When I say I am concerned about medium-sized firms as an area of high\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\nrisk, it could affect big firms and could affect the economy as a \nwhole.\n  Now, the next question after where is the greatest risk: What are we \ndoing about it? What is being done? Here, I think, it is time for the \nSenate and the Congress, if I might, to be a little bit self-\ncongratulatory. When this problem first came to the attention of the \nCongress, Senator Burns of Montana has said he held hearings on this \nissue, or had been involved in hearings on this issue back in the early \n1990s. He said we couldn't get anybody interested; nobody paid any \nattention. He was on the Commerce Committee. He said the thing just \nkind of dropped without a trace.\n  We first became aware of this on the Senate Banking Committee in \n1996. That is where Senator Dodd and I became zealots on this \nissue, and we began to work on this with respect to the financial \nservices area. The more we got into that, the more we realized that it \nencompassed all of the things that I have described here this \nafternoon.\n\n  One example demonstrates what I am talking about when I say that \nCongress can be a little bit self-congratulatory about the question of \nwhat is being done. My son-in-law works for one of the major banks in \nthis country. He said at a family gathering, ``You know, I don't know \nwhat's happened, but the bank examiners from the Federal Reserve who \ncome into our bank now have only one thing on their minds, and that is \nY2K, and they have made it the top priority in the bank.'' I thought, \nyou know, we have finally done something in Congress that has produced \na result because, at Senator Dodd's suggestion, we got the bank \nregulators before our subcommittee of the Banking Committee and we \nraised this issue with them; we discovered several things. No. 1, they \nwere not raising it as part of the safety and soundness examination \nthey were doing in banks. No. 2, their own computers weren't going to \nwork in the year 2000. They would not be able to conduct their \nregulatory activities if we didn't get it fixed. The mere act of \nholding a hearing and bringing these people forward produced a salutary \nresult that actually got out into the economy and changed the way \nthings are being done.\n  Well, now, I think we can take some credit for having raised that \nalarm. Senator Moynihan wrote to the President and urged him to appoint \na Y2K czar or coordinator. The President did not respond. I wrote to \nthe President after we had our hearings in the Banking Committee and \nrecommended it. He did not respond to me, either. But in February of \n1998, he did, in fact, appoint a Y2K coordinator. I think the track \nrecord says it is the Congress that possibly spurred that. And we now \nhave a President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion, headed by John \nKoskinen, working very diligently to make sure the Federal Government \nand the economy as a whole is ready for this. We are doing everything \nwe can to create awareness of the challenge. At the same time, we want \nto be sure, in words that we have used before, that while we are ``Paul \nRevere,'' we are not ``Chicken Little.'' We have to get everybody \naroused to the fact that the British really are coming. They have to \nget out of their warm beds and pick up their muskets and get ready for \nthis; but the sky is not falling and it will not be TEOTWAWKI; it will \nnot be the end of the world as we know it.\n  Well, I see that the vice chairman of our committee, Senator Dodd, \nhas come on to the floor. Soon I will reserve the remainder of my time \nand give him an opportunity for a statement about this.\n  Other members of the committee have expressed an interest to come to \nthe floor and talk about this issue. I want to acknowledge the \ntremendous support we have had on this committee. This is a unique kind \nof committee in that we have had tremendous bipartisan support. My \nstaff and Senator Dodd's staff function almost as one on this \ncommittee. We have made every effort to keep any kind of partisanship \nout of it. We go out on field visits together. Senator Dodd has been \nindefatigable in his effort to keep this thing going, and he prods me \nin areas where I need it and keeps the committee focused in areas where \nsometimes I stray in other places. It has been one of the most \nsatisfying legislative experiences that I have ever had.\n  Other members of the committee, the same way. Senator Moynihan was \ninto this issue before we even discovered it and came onto the \ncommittee with great enthusiasm. Senator Smith of Oregon, who came to \nthe Senate as a businessman, took charge of dealing with business and \nY2K's impact on business and has been tremendously helpful. We have had \nSenator Bingaman, who we have asked to focus on the national defense \nissues. Senator Collins, as a representative of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, has held hearings in that committee based on what \nshe has come up with out of our committee. Senator Kyl did all of the \nheavy lifting on the committee for last year's bill on disclosure and \nhas been enormously valuable.\n  And then we have, unlike any other committee in the Senate, two ex \nofficio members, Ted Stevens of Alaska and Robert C. Byrd of West \nVirginia; and the fact that the Federal Government received literally \nbillions of dollars in emergency funds in the last supplemental, which, \nI think, have dealt with the true emergency. I think we are responsible \nfor our being where we are in many of the government agencies. I don't \nthink that would have happened if the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee were not involved directly and \nparticularly in the work of this particular special committee.\n  So, with that tribute to my fellow Senators on this committee and the \nwork that has been done, I will reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. \nPresident, to allow the vice chairman of the committee and the ranking \nDemocrat, Senator Dodd, to make his statement.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Without breaking into the colloquy, I wonder if I can \nhave 5 seconds to introduce a bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alaska be recognized for the purpose of introducing a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n501 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me begin these remarks by seconding everything \nthat my colleague from Utah has said about the other members of this \ncommittee. I will add, as I know he has expressed on numerous \noccasions, the tremendous work done by our respective staffs. They have \ndone a tremendous amount of work in providing us with the kind of \ndetailed information that we have been able to produce at this juncture \nin our interim report, which we released today.\n  Let me also, on behalf of other members of the committee, say to you \nand to our colleagues here that we have been truly fortunate to have \nBob Bennett lead this effort. I have said this on numerous occasions. \nHe has literally been the leader on this in the Senate. He began early \non and insisted that the Banking Committee have a subcommittee that \nwould look at the implications of this year 2000 ``bug,'' as it is \naffectionately referred to, on financial institutions. It was as a \nresult of his efforts that my curiosity was piqued.\n  As a member of that committee--not as the ranking Democrat, but as a \nmember of that committee--I attended a number of hearings we had on \nfinancial services, and I quickly learned through that process that \nthis issue went far beyond the individual institutions that had to do \ntheir own assessments. What Senator Bennett discovered very early on \nand what others of us who sat in on those committee hearings soon \nlearned, was that it wasn't enough to be a financial service and have \nyour own house in shape when it came to the Y2K issue, and that the \nbank, or the savings and loan, or the stock brokerage, or any other \nfinancial service, insurance agent, or company--if they were in good \nshape internally, that wasn't enough. They had to also determine \nwhether or not suppliers and customers, all sorts of contractors with\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\nwhom they do business, would also have to be in good shape.\n  That obviously drew us to the conclusion that this was an issue that \ndeserved broader attention than just looking at the financial services \nsector. As a result, Senator Bennett and I went to our respective \nleaders and asked and urged them to support this special committee that \nhas no legislative authority. We have no authority to pass any laws or \ndo anything, but merely try to make an assessment as we now approach \nthe millennium date 304 days from today.\n  As a result of those efforts, beginning last year, Trent Lott, our \nmajority leader, and Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate, \nsupported our efforts to form this committee. We owe them a great debt \nof gratitude, as well, as leaders for giving us the kind of support \nthat has been necessary to do our jobs.\n  Today, at the conclusion of this discussion, there will be a vote on \na matter that would provide an additional $300,000 over the next year \nfor us to complete our work as we now enter this second phase of this \nassessment of how the Nation and the world is responding to this issue. \nSo we hope that our colleagues will be supportive of that effort to \nallow us to complete our work.\n  Again, at the outset, I want to thank my friend and colleague from \nUtah whose own background in business--and a successful business, I \nmight add--has brought some wonderful awareness and knowledge to all of \nthis. It has been truly enjoyable to work with him and his staff over \nthese past number of months which has brought us to the place we are \ntoday.\n  The Senate special committee, which formed in April, as I have said, \nhas been working hard to assess a variety of industry sectors. Some \nsectors have been very cooperative. We should tell you that in this \nkind of effort so much information and so much news is focused on what \nis wrong. We need to take some time to tell you about what is right, \ntoo.\n  There is a lot that is going on that is right when it comes to this \nissue. It doesn't get the same attention. The old axiom that the media \ndoesn't report about planes that fly is certainly true in the Y2K \nissue. The headlines are going to tell you about where the problems \nare. That is the nature of the news media and what gets covered. But \nthere are a lot of planes that are flying, if you will, both literally \nand figuratively when it comes to the year 2000 issue. Those that have \nbeen doing the work getting the job done deserve to be recognized as \nwell. Others have needed more persuasion, unfortunately. We will get to \nthat.\n  After 10 months of research, we have now completed our report, which \nI have referred to already, which gives you the status on seven major \nsectors. It is not an all-conclusive list. But we came up with this \nlist. Senator Bennett did. He came up with a list of seven critical \nareas that we thought most people would have questions about and \nlegitimate concerns. I will get to that in a second. I know Senator \nBennett has already discussed that to some degree.\n  The report was intended to provide as comprehensive as we could an \nanalysis, and described as thoroughly as we could in a single document \nhow ready we are to face this millennium issue that is going to be upon \nus in 304 days; in some cases before.\n  Reflecting on what we have learned from our research and hearings, I \nthink it would be an understatement to say that Y2K is an important \nissue. Expert opinions on the subject have ranged from denial to the \ncoming of Armageddon.\n  While we don't foresee any major disruptions, anyone who hasn't begun \nto consider the ramifications of this problem should do so immediately, \nin our opinion. Some businesses within different industries have been \nextremely forward thinking in their year 2000 preparation efforts. \nGeorge Washington Memorial Hospital, right in our own Nation's Capital \nin the city of Washington, began its remediation efforts a half a \ndecade ago in order to be ready for the year 2000 issue. State Street, \nan international financial service in Boston, MA, began fixing its year \n2000 problem 6 years ago and is projected to spend some $200 million on \nremediation efforts. The cost has been significant. For some it will \ncontinue to rise as companies continue to discover problems and work \nthrough them.\n  Consider for a moment, if you would, Mr. President, the cost of not \nbeing ready, especially with regard to exposure to litigation. \nProjected litigation costs have ranged from $500 billion to $1 \ntrillion. You can be sure that these costs in one way or another will \nbe passed on to consumers in other groups.\n  Let me just mention the litigation issue. As my colleague from Utah \nknows, and others know, I have been a strong advocate of litigation \nreform. Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator Domenici, myself, and others \nauthored the securities litigation reform bill, and then last year we \npassed the uniform standards legislation to reduce the proliferation of \ncomputer-driven complaints where mere stock fluctuations would generate \nlawsuits. I think it was a good effort and was endorsed by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and overwhelmingly supported by our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I am a supporter of litigation \nreform in this area, too. I think it is going to be very important that \nwe do something in this area to reduce the potential costs of \nunwarranted litigation.\n\n  Having said that, however, Mr. President, I also want to say that \nthere should be no mistake out there that this committee and this \nCongress are not about to create some firewall that protects businesses \nor industries when they should have known better and done better and \ndidn't do so. If you are sitting back and saying, I hear Congress is \nabout to pass some legislation that is going to insulate me and protect \nme from consumers and businesses and others that would have a \nlegitimate complaint against a company that did not do its Y2K work, \nyou would be mistaken. I think I am speaking for most of us here who \nfeel that way. That is not to say we will not be able to pass a bill. I \nhope we can. But we shouldn't leave the impression that this is going \nto be somehow an abolition of tort law in this country.\n  There is a reason why we call these problems bugs or viruses. Like a \ndisease, this issue can corrupt the functioning of vital systems, can \ncause damage, shutdown, and can bring the flow of work to a halt. They \ncan take a business out of business very quickly. They can stop the \nflow of information and communication.\n  As concerned as I am, let me make the point that we believe the \nUnited States is one of the most prepared nations in the world. We have \nthe resources we need both in terms of economics and expertise. \nHowever, most countries lag behind the United States in the year 2000 \npreparation.\n  I cannot stress to you enough, Mr. President, the serious nature of \nthis topic. This is not an imaginary problem just because we can't at \nthis time quantify as exactly as we would like, or forecast as exactly \nas we would like, the extent of this problem. We don't know for sure \nwhat is going to happen, and where it is going to happen. So we must \nprepare, in our view, for a bad situation. We hope it doesn't occur. \nThere is no information we have that it is likely to occur. But we \ndon't know. We just don't know with the kind of certainty we would like \nto share with our colleagues and share with the Nation.\n  Some chief executive officers and government leaders assume because \nthis is a technical problem and they lack technical expertise that \ntheir hands are somehow tied. This is not the case. There is no \nsinglehanded resolution to this crisis. A successful resolution will \ncall for cooperation across the board. This is not just a technology \nproblem. It will require managers who are willing to get involved at \nall levels. It will take leaders in business, in the U.S. Congress, and \nat the executive branch level to take the initiative and find out where \ncompanies and organizations, nonprofits and for-profits, are in their \nY2K remediation and contingency planning.\n  Large, medium and small businesses must cooperate to find solutions. \nChief executive officers must be aware of the extent of their \ncompanies' Y2K exposure. Companies must develop contingency plans. In \nfact, this is a critical issue right now. It doesn't mean you ought to \nstop remediation, but if you are concerned that you are not going to be \nable to get ready in 304 days, you ought to be actively involved in \nlooking at contingency planning.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\n  If there were no other message I could leave our colleagues with, or \nothers who may be following this discussion today, the most important \npoint I would like to make is the need for contingency planning. I \ncan't think of anything more important. You ought to know how important \ncontingency planning will be.\n  They also must insist that vital suppliers and vendors resolve their \nown problems and have their own contingency plans in place. The true \nheroes on January 1, 2000, will be those organizations, private and \npublic companies--small, medium and large--that have found a way to \nadapt to this potential problem. A business owner who wants to prosper \nin the new millennium must prepare for the Y2K problem in such a way \nthat the business--that their business, his or her business--does not \nskip a beat come New Year's Day.\n  As of today, as I have said repeatedly now today, we have 304 days \nremaining, but much can still be done in that time, as short as it is.\n  If you have lived in the Southeast of our country where there are \nhurricanes on almost an annual basis, or the Midwest and South where \ntornadoes are common, you may have heard warnings that gave you little \ntime to make survival decisions. The year 2000 is a storm on the not-\ntoo-distant future horizon. It is a disaster, in some cases pervasive \nthroughout the First World and beyond, but is one for which we can \nprepare.\n  It is one that we can work to neutralize. We on this committee have \nbeen assessing all that we can to understand more about this coming \nstorm, and we have learned a great deal. Small businesses do not have \nany compliance plans in place.\n  Preparation for the continued health of our Nation's businesses and \nindustries is vital, but paramount is the health of our health care. It \nis not an exaggeration to say that lives could be lost as a result of \nthis crisis. I point to disturbing examples of what could happen \nrelative to health care and the Y2K issue not to be an alarmist, quite \nthe contrary, but to shed light on something that needs the attention \nof everyone in this country. Sixty million people are dependent on \nmedication for the treatment of health problems from cancer to heart \ndisease. Some require daily doses of life-sustaining medicines to keep \ntheir bodies from rejecting transplanted organs or to prevent cancers \nfrom spreading.\n  Let me just cite one example of what I am talking about of which this \ncommittee has become keenly aware. Laurene West is a registered nurse \nand a computer expert. She brings together some wonderful talents. And \nif you were to meet her, you would see a seemingly healthy woman. Were \nit not for the fact that I tell you now, you would never guess that her \nstate of health will put her more at risk than any of us when the year \n2000 arrives. Ms. West had a tumor removed from her brain and requires \ndaily medication to prevent the regrowth of that tumor.\n  During her first of 13 surgeries, she developed a staph infection \nthat does not respond to any known oral antibiotic. She is dependent on \nIV antibiotics which she cannot store because they have no shelf life. \nAny disruption to the supply of these antibiotics could be fatal to \nher. She knows health care. She knows computers. And she knows all too \nwell the impact that the year 2000 could have on her health care.\n  Ms. West has been the most proactive voice calling upon us to take \naction. She worries that HMOs and physicians, to a certain extent, view \nthe impending crisis with a degree of disbelief and apathy. Many health \ninsurance organizations will not pay for the storage of even the most \ncritical of drugs. We now are aware that as much as 80 percent--80 \npercent--of the ingredients of drugs manufactured in the United States \nof America come from overseas.\n  Let me repeat that. As much as 80 percent of the ingredients of drugs \nmanufactured in this country come from overseas. Foreign companies \naccount for 70 percent of the insulin market in the United States. \nUnfortunately, patients have been prevented from stocking lifesaving \ndrugs because of restrictions placed on pharmacists by insurers and \nphysicians who may not fully understand the magnitude of this problem. \nMs. West has brought this to our attention. We applaud her efforts, and \nwe are going to try to do something about her case and cases like it.\n  Health care is this Nation's single largest industry. It generates \n$1.5 trillion annually. There are 6,000 hospitals in America, 800,000 \nphysicians, and 50,000 nursing homes, as well as hundreds of biomedical \nequipment manufacturers, health care insurers, suppliers of drugs and \nbandages that may be unprepared for the year 2000. According to the \nGartner Group, 64 percent of our Nation's 6,000 hospitals have no plans \nto test their Y2K preparedness. About 80 to 85 percent of doctors' \noffices are said to be unaware of the Y2K problem.\n  Struggling compliance efforts by the Health Care Finance \nAdministration and unaddressed concerns about medical devices are major \nroadblocks to the industry's year 2000 readiness. In short, the health \ncare industry is one of the least prepared with 304 days to go for \ndealing with the Y2K problem and carries, in my opinion, the greatest \npotential for harm at this juncture. Due to limited resources and a \nlack of awareness, rural and inner-city hospitals are particularly at \nhigh risk.\n  Each industry we have examined is critical to the functioning of our \nsociety. We have all heard the analogies about making a phone call on \nDecember 31 around midnight and getting the bill the next month with a \ncharge for 100 years of long-distance calls. But what if the phone \ndoesn't work at all; what if you lose contact with your work, your \nfamily doctor, your 911 dispatcher. Think what would happen if the \nability to communicate was taken from governments, militaries, \nbusinesses and people.\n\n  The U.S. has never experienced a widespread telecommunications \noutage, yet the telecom network is one of the most Y2K-vulnerable \nsystems. And while 95 percent of telephone systems are expected to be \ncompliant in time, there is no industry-wide effort to test data \nnetworks, cellular and satellite communications systems or the Nation's \n1,400 regional telecom carriers. Despite telecom infrastructure \nreadiness, customer equipment and company switchboards may experience \nsome problems, leaving no guarantee of getting a dial tone on January \n1.\n  A forum that included the Nation's largest telecom companies was \nformed in 1997 to address the year 2000 concerns and was early, to \ntheir credit, in formulating a compliance plan. We are awaiting a final \nindustry report which is expected early this year.\n  With all of our assessment, research and hearings, we have learned a \ngreat deal about many sectors of our infrastructure. We have learned \nwho is compliant and who is making headway, who is lagging behind, and \nwho has failed to disclose their status. We discuss and recommend \nlegislation to move the process forward, and we must look hard into the \nmirror. The Federal Government should be setting an example, in our \nview, for the rest of our country in preparing for the Y2K issue, yet \nthe Federal Government's Y2K preparations vary widely.\n  The Social Security Administration, for instance, got an early start \nand is well prepared--we commend them for their efforts--while other \nagencies such as the Department of Defense and the Health Care Finance \nAdministration are lagging somewhat behind. The Federal Government will \nspend somewhere, we are told, between $7.5 billion--and I apologize for \nthe disparity --and $20 billion. I would like to make that number more \ndefinitive for you, but we are getting wide-ranging cost figures here. \nThose are the numbers we are being told just for the remediation at the \nFederal agencies, but it will not be able to renovate, test, and \nimplement all of its critical missions in time. After a late start, the \nFederal Emergency Management Administration is now engaged in national \nemergency planning in the event of year 2000 disruptions, but many \nState and local governments are not prepared to deliver critical \nservices such as benefit payments, 911, and emergency services.\n  Both Senator Bennett and I have had a particular interest in small \nbusinesses. This is because small businesses fulfill such a crucial \nrole in our Nation's economy, providing 51 percent of the total private \nsector output. Small businesses are absolutely vital to the economic \nwell-being of our Nation. There are approximately 14 million small \nbusinesses in the United States today and, according to the NFIB \nEducation Foundation, nearly a quarter of\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nthese 14 million businesses haven't spent a dime on year 2000 \nremediation. Fifty-five percent of them correspond with suppliers via \nelectronic interaction and 17 percent say that they would lose at least \nhalf their sales or production if automated processes were to fail. \nMany of these companies are playing wait and see--in reality, gambling \nthat the problems are small, or at least they will be able to repair \nthe damage before they go out of business.\n  In our February 5 hearing, we heard testimony from Mr. Ken Evans, \npresident of the Arizona Farm Bureau Federation. Part of the \nresponsibility of his organization is to look out for a type of small \nbusiness that is literally the bread and butter of our country--the \nfamily farm. Some reports have indicated that these small businesses \nmay not be affected by the year 2000 problem since few of the systems \nused by family farms are automated. However, as Mr. Evans pointed out \nbefore our committee hearing, smaller farms rely heavily on vendors, \ntelecommunications services, bankers, and transportation companies that \nare all highly automated.\n  I know the Presiding Officer in the Chair comes from one of our rural \nStates and knows better than most about just what I have said here, \nthat people have sort of a mythological perception about the family \nfarm and how it works. But today to succeed as a family farmer you have \nto be connected with these other vehicles to provide the services you \nneed and to get your products and produce to the consumers.\n  The smooth functioning, as Mr. Evans pointed out, of day-to-day \nbusiness on the small farm requires that phones work, the refrigeration \nis in service, and the transportation services are available.\n  In general, we think the level of preparedness seems to be determined \nby the relative size of the business or by how much the business is \nregulated by State and Federal agencies. While the heavily regulated \ninsurance, investment, and banking industries are the furthest ahead in \nthe Y2K compliance efforts, health care, oil, education, agriculture, \nfarming, food processing, and the construction industries are lagging \nbehind.\n  The cost to regain lost operational capability for mission-critical \nfailures will range, we are told, from $20,000 to $3.5 million per \nbusiness, depending upon the size of your company. It is estimated that \nit will take an average of 3 to 15 days to fix the problems. Large \ncompanies with greater resources, of course, are better able to deal \nwith the year 2000 problem. Small and medium-sized businesses, however, \nare the most vulnerable to the year 2000 disruptions. One survey shows \nthat more than 40 percent of 14 million small businesses do not have \nany compliance plans in place.\n  Mr. President, I am only going to speak briefly about the problem of \nlitigation. I already mentioned my concerns about this and my desire \nfor legislation. I think the price tag of $500 billion to $1 trillion \nspeaks for itself. That would be a staggering cost to our Nation, not \nto mention to the individual businesses that may be the subject of \nlitigation. It would be contrary, in my view, to our goal of \npreparation, to walk blindly into the next year without taking into \nconsideration the question of litigation reform.\n  Any reform would have to be, in my view, specific. It ought to be \nbipartisan, especially considering this is a very unusual circumstance. \nThere is no established precedent upon which to rely in making \nrecommendations for reform. Reform would have to be narrowly tailored, \nin my view, for a very specific purpose. It would have to encourage \nbusinesses and organizations to seek solutions and disclose progress \nwithout fear of litigious retribution. At the same time, companies and \norganizations must not be allowed to choose to do nothing and escape \nresponsibility. We will be looking at this in the coming weeks. \nClearly, much is left to be resolved.\n  Again, Senator Bennett has spoken about the interconnected \nrelationships of governments, all organizations, all companies and \npeople. To say that everything is connected is to put simple words to a \nvery complex reality. To those chief executive officers who have told \nus that their Y2K exposure is nonexistent, due to early planning and \nremediation efforts, I would only ask: What will you do if power is \ndisrupted on the grids? What will you do if you cannot ship products? \nWhat will you do if your vendors are not Y2K compliant? To government \nleaders at the local and State level who have not planned for this, we \nwould ask: What will you tell the people you serve if their government \ncannot function? To those HMOs and physicians who are not anticipating \na Y2K-related problem, my question to you is: What will happen if you \nare wrong and you do nothing?\n  Even if our country solves this problem, the fact that many of our \nindustry sectors are tied closely to international businesses and \neconomies will have an unknown effect on all of us. Plants grown \noverseas affect the supply of pharmaceuticals here. America imports \ngoods ranging from produce to electronic equipment. How will our \neconomy be affected if some of these products do not arrive on our \nshores? The fact is, what I am saying here, and what Senator Bennett \nhas said over and over again, is we are all in this together. You are \nnot protected by geographical boundaries, by political entities, or by \nlamenting what is not happening offshore.\n  There is a storm on the horizon. We have seen the warning signs. The \nquestion is, do we have the ability to weather this storm? We think we \ndo, but we have to work hard and all of us need to work together. In \nweathering this potential storm, we need to continue to look closely at \nthe sectors of infrastructure that we have reported on in this interim \nreport. We need to work closely with our international neighbors who \nare of particular interest to the United States, both economically and \npolitically, in order to better assess their problems and better \nanticipate the effect that problems in their countries will have on us.\n  Our list of priorities for the coming months include the following: \nWe need to revisit the domestic industry and infrastructure sectors \nfirst examined last year. As I indicated, we need to place increased \nemphasis on international Y2K preparedness. We hope to identify \nnational and international security issues and concerns, some of which \nwe have been briefed on even as late as today, as Members of this body, \nby the respective agencies of our Federal Government. We will continue \nto monitor Federal Government preparedness, but also turn our attention \nmore to State and local government preparedness. Evaluating contingency \nemergency preparedness and planning is a high priority for this year. \nWe need to determine the need for additional Y2K implementation or \ndelaying implementation dates of new regulations.\n  I should have made note, by the way, when speaking about our paying \nattention to local governments and to municipalities, our colleague \nfrom New York, who I think is going to come shortly to the floor, has \nraised the issue.\n\n  Here he is. He has already raised the issue of how we might help the \nmunicipalities and State governments, and I commend him once again for \nbringing to this chamber the kind of vision he historically has brought \non so many other matters. I leave it to the Senator from New York to \ndiscuss his ideas in that regard, and I leave him to comment on those \nmatters.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate the words of our colleagues when they \nsaid we must work together. We must not let our differences keep us \napart. If we are going to cooperate, if we are going to keep this from \nbecoming a larger problem than it has to become, then the finger-\npointing and name-calling and recriminations that can often be \nassociated with this kind of an issue need to be eliminated entirely.\n  Again, I commend my colleague from Utah who has led this effort so \nwell over the past year or two--several years, now. I am very, very \nconfident that, whatever else may happen, we will be doing our very \nbest in these coming 10 months to keep our colleagues and the American \npublic well informed about this issue, raising concerns where we think \nthey are legitimate, not engaging in the hyperbolic kind of rhetoric \nthat can create a panic which poses its own set of problems, but to be \nrealistic with people, backup what we say with the kind of evidence we \nthink is important for the American public and others to have as we try \nto work our way through this issue.\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time and am glad to yield to \nmy colleague from New York. I apologize, I didn't see him come in \nearlier or I would have yielded to him earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The senior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in the first instance to \ncongratulate the chairman of our committee and his vice chairman for \nthe extraordinary work they have done in less than a year. I make the \npoint, it is a point of Senate procedure, that it is rare there is a \nchairman and vice chairman, not chairman and ranking member. This has \nbeen a wholly bipartisan effort from the first, and I think we can see \nthat from the results in so brief a span.\n  The issue has been with us for some while, and it would be derelict \nof me not to mention that it was brought to my attention by a dear \nfriend from New York, a financial analyst, John Westergaard, who began \ntalking to me about the matter in 1995. On February 13 of 1996, I wrote \nto the Congressional Research Service to say: Well, now, what about \nthis? Richard Nunno authored a report which the CRS sent to me on June \n7 saying that ``the Y2K problem is indeed serious and that fixing it \nwill be costly and time-consuming. The problem deserves the careful and \ncoordinated attention of the Federal Government, as well as the private \nsector, in order to avert major disruptions on January 1, 2000.''\n  I wrote the President, on July 31 of that year, to relay the findings \nof the CRS report and raise the issue generally. And, in time, a \nPresidential appointment was made to deal with this in the executive \nbranch, to which I will return. But last spring--less than one year \nago--the majority leader and the minority leader had the perception to \nappoint this gifted committee, with its exceptional staff, and now we \nhave its report before us.\n  Two points, followed by a coda, if I may. Shortly after the committee \ns establishment, Senator Bennett and I convened a field hearing--on \nJuly 6--in New York in the ceremonial chamber of the U.S. Federal Court \nHouse for the Southern District of New York at Foley Square. We found \nwe were talking to the banks, the big, large, international banks in \nthe city, and the stock exchange. And we found them well advanced in \ntheir preparations regarding this matter. I think my colleague from \nConnecticut would agree. They were not only dealing with it in their \nown terms, they had gone to the Bank for International Settlements in \nBasel where a Joint Year 2000 Council had been established at our \ninitiative. They were hard at work on their own problems. They were \nworried about others.\n\n  One witness told us that 49 Japanese banks planned to spend some $249 \nmillion as a group on Y2K compliance; 49 banks are thinking of spending \nin combination $249 million. Citicorp was planning $600 million, and it \nalready expended a goodly share of that.\n  Indeed, it was not all our initiative, but certainly it was \nserendipitous, if I can use that term, that the security industry \ncommenced massive testing just a week later--on July 13, 1998. The \ntests went very well. The industry was on to this subject. The point \nbeing, if you are on to this, you can handle it. It is those who aren't \nwho will leave us in the greatest trouble. There will be another \nindustry-wide test later this month. So much for private initiative.\n  We should be grateful for what we have learned, here and abroad. As \nthe Senator from Utah and the Senator from Connecticut have made clear, \nthere are countries that have understood this, as we have done, and are \non top of this. But there are too many other countries that don't know \nthe problem exists or might as well not.\n  As a sometime resident in India, I was interested to find that Indian \nenterprises, concentrated in the Bangalore area, are very much involved \nin doing the computer remediation. If you would like to know something \nabout the world we live in, Mr. President, the work for the day is sent \nto them from San Francisco or New York or Chicago; they do it \novernight, which is not overnight for them, it is the daytime, and it \nis back on our desks in the morning. It is that kind of world we live \nin.\n  Hence, to the second subject, which is the nuclear one. There is \npotential here for the kind of unintended disaster of an order we \ncannot describe in terms of medical care or financial statements or, \nfor that matter, air travel at New Year's--which is to say that the \nfailure of computer systems in Russia to give the correct information \nabout early warning systems, such that 6,000 nuclear warheads still in \nRussia are not inadvertently launched. They could be, you know. They \nare in place--not all--but enough. A hundred would do. Three would be a \ncalamity. Two were dropped on Japan and ended the Second World War. \nThese are all huge weapons, far above the tonnage and of a different \nchemical composition than the early atomic bombs, as we have come to \nknow them.\n  The Russians seem to know they have a problem--or they may have a \nproblem. Or they don't know whether they do or they don't. In that \nsituation, ``we didn't quite catch it'' could bring incomprehensible \ncatastrophe just at the moment when we thought that long, dark half a \ncentury was ended, the half century that began in 1946, when the \nSoviets exploded their first nuclear device.\n  We have a danger here and we have an opportunity, and we ought to \nrespond to the one and seize the other. We are given to understand that \nour Department of Defense officials have begun some negotiations, \ndiscussions in Moscow to invite a Russian team to Colorado Springs--\nwhere it happens our facilities in these regards are located--to let us \nwatch each other's nuclear launches, nuclear alerts, false alarms.\n  We can think, Mr. President, that this was something behind us, \nsurely a matter of passing. It wasn't. We have learned just recently \nthat in 1983, one Soviet officer, a Stanislav Petrov, a 44-year-old \nlieutenant colonel, was in the Serpukhov-15 installation where the \nSoviet Union monitored its early warning satellites over the United \nStates, and all of a sudden the lights began to flash ``Start,'' \nbecause the warning time is very short.\n  He made a decision on his own: they only supposed that they had \npicked up a launching; the equipment picked up five ICBMs. Mankind was \nspared by one lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Army who knew enough \nstrategic doctrine to know that the United States would never launch \nfive. It might launch 5,000. So as the information went up, by the \nnanoseconds, through the chain of command, it was decided not to launch \na counterstrike.\n  That is how close we came, probably never in a more mortal way. He is \nstill alive and has told his tale. I ask unanimous consent that at the \nend of my remarks David Hoffman's account of this in the Washington \nPost be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest that we seek to reach an \nagreement for the Russians to come and bring with them all their codes \nand their classified communications modes, learn what our early warning \nsystem is, tell us what they will of theirs, perhaps be open about its \nown weaknesses, which are so great. These are the people who still have \nthe fate of mankind in their hands, and they haven't been paid in 6 \nmonths. What they talk about, evidently, is the need for money. How in \nGod's name we cannot provide it I fail to see. The maintenance of our \nnuclear system in the course of a half century cost $5.5 trillion. I \nsometimes forget this, but in my years on the Finance Committee, I have \nlearned that a billion minutes ago, Saint Peter was just 30 years dead. \nA billion is a large number. A trillion is beyond our capacity. They \nare asking thousands of millions. Very little.\n  I hope Beijing might want to join. I would invite Islamabad and New \nDelhi, places which are unstable and have nuclear devices. Out of that, \nMr. President, out of this immediate crisis, we might find a longrun \ninstitution or institutions--they need not be here, exclusively--they \ncan be in many places--in which we would monitor one another's nuclear \nactivity while, pray God, we develop it down, and relearn the \nconfidence-building measures that were so important in the cold war. \nThat telephone between the Kremlin and the White House made more of a \ndifference than we probably know. It is this kind of thing.\n\n  I note to my dear friends--and I will get complete agreement--this \nbody has\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nknown fewer persons with a greater understanding of the cold war than \nSenator Sam Nunn and the late Senator Henry Jackson who, in the early \n1980s, brought up the concept of a joint early warning system. And then \nthe MX was deployed, and we moved from essentially a deterrence \nposition on nuclear matters, a second-strike, if you will, to a first-\nstrike capacity, such that the Soviet systems had to be constantly \nalarmed.\n  Now, maybe that idea of Senators Nunn and Jackson will come, come at \nlast. I would hope for two things. And I do not want to impose, and I \ndo not want to presume, but I will do. This is not a time for too much \ndelicacy.\n  I would hope that our chairman and vice chairman--I make that point: \nthe Intelligence Committee and, I believe, the Ethics Committee have a \nchairman and vice chairman; all the rest is majority rule around here, \nwhich is fine, but this is bipartisan--if they might find it possible \nto visit Moscow and talk with members of the Duma there where the START \nII treaty, which we took all the 1980s to negotiate, lies unratified. \nAnd our plans for START III are, accordingly, on hold. They might go or \nthey might invite--some action from the Congress, I think, is in order. \nAnd it would be no harm to point out to the Russian Government that \nthey now have a legislative branch. And if it acts in ways that are not \nalways agreeable to the executive, well, that is not an unknown \nphenomena. It has been going on for two centuries in the United States. \nIt is an important and necessary initiative we ought to somehow pursue.\n  One final point. I hope my friends will not feel I am trespassing on \ntheir--our concerns, as I am a member and am honored to be a member of \nthe committee--the Pentagon is too much disposed to discuss this matter \nin secret session. This is a time for more openness. This is a time the \nAmerican people can be trusted with information which the Russian \nauthorities already have.\n  One of the phenomenons of the cultural secrecy which has developed \nover the last century is that the U.S. Government is continuing to keep \ninformation from us which our adversaries know perfectly well. It is \nonly we who do not know. This has done a perceptible harm to American \ndemocracy. We have no idea how distant it is from the beginning of the \ncentury when Woodrow Wilson could proclaim, as a condition of peace to \nconclude the First World War, ``open covenants openly arrived at.''\n  Now, mind you, that same President Wilson, to whom I am devoted, in \nthe day after he asked for a declaration of war, he sent a series of 17 \nbills, which were rolled together and called the Espionage Act. It \nprovided for prior restraint, as lawyers call it, censorship of the \npress. First Henry Lodge, on this floor, the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, said, ``Yes, I think that is a good idea.'' The \nnext day he came back and said, ``You know, I don't think it's a good \nidea. The press should be free in this country.''\n  President Wilson wrote the bill manager on the House side, and said, \n``Please keep it.'' It was not kept. But it was assumed it was kept, so \nmuch so that when the Pentagon Papers were released, the executive \nbranch of our Government just assumed that was a crime and proceeded to \nprevent their publication and find out more about the person who had \nreleased them. And the next thing you know, we had an impeachment \nhearing in the Federal Government--a crisis that all grew out of \nsecrecy and presumptions of secrecy.\n  I would hope--I doubt there is anybody in the Pentagon listening, but \nI see the chairman and vice chairman listening--I would hope they would \nsay we could have an open briefing. The American people will respond \nintelligently to dangers of which they are appropriately apprised. And \nthis surely is one.\n  But, sir, I have spoken sufficiently. I beg to say one last thing. On \nthe House side, our colleague and friend, Representative Stephen Horn \nof California, has been very active producing ``report cards'' on the \nstatus of the different departments of the Government and keeping it up \nregularly. As the Senator from Connecticut observed, the Social \nSecurity Administration got A's all along. Others have not.\n  It would not be a bad idea for the chairmen and ranking members of \nour standing committees to review Representative Horn's report cards \nand keep an eye on the departments that report to them.\n  Other than that, I think I have spoken long enough. I do not think, \nhowever, I have sufficiently expressed my admiration and at times awe \nof the performance of our chairman and vice chairman. The Senate is \ngrateful, is in their debt. So is the Nation. The Nation need not know \nthat; it just needs to pay attention to their message, sir.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 10, 1999]\n\n   ``I Had a Funny Feeling in My Gut''--Soviet Officer Faced Nuclear \n                               Armageddon\n\n                           (By David Hoffman)\n\n       Moscow--It was just past midnight as Stanislav Petrov \n     settled into the commander's chair inside the secret bunker \n     at Serpukhov-15, the installation where the Soviet Union \n     monitored its early-warning satellites over the United \n     States.\n       Then the alarms went off. On the panel in front of him was \n     a red pulsating button. One word flashed: ``Start.''\n       It was Sept. 26, 1983, and Petrov was playing a principal \n     role in one of the most harrowing incidents of the nuclear \n     age, a false alarm signaling a U.S. missile attack.\n       Although virtually unknown to the West at the time, the \n     false alarm at the closed military facility south of Moscow \n     came during one of the most tense periods of the Cold War. \n     And the episode resonates today because Russia's early-\n     warning system has fewer than half the satellites it did back \n     then, raising the specter of more such dangerous incidents.\n       As Petrov described it in an interview, one of the Soviet \n     satellites sent a signal to the bunker that a nuclear missile \n     attack was underway. The warning system's computer, weighing \n     the signal against static, concluded that a missile had been \n     launched from a base in the United States.\n       The responsibility fell to Petrov, then a 44-year-old \n     lieutenant colonel, to make a decision: Was it for real?\n       Petrov was situated at a critical point in the chain of \n     command, overseeing a staff that monitored incoming signals \n     from the satellites. He reported to superiors at warning-\n     system headquarters; they, in turn, reported to the general \n     staff, which would consult with Soviet leader Yuri Andropov \n     on the possibility of launching a retaliatory attack.\n       Petrov's role was to evaluate the incoming data. At first, \n     the satellite reported that one missile had been launched--\n     then another, and another. Soon, the system was ``roaring,'' \n     he recalled--five Minuteman intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles had been launched, it reported.\n       Despite the electronic evidence, Petrov decided--and \n     advised the others--that the satellite alert was a false \n     alarm, a call that may have averted a nuclear holocaust. But \n     he was relentlessly interrogated afterward, was never \n     rewarded for his decision and today is a long-forgotten \n     pensioner living in a town outside Moscow. He spoke openly \n     about the incident, although the official account is still \n     considered secret by authorities here.\n       On the night of the crisis, Petrov had little time to \n     think. When the alarms went off, he recalled, ``for 15 \n     seconds, we were in a state of shock. We needed to \n     understand, what's next?''\n       Usually, Petrov said, one report of a lone rocket launch \n     did not immediately go up the chain to the general staff and \n     the electronic command system there, known as Krokus. But in \n     this case, the reports of a missile salvo were coming so \n     quickly that an alert had already gone to general staff \n     headquarters automatically, even before he could judge if \n     they were genuine. A determination by the general staff was \n     critical because, at the time, the nuclear ``suitcase'' that \n     gives a Soviet leader a remote-control role in such decisions \n     was still under development.\n       In the end, less than five minutes after the alert began, \n     Petrov decided the launch reports must be false. He recalled \n     making the tense decision under enormous stress--electronic \n     maps and consoles were flashing as he held a phone in one \n     hand and juggled an intercom in the other, trying to take in \n     all the information at once. Another officer at the early-\n     warning facility was shouting into the phone to him to remain \n     calm and do his job.\n       ``I had a funny feeling in my gut,'' Petrov said. ``I \n     didn't want to make a mistake. I made a decision, and that \n     was it.''\n       Petrov's decision was based partly on a guess, he recalled. \n     He had been told many times that a nuclear attack would be \n     massive--an onslaught designed to overwhelm Soviet defenses \n     at a single stroke. But the monitors showed only five \n     missiles. ``When people start a war, they don't start it with \n     only five missiles,'' he remembered thinking at the time. \n     ``You can do little damage with just five missiles.''\n       Another factor, he said, was that Soviet ground-based radar \n     installations--which search for missiles rising above the \n     horizon--showed no evidence of an attack. The ground radar \n     units were controlled from a different command center, and \n     because they cannot see beyond the horizon, they would not \n     spot incoming missiles until some minutes after the \n     satellites had.\n       Following the false alarm, Petrov went through a second \n     ordeal. At first, he was\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n     praised for his actions. But then came an investigation, and \n     his questioners pressed him hard. Why had he not written \n     everything down that night? ``Because I had a phone in one \n     hand and the intercom in the other, and I don't have a third \n     hand,'' he replied.\n       Petrov, who was assigned to the satellite early-warning \n     system at its inception in the 1970s, said in the interview \n     that he knew the system had flaws. It had been rushed into \n     service, he said, and was ``raw.''\n       Petrov said the investigators tried to make him a scapegoat \n     for the false alarm. In the end, he was neither punished nor \n     rewarded. According to Petrov and other sources, the false \n     alarm was eventually traced to the satellite, which picked up \n     the sun's reflection off the tops of clouds and mistook it \n     for a missile launch. The computer program that was supposed \n     to filter out such information was rewritten.\n       It is not known what happened at the highest levels of the \n     Kremlin on the night of the alarm, but it came at a climactic \n     stage in U.S.-Soviet relations that is now regarded as a \n     Soviet ``war scare.'' According to former CIA analyst Peter \n     Pry, and a separate study by the agency, Andropov was \n     obsessed with the possibility of a surprise nuclear attack by \n     the West and sent instructions to Soviet spies around the \n     world to look for evidence of preparations.\n       One reason for Soviet jitters at the time was that the West \n     had unleashed a series of psychological warfare exercises \n     aimed at Moscow, including naval maneuvers into forward areas \n     near Soviet strategic bastions, such as the submarine bases \n     in the Barents Sea.\n       The 1983 alarm also came just weeks after Soviet pilots had \n     shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and just before the \n     start of a NATO military exercise, known as Able Archer, that \n     involved raising alert levels of U.S. nuclear forces in \n     Europe to simulate preparations for an attack. Pry has \n     described this exercise as ``probably the single most \n     dangerous incident of the early 1980s.''\n\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from New York for his generous \nremarks. He is always generous and gracious. I never deserve all the \nnice things he says about me, but I am always glad to have him say them \nnonetheless. I am grateful on this occasion as well.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Tania Calhoun, a detailee to the \ncommittee, be granted floor privileges for the balance of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. Chairman, would you allow me to request a similar \nprivilege of the floor?\n  I ask unanimous consent that Jason Klurfeld of my staff, a designee \non the committee, have privileges of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you.\n  In the list of questions I laid out at the beginning of my \npresentation, we are now at the point where we are asking the two \nquestions: What should we be doing next and what can we expect?\n  The Senator from Connecticut talked about the liability bill. I agree \nwith him absolutely that we cannot take this particular emergency and \nturn it into a stealth operation to slip through other legislation, \neven though I would be for it. The Senator from Connecticut would be \nopposed to it. I would love to do that. But I think that would be an \ninappropriate thing to try to do.\n  It has just come to my attention a demonstration of why we need some \nkind of limited liability relief tied to this. I had an interview with \nan individual who is following Y2K matters, and she said, ``What are \nyou going to do about insurance companies that are canceling policies \nover Y2K?'' And quite frankly, I was skeptical. I said, ``I don't know \nof any insurance companies that are canceling policies.''\n  Well, she sent me one. And here it is; it arrived today. I think that \nis appropriate since this is the day we are talking about Y2K. Here--in \nan area that the Senator from Connecticut has pioneered, health care--\nis an insurance company that has sent out an endorsement on one, two, \nthree, four, five, six, seven, eight different health care policies \nthat they write.\n  They say:\n\n       The following exclusion is added to Section III [of these \n     policies]:\n       This Policy does not apply to, and the Company will not pay \n     any DAMAGES or CLAIM EXPENSES . . . arising out of, or in any \n     way involving any actual or alleged failure of any . . . \n     ``equipment'' . . . [relating to]:\n       (A) any date or time after September 8, 1999;\n\n  The reason for that, Mr. President, is because the 9th day of the 9th \nmonth of the 99th year could trigger four 9's in a computer program and \ncause it to fail.\n\n       (B) any date, time, or data representing or referring to \n     different centuries or more than one century;\n       (C) the change of the Year 1999 to the Year 2000;\n       Or,\n       (D) the Year 2000 as a leap year.\n\n  The reason for that, Mr. President, is that the algorithm used in \ncomputers to compute dates--for reasons I won't take the time to \nexplain--will not recognize the 29th of February, a leap year, in the \nyear 2000; it recognizes it in every other leap year but it does not \nrecognize it in the year 2000.\n  Here is an insurance company that says, ``We will not pay any claims \narising from these predictable Y2K kinds of problems.'' So you have \nthat added burden to a company that is doing its very best to get the \nY2K thing under control and suddenly finds that their insurance policy \nis being unilaterally canceled.\n  Now, as I have said on this floor before, I am unburdened with a \nlegal education, so I don't know quite how to deal with this one, but I \nam sure this is something that ought to go in the mix of what we might \ndo with respect to some kind of legislation this year.\n  Another thing we should be doing next--should be doing now--has to do \nwith more disclosure. Here we are working very closely with the SEC. \nChairman Arthur Levitt of the SEC has been in close touch with the \ncommittee, with Senator Dodd and me, as we have gone through this. The \nSEC is working very hard to get more disclosure. Unfortunately, we \nhaven't had the kind of disclosure that I think shareholders are \nentitled to in this area. This is one thing we ought to keep pushing \nfor. We ought to have more hearings. The Senator from New York talked \nabout that.\n  The authorizing committees, committees of jurisdiction, should take \nup the burden of conducting oversight hearings of the Departments that \nthey have responsibility for. This has already happened. The Armed \nServices Committee of the Senate held a very useful hearing last week \nwith the level of preparedness of the Secretary of Defense. I won't \nrepeat all the information that was developed there because it is \nalready in the Record, but there ought to be more of that going on as \nwe get closer to this. The burden of paying attention to what is going \non in the executive branch should not fall exclusively on John Koskinen \nand the President's Council on the Year 2000. It should be shared by \nthe Congress. We should have more activity rather than less, as the \nCongress stays involved in this.\n  Finally, we have suggested to Senators that they should meet with \ntheir own constituents. Senator Dodd has done this in Connecticut, as I \nhave in Utah. Senator Smith has done it regularly in Oregon and as part \nof his own education as a member of this committee. But other Senators \nwho are not members of the committee have been working in this way. We \non the committee are prepared to help them in this effort. We are going \nto put together, in addition to the report that has been released \ntoday, talking points and guidance information for Senators who decide \nthey want to hold town meetings or other meetings while they are back \nin their own home States.\n  That is very worthwhile. It helps accomplish the twin goals of the \ncommittee: No. 1, to calm down the panic so that people are not Chicken \nLittle; and, at the same time, raise the awareness in a responsible \nway. Individual Senators speaking in their individual States have a \nhigher profile than speeches on the floor of the Senate. That is \nsomething we ought to be doing and something that our committee will do \nits very best to facilitate.\n  Now, this is a moving target, as we have both said. One of the areas \nthat has just come to light that we are going to need more information \non is the chemical industry. We were assured that everything was all \nright in the chemical industry, and now we are discovering that maybe \nthat is not the case. The chemical industry might replace the health \ncare industry as an industry that we look at. This is going to require \nus to pay attention through the\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\nremainder of this year, which is why the resolution funding the \ncommittee for the coming year is the subject of this debate.\n  There have been some questions, by the way, raised as to: Where is \nthis money coming from, and how is Senator Bennett going to pay for it? \nWhere is the offset? I can assure all Senators, this is part of the \noverall allocation of Senate business. This is not new money; this is \nmoney that is already in the budget. It is just being allocated to this \ncommittee as opposed to some other use. We do not have to come up with \nan offset for it under the Budget Act. For those who are concerned \nabout that, I assure you that is not of concern. It is a little \nheartening and indicates that Senators are indeed watching this on \ntheir television sets in their own offices. They are making these phone \ncalls. If they weren't calling the cloakroom asking this, then we would \nknow they were not paying attention.\n\n  The final question which we get all the time with respect to Y2K--\nSenator Dodd gets it, I am sure; I get it almost everywhere I go--What \ncan we expect? Are we going to be all right? We addressed this in our \nopening remarks in saying yes, we are probably going to be all right, \ngenerally. The United States is going to have some problems, but it is \nnot going to be the end of the world as we know it.\n  I want to now focus on what I think we can expect outside of the \nUnited States, because that is the area of greatest concern as we have \ngone through this situation. There are far too many countries in the \nworld where Y2K has not been given the kind of attention it deserves. \nRecently, to his credit, John Koskinen, the President's Y2K czar, \nworking with officials at the United Nations, helped put together a Y2K \nDay at the United Nations and invited the Y2K coordinators from all of \nthe countries around the world to come to New York and participate in \nthis discussion at the United Nations. I went to New York, along with \nCongressman Horn, to represent the legislative branch there and \ndemonstrate that it was not just the executive branch of the Government \nthat was concerned about this.\n  There was a very heartening turnout. A large number of countries sent \nY2K coordinators. It was a very useful day. That is the good news. The \nbad news is that many of these Y2K coordinators didn't know anything \nabout Y2K up to about 2 weeks before they were appointed coordinator \nand given a ticket to New York. They had no idea what this was about. \nThe fact that the United Nations was holding a day and they were \ninvited to come, their government said, ``Maybe we need a Y2K \ncoordinator to go; you go; name somebody''--he or she got on the \nairplane, flew to New York, and didn't have the slightest idea what we \nwere talking about. That is the bad news.\n  The other bad news is that some of them simply could not afford a \nticket. The World Bank funded the airline tickets for some of these Y2K \ncoordinators, which raises the demonstration of the problem we have in \nmany countries around the world. As our consultants have spanned out \nand talked to these people, many of them say, ``We recognize we have a \nproblem; we recognize it is very serious. We are completely broke. What \ndo you suggest we do about it? We simply can't afford the kind of \nremediation that you are going through in the United States.''\n  We just had a team of consultants that came back from Russia and they \ndid a very valid job of assessing where things are in that country. But \nthey said every official that they spoke to began the conversation by \nasking for money. Every single one said, ``We have a problem. Now, can \nyou help us solve it, because we can't afford to do anything about \nit.'' Senator Moynihan was talking about the Russian military not \nhaving been paid for months and months, and they say, ``If we haven't \ngot any money to pay to our military, we don't have any money to deal \nwith the Y2K problem.''\n  What will be the impact? There will be economic dislocation in many \ncountries as a result of this. In some countries it will be more \nserious than others. The unknowable question is, What will be the \nimpact on the United States? I cannot quantify that for you, but I will \ngive you this overall assessment. I think Y2K will trigger what the \neconomists call a ``flight to quality.'' That is, I think investors \naround the world, as they decide that infrastructure problems are going \nto arise in certain countries, will decide as a matter of prudence on \ntheir part, to withdraw their financial support for economic activity \nin that country, which will cripple the country further. The speed with \nwhich money moves around the world is now very different than it used \nto be as recently as 10 or 15 years ago. It used to be when there was \nforeign investment in a country, getting that investment out meant \ncouriers going through airports with attache cases filled with crinkly \npieces of paper handcuffed to their wrists.\n\n  Senator Dole assigned me to work on the Mexican peso problem in early \n1995 when the Mexicans devalued the peso. The flight of foreign \ninvestment from Mexico took place in a matter of hours, and it was all \ndone electronically--a few keystrokes at a keyboard and the money was \ngone. The speed with which foreign investment fled Mexico stunned a \nnumber of economists who had no idea that the foreign money would \ndisappear virtually overnight.\n  I think you are going to see that kind of thing repeated as foreign \ninvestors say: Our Y2K assessment says Country X's infrastructure is \ngoing to fail, their power system is going to go down, their \ntelecommunications system will fail and they won't be able to function. \nEven though we are confident in the management of the company we are \nbacking in that country, we can't run the risk of having them shut down \nbecause of an infrastructure failure. We are going to call the loan, \nsell the stock, and do whatever is necessary to get our money out \nbefore it really hits.\n  This ``flight to quality'' may very well mean that the rich get \nricher and the poor get poorer as a result of Y2K, which raises the \nother two unknowables, but that we need to be concerned about: One, \ncivil unrest in some of these countries and what that might mean to \ntheir economies and their place in the world markets; second, \nhumanitarian requirements.\n  I say, somewhat facetiously, that we have foreign policy by CNN in \nthis country. That is, when the CNN cameras go into a particular area \nof the world and send images back to the United States, we then \nrespond. CNN cameras showed starving children in Somalia and George \nBush sent in troops. I am not criticizing that decision to send in \ntroops, but I wonder if there might not have been starving children in \nother parts of Africa that CNN didn't get into and that was the reason \nwe didn't intervene in those countries as well. I have a nightmare of \nCNN cameras in villages or cities where there is no power, no \ntelecommunications, the banking system is broken down, widespread \nrioting, and then the request is: What is the United States going to do \nabout it? The United States has its Y2K problem under control--the \nrichest country in the world--and we will be faced with the \nhumanitarian challenge of some real hardship in some real areas.\n  So, again, Mr. President, that is one of the reasons why the special \ncommittee on year 2000 should be funded and continued, so that we can \nmonitor these things in the way we have in the past and provide \ninformation and guidance to policymakers who have come to depend upon \nus as a repository of information in this whole situation.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, I am through with my formal statement.\n  Mr. DODD. I see that our colleague is here, and I won't be long.\n  First, I want to commend Senator Moynihan from New York for an \nexcellent statement. He has been a real value to us on the committee. \nHe brings such a wealth of knowledge, information and experience. I \nthought his observation about at least some of the material the Defense \nDepartment has is a worthwhile suggestion. We might want to explore how \nto make more of that information available to the general public. I \nthink those who are skeptical about whether or not there is legitimacy \nin pursuing this committee and making the information available as we \nrequire it, their concern would be further dispelled were they to have \nthe ability to share some of the information we have come across.\n  I commend my colleague from Utah. I think this memo where he has left \noff the name--and I will respect that as\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nwell here, although I will point out that it is not a Connecticut \ncompany. Most people would assume that since it is an insurance \ncompany, it is probably located in Connecticut; but it is not. We may \nwant to compose a letter to send to the industry as a whole. I would be \nvery curious as to whether or not this is a unique, isolated case, or \nwhether or not it is being duplicated by others.\n  For those who may not have heard this, we have come across a memo \nwhich details a number of different kinds of health care policies that \nwould be significantly affected. In fact, they would be excluded from \npayment if, in fact, the damages occur ``as a result of failure of any \nmachine, equipment, device, system, or component thereof, whether it is \nused for the purposes or whether or not the property of the insurer to \ncorrectly recognize, accept, and process or reform any function: any \ndate or any time after September 8, 1999, to January 1.''\n  Clearly, this is the insurance companies saying ``we are not covering \nyou here on this one,'' which is a very important piece of information. \nI think we ought to examine and look at that.\n  This is an early version of OMB's March report that we have been \ngiven which rates the Federal agencies in terms of their year 2000 \ncompliance. Basically, there is good news here, Mr. President. An awful \nlot of agencies are doing pretty well. Some have a long way to go here. \nI think this may be a worthwhile item to be included in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Predictions by Country and Worldside \nPredictions by Industry be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         PREDICTIONS BY COUNTRY\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Rate (percent)                          Country\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n15...............................

Lastly, I don't have this with me, but I am going to ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record as well, Mr. \nPresident. I spent a couple of hours yesterday in my State with the \nGarner Group, a successful firm that represents 35,000 clients \nworldwide--public and private entities--and has a pretty good fix on \nwhat is happening at home and abroad. They have a new assessment, an \nupdated assessment, an industry-by-industry assessment worldwide, \nnational assessments, and for major nations around the globe as to \nwhere they are in all of this. I thought it might be worthwhile for the \npublic and our colleagues to see that most recent information.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           GOVERNMENT-WIDE SUMMARY--YEAR 2000 STATUS MISSION-CRITICAL SYSTEMS\n                                                                      [In percent]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   All systems                       Systems being repaired transpose\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                         Agency status                           Y2K  complaint      Assessment        Renovation        Validation      Implementation\n                                                                       \\1\\            complete        complete \\2\\      complete \\3\\      complete \\4\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTier Three:\n    NASA, FEMA, Education, OPM, HUD, Interior, GSA, VA, SBA,                  96               100               100                99                96\n     EPA, NSF, NRC, SSA.......................................\nTier Two:\n    Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Justice, Labor,                   77               100                94                83                74\n     State, Treasury..........................................\nTier One:\n    U.S. Agency for International, Development Health and                     63               100                98                79                42\n     Human Services, Transportation...........................\nAll Agencies..................................................                79               100                96                87                76\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Percentage of all mission-critical systems that will accurately process data through the century change; these systems have been tested and are\n  operational and includes those systems that have been repaired and replaced, as well as those that were found to be already compliant.\n\\2\\ Percentage of mission-critical systems that have been or are being repaired; ``Renovation complete'' means that necessary changes to a system's\n  databases and/or software have been made.\n\\3\\ Percentage of mission-critical systems that have been or are being repaired; ``Validation complete'' means that testing of performance,\n  functionality, and integration of converted or replaced platforms, applications, databases, utilities, and interfaces within an operational\n  environment has occurred.\n\\4\\ Percentage of mission-critical systems that are being or have been repaired; ``Implementation Complete'' means that the system has been tested for\n  compliance and has been integrated into the system environment where the agency performs its routine information processing activities.

I point out to my chairman that one of the industries they \npoint out that is not doing very well--it is not doing badly, but not \nvery well--in terms of being Y2K compliant; it is the broadcast news \nindustry, and particularly television. So when my colleague refers to \n``foreign policy by CNN,'' he is accurate, but one of the problems is \nthat CNN may have a problem--and I am sure they will respond very \nquickly. But I thought it was interesting when I went over this last \nevening detailing some of the industries identified as ones that have \nwork to do, and broadcast news was one that is lagging behind.\n  I also see our colleague from Oregon. Before he shares his thoughts, \nI want to thank him as well. He has been a tremendous asset to our \ncommittee. He has brought a wonderful perspective since he joined this \nbody, and comes from the public sector as well as the private sector. \nHe served in the legislature in his own State with great distinction, \nbut also he comes with a private sector perspective, which has been \ntremendously helpful throughout the hearings. And I thank him for his \nattention and for the time he has brought to this issue as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I join my friend from Connecticut in \nthanking the Senator from Oregon for his diligence on this committee. \nHe comes to the hearings and he contributes. He pays attention. He has \nblazed a way with the meetings he held in his home State. As I say, I \nwould encourage all other Senators to follow his example. I am happy to \nyield to him such time as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Thank you, Mr President. I thank Chairman \nBennett and Senator Dodd. It has been a great pleasure and a real \nprivilege for me to participate in this committee with them.\n  I can tell you that I sought membership on the committee when I heard \nabout its creation. I sought membership not because I am some computer \nwhiz--in fact, my kids are always trying to teach me new things we can \ndo with it--but, frankly, because I recognized that my State, as well \nas yours, is very much focused on the development of the high-tech \nindustry. Oregon has grown in high-technology in a remarkable fashion \nin the last decade. So I thought it would be important. I didn't \nrealize how important it would be until feeling my oats as a member of \nthis new committee.\n                                ____\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n  Last year, I held a town hall meeting in Medford, OR. We published \nnotice of it. Usually at a town hall you get 20 or 30 people to show up \nwho want to talk about some public policy. But we said it was going to \nbe about Y2K. There were over 1,000 people who came to that meeting. I \nrealized we were on to something here.\n  If any of my colleagues are listening to me at this time, I would say \nto them that no matter what State you are from, if you want to get the \nattention of the people you are trying to serve, call a Y2K town hall. \nYou will be amazed. And you will perform a great public service to the \npeople who are becoming aware of this, mindful of it, some afraid of \nit, some panicked by it.\n  What I have found in Oregon is that by going home to meet with my \nconstituents and saying, ``Look, don't panic, but begin to be \nprepared,'' has had a calming effect on my State. I thank these two \nleaders in the Senate, these men who led this committee, because when \nthey first began talking about this issue --and I know in the \nRepublican caucus Bob Bennett was sort of Chicken Little; he is Paul \nRevere now, and I honor him and salute him as that. I think, frankly, \nChris Dodd has done the same thing in the Democratic caucus. We all \nlook to them with renewed respect, and deserved respect, because they \nhave been the Paul Reveres for this country on this issue. It has been \na great pleasure to serve with them.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill that will allow the \ncommittee to continue to do its wonderful work. I was proud to vote \nthis morning for another bill that would allow the SBA to help small \nbusinesses become Y2K compliant.\n  Chairman Bennett asked me to focus my service on the committee on the \nwhole business industry. Having come from the private sector, I will \ntell you that businesses have a ways to go, but they are making great \nprogress, because the motive of the business man or woman is to make a \nprofit. I found that for a food processor, for example--whatever the \nGovernment standard was, it was an important standard. It was always \nthe floor and was never the ceiling. And when I wanted to sell frozen \npeas, I wasn't trying to sell it to the Government, I was trying to \nsell it to Campbell Soup, whose standard is much higher than those of \nthe Government.\n  So for me as a business person, when Y2K would come to my desk, I \nwould say, ``How does this affect my ability to sell my product and \nmake a profit?''\n  So I say to all business people, this could affect your ability to \nstay in business and make a profit. So if you are interested in a \nprofit, get interested in Y2K and figure out how it is that this \ncomputer glitch might affect either your energy supply, your financial \nservices, your transportation, and your ability to communicate with the \nworld. These things are all interconnected.\n  I never realized as fully as I do now as a member of the committee \njust how interconnected we are as a country, and now as an entire \nworld. I would predict, as others have, that our problems in this \ncountry will be theirs. This is real. But it will not be of a \nmillennial nature, like some fear. But in some parts of the world it \nmay well be. And a business man or woman is going to have to figure out \nhow to deal with an international trade world that is having to adjust \nto these Y2K problems.\n  I want to also say, to comfort the people out there, that the United \nStates is prospering right now relative to the rest of the world in a \nremarkable way, in part because during the 1980s and the 1990s American \nindustry began to retool. As we have retooled and restored our \nindustrial base, we have done so with Y2K-compliant equipment and \ncomputerization. This will all make the bump in this country much \nsmaller than it otherwise would be.\n  So there are lots of reasons for optimism. But there is still much \nwork to be done.\n  I am just pleased to participate with my colleagues today, and I know \nthat a vote is pending. So, Mr. President, without further delay, I \nencourage all of my colleagues to vote for this legislation. Today, I \nthink has become something of a Y2K Day, and it does a great service to \nour whole country to alert them to the real dangers and not the \nmirages.\n  In a hearing I recently held in my State, I heard a tragic story \nabout a gentleman who had listened to some literature that caused him \nto panic. He went out and took all of his savings from his personal \naccount, roughly $30,000. But somebody heard that he had done it and \nwent and robbed him of his life savings.\n  So don't panic; just simply be prepared. Find a reasonable level of \nstorage for food and water for your family, take some copies of your \nfinancial statements, check your own computers, but don't do things \nthat are unwarranted, because that will be something of a self-\nfulfilling prophecy. We are not here to be self-fulfilling prophets; we \nare here to be Paul Reveres, as Senator Bennett and Senator Dodd have \nshown us how to be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. I urge an ``aye'' \nvote on this bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back all time, \nboth for myself and Senator Dodd, and call for the yeas and nays on the \nunderlying question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to S. Res. 7, as \namended. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis absent attending a funeral of a family member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 92, nays 6, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 29 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--92\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--6\n\n     Allard\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Thomas\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n      Byrd\n     McCain\n       \n  The resolution (S.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to once \nagain express my appreciation to the leaders on the subject matter just \npassed overwhelmingly. The Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, and the \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, have done outstanding work.\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\n  I think they have served not only the Senate but the country well by \nhighlighting the problems in this area with Y2K, but doing it in a way \nthat does not cause undue alarm or panic. But it has been very helpful \nto Senators to hear what they have had to say, both in the closed \nsession and also here on the floor this afternoon. I believe they have \ncontributed mightily to the prospect of us dealing much more with the \nproblems adherent in this area and getting some results before we face \nthe turn of the century. So I commend them for their fine work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2071-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2084-S2088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to a motion to proceed to the education flexibility bill, S. 280, \nand there be 30 minutes under the control of Senator Wellstone tonight \nwith 3 hours 30 minutes under his control tomorrow and 30 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Jeffords, or his designee, and following the \nconclusion or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote \non the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object. I am just inquiring of \nthe leader--since this is the legislation, I would like to, as the \nranking member, make a brief opening statement, as we proceed to this \nmotion, for 10 minutes. I ask for 10 minutes tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. That probably would even be helpful if the Senator could do \nthat tonight.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. And then if it is agreeable----\n  Mr. LOTT. Do I need to modify, then, my unanimous consent request to \nthat effect? I don't believe I would. I will take care to make sure we \nget that 10 minutes designated in the balance of our request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. At the start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the motion to proceed \nto S. 280.\n  Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I need to just clarify a couple points \nbefore we begin this time. I further ask unanimous consent that before \nwe proceed to the time designated for Senator Wellstone that Senator \nKennedy have 10 minutes to make an opening statement as the manager of \nthe legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, in light of this consent, there will be no \nfurther votes this evening. The Senate will debate the motion to \nproceed to the education flexibility bill this evening.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle in working out this agreement. I know the Senator \nfrom Minnesota wishes to have some extended time to talk on this \nmatter, but we have worked it out in a way he will have his time to \ntalk, we will get the vote, and we can go on to debate the substance of \nthis very important, broadly bipartisan supported bill.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation in helping make this \narrangement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 10 minutes and the Senator from Minnesota will be recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I welcome the opportunity \nthat the Senate of the United States now in this early part of March \nwill be considering various education policy questions because I \nbelieve, like other Members of this body, that the issues of education \nare of central concern to families all over America. I firmly believe \nthat what families all over America are looking for is some form of \npartnership between the local community, the State, and the Federal \nGovernment, working in harmony to try to enhance the academic \nachievement and accomplishment for the young people in this country.\n  I think all of us are very much aware that enhancing education \nachievement is a complex issue, and therefore we have a variety of \ndifferent kinds of ideas about how best that can be achieved. I think \nall of us understand that the Federal role has been a limited role. It \nhas been a limited role in identifying where, as a matter of national \npolicy, we want to give focus and attention to children in this \ncountry. Historically, that has been the focus and attention in terms \nof the neediest, the disadvantaged children in this country.\n  There have been other areas. For example, those that have some \nspecial needs. We have also been helpful in providing help and \nassistance to schools in terms of nutrition programs, breakfast and \nlunch programs. There has been a program in terms of the bilingual, \nhelp and assistance in Goals 2000 under President Clinton to try and \nhelp and assist local communities to move ahead in terms of education \nreform, and a number of other very important areas.\n\n  Tomorrow we will begin the debate on education policy. The issue that \nis going to be before the Senate will be whether we are going to \nprovide additional kinds of flexibility to the States and the school \ndistricts in their use of a number of the Federal programs that reach \nout into the communities.\n  In 1994, we had reauthorization of the title 1 program. I joined in \nthe initiative with Senator Hatfield. It was his initiative in \nproviding a test program where we permitted a number of States to \neffectively waive the regulations on the title I programs with the \nassurance that the objective of the title I programs would be \nmaintained and that the resources could be targeted to needy children. \nWe have seen over a period of time a number of States take advantage of \nthis flexibility.\n  There have been other school districts which have had the opportunity \nto make application--some of them have, but not many. What is before \nthe Senate now is the consideration to effectively permit greater \nflexibility in the States and local communities for the using of title \nI funds. Ninety percent of the waivers that have been considered to \ndate have been on the title I programs. There are other programs that \ncan be waivers, but those have been the title I programs.\n  By and large, it is for reasons that have been best established \nwithin the local community. There have been waivers granted when they \nhave not been able to reach a 50-percent standard of poor and needy \nchildren. It might be 48 or 45 or in some instances 40-percent poverty \nchildren. Without that waiver, there would not be the kinds of \nadditional resources that would be available to that school to help and \nassist the needy children.\n  Now we are embarked on a more extensive kind of a consideration of a \nwaiver program. What I think we understand is if we are going to get \ninto providing additional waivers, we need to have important \naccountability about how these resources that are going to be expended \nare going to be used to help and assist the academic achievement of the \ntargeted group, which are the neediest children. Tomorrow we will have \nan opportunity to go over that particular issue with Senator Frist and \nothers after we have an opportunity to move toward the bill.\n  Mr. President, I think, quite frankly, I would have agreed that there \nis a certain logic in considering the waiver provisions when we \nreauthorize the total bill. I don't have an objection to the \nconsideration of this legislation. It may be a valuable tool in terms \nof a local community if we are going to be assured that these scarce \nresources that we have available that today are targeted on the \nneediest children, are going to go to the neediest children; that we \nare going to ensure that parents are going to be involved in any \ndecisions; that it is going to affect those children, and that we are \ngoing to maintain our content and performance standards which are out \nthere now so we can have some opportunity to be assured that those \nchildren are actually benefiting from any alteration or change from \nwhat has been the Federal policy; and that there will be ultimately the \njudgment of the Secretary of Education that if the measure is going to \nviolate the fundamental principle of the intent of the legislation, \nthen the power still retains within the Secretary of Education not to \npermit\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\nsuch a waiver to move ahead. That is basically the initial issue that \nwe will be debating.\n  We will also, I think, have an important opportunity to debate the \nPresident's proposal for smaller class size. That is something which is \nvery, very important. We made a downpayment with Republicans and \nDemocrats alike at the end of the last session to ensure additional \nschoolteachers in local school districts, and now the school districts \nthemselves are going to wonder whether that was really a one-time only \nor whether it will be as the President intended to be--a commitment \nover a period of some 6 years. The afterschool programs which have been \nsuch a success, which the President and Secretary Riley have talked \nabout--there will be initiatives, hopefully, in those areas. There are \nexcellent programs by Senator Bingaman in terms of school dropouts that \nhas been accepted in the past by this body; I hope we will be able to \ngive attention to that area.\n  There will be a limited but important group of amendments which we \nthink can be enormously helpful and valuable to our local communities \nin terms of being that kind of constructive partner in enhancing the \neducation for the children of this country.\n  So that is where we are going, and I welcome the chance to have that \ndebate over the period of these next several days. There are many \nthings that are important in this session, but this will be one of the \nmost important.\n  Finally, let me say I want to pay tribute to my friend and associate \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, who has very strong views in terms \nof making sure these resources are going to actually be targeted to the \nneediest children in this country. He has been an effective and \nforceful fighter for those children. I know he will speak for himself, \nbut he really questions whether any of these kinds of waivers can still \ngive the kinds of assurances, as we have them in the current \nlegislation, that will target those funds to the children. It is a \npowerful case that he makes--one that should be listened to by our \ncolleagues--and it is a very persuasive case that he makes. We have \ncome to a different conclusion, but I have enormous respect and \nfriendship for him.\n  I must say that our colleagues should listen to him carefully on the \npoints he is making, because I think he speaks for the neediest \nchildren in this country, as he has so often. It is a position that is \na respectable position and I think a very defensible position, and I \nthink it underlies the kind of central concerns many of us have if we \nfail to have the kind of accountability that hopefully will be included \nin the legislation. So I thank him for all of his work and for his \nconsistency in protecting the title I children. I hope that all of our \ncolleagues will pay close attention to what I know will be a very \nimportant statement.\n  I yield whatever time I have back, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank Senator \nKennedy for his very gracious remarks. There is nobody in the Senate \nthat I have more respect for, and I much appreciate what he had to say. \nI hope that we will, in fact, be in partnership on some critical \namendments. In fact, I know we will be in partnership on some critical \namendments that the Senate will be voting on.\n  Mr. President, I am debating this motion to proceed, and I am going \nto use a half hour tonight to kind of spell out or give an outline of \nwhere I am going to be heading, and then I will use 3\\1/2\\ hours \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, this is what I want to say on the floor of the Senate, \nand I hope that it is important. We have a piece of legislation that is \non the floor of the Senate and I wonder why. This bill is called the \nEd-Flex legislation, the Ed-Flex bill. But we never had a hearing in \nthe U.S. Senate--not one hearing in one committee, the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, on this bill. We never had an opportunity to \nlisten to different people who are down in the trenches working with \nchildren. We never had an opportunity to carefully evaluate the pluses \nand minuses. Yet, my Republican colleagues bring this bill to the \nfloor.\n  Secondly, it is absolutely true--and Senator Kennedy did an excellent \njob of summarizing this--that there are a number of States that have \nmoved forward. I voted for the legislation--and Senator Kennedy was a \ncoauthor of it--to give the States flexibility. I thought the agreement \nwas that we would then be able to see what States have done and \nthen reach a final judgment as to whether or not we wanted to pass such \na sweeping piece of legislation. I will talk about why I think it is \nsweeping, not in the positive but in the negative. As the General \nAccounting Office pointed out, we don't have any evaluation of what \nthese different States have done with this flexibility. Have they used \nthis Ed-Flex bill to dramatically improve the opportunities for poor \nchildren in their States or not? We don't know. Yet, this bill is now \non the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, I am opposed to this piece of legislation. It passed \n18-1 in committee, but I am opposed to this piece of legislation. I \nhope other colleagues will join me as this debate goes forward, for \nseveral reasons. First and foremost, I believe this legislation--just \ntaking this bill for what it is--is a retreat from a commitment that we \nmade as a nation in 1965 to poor children in America. We made this \ncommitment and had title I as a provision in the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act because we knew, unfortunately, that for all \ntoo many poor children and their families--you know, they are not the \nones with the clout--they were not receiving the educational assistance \nand support that they deserved; thus, the title I program. It is now \nabout $8 billion a year. I want to talk about the funding level of this \nprogram a little later on.\n  What this legislation does is it essentially turns the clock back 30 \nor 35 years. This legislation now says that we no longer, as a nation, \nas a Federal Government, will continue with this commitment. We will \ngive money to States and they will decide what they want to do.\n  I am all for flexibility. I just wonder, where is the accountability? \nAt the very minimum, in such a piece of legislation shouldn't there be \nclear language that points out that the basic core provisions of title \nI, which provide the protection for poor children in America, are \nfenced off and no State will be exempt from those provisions? That is \nto say that these children, low-income children, will have highly \nqualified teachers who will be working with them, that these low-income \nchildren will be held to high standards, that these low-income children \nwill have an opportunity to meet those standards, and that the poorest \ncommunities with the highest percentage of low-income children will \nhave first priority on the title I funding that is spent. All of that, \nwith the legislation that is before us, can be waived. No longer will \nwe have any of these standards.\n  So you have two issues. No. 1, you have the lack of accountability on \nthe very core provisions of title I that are so important in making \nsure that this is a program that works for poor children. No. 2, you \nhave a problem just in terms of dilution of funding.\n  One of the amendments I will have on the floor will say that this \ntitle I funding that goes to different States--that those schools with \n75 percent low-income students, or more, will have first priority in \nthat funding. The funding has to first go to those schools. Right now, \nwith this legislation, we have moved away from that. In 1994, when we \nwent through this, we had an amendment that said that schools with over \n75 percent low-income students had first priority for this funding. Now \nwe abandon that in this legislation. So, first of all, let me be \ncrystal clear about why I object to this. I object to this piece of \nlegislation because it represents an abandonment of a national \ncommitment to poor children in America, and, frankly, I am disappointed \nin my colleagues. I am disappointed in my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, but I am especially disappointed in my Democratic \ncolleagues. Where is our sense of justice? Whatever happened to our \nfight for poor children? How could we have let this legislation just \nmove forward and come right to the floor in its present form? Where is \nour voice? I don't understand it.\n  I am sorry if I sound--well, I am worried about sounding self-\nrighteous; I\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\ndon't want to, but I certainly feel strongly about this. I think the \nsilence of the Democrats is deafening on this question.\n  Now, second of all, Mr. President, I am going to take time tonight--I \nwon't take much time tonight, but I will have a lot of time tomorrow--\nto raise another question about this legislation. No wonder people in \nour country become cynical about politics because this Ed-Flex bill--\nsee, I understand the politics of it. It is hard to vote against it. It \nis called Ed-Flex, which is a great title.\n  Then we say get the money to the States, get the Federal Government \nout, it is politically--yes. I see how it works. But do you want to \nknow something? I don't want to let anybody --any Republican or any \nDemocrat--pass this legislation off as some great step forward in \nexpanding opportunities for children. It is not a great step forward \nfor children. It is a great leap backwards. It is a great leap \nbackwards because it is an abandonment of our commitment to poor \nchildren. It is an abandonment of our standard which should be met by \ntitle I programs for poor children. I will tell you something else; it \nis a great leap backwards, or a great leap sideways, because it doesn't \nrepresent what we should be doing for children in this country. \nTomorrow I will have an opportunity to outline some of the directions \nthat I am going to go in. But let me just raise a few questions.\n  When I am home, what most people in communities tell me that are down \nin the trenches working with children, and what most of the State \nlegislators tell me who are education legislators, is, ``Paul, the \nFederal Government is a real player in a number of different areas.'' \nTitle I is one, and another is early childhood development. Here is how \nyou can help us out pre-K. We have a White House conference on the \ndevelopment of the brain. We have all this literature that has come \nout. I have read a lot of it about the development of the brain. The \nfact is irrefutable and irreducible--that if we don't get it right for \nchildren by age 3, many of them will never be prepared for school. They \nwill come to kindergarten way behind and then they will fall further \nbehind and further behind and then they will wind up in prison.\n  But we don't have a piece of legislation out here on early childhood \ndevelopment. And, frankly, the President's budget is pathetic, much \nless the Republicans' proposing even less. I mean, in the President's \nbudget, I think maybe at best 20 percent of those low-income families \nthat would be eligible for assistance are going to be able to receive \nany. And what about middle-income? I cannot believe that we are \ncontinuing to play symbolic politics with children's lives.\n  If we were serious about a piece of legislation on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate that would really do something positive for children, then \nwe would be about the business of making sure that working families can \nafford the very best child care for their children. And we don't do \nthat. Instead, we get Ed-Flex, which won't do one additional positive \nthing that will help expand educational opportunities for children in \nthis country, especially among poor children of this country.\n  Mr. President, let me talk about another area that I think is really \nimportant.\n  Children's Defense Fund study this past year: Every day in America \nthree young people under age 25 die from HIV infection, 6 children \ncommit suicide; 13 children are homicide victims; 14 children are \nkilled by firearms; 81 babies die; 280 children arrested for violent \ncrime; 434 babies are born to mothers who have late or have no prenatal \ncare; 781 babies are born at low-birth weights; 1,403 babies are born \nto teen mothers; 1,087 babies are born without health insurance; 2,430 \nbabies are born into poverty; 2,756 children drop out of high school \nevery schoolday; 3,346 babies are born to unmarried mothers; 5,753 \nchildren are arrested; 8,470 children are reported abused or neglected; \n11.3 million children are without health insurance; and, 14.5 million \nchildren live in poverty.\n  Do we have a piece of legislation out here on the floor that deals \nwith the fact that one out of every four children under the age of 3 in \nAmerica are growing up poor? Do we have a piece of legislation that \ndeals with the reality that one out of every two children of color \nunder the age of 3 in America are growing up poor?\n  I was talking to about 350 principals in Minneapolis-St. Paul about 2 \nweeks ago. And they said to me, ``There is another issue, Paul.'' It is \nnot just that so many kids come to school way behind. Ed-Flex does \nnothing for those children. It is also that a lot of children come to \nschool emotionally scarred. These children have seen violence in their \nhomes. They have seen violence in their neighborhood. And they need a \nwhole lot of additional support.\n  Is there a piece of legislation out on the floor that calls for the \nFederal Government to get resources to local communities, then let them \nbe flexible, let them design the programs that can provide the support \nfor these children? No. Not at all. Instead we get Ed-Flex.\n  Mr. President, we have a program in this country called Head Start. \nIt does just what the title says it does. It is an attempt to give a \nhead start to children who come from impoverished backgrounds. I am \namazed at the men and women that are Head Start teachers. I am amazed \nat the men and women that are child care workers. Their work is so \nundervalued. They barely make above minimum wage. Do we have a piece of \nlegislation out here on the floor that provides more funding for Head \nStart? No. Mr. President, instead, we have a budget from the President \nthat essentially says that we will get the funding to one-half of the \neligible Head Start families and children at best. It is an \nembarrassment. It is an embarrassment. We have a program, a Head Start \nprogram, to provide a head start for children from impoverished \nbackgrounds. We know it makes a real difference, and we don't even \nprovide the funding for half of the children that could benefit. I \ndon't think that is pre-teen. I think that is just 4 and 5-year-olds, \nmuch less early Head Start.\n  Does Ed-Flex do anything about providing the support for children for \nthe Head Start program? No. Does it speak to early childhood \ndevelopment? No. Does it speak to afterschool care? No. My colleagues \nwill have amendments on the floor. And good for them. We will be \nsupporting them and speaking for them about smaller class sizes, about \nrebuilding crumbling schools, about involving parents, about giving \nchildren hope. All of that is important. Does this piece of legislation \ndeal with any of that? No.\n  Mr. President, I am going to present some jarring statistics that \ntranslate into personal terms tomorrow about the whole lack of equity \nfinancing in education. I will draw from my friend, Jonathan Kovol, who \nwrote ``Savage Inequality.'' It is incredible that some children in our \ncountry--probably not the children of Senators and Representatives--go \nto schools without adequate lab facilities, without enough textbooks, \nwithout proper heat, delapidated buildings. And they don't have the \nfinancing. They don't have the financing for computers. They don't have \nthe financing so students can be technologically literate. They don't \nhave the financing for the best teachers. There are huge disparities.\n  Does this piece of legislation called Ed-Flex do anything to deal \nwith the fact that we have such dramatic inequalities in access to good \neducation for children in America? Does this piece of legislation, Ed-\nFlex, say that since our economy is doing so well, surely today we can \nprovide a good educational opportunity for every child? No. It doesn't \ndo any of that. What it does is it turns the clock back.\n  I can't believe so many of my colleagues have caved into this. How \ncould we have let a bill come to the floor pretending to be a great \ninitiative to improve the education of our children when it doesn't, \nand, in addition, turns the clock back and takes the accountability and \ntakes some of the core requirements of title I, and no longer makes \nthat the law of the land, no longer says that we have a national \ncommitment, and essentially says to the States do what you want without \nany accountability? What do you think is going to happen to these \nchildren? Some States may be better. I hope it will be in Minnesota. I \nwill tell you what. I will make some of my colleagues angry in other \nStates. It will be worse. It will be worse.\n  That is why we have title I. That is why we have the IDEA program. We\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\nknow that unless you have a real commitment to children--IDEA is not \ncovered in this bill. But unless you have a real commitment to children \nwith disabilities, or low-income children, they are not going to get \nthe assistance or the support.\n  Let me now turn to the third argument I want to make tonight, and I \nwill develop this in much more detail tomorrow.\n  Here is the other thing that is so disingenuous about this Ed-Flex \nlegislation. We ought to have some direction--and I will try to have an \namendment that talks about this--for funding. We are spending $8 \nbillion a year, and that is about a third, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, of what we need to be spending if we \nare, in fact, going to reach all the children who are eligible for this \nhelp and all the schools that are eligible. And you know what. When I \nmet with the teachers, when I met with the principals, when I met with \nthe educators in my State of Minnesota, they could not identify one \nprovision in title I right now that needs to be changed in order for \nthem to have the flexibility to do their best for children. And when we \nget into the debate, I am going to ask my colleagues to list what \nexactly the provisions are that create the problem, that create the \nimpediment for the reform to do our best by these children. So far I \nhaven't heard of any. I haven't heard of one statute. I haven't seen \nany of my colleagues identify one statute.\n  I will tell you what the men and women who are involved in education \nand who care about children tell me about title I. ``Senator, we don't \nhave enough funding.'' That is what this is all about. We don't provide \nenough funding, and then it becomes a vicious zero sum game. So, for \nexample, if you are a school with over 50 percent low-income children, \nyou get some help for those children, but if you are under 50 percent, \neven though you have a lot of children, you don't get any funding at \nall. That is because we have such a limited amount of funding, and when \nwe divide it up in our school districts, we allocate it to the schools \nwith the highest percentage of poor children, but then many other \nschools with many poor children don't get any funding at all.\n  Let me give some examples. St. Paul. There are about 60 K-12 public \nschools in the St. Paul School District in Minnesota. There are 20 \nschools in St. Paul with at least 50 percent free and reduced lunch \nthat receive no title I funds at all. One-third of St. Paul schools \nhave significant poverty and receive no title I funds to help eliminate \nthe achievement or learning gap.\n  There it is right there. Where is the discussion of the funding? We \nare making Ed-Flex out to be some great thing for our school districts \nand our local communities and we are not providing the resources that \nare needed.\n  Example. Five senior high schools receive no title I funding. \nHumboldt Senior High has 68 percent of its students on free and reduced \nlunch, no title I. A school with a 68 percent low-income population \ndoesn't receive any title I funding because after we allocate it, there \nis so little that it goes to schools with an even higher percentage of \nlow-income students. There is nothing left.\n  Let's get honest and let's get real and let's talk about funding if \nwe want to make a difference.\n  Several middle schools receive no title I funding. Battle Creek \nMiddle School has 77 percent free and reduced lunch but receives no \ntitle I funds. Frost Lake Elementary School, 68 percent free and \nreduced but no title I. Eastern Heights Elementary School, 64 percent \nfree and reduced but no title I. Mississippi Magnet Elementary School, \n67 percent of the students are low income, no title I.\n  The St. Paul School District in Minnesota, if it had another $8 \nmillion, could reduce class size, it could increase parental \ninvolvement, it could have good community outreach, and it could hire \nadditional staff to work with the students who have the greatest need. \nBut we don't have the funding. And we have a bill out here called Ed-\nFlex that pretends to be some great, some significant commitment to \nchildren and to education in our country. Can't we do better than that?\n  Let me talk about Minneapolis, and this is just a draft of what \nMinneapolis is expecting on present course. Here is what Minneapolis is \ngoing to get with Ed-Flex but no additional funding. This is basically \nwhat is going to happen. Of the 87 K-12 schools in Minneapolis, 31 \nschools will receive no title I funds, 14 schools which have at least a \n50 percent low-income student population will receive no title I. That \nis unbelievable. Schools that have over 50 percent low-income student \npopulation do not receive any funding because there is not enough \nfunding. I don't hear any discussion in this Ed-Flex bill about funding \nor pointing us in the direction of additional funding.\n  Let me give some examples. Burroughs Elementary School, 43 percent \nfree and reduced, will receive no title I funding. Anthony Elementary \nSchool, 42 percent low-income, no title I funding. They would use the \nmoney for afterschool tutoring to improve math and science, to improve \ntechnology, to increase staffing and to improve parental involvement. \nMarcy Open Elementary School, 44 percent low-income, no title I \nfunding. The school is in danger of losing 10 educational assistants \nbecause the funding level doesn't keep up with the kids and what needs \nto be done. Kenny Elementary School, 39 percent low-income, no title I \nfunding. This school would use the additional resources, if they had \nthem, for additional tutors in small group instruction, to buy certain \ncomputer-assisted instruction, make the ``Read Naturally'' Program \navailable to more students, and focus on the students who are English \nlanguage learners. No funding. Dowling Urban Environmental Learning \nCenter, 45 percent free and reduced lunch, no title I, and they would \nuse this to help prevent students from becoming special ed students, do \nearly intervention to help students succeed.\n  Well, Mr. President, I don't know how much time I have remaining \ntonight. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Six minutes. Well, let me just kind of read from--I \nwill give plenty of examples tomorrow of great success, but I have just \na few comments from constituents of mine. Vicki Turner says:\n\n       The title I program of the Minneapolis public schools \n     provided not only help for my two children, but the parental \n     involvement program was crucial in helping me develop as an \n     individual parent and now as a teacher for the program.\n\n  Gretchen Carlson Collins, title I director, Hopkins School District, \nsaid:\n\n       There is no better program in education than title I of the \n     ESEA. We know it works.\n\n  John and Helen Matson say:\n\n       How can anyone question the need for a strong ESEA. Ed-Flex \n     waivers are an invitation to undermine the quality of public \n     school systems.\n\n  High school senior Tammie Jeanelle Joby was in title I in third \ngrade.\n\n       Title I has helped make me the hard-working student that I \n     am. My future plan after high school is to attend St. \n     Scholastica. I may specialize in special education or \n     kindergarten.\n\n  And the list goes on.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow I will develop each of these arguments. \nTonight, let me just kind of signal to my colleagues that I am debating \nthis motion to proceed, and I will have amendments and I will fight \nvery hard on this piece of legislation because this is a rush to \nrecklessness. Unfortunately, the recklessness has to do with the lives \nof children in America, specifically poor children in America. And I \nfind it hard to believe that we have a piece of legislation which will \nhave such a critical and crucial impact on the lack of quality of lives \nof children in our country that we brought this piece of legislation to \nthe floor of the Senate without even a hearing, and we brought this \npiece of legislation to the floor of the Senate without even seeing how \ndifferent Ed-Flex States, which are part of the demonstration projects, \nare doing right now.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to let my colleagues, Republicans or \nDemocrats, pretend that this piece of legislation represents some major \nstep forward for education for children in America. It does not. I \nthink at least some of my colleagues--Senator Kennedy spoke about \nthis--are going to have some amendments that I think really will make a \ndifference.\n  Second, I am going to make it as clear as I can tomorrow, and as \ncrystal clear as I can with amendments and with debate--and I am ready \nfor the debate--that in no way, shape or form is\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nit acceptable for the U.S. Senate to support a piece of legislation \nwhich essentially turns its back on or abandons our national commitment \nto poor children in America to make sure that the standards are met, \nthat there are good teachers, that the money goes to the neediest \nschools and the neediest children, that there are high standards, that \nthe schools are required to meet those standards, that we have some \nevidence of progress being made. The core requirements of title I must \nremain intact.\n  This piece of legislation on the floor right now does not require \nthis to be the case. This piece of legislation essentially removes \nthose core requirements and leaves up to the States what they want to \ndo. This piece of legislation essentially wipes away the requirement \nthat the money should go to the neediest schools first and allows \nStates to do what they want to do. That is not acceptable. That is an \nabandonment of our commitment to low-income children in America. I look \nforward to this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2084-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2088-S2090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the topic which I would like to speak \nabout during this brief time on the floor is one which is important to \nmillions of Americans and involves two of our most important and \nsuccessful programs: Social Security and Medicare.\n  They are so important to so many families that President Clinton has \nproposed that 77 percent of the surplus which we anticipate over the \nnext few years be invested in both of these programs so that they will \nbe available for future generations of Americans.\n  There are some who believe that the surplus, as it is generated, \nshould be spent instead and invested in tax cuts for Americans. Of \ncourse, any politician, any person in public life, proposing a tax cut \nis going to get a round of applause. People would like to pay less in \ntaxes, whether they are payroll taxes, income taxes, or whatever. But \nwe have to realize that a tax cut is instant gratification and what the \nPresident has proposed instead is that we invest the surplus in \nprograms with long-term benefits to not only current Americans but \nthose of us who hope in the years ahead to take advantage of them as \nwell.\n  We have to keep the security in Social Security and the promise of \ngood medical care in our Medicare Program. And I think we have to \nunderstand that just solving the problems of Social Security is not \nenough; income security goes hand in hand with health care security.\n  One of the proposals coming from some Republican leaders suggests \nthat there would be a tax cut. And as you can see from this chart, the \nRepublican investment in Medicare under this plan is zero, and the \nRepublican investment in tax cuts, $1.7 trillion.\n  Now, of course, that is quite a stark contrast. Instead of prudent \ninvestments, I am afraid that many of those who suggest tax cuts of \nthis magnitude are not really giving us the bread and butter that we \nreally need for these important programs like Social Security and \nMedicare. Instead, they are handing out these candy bar tax cuts. I do \nnot think that that is what America needs nor what we deserve. Let me \ntake a look at the tax cut as it would affect individual American \nfamilies.\n  There is a question that many of us have when we get into the topic \nof tax cuts, and that is the question of fairness, progressivity: Is \nthis tax cut really good for the average working family? One of the \nproposals which has been suggested by a Republican leader and \nRepublican candidate for President, who serves in the House of \nRepresentatives, is an across-the-board tax cut. Well, take a look at \nwhat this means for the families of average Americans.\n  For the lower 60 percent of wage earners in America, people making \n$38,000 or less, this Republican tax cut is worth $99 a year, about \n$8.25 a month--not even enough to pay the cable TV bill. But if you \nhappen to be in the top 1 percent of the earners, with an average \nincome of $833,000, your break is $20,697.\n  I listened over the weekend while one of our noted commentators, \nGeorge Will, who was born and educated in my home State of Illinois, \nsuggested: Well, of course, because people who make this much money pay \nso much more in taxes, they should get a larger tax cut.\n  We have been debating this for a while, but we really decided it \ndecades ago. In a progressive tax system, if you are wealthy, if you \nhave higher income, then in fact you will pay more in taxes. So I do \nnot think it is a revelation to suggest that people making almost a \nmillion dollars a year in income are going to end up paying more in \ntaxes. Well, the Republican tax cut plan, as it has been proposed, an \nacross-the-board tax cut, does very little for the average person, but \nof course is extremely generous to those in the highest income \ncategories.\n  Today in America, 38 million citizens rely on Medicare, including 1.6 \nmillion in my home State of Illinois. By the time my generation \nretires, this number will have increased substantially. With these \nincreasing numbers of Americans relying on Medicare, and advances in \nhealth care technology currently increasing costs, any way you look at \nit, you need more money for the Medicare Program, unless you intend to \ndo one of several things:\n\n  You can slash the benefits; you can change the program in terms of \nthe way it helps senior citizens; you can ask seniors and disabled \nAmericans who use Medicare, who are often on fixed incomes, to shoulder \nsubstantially higher costs; you can significantly reduce the payments \nto providers, the doctors and the hospitals; or you can increase \npayroll taxes by up to 18 percent for both workers and their employers.\n  A report that was released today by the Senate Budget Democrats lays \nout some of these harsh alternatives that would be necessary if the \nRepublicans refuse to make investments in the Medicare Program.\n  President Clinton says, take 15 percent of the surplus, put it in \nMedicare; it will not solve all the problems of Medicare, but it will \nbuy us 10 years to implement reforms in a gradual way. The Republicans, \ninstead, suggest no money out of the surplus for Medicare, and instead \nput it into tax cuts. I think that is a rather stark choice.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am so pleased that the Senator from Illinois has once \nmore come to the floor to discuss something so fundamental to our \ncountry. I think if you asked people in the country, ``What is good \nabout your national Government?'' yes, they would say a strong \nmilitary; they would also say Social Security and Medicare.\n  Has the Senator talked about the 1995 Government shutdown yet?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Go ahead.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask him a few questions and then let him finish \nhis remarks.\n  As the Senator was talking and showing this chart, it brought back to \nme the 1995 Government shutdown. We remember what that was about. \nEssentially, the President took a very firm stand in favor of Medicare, \nthe environment, and education, and against the kind of tax cuts for \nthe wealthy that would have meant devastating those programs. And the \nGovernment actually shut down over this. I am sure my friend remembers, \nit was a stunning thing. But it was really tax cuts for the wealthy, \ntaking it straight from Medicare.\n  Now what we have is a situation that is very similar. We know we have \nto fix Social Security. The Republicans have said they agree with that, \nbut they are silent on the issue of Medicare. They do nothing about \nshoring it up whatsoever. And yet they propose the same kind of tax \ncuts.\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\n  So I say to my friend, in 1995 Republicans essentially shut down the \nGovernment because they wanted these tax cuts at the expense of \nMedicare. And this year it looks like they are shutting down Medicare \nso they can go back to these tax cuts.\n  I wonder if he sensed, as I did, as we watched this budgetary debate \nunfold--if it did not bring back all these memories, and how he feels \nabout that, because it was a pretty tough time we went through and I do \nnot want to see those times repeated.\n  I ask my colleague to comment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course I remember that period of time. It was an \namazing period. I recall particularly the commentator, Rush Limbaugh, \nwho enjoys some notoriety across America. He said: You know, if they \nclosed down the Federal Government, no one would even notice. They were \nkind of goading us to go ahead and call the bluff of those who wanted \nto shut it down.\n\n  Well, in fact the Government was shut down when Congress failed to \npass the necessary bills to continue the funding of Government \nagencies. And across America people started noticing. I am sure the \nSenator from California--I was then a Congressman from Illinois--\nreceived phone calls from people saying, ``Wait a minute. You mean to \ntell me that these workers cannot go to work and they're going to be \npaid ultimately? You mean to say the services that we depend on, that \nGovernment needs to do, aren't going to be performed?'' And that is \nexactly what happened.\n  I think the American people were outraged over this, outraged that \nthe Government would shut down. If there were those on the other side \nwho believed that the American people would rally to their cause over \nthis Government shutdown and say, ``Oh, you've got it right, give tax \ncuts to wealthy people, and go ahead and cut Medicare and cut the \nenvironmental protection and cut education programs,'' that did not \nhappen.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if the Senator would share with us the chart \nthat he has there, because that goes back to 1995.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I am happy to.\n  Really, it is a good illustration of what happened. Back in 1995 with \nthe Government shutdown, this was a time when the Republican Party was \ncalling for tax cuts of $250 billion and was going to cut Medicare for \nthat to occur. And that is exactly what led to the President's veto of \ntheir bill and ultimately led to the shutdown of the Government.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend again, I appreciate his \nleadership on this. We did hold a press conference today, the \nDemocratic members of the Budget Committee, to call everyone's \nattention to this.\n  When you deal with a budget the size of this Federal budget, it has a \nlot of important things that we do. But this is one thing that we need \nto call attention to, the fact that if we are going to protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare, we are going to have to defer these tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest people, some of them earning millions of dollars, who \nwould get back tens of thousands of dollars, while the average person \nwould get back $99. As a result, we would see Medicare essentially shut \ndown as we know it, and we don't want to go through another Government \nshutdown of that nature. We don't want a Medicare shutdown; we don't \nwant an education shutdown. We want a budget that addresses these \nissues.\n\n  Again, I thank my colleague. He and I have known each other a long \ntime. We have both gone through the situation of aging parents \ntogether. We have talked many times about how important Medicare is. I \nwill never forget my friend and I being on the floor of the Senate when \nthere was a move to raise the eligible age for Medicare. He and I stood \nhere and fought. We said right now people are praying that they will \nturn 65 so they can get some health insurance, and then if we increase \nthat age when we should actually be reducing the age that people can \nget Medicare--we should allow the President's plan to go forward on \nthat as well, to allow people to buy in if they have no Medicare at 55, \n60, and 62. This was going to raise the age. We told the stories of our \nfamilies and how Medicare brought peace to our aging parents.\n  So we are, I think, going to stand shoulder to shoulder through to \nthe fight.\n  I want to again thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Of course, she raises a point near and dear to all of us. Some people \nthink Medicare is a program that seniors worry about. I think it is a \nprogram that their children worry about. They want to make sure that \ntheir mothers and fathers--grandparents in some instances--have the \nprotection of Medicare. It is hard to believe this program only dates \nback about 35 years. It is a program that has now become so essential, \nand it is a program that has worked.\n  As a result of the Medicare Program, people are living longer, the \nquality of health care for elderly people has improved. At the same \ntime, the Medicare Program has really democratized health care across \nAmerica. Hospitals, which once might have served the very elite \nclientele, now serve virtually everyone because they are part of the \nMedicare Program. I think that is a plus. I think that says a lot about \nour country.\n  I worry when I look at the alternative budget plans here because the \nDemocratic plan is very specific. It says if there is to be a surplus--\nand we think there will be--that this surplus should be used for \nspecific purposes: to save Social Security and to preserve Medicare. \nUnfortunately, on the other side, there is no mention of Medicare. The \nRepublican proposal doesn't talk about putting any of the surplus into \nMedicare.\n  That, I think, is shortsighted, because if you don't put the surplus, \na portion of it, into Medicare, it causes some terrible things to \noccur. For instance, to extend Medicare to 2020 without new investment, \nwithout the influx of capital which we are talking about in the \nsurplus, and without benefit cuts and payroll tax increases, we would \nneed to cut payments to providers by over 18 percent. That is a cut of \n$349 billion. For the average person, these figures, I am sure, swim \nthrough their head. They think, What can that mean?\n  What it means is your local hospital, your local doctor, the people \nwho are providing home health care for elderly people to stay in their \nhomes, would receive less in compensation. As they reduce their \ncompensation, many of them will not be able to make ends meet. I have \nseen it happen in Illinois already.\n  I have been somewhat critical of the Clinton administration. Some of \nthe changes they have made in home health care services, I think, are \nvery shortsighted. Many seniors, for example, would love to stay in \ntheir homes. That is where they feel safe and comfortable. They have \nthe furniture and the things they have collected through their lives \nand their neighbors who they know. They don't want to head off to some \nother place, a nursing home or convalescent home. They would much \nrather stay in their home. What do they need to stay there? Many times \njust a visit by a nurse, a stop by a doctor once in a while. Although \nthat seems extraordinary in this day and age, the alternative is a much \nmore expensive situation where someone finds himself in a nursing home \nwith extended and expensive care.\n  I hope that we realize that we made a mistake in 1995 when we had \nthis Republican tax cut of $250 billion at the expense of Medicare and \nthe Government was shut down. I hope we don't repeat it. We called the \nhospitals in our State of Illinois back in 1995 and asked what would \nthis mean to you, if, in fact, you lost some $270 billion in Medicare \nreimbursement; what would it mean? Most of the hospitals were reluctant \nto speak openly and publicly and on the record. They told us privately \nmany of them would have to close because many hospitals in my home \nState of Illinois and rural States like Kansas depend to a great extent \non Medicare and Medicaid to reimburse their services and to keep their \ndoors open. So, cutbacks can cost us the kinds of hospitals we need in \nareas that, frankly, are underserved medically.\n  Large cuts that might be envisioned without dedicating part of the \nsurplus could threaten many of these hospitals. When a hospital closes, \nit isn't just the seniors who are affected. The whole community \nsuffers. It is a situation in\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nmany of my rural towns and downstate Illinois where that emergency room \nis literally a matter of life or death. Farmers, miners and people who \nwork around their homes count on the availability of their services. \nWhen a hospital's financial security is put under significant strain, \nthey are forced to look for other sources of revenue. Cost shifting \nbecomes inevitable. So virtually every American would pay for Congress' \nfailure to invest in Medicare.\n\n  The second option, if we don't invest a portion of the surplus into \nMedicare, is one that would ask seniors and disabled to pay more for \ntheir own medical care. They would need to double their contributions \nto extend the solvency of Medicare to the year 2020 if the President's \nproposal of investing 15 percent of the surplus into Medicare is not \nmade.\n  Take a look at this chart to get an idea of what it means to a senior \ncitizen. This is a chart which shows the current amount that is being \npaid in part B premium of $1,262; then take a look, if we do not \ndedicate a part of the surplus, what the senior will have to pay \ninstead. Instead of $100 a month, it is over $200 a month.\n  Some might say it is not too much to go from $100 to $200. I think \nthey don't understand that many senior citizens live on fixed incomes, \nvery low incomes, and that this kind of premium increase in order to \ncontinue Medicare as they know it would cause a great hardship to many \nof their families.\n  Today, on average, seniors pay 19 percent of their income to purchase \nthe health care that they need. Medicare is currently only paying about \nhalf of their bills. These seniors living on fixed incomes are really \ngoing to face some sacrifice if this increase takes place. The medium \ntotal annual income of Americans over the age of 65 is a mere $16,000; \nfor seniors over 85, it is even less, $11,251; for the oldest and \nfrailest among us, such as those using home health services, the \naverage income is less than $9,000. Now, can someone making about $800 \na month, for example, see an increase in their Medicare premium from \n$100 to $200 without some personal sacrifice? I don't think so. \nMedicare as it is currently drawn up helps seniors to live with \ndignity. Medicare reform may involve tough choices but it shouldn't \ninvolve mean choices. This Medicare reform on the backs of seniors and \ndisabled, unfortunately, leads us to that.\n  Reform and investment are clearly needed to strengthen Medicare. \nThere are some who will say all you want to do is spend more money; you \nhave to do more fundamental things like reform. I don't disagree with \nthe concept of reform. I think it is part of the package. But the \nreality is, the Medicare Program has grown, the number of beneficiaries \nhas doubled since the program was enacted, and Americans are living \nlonger.\n  I think there is a fair argument to be made that one of the reasons \nthat Americans are living longer is because of Medicare and the access \nto health care that it provides. Before Medicare, less than 50 percent \nof retirees had health insurance. Now, virtually every one of them \ndoes. This is a question of priority. How much do we value increased \nlife expectancy? Are people in my generation who are working and \nactually contributing to the surplus--a surplus that we hope to soon \nhave--willing to put off a tax cut to make sure that Social Security \nand Medicare are there for decades? Are we willing to invest in what is \nbasically our own retirement health insurance program in the years to \ncome?\n  By not enacting a massive tax cut that benefits the most wealthy \nAmericas, but instead passing more limited tax cuts targeted to help \nworking families, we can, in fact, get a tax cut that is reasonable and \nconsistent with saving Social Security and Medicare. It seems very \nunwise to enact large tax cuts before we secure both of these important \nprograms.\n  Let me close by saying that this budget season is one that causes \nmany people's eyes to glaze over. I have served a combination now of \nabout 8\\1/2\\ years on Budget Committees in the House and the Senate. I \ndo my best to keep up with it. It is an arcane science to follow this \nbudget politics. But I have to say that it does reflect our values. We \nhave to decide what is important.\n\n  Last week, we had a bill on the floor here that was, on its face, a \nvery good proposal--a bill that would have increased military pay and \nretirement benefits. I believe that those things should happen. The \nPresident proposed it, the Republican Party and Democratic Party agree \non it. But the bill that came to the floor was significantly different \nthan the President's proposal. In fact, it spent about $17 billion more \nover 6 years than the President had proposed.\n  This bill came to the floor of the Senate without one committee \nhearing. Some came to the floor and said we need to do this so that men \nand women will stay in the military, and that we give them adequate pay \nand the reward of retirement. So they suggested we vote for the bill. I \ndidn't think it was a responsible thing to do. I can remember that, two \nyears ago, on the floor of the Senate we tied ourselves in knots over \namending the Constitution to provide for authority to the Federal \ncourts to force Congress to stop deficit spending. We had reached our \nlimits and we had said that the only thing that could control \ncongressional spending is a constitutional amendment and court \nauthority. Well, that constitutional amendment failed by one vote. But \nthat was only two years ago. We were so despondent over dealing with \ndeficits two years ago that we were at the precipice where we were \nabout to amend the Constitution and virtually say we have given up on \ncongressional responsibility in this area.\n  Well, here we are two years later, and the first bill we consider is \nnot a constitutional amendment about deficits, but rather one over \nspending this surplus on military pay raises that we cannot justify in \nterms of their sources. I have asked a variety of members and people in \nthe administration where would the extra money come from--the extra $17 \nbillion--for military pay raises. They say, ``Frankly, we don't know.'' \nI don't think that is a good way to start the 106th Congress, in terms \nof its substantive issues; but it is a reminder that we need a budget \nresolution that honestly looks at our budget to maintain not only a \nbalanced budget, but surpluses for years to come, and investment of \nthose surpluses in a way that we can say to future generations that, \nyes, we understood; we had a responsibility not only to the seniors, \nbut to the families and their grandchildren, to make sure that those \nprograms would survive.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that as this debate continues we can find \nsome common ground to work together to make sure that the surplus as it \nexists in the future is invested in programs of real meaning to \nAmerican families for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the last Congress passed the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act. it was not an easy process, and compromises were reached. \nIn the end, the debate resulted in a bill which made a good law. It \ncalls for a 3-year moratorium on new taxes. This was important, Mr. \nPresident. The Internet is not only a new tool of communication and \ninformation but is fast becoming the most vibrant new marketplace as \nAmerica goes into the next millennium. Having said that, I am aware of \nthe concerns expressed by those on main street as well as mayors--from \nGreenwood to Belzoni to Shuqualak, Mississippi--and in towns all across \nAmerica.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the distinguished Majority \nLeader's enthusiasm for the potential of electronic\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\ncommerce and his assessment of the role of the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nin the encouragement of that potential. I also appreciate the concerns \nhe referenced about the need for balance on the Advisory Commission on \nElectronic Commerce. The advisory panel can provide policymakers with \nvaluable perspective on many of the issues that must be resolved if the \npotential of electronic commerce is to be fully realized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that is correct. Congress did recognize that \nan examination of e-commerce was needed to fully understand the ripple \neffects of taxing access to or transactions conducted on the Internet. \nDuring Senate deliberations on the bill, my colleagues and I listened \nintently to varying viewpoints. Consequently, the statute created a \nnational Commission reflecting the stakeholders who would provide \nrecommendations to Congress. Mr. President, the balance required by the \nstatute has yet to be achieved. The Congressional leadership involved \nin the selection is taking another look at the current makeup of the \nmembership and considering options to resolve the impasse.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur with the Majority Leader. When \nCongress debated the Internet Tax Freedom Act, considerable attention \nwas paid to the section of the bill that delineated the membership of \nthe Advisory Commission. The legislation is very clear in specifying a \nbalanced makeup of this panel. While some adjustments have already been \nmade in an effort to achieve that goal, further discussion of the make \nup of the Commission and the requirements of the statute is clearly \nrequired.\n  As the Majority Leader knows, state and local governments have a lot \nat stake with respect to the deliberations of this Commission, and the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act anticipates their full participation on the \npanel. If we hope to reach consensus on a uniform taxation system that \nallows electronic commerce to flourish without eroding state and local \ntax bases, a balanced, representative Commission is in all parties' \nself-interest.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Internet has arrived, and it is \nworldwide. Let me share a few statistics. There are an estimated 66,000 \nnew users a day, e-commerce is growing at about 200% a year, web sites \nwent from 10,000 to 3.2 million in just 3 years. Congress needs the \nCommission's recommendations, and I look forward to reviewing them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2090-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

There are times, Mr. President, when every Senator, on one \noccasion or another, for one reason or another, feels the need to share \nwith his colleagues a moment of grief or happiness or sadness or hope.\n  This being a time like that for me, Mr. President, my purpose is to \nshare a few thoughts about a wonderfully gifted, beautiful, thoughtful \nlady named Hannah Covington McGee.\n  I suppose I should begin, Mr. President, by stating that Hannah \nmarried a young fellow named Jerry McGee 33 years ago. Dr. Jerry McGee \ntoday is president of Wingate University, a splendid Baptist \ninstitution in North Carolina. Jerry is the kind of friendly, caring \nand active husband and father with an enthusiasm for his responsibility \nas a top-flight educator--and his privilege of being Hannah's husband \nall those years.\n  Mr. President, Jerry and Hannah this past weekend were enjoying a \nsix-week sabbatical at Tortola Island, one of the British Virgin \nIslands. Their stay on Tortola had been, both said last week, the \nhappiest weeks of their lives. It all ended when Hannah was awakened \nSunday morning suffering an excruciating numbness which quickly \ndeveloped into the massive cerebral hemorrhage that claimed Hannah \nMcGee's life at such an early age.\n  Hannah grew up in Rockingham in North Carolina. At age 14 she caught \nthe eye of a star athlete at Richmond County Senior High School. She \nmarried that star athlete years later--- after both of them had \nfinished college. They immediately began together devoting their lives \nto young people.\n  A mutual friend asked Jerry about Hannah. Jerry's response was that \nHannah provided the kind of relationship that everyone dreams of; he \nconfirmed that he had been in love with Hannah since his high school \nfootball days when she was that 14-year-old girl with the ponytail.\n  Mr. President, services for that beautiful, loving and caring Hannah \nwill be held at the Wingate Baptist Church tomorrow very close to the \ncampus of Wingate University. She will be remembered as one who was \nforever and tirelessly doing things for others and, as Jerry McGee put \nit, ``It never once occurred to her that anybody ought to do anything \nfor her.''\n  Mr. President, I certainly know nothing more than anyone else about \nthe hereafter, or what will happen on that inevitable day for all of \nus. But I suspect that Saint Peter was standing at the Pearly Gate \nSunday motioning for Hannah to come in and take her seat on the right \nhand of God who loves her just as all of us who know her do.\n  Mr. President, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer this morning published a \ndetailed story, written by Wendy Goodman, praising Hannah McGee. I ask \nunanimous consent that Wendy Goodman's fine article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Charlotte (NC) Observer, Mar. 2, 1999]\n\n             Wingate President's Wife--and Much More--Dies\n\n                           (By Wendy Goodman)\n\n       Wingate.--When Wingate University celebrates the opening of \n     the George A. Batte Fine Arts Center later this year, a woman \n     who had a hand in making the center a reality won't be there.\n       Hannah McGee helped lead the fund-raising campaign and \n     decorate the new building's interior. An art lover, McGee \n     hoped Wingate would serve as a cultural center for Union \n     County.\n       McGee died Sunday morning in San Juan, Puerto Rico, of a \n     brain aneurysm. She was 54.\n       ``She had a great eye for things beautiful and artistic,'' \n     said friend Stelle Snyder. ``You could see her love for the \n     arts in her home, in her work at Wingate, in anything she \n     did.\n       ``Hannah had so many responsibilities behind the scenes, \n     and she loved her work.''\n       Monday, flags at Wingate University flew at half-staff in \n     honor of Hannah McGee. As the wife of Wingate President Jerry \n     McGee, she left a lasting impression on the university and \n     the entire community.\n       A Rockingham native, she moved to Wingate about 6\\1/2\\ \n     years ago when her husband was named president of the \n     university. But Hannah McGee was more than a president's \n     wife, friends said.\n       ``Hannah touched so many things in her own special way here \n     at Wingate,'' said friend Barbara Williamson. ``People never \n     even knew all the hard stuff Hannah did because it was all \n     behind the scenes.''\n       Hannah McGee helped launch English as a second language \n     program in Union County. As a board member of the Union \n     County Players, she made costumes and worked backstage for \n     several performances.\n       She played a major role in beautifying and restoring the \n     M.B. Dry Memorial Chapel at the school. She never hesitated \n     to open the doors to her home and entertain students, faculty \n     and other guests.\n       ``Bit by bit, we'll see Hannah's no longer with us,'' \n     Snyder said.\n       Jerry McGee had taken a three-month sabbatical leave from \n     the university in January to relax and spend more time with \n     his wife of 33 years. The McGees were childhood sweethearts, \n     and Jerry McGee often referred to\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\n     Hannah as ``the girl with the ponytail who stole my heart.''\n       The couple were in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands \n     when Hannah McGee got sick. She was flown to a San Juan \n     hospital and died Sunday morning.\n       ``She was the mother, wife, daughter and sister that \n     everyone dreams of--one of the easiest people to love who \n     ever lived,'' Jerry McGee said in a news release Monday.\n       Hannah McGee is survived by her husband and two adult sons, \n     Ryan and Sam.\n       Funeral services will be 11 a.m. Wednesday at Wingate \n     Baptist Church and burial will follow at Dockery Family \n     Center in Rockingham.

That was 65 of the 91 nominations received for the \n115 vacancies the federal judiciary experienced last year.\n  Together with the 36 judges confirmed in 1997, the total number of \narticle III federal judges confirmed during the last Congress was a 2-\nyear total of 101--the same total that was confirmed in one year when \nDemocrats made up the majority of the Senate in 1994. The 104th \nCongress (1995-96) had resulted in a 2-year total of only 75 judges \nbeing confirmed. By way of contrast, I note that during the last two \nyears of the Bush Administration, even including the presidential \nelection year of 1992, a Democratic Senate confirmed 124 federal \njudges.\n  As we begin this year there are 64 current judicial vacancies and \nseven more on the horizon. In 1983, at the beginning of the 98th \nCongress there were only 31 vacancies. Even after the creation of 85 \nnew judgeships in 1984, the number of vacancies had been reduced by a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate for a Republican President to only 41 \nat the start of the 101st Congress in 1989.\n  After the first Republican Senate in a decade, during the 104th \nCongress (1995-96), the number of unfilled judicial vacancies increased \nfor the first time in decades without the creation of any new \njudgeships. Vacancies went from 65 at the start of 1995, to 89 at the \nstart of the 105th Congress in 1997. That is an increase in judicial \nvacancies of 37 percent without a single new judgeship having been \nauthorized.\n  We made some progress last year when the Senate confirmed 65 judges. \nThat only got us back to the level of vacancies that existed in 1995. \nIf last year is to represent real progress and a change from the \ndestructive politics of the two preceding years in which the Republican \nSenate confirmed only 17 and 36 judges, we need to at least duplicate \nthose results again this year. The Senate needs to consider judicial \nnominations promptly and to confirm without additional delay the many \nfine men and women President Clinton is sending us.\n  We start this year already having received 19 judicial nominations. I \nam confident that many more are following in the days and weeks ahead. \nUnfortunately, past delays mean that 26 of the current vacancies, over \n40 percent, are already judicial emergency vacancies, having been empty \nfor more than 18 months. A dozen of the 19 nominations now pending had \nbeen received in years past. Ten are for judicial emergency vacancies. \nThe nomination of Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit dates back over three \nyears to January 1996. Judge Paez along with three others were reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate last Congress but \nwere never considered by the full Senate. I hope that the Senate will \nconfirm all these qualified nominees without further delay.\n  In addition to the 64 current vacancies and the seven we anticipate, \nthere is also the longstanding request by the Federal judiciary for \nadditional judges who are needed to hear the ever growing caseload in \nour Federal courts. In his 1998 Year-End Report of the Federal \nJudiciary, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted: ``The number of cases brought \nto the federal courts is one of the most serious problems facing them \ntoday.'' Criminal cases rose 15 percent in 1998, alone. Yet the \nRepublican Congress has for the past several years simply refused to \nconsider the authorization of the additional judges requested by the \nJudicial Conference.\n  In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed \njudicial resources by the Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a \nDemocratic majority in the Congress created judgeships during a \nRepublican presidential administration.\n  In 1997, the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that \nan additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. If \nCongress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S. 678, as it \nshould have, the Federal judiciary would have 115 vacancies today. That \nis the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that \nhave been ignored by the Congress over the past several years.\n  In order to understand the impact of judicial vacancies, we need only \nrecall that more and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies \nthat have been left vacant for longer periods of time. Last year the \nSenate adjourned with 15 nominations for judicial emergency vacancies \nleft pending without action. Ten of the nominations received already \nthis year are for judicial emergency vacancies.\n  In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focused on the \nproblem of ``too few judges and too much work.'' He noted the vacancy \ncrisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency vacancies \nand observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable \ntime for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.'' He \nwent on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm \nany particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it \nshould vote him up or vote him down.''\n  During the entire four years of the Bush Administration there were \nonly three judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for \nas long as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a \nyear. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more \nthan 9 months before a final favorably vote and 9 of those 10 extended \nover a year to a year and one-half. In 1998 another 10 confirmations \nextended over 9 months: Professor Fletcher's confirmation took 41 \nmonths--the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the \nUnited States--Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki \nMollway's confirmation took 30 months, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 \nmonths, Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Margaret \nMorrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's \nconfirmation took 15 months, Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 \nmonths, Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Victoria \nRoberts' confirmation took 11 months.\n\n  I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky \nnominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1996, \nthe Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of \ndays from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The \naverage rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the average number of days \nfrom nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and that \nwas during the first year of a presidential term. From initial \nnomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action \non the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the \nfirst time in our history. It was 212 days. Unfortunately, that time is \nstill growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the \nadministration of justice. Last year, in 1998, the Senate broke the \nrecord, again. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the \n65 judges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days.\n  At each step of the process, judicial nominations are being delayed \nand stalled. Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie L. White, Judge William \nJ. Hibbler and Timothy Dyk were each left on the Senate calendar \nwithout action when the Senate adjourned last October. Marsha Berzon, \nMatthew Kennelly and others were each denied a\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\nvote before the Judiciary Committee following a hearing. Helene N. \nWhite, Ronald M. Gould and Barry P. Goode, were among a total of 13 \njudicial nominees never accorded a hearing last year before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  At the conclusion of the debate on the nomination of Merrick Garland \nto the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as \n23 Republicans were preparing to vote against that exceptionally well-\nqualified nominee whose confirmation had been delayed 18 months, \nSenator Hatch said ``playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am \nsick of it.'' I agree with him. I look forward to a return to the days \nwhen judicial nominations are treated with the respect and attention \nthat they deserve.\n  It is my hope that we can start in the right spirit and move in the \nright direction by reporting out the nominations of Timothy Dyk to the \nFederal Circuit; Judge Richard Paez and Marsha L. Berzon to the Ninth \nCircuit; William J. Hibbler and Matthew F. Kennelly to the District \nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois; and Ronnie L. White to the \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. They have each \nalready had confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Four of the six have previously been reported favorably by \nthe Committee. The Senate should act to confirm these six nominees \nbefore the end of the month.\n  We should proceed to confirmation hearings for Helene N. White, \nRonald M. Gould, Barry P. Goode, Lynette Norton, Legrome D. Davis and \nVirginia Phillips. Each of these nominations has been before the \nCommittee for more than nine months already. It is time for us to \nproceed.\n  With the continued commitment of all Senators we can make real \nprogress this year. We can help fill the longstanding vacancies that \nare plaguing the Federal judiciary and provide the resources needed to \nthe administration of justice across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2092-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VETERANS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Mr. Jeffords in co-\nsponsoring the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act. This bill \nrequires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to create a demonstration program to allow Medicare-\neligible veterans to receive their treatment at VA treatment \nfacilities. This is a thoughtful approach to try to help our veterans, \nespecially our elderly veterans, receive all of their treatments in one \nplace. In the process, we hope to save money for the taxpayers and get \ngreater benefits for our treatment dollars.\n  This is a voluntary program to establish 10 regional sites nationwide \nto provide this new service. This bill calls out several criteria for \npotential sites: one must be near a closed military base, one must be \nin a predominantly rural area, and no new buildings must be built as \npart of this program. I'm especially interested in the potential for \nMontana to be the rural site. We currently have veterans traveling \nhundreds of miles for their VA treatments. By establishing some type of \njoint VA/Medicare program, we create opportunities to expand access and \nimprove continuity of medical care for Montana Veterans.\n  I'm encouraged by the awareness being raised in the VA recently for \nour State. The recent town meetings by the VA officials are just the \nbeginning. My presence there was intended to show the VA how serious we \ntake the necessity of improvement. We have to get better. My commitment \nthrough the coming months is to look for additional ways to ease \ncommunication between Montana Veterans and the Washington, D.C. \nestablishment. We also need to increase the opportunities for Veterans \nto hear more about the future plans for Veterans' health care. Again, \nI'll be working on both of these topics this spring.\n  We owe our veterans a debt of service for their sacrifices for our \ncountry. The program in this bill is a great opportunity for us to be \nfiscally responsible while improving the care and treatment of a group \nof honored citizens. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2093-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SPACE TRANSPORTATION LOAN GUARANTEES\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Mr. Breaux in co-\nsponsoring the Commercial Space Transportation Cost Reduction Act. This \nis a appropriate extension of programs that we have used to encourage \nother fledgling industries such as shipbuilding and rail. Through this \nlegislation, we hope to build a commercially competitive launch \nindustry here in America that brings the world's satellites to our \ndoorstep for launch into orbit.\n  This bill sets up loan guarantee programs; not grant handouts, but \nloan guarantees to help encourage commercial investment in start-up \nspace industries. We want to encourage anyone with an idea good enough \nto raise some start up funds to approach the financial market with some \nassurance that their request for business loans will be approved. By \nplacing $500 million in a NASA account in a guarantee program, we will \nleverage growth and investment to many times that. To encourage truly \ncompetitive ideas, we've placed a number of guidelines on this bill. We \nwill only guarantee a maximum of 80% of the capitol required for a \nspace vehicle construction project, the rest must be raised privately. \nTen to twenty percent of the pool is set aside for small businesses, \nand we've specifically excluded the DoD launch vehicle development \nprograms currently underway. There is a credit-worthiness requirement \nwith specific loan criteria for being eligible for the loan. Finally, \nit guarantees the U.S. Government the best price for any launch system \ndeveloped under this program. To make sure that no launch companies \nbecome dependent on this funding, we've provided for an expiration of \nthis program in 10 years.\n  I'm especially interested in the potential benefit to Montana. Many \nstart-up companies choose to locate in Western states where they have \nroom to actively test their ideas and inventions. When combined with \nVentureStar's interest in Montana, this loan guarantee program could \nhelp develop a space technology region in our state that would attract \nhigh-tech companies with high-tech jobs. Montana already has a lot to \noffer, and I'm convinced that this program is one more way to give \npotential businesses a reason to make Montana their headquarters.\n  As seen this past summer, launching rockets is a risky business even \nfor well-established companies. We need to find ways to encourage banks \nto qualitatively judge the overall risks and invest in creative new \nways to get satellites into orbit. By providing loan guarantees to \nqualified companies, we can grow our capable domestic launch program \ninto the world's choice for getting access to space. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2093-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2093-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 12\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 701 of the Civil Service Reform Act of \n1978 (Public Law 95-454; 5 U.S.C. 7104(e)), I am pleased to transmit \nthe Nineteenth Annual Report of the Federal Labor Relations Authority \nfor Fiscal Year 1997.\n  The report includes information on the cases heard and decisions \nrendered by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the General Counsel \nof the Authority, and the Federal Service Impasses Panel.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to enable America's schools to use their computer \nhardware to increase student achievement and prepare students for the \n21st century workplace; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n               the ``education for the 21st century act''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce ``E-21''--the \nEducation for the 21st Century Act.\n  The E-21 Act will help ensure that all middle school graduates attain \nbasic computer literacy skills that will prepare them for high school \nand beyond, and ultimately, for the 21st Century workplace. The E-21 \nAct will also allow all school districts to obtain and utilize the \nlatest high-quality educational software, free of charge.\n  Mr. President, the first piece of legislation I introduced in the \nSenate was to provide financial assistance to introduce computers into \nschools, to help students learn and expand their horizons. That was in \n1983. Back then, it was the exceptional school that even had a \ncomputer. It was an unusual teacher or student who knew how to use one.\n  That legislation was enacted into law. Along with other resources, it \nhelped bring computers into our schools as part of everyday learning.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I got my start in the \ncomputing business. Back then, computers filled large rooms and were so \nexpensive that only the largest corporations could afford their own \ncomputing centers. Today, even more powerful computers sit on a desktop \nin millions of homes, schools and businesses across the nation.\n  Mr. President, we've made great strides toward introducing computers \ninto schools, but too many of these computers are not being utilized to \ntheir potential due to lack of updated computer training for teachers.\n  Mr. President, a recent study by the Educational Testing Service \nconfirmed that computers do increase student achievement and improve a \nschool's learning climate. However--and this is critical--the study \nspecified that to achieve those results, teachers must be appropriately \ntrained and use effective educational software programs. Otherwise, \nthese computers become mere furniture in a classroom.\n  To boost student achievement through computers and technology, my \n``Education for the 21st Century Act'' will provide up to $30 million \nper year to train a team of teachers from every middle school in the \nnation in the most up-to-date computing technology. These Teacher \nTechnology leaders could then share their training with the rest of the \nfaculty in their schools, so all teachers are ready to pass these \nskills on to their students.\n  Mr. President, the E-21 Act will also create national educational \nsoftware competitions, open to high school and college students, to \nwork in partnership with university faculty and professional software \ndevelopers. The best of these software packages would be available \nfree-of-charge over the Internet through the Department of Education's \nweb page.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear to my colleagues that this \nemphasis on computer training is not at the expense of the fundamental, \nbasic skills that underlie education: reading, writing and arithmetic. \nIt's still important to master these traditional basics. But we should \nalso add a ``new basic'' to the list--computer literacy. Americans will \nneed those skills to compete in the 21st Century.\n  Mr. President, this proposal is part of President Clinton's FY 2000 \nBudget, and as Ranking Member of the Budget Committee and a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, I will work to see that it is funded for \nyears to come.\n  Mr. President, as a businessman who got his start at the beginning of \nthe computing age, I am proud to see the way our nation has led the \nworld in computer technology. I want to make sure that we continue to \nlead--through the second computer century--the 21st Century.\n  I therefore ask my colleagues to support ``E-21''--the Education for \nthe 21st Century Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Education for the 21st \n     Century (e-21) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to enable America's schools \n     to use their computer hardware to increase student \n     achievement and prepare students for the 21st century \n     workplace.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Establishing computer literacy for middle school \n     graduates will help ensure that students are receiving the \n     skills needed for advanced education and for securing \n     employment in the 21st century.\n       (2) Computer literacy skills, such as information \n     gathering, critical analysis and communication with the \n     latest technology, build upon the necessary basics of \n     reading, writing, mathematics, and other core subject areas.\n       (3) According to a study conducted by the Educational \n     Testing Service (ETS), eighth grade mathematics students \n     whose teachers used computers for simulations and \n     applications outperformed students whose teachers did not use \n     such educational technology.\n       (4) Although an ever increasing amount of schools are \n     obtaining the latest computer hardware, schools will not be \n     able to take advantage of the benefits of computer-based \n     learning unless teachers are effectively trained in the \n     latest educational software applications.\n       (5) The Educational Testing Service (ETS) study showed that \n     students whose teachers received training in computers \n     performed better than other students. The study also found \n     that schools that provide teachers with professional \n     development in computers enjoyed higher staff morale and \n     lower absenteeism rates.\n       (6) Some of the most exciting applications in educational \n     technology are being developed not only by commercial \n     software companies, but also by university faculty and \n     secondary school and college students.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Act to assist in \nthe restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today, I am introducing along with a \nnumber of my colleagues, a bill to continue and enhance the efforts to \nclean up the Chesapeake Bay. Joining me in sponsoring this bill are my \ncolleagues from Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, Senators \nMikulski, Warner, Robb, and Santorum.\n  Mr. President, the Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the \nUnited States and the key to the ecological and economic health of the \nmid-Atlantic region. The Bay, in fact, is one of the world's great \nnatural resources. We tend to take it for granted because it is right \nhere at hand, so to speak, and I know many Members of this body have \nenjoyed the Chesapeake Bay. The Bay provides thousands of jobs for the \npeople in this region and is an important component in the national \neconomy. The Bay is a major commercial waterway and shipping center for \nthe region and for much of the eastern United States. It supports a \nworld-class fishery that produces a significant portion of the \ncountry's fin fish and shellfish catch. The Bay and its waters also \nmaintain an enormous tourism and recreation industry.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is a complex system. It draws its life-sustaining \nwaters from a watershed that covers more than 64,000 square miles and \nparts of six states. The Bay's relationship to the people, industries, \nand communities in those six states and beyond is also complex and \nmultifaceted.\n  I could continue talking about these aspects of the Bay, but my \nfellow Senators are aware of the Bay's importance and have consistently \nregarded the protection and enhancement of the quality of the \nChesapeake Bay as an important national objective.\n  Through the concerted efforts of public and private organizations, we \nhave learned to understand the complexities of the Bay and we have \nlearned what it takes to maintain the system that sustains us. The \nChesapeake Bay Program is an extraordinary example of how local, State, \nregional, and Federal agencies can work with citizens and private \norganizations to manage complicated, vital, natural resources. Indeed, \nthe Chesapeake Bay Program serves as a model across the country and \naround the world.\n  When the Bay began to experience serious unprecedented declines in \nwater quality and living resources in the 1970s, the people in my state \nsuffered. We lost thousands of jobs in the fishing industry. We lost \nmuch of the wilderness that defined the watershed. We began to \nappreciate for the first time the profound impact that human activity \ncould have on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. We began to recognize that \nuntreated sewage, deforestation, toxic chemicals, agricultural runoff, \nand increased development were causing a degradation of water quality, \nthe loss of wildlife, and elimination of vital habitat. We also began \nto recognize that these negative impacts were only part of a cycle that \ncould eventually impact other economic and human health interests.\n\n  Fortunately, over the last two decades we have come to understand \nthat humans can also have a positive effect on the environment. We have \nlearned that we can, if we are committed, help repair natural systems \nso that they continue to provide economic opportunities and enhance the \nquality of life for future generations.\n  We now treat sewage before it enters our waters. We banned toxic \nchemicals that were killing wildlife. We have initiated programs to \nreduce nonpoint source pollution, and we have taken aggressive steps to \nrestore depleted fisheries.\n  The States of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania deserve much of \nthe credit for undertaking many of the actions that have put the Bay \nand its watershed on the road to recovery. All three States have had \nmajor cleanup programs. They have made significant commitments in terms \nof resources. It is an important priority item on the agendas of the \nBay States. Governors have been strongly committed, as have State \nlegislatures and the public. There are a number of private \norganizations--the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, for example--which do \nextraordinary good work in this area.\n  But there has been invaluable involvement by the Federal Government \nas well. The cooperation and attention of Federal agencies has been \nessential. Without the Federal Clean Water Act, the Federal ban on DDT, \nand EPA's watershed-wide coordination of Chesapeake Bay restoration and \ncleanup activities, we would not have been able to bring about the \nconcerted effort, the real partnership, that is succeeding improving \nthe water quality of the Bay and is succeeding in bringing back many of \nthe fish and wildlife species.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is getting cleaner, but we cannot afford to be \ncomplacent. There are still tremendous stresses on the Bay. This is a \nfast-growing area of the country, with an ever increasing population, \ndevelopment, and continuous changes in land use.\n  We need to remain vigilant in continuing to address the needs of the \nBay restoration effort. The hard work, investment, and commitment, at \nall levels, which has brought gains over the last three decades, must \nnot be allowed to lapse or falter.\n  The measure I am introducing today reauthorizes the Bay program and \nbuilds upon the Federal Government's past role in the Chesapeake Bay \nProgram and the highly successful Federal-State-local partnership to \nwhich I made reference. The bill also establishes simple agency \ndisclosure and budget coordination mechanisms to help ensure that \ninformation about Federal Bay-related grants and projects are readily \navailable to the scientific community and the public.\n  As I mentioned before, the Chesapeake Bay Program is a model of \nefficient and effective coordination. Still, there is always room for \nimprovement as experience informs and enlightens our judgments. While \ncoordination between the various levels of government has been \nexemplary, coordination among Federal agencies can be strengthened. \nThis legislation begins to develop a better coordination mechanism to \nhelp ensure that all Federal agency programs are accounted for.\n  In addition, this bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency \nto establish a ``Small Watershed Grants Program'' for the Chesapeake \nBay region. These grants will help organizations and local governments \nlaunch a variety of locally-designed and locally-implemented projects \nto restore relatively small pieces of the larger Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. By empowering local agencies and community groups to \nidentify and solve local problems, this grant program will promote \nstewardship across the region and improve the whole by strengthening \nthe parts.\n  This bill was carefully crafted with the advise, counsel, and \nassistance of many hard working organizations in the Chesapeake Bay \nregion, including the Chesapeake Bay Commission, the Chesapeake Bay \nFoundation, The Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay and various offices \nwithin the state governments of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is the hope of the cosponsors that this bill will \nultimately be incorporated into a larger piece of legislation that is \ndue to be reauthorized or considered this year. However, if such \nlegislation is not considered or should become stalled in the \nlegislative process--the larger legislation covers a wide range of \nissues--it is our intention to try to move forward with this \nlegislation separately.\n  The Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort has been a major bipartisan \nundertaking in this body. It has consistently, over the years, been \nstrongly supported by virtually all members of the Senate. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this legislation and \ncontributing to the improvement and the enhancement of one of our \nNation's most valuable and treasued natural resources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill, a section-by-section analysis, and letters of support of the bill \nbe inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Paul: Thank you for your continuing to support \n     environmental initiatives that benefit Maryland citizens. You \n     have long been a champion of our great Chesapeake Bay, and an \n     outstanding advocate for the protection and restoration of \n     all our State's natural treasures. Your current proposed \n     legislation to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n     to assist in restoration of the Chesapeake Bay is just \n     another example of how you have been able to translate your \n     concern into action. The work you have facilitated through \n     the Chesapeake Bay Program has been an outstanding example of \n     interstate cooperation and progressive environmental programs \n     that have been invaluable to Maryland and Bay restoration.\n       If we are to be successful in the next century, we must \n     look ahead and be ready to face new challenges as well as \n     continue to meet the old ones. Your proposed legislation \n     embodies that vision and therefore has my full support. Its \n     content demonstrates your understanding of the needs of \n     Maryland and the other states in the watershed. It also \n     recognizes the critical role played by local governments and \n     citizen groups. The legislation clearly moves the Bay cleanup \n     in the direction needed. In addition to my personal support, \n     the bill has been reviewed by the Maryland Bay Cabinet and \n     received its endorsement as well. We are all eager to see the \n     legislation move forward and would be happy to assist you.\n       Thank you again for taking this initiative. Should you \n     require our assistance, you may contact John Griffin, \n     Secretary, Department of Natural Resources at (410) 260-8101.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Parris N. Glendening,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Commonwealth of Virginia\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                February 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Commonwealth of Virginia \n     supports the language of the proposed Chesapeake Bay \n     Restoration Act, as shown in the attached copy dated February \n     8, 1999.\n       The cooperative Chesapeake Bay Program has been and will \n     continue to be essential to the restoration of the Chesapeake \n     Bay system. Reauthorization will strengthen an already \n     successful Program and help support an increased level of \n     effort.\n       The proposed increase in Federal support is already more \n     than matched by state monies put into the recently created \n     Virginia Water Quality Improvement Fund. Since its creation \n     in 1997 the Virginia General Assembly approves Governor \n     Gilmore's current legislative initiative, it will appropriate \n     an additional $45.15 million for 1999.\n       We thank you for being the sponsor of this bill, and we \n     will assist in whatever way is appropriate to help ensure its \n     passage by Congress.\n           Very truly yours,\n     John Paul Woodley, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Citizens Advisory Committee to\n\n\n                             the Chesapeake Executive Council,\n\n                                                February 22, 1999.\n     Senator Paul Sarbanes,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the Citizens Advisory \n     Committee to the Chesapeake Executive Council (CAC), I would \n     like to express our appreciation for your leadership in \n     developing the draft Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act. \n     Provisions such as those embodied in this proposed \n     legislation are vital to building upon one of the most \n     successful partnerships ever assembled, involving every level \n     of government and the private sector, to restore the health \n     of an entire ecosystem.\n       The Citizens Advisory Committee was created by the \n     Chesapeake Executive Council to represent residents and \n     stakeholders of the Chesapeake Bay watershed in the Bay \n     restoration efforts. By serving as a link with stakeholder \n     communities in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the \n     District of Columbia, CAC provides a non-governmental \n     perspective on the Bay cleanup effort and on how Bay Program \n     policies affect citizens who live and work in the Chesapeake \n     Bay watershed.\n       The successes of the past twelve years in restoring the \n     health of the Bay are a direct result of hard work, funding, \n     and the dedicated commitment of the partners. Each and every \n     one of these factors is essential to continue fulfilling the \n     long-term restoration goals, particularly as the Bay Program \n     partners embrace a renewed Bay agreement in the next year. \n     Reauthorization and enhancement of Bay Program legislation \n     will signal to the states, local governments and citizens \n     that the Congress and the federal government will continue to \n     be a strong partner with them as they renew their commitment \n     to these goals and to a cleaner, healthier Chesapeake Bay. I \n     am particularly encouraged by the provisions to continue the \n     Small Watershed Grant program which provides a mechanism for \n     local groups and governments to take an active, hands-on role \n     in the Bay restoration activities.\n       The members of CAC look forward to working with you and the \n     other members of Congressional delegations from the Bay \n     Program jurisdictions toward successful passage of this \n     legislation. Again, thank you for your leadership. Please \n     feel free to call upon CAC if there is any assistance that we \n     can provide.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Andrew J. Loftus,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Commission,\n\n                                 Annapolis, MD, February 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing, in my new capacity as \n     Chairman of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, to commend you for \n     your endeavors to reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Program \n     through the introduction of the Chesapeake Bay Restoration \n     Act of 1999. The Commission strongly supports this \n     legislation. We commit to you our resources and expertise in \n     working to secure its passage.\n       We believe that the cooperation of government at the \n     federal, state and local level is, and will continue to be, \n     essential to protecting and restoring the Bay. Your bill \n     helps to establish the blueprint and financial support for \n     that collaboration.\n       We strongly support the small watershed provisions of the \n     bill. The health of the Bay depends on the cumulative effect \n     of thousands of daily decisions that either compromise or \n     improve water quality in our subwatersheds. Offering \n     community groups financial support and direct access to the \n     tremendous informational resources of the Chesapeake Bay \n     Program can only help them to make environmentally-sound \n     decisions.\n       We would also like to commend you for pursuing improved \n     coordination of federal agency budgets. One of the great \n     hallmarks of the Program is EPA's close coordination with the \n     states in its expenditure of Bay Program monies. The Act \n     calls for each federal agency with projects related to the \n     Chesapeake Bay ecosystem to submit a plan detailing how the \n     expenditure of these funds will proceed. This enhanced \n     communication can only help to avoid unnecessary duplication \n     and cultivate cooperation among our federal partners.\n       Finally, we are encouraged by your inclusion of a special \n     study to better relate the health of our living resources to \n     water quality improvements. Establishing better linkages will \n     improve the public's support of restoration efforts.\n       Again and again you have proven yourself to be a tremendous \n     leader for the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort. We hope \n     that this legislation, with your support, will be enacted by \n     the 106th Congress.\n       With gratitude, I remain\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Arthur D. Hershey,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Chesapeake Bay Local\n\n\n                                Government Advisory Committee,\n\n                                    Easton, MD, February 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Chesapeake Bay Local Government \n     Advisory Committee supports all efforts to sustain and \n     enhance Chesapeake Bay Program activities through renewal of \n     Federal legislation in the ``Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act \n     of 1999.''\n       To date, the Chesapeake Bay Program has made great strides \n     in solidifying multijurisdictional efforts to improve the \n     condition of watershed resources in and around the Bay. It \n     has magnified the importance of continued efforts to enhance \n     water quality and to restore the living resources native to \n     the Bay. The Chesapeake Bay Program has elevated the role and \n     importance of local governments participating not only in the \n     Bay Program, but in completing watershed restoration projects \n     in their own jurisdiction.\n       On behalf of the Chesapeake Bay Local Government Advisory \n     Committee, I thank you for your continuing leadership and \n     commitment to the Bay Restoration effort. If there is any way \n     that the Committee or its staff can assist you, please don't \n     hesitate to call.\n       Sincerely,\n     Russ Pettyjohn,\n       Chairman, Chesapeake Bay Local Government Advisory \n     Committee.\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\n     Lititz Borough,\n       Mayor, Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay,\n\n                                                February 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the board of directors \n     of the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, I am writing to you \n     to express our support for your efforts to draft new \n     legislation to reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n       Your leadership has been vital over the years in keeping \n     congressional attention focused on the work being conducted \n     in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania to restore the Bay. \n     There is ample evidence that the unique collaborative effort \n     which was formalized in the 1987 amendment to the Clean Water \n     Act is producing positive results for the Bay. It is also \n     apparent that there is much left to do. The bill you have \n     drafted adds some significant features to the Bay Program; \n     the increase in the authorization level to $30 million will \n     substantially enhance the ability of the Bay partners to meet \n     the needs of the Bay in the next decade.\n       We are conveying our support for the reauthorization of the \n     Bay Program to other members of Congress from the Bay states \n     in the hope that all will join as co-sponsors.\n       Again, thank you for your vigilance and your vision with \n     regard to the Bay.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                 John T. Kauffman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Foundation,\n\n                                                    March 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to express the \n     Chesapeake Bay Foundation's support for the Chesapeake Bay \n     Restoration Act of 1999. Although I realize that no single \n     piece of legislation can save the Chesapeake Bay, I believe \n     this bill will help push the Bay Program towards an increased \n     effort to carrying out the commitments made by the \n     signatories.\n       I am particularly glad to see the section enhancing the \n     oversight and reporting responsibilities of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency. CBF has long felt that it is important for \n     the Environmental Protection Agency to take a stronger \n     leadership role in assuring that the participants are held \n     accountable for their commitments.\n       I am also enthusiastic about the provisions providing for a \n     small watershed grant program. Restoration of the Bay's \n     essential habitat--its forests, wetlands, oysters, and \n     underwater grass beds--is a critical component of the effort \n     to save the Bay, and this legislation should help move that \n     effort forward.\n       In summary, this legislation provides a step forward for \n     the Bay Program, and will help steer it in the right \n     direction. I would like to thank you and your cosponsors for \n     your efforts on behalf of this legislation and on behalf of \n     the Chesapeake Bay.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 William C. Baker,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 493. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army, acting through \nthe Chief of Engineers, to evaluate, develop, and implement pilot \nprojects in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina to address problems \nassociated with toxic microorganisms in tidal and non-tidal wetlands \nand waters; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n            TOXIC MICROORGANISMS ABATEMENT PILOT PROJECT ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last Thursday's Baltimore Sun reported \nthat Pfiesteria, a sometimes toxic microorganism, has been found in \nfive more Maryland rivers. The article explained that new research is \nproving what scientists have suspected since serious outbreaks of toxic \nPfiesteria first occurred in 1997--namely that Pfiesteria exists in a \nwide area. While the organism isn't always toxic, the fact that it has \nbeen found in a wide area coupled with the fact that it has proved \ninjurious in the past, strongly supports the assertion that Pfiesteria \nposes a potential threat to the economic well-being of thousands of \nbusinesses in the fishing, recreation, and tourism industries along the \neast coast.\n  In 1997, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina suffered from several \nseparate incidents that involved fish behaving in an erratic manner, a \nlarge number of fish with lesions, and fish kills. State and outside \nscientists concluded that Pfiesteria was the most likely cause of the \nproblem. In Maryland, the fishing industry alone, lost millions of \ndollars in revenue.\n  In 1998, the magnitude of reported Pfiesteria outbreaks was \nconsiderably less, however, we cannot become complacent. The report in \nthe Baltimore Sun confirms that the 1997 Pfiesteria outbreaks may not \nhave been a one-time phenomenon. We must begin to safeguard the \neconomy, both regional and national, from the impacts of Pfiesteria.\n  Today, I am joined by my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, \nand my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Edwards in introducing a \nbill, entitled the Toxic Microorganism Abatement Pilot Project Act, \nwhich would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to begin developing \ntools and techniques to abate the flow of nutrients into our waters and \nthereby prevent or at least minimize the effects of future toxic \nPfiesteria outbreaks.\n  In 1997, the Administration directed that an interagency research and \nmonitoring strategy be developed in response to the outbreaks of \nPfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay. Several Federal agencies participated \nin the development of this strategy including the National \nOceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA), the Centers for Disease Control, and the \nDepartments of Interior and Agriculture. Funding to implement the plan \nwas included in the fiscal 1998 and 1999 budgets. Unfortunately, the \nkey federal agency with expertise in habitat maintenance, water \nresources and engineering principles--the Army Corps of Engineers--was \nnot included in the interagency task force and the agency's unique \nqualifications were not integrated into the strategic plan. While \nresearch into the exact causes of toxic Pfiesteria blooms is \nimperative, it is just as important that we take early, aggressive, and \nconcrete steps to prevent such blooms if we can.\n  This bill is designed to ensure that all available expertise is \nbrought to bear in combating these biotoxins. The legislation would \nauthorize the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct an evaluation and to \nengage in pilot projects to develop tools and techniques for combating \nPfiesteria and other toxic microorganisms. At the end of each pilot \nproject, the Army Corps of Engineers will be required to submit a \nreport to Congress that describes the project, its success, and the \ngeneral applicability of the methods used in the project.\n  Because of its expertise in construction and watershed management, \nthe Army Corps of Engineers has a vital role to play in responding to \nthe threats posed by toxic microorganisms. This legislation provides \nthe funding and authority for the agency to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a copy of the \nBaltimore Sun article be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Toxic Microorganism \n     Abatement Pilot Project Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) effective protection of tidal and nontidal wetlands and \n     waters of the United States is essential to sustain and \n     protect ecosystems, as well as recreational, subsistence, and \n     economic activities dependent on those ecosystems;\n       (2) the effects of increasing occurrences of toxic \n     microorganism outbreaks can adversely affect those ecosystems \n     and their dependent activities;\n       (3) the Corps of Engineers is uniquely qualified to develop \n     and implement engineering solutions to abate the flow of \n     nutrients;\n       (4) because nutrient flow abatement is a new challenge, it \n     is desirable to have the Corps of Engineers conduct a series \n     of pilot projects to test technologies and refine techniques \n     appropriate to nutrient flow abatement; and\n       (5) since the States of Maryland, North Carolina, and \n     Virginia have recently experienced serious outbreaks of \n     waterborne microorganisms and there is a large store of \n     scientific data about outbreaks in those States, pilot \n     projects in those States can be effectively evaluated.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Rivers--Presence Widespread in Rivers, \n                     Streams But Not Always Harmful\n\n\n                       no ``one-time phenomenon''\n\n     toxic microorganism detected for first time in Ocean City area\n\n                           (By Heather Dewar)\n\n       New research is proving what scientists long suspected: \n     that the toxic microorganism Pfiesteria piscicida lives in \n     many Maryland rivers and streams, even though it doesn't \n     always kill fish or make people sick.\n       Pfiesteria expert Dr. JoAnn Burkholder has found the \n     dangerous dinoflagellates in samples taken from the bottom \n     muck of five Maryland waterways, including two where it had \n     not been found before. One of those waterways, the St. Martin \n     River, flows into the state's coastal bays west of Ocean \n     City.\n       It was the first time the toxic microorganism had turned up \n     in a river that flows toward the Atlantic Coast tourist \n     mecca, though it has not caused any known fish kills or human \n     illnesses there, said David Goshorn of the Maryland \n     Department of Natural Resources.\n       ``We have suspected all along that Pfiesteria is pretty \n     widespread,'' Goshorn said, ``and what she has done is to \n     confirm our suspicion.''\n       A spokesman for the Maryland Coastal Bays Program said the \n     finding of Pfiesteria cells in local waters was ``not \n     surprising, but it is worrisome at the very least.''\n       ``My guess is that Pfiesteria being there, as long as it \n     isn't toxic in the real world, is not that harmful,'' said \n     Dave Wilson Jr., a spokesman for the coastal bays \n     conservation effort. ``Hopefully, people will understand that \n     Pfiesteria is not running rampant in the coastal bays, but it \n     does have the potential to do so.''\n       The aquatic organism has been found in coastal waters from \n     New Jersey to Georgia, but it causes fish kills or human \n     illnesses only when conditions are just right or just wrong, \n     Burkholder said.\n       Pfiesteria ``is probably all over the bay,'' said \n     Burkholder, who presented preliminary findings to Maryland \n     officials at a two-day scientific meeting of Pfiesteria \n     experts near Baltimore-Washington International Airport \n     yesterday. ``It's just that most of the time it's going to be \n     pretty benign.''\n\n\n                          weather as a factor\n\n       Experts say Pfiesteria seems most likely to multiply, \n     attack fish and sicken people in warm, shallow, still waters \n     that are a mix of fresh and salt, are rich in nutrients--like \n     the pollutants that come from human sewage, animal manure or \n     farm fertilizer--and also rich in fish, especially oily fish \n     like menhaden. Weather also plays a role, but scientists \n     aren't certain what it is.\n       Maryland experts think unusual weather patterns, combined \n     with high nutrient levels, helped trigger significant \n     Pfiesteria outbreaks in the Pocomoke River and two other \n     Eastern Shore waterways in 1997. The three waterways were \n     closed, and 13 people were diagnosed with memory loss and \n     confusion after being on the water during the outbreaks.\n       Researchers think a different set of weather quirks helped \n     limit Pfiesteria to three small incidents last year, none of \n     which killed fish or caused confirmed cases of human illness.\n       A spokesman for Gov. Parris N. Glendening, who pushed for \n     controversial controls on farm runoff after the 1997 \n     incidents, said Burkholder's latest findings show that action \n     was justified.\n       ``What they point to is that this is not a one-time \n     phenomenon,'' said Ray Feldmann of the governor's office. \n     ``We cannot take a bury-our-heads-in-the-sand approach to the \n     phenomenon we saw in the summer of 1997. We still need to be \n     concerned about this.\n       ``We're encouraged that we've got a plan in place that has \n     the potential for helping to hold off future outbreaks.''\n       Burkholder, a North Carolina State University researcher \n     who helped discover Pfiesteria in the late 1980s, said \n     Maryland waters do not seem to be as prone to toxic outbreaks \n     as the waters of North Carolina, which has experienced 88 \n     Pfresteria-related fish kills in the past eight years.\n       The latest finding ``tells me that Chesapeake Bay is not \n     ideal for toxic Pfiesteria, but you have the potential to go \n     a lot more toxic unless you take appropriate precautions,'' \n     Burkholder said. ``Do you want to be a center for toxic \n     outbreaks, or do you not?''\n       The preliminary results are part of a study for the DNR, \n     which is trying to map the extent of Pfiesteria in Maryland \n     waters.\n       In October and November, when the dinoflagellate is usually \n     burrowed into bottom mud, DNR workers took 100 sediment \n     samples from 12 rivers. They were the Patuxent and Potomac on \n     the Western Shore; the Chester, Choptank, Chicamacomico, \n     Nanticoke, Wicomico, Manokin, Big Annemessex and Pocomoke, \n     all flowing into the Chesapeake Bay on the Eastern Shore; and \n     the St. Martin, which flows into Assawoman Bay near Ocean \n     City, and Trappe Creek, which enters Chincoteague Bay near \n     Assateague Island National Seashore.\n       In the first 30 samples, Burkholder found Pfiesteria \n     piscicida in concentrations high enough to kill fish in the \n     Big Annemessex, Chicamacomico, Pocomoke, and St. Martin. She \n     found the same organism on the Wicomico, but the cells did \n     not kill fish in her laboratory. In Trappe Creek, she found a \n     dinoflagellate that did not kill fish and has not been \n     identified.\n       Burkholder and other experts stressed that there have been \n     no recent fish kills or signs that people have gotten sick at \n     the sites where DNR workers took the Pfiesteria-infested \n     samples in October and November.\n       The Patuxent, Potomac, Chester and Choptank turned up no \n     traces of Pfiesteria, but Burkholder said she has about 70 \n     more sediment samples waiting to be analyzed, and expects to \n     find signs of the microorganism in at least some of them.\n\n\n                         rhode river discovery\n\n       Another marine scientist discovered Pfiesteria almost by \n     accident in the Rhode River south of Annapolis this fall.\n       Park Roblee of the University of North Carolina has \n     developed a test that can spot Pfiesteria in the water, but \n     he cannot tell whether the organism is in its toxic stage. He \n     told scientists at this week's meeting that he got samples \n     from the Rhode River expecting them to be Pfiesteria-free but \n     to his surprise they came up positive.  Again, there were no \n     signs of a fish kill in the area.\n       Roblee said workers from his laboratory traveled the coast \n     from New Jersey to Florida, taking water samples ``basically \n     wherever I-95 crossed a river or stream that flowed into an \n     estuary.'' The samples showed signs of Pfiesteria at eight \n     out of 100 sites, he said.\n       In other findings reported yesterday, University of \n     Maryland researcher David Oldach said no signs of serious \n     illness were found in 1998, the first year of a five-year \n     study of people who might come in contact with Pfiesteria. \n     Oldach said 90 Eastern Shore watermen and 25 people who don't \n     work near the water have volunteered for the study and \n     undergone testing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Roth, Mr. Moynihan, \n        Mr. Chafee, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Mack, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 494. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprohibit transfers or discharges of residents of nursing facilities as \na result of a voluntary withdrawal from participation in the Medicaid \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          nursing home resident protection amendments of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend Senator Grassley, Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan for their \nbipartisan commitment to protect our nation's seniors from \nindiscriminate dumping by their nursing homes. I would like to request \nthat their statements be added to the Record.\n  The Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 has the support of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\nnursing home industry and senior citizen advocates. It is with their \nsupport that we encourage the Senate to take action on this important \npiece of legislation. I also have letters of support from the American \nHealth Care Association, the National Seniors Law Center, and the \nAmerican Association for Retired Persons which I will include in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, last year, it looked like 93-year-old Adela Mongiovi \nmight have to spend her 61st Mother's Day away from the assisted living \nfacility that she had called home for the last four years. Her son \nNelson and daughter-in-law Geri feared that they would have to move \nAdela when officials at the Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center of \nTampa told them that their Alzheimer's Disease-afflicted mother would \nhave to be relocated so that the nursing home could complete \n``renovations.''\n  As the Mongiovis told me when I met with them and visited their \nmother in Tampa last April, the real story far exceeded their worst \nfears. The supposedly temporary relocation was actually a permanent \neviction of all 52 residents whose housing and care were paid for by \nthe Medicaid program. Ms. Mongiovi passed away during the holiday \nseason and I send my heartfelt condolences to her family.\n  The nursing home chain which owns the Tampa facility and several \nothers across the United States wanted to purge its nursing homes of \nMedicaid residents, ostensibly to take more private insurance payers \nand Medicare beneficiaries which pay more per resident.\n  This may have been a good financial decision in the short run, \nhowever, its effects on our nation's senior citizens, if practiced on a \nwidespread basis, would be even more disastrous.\n  In an April 7, 1998, Wall Street Journal article, several nursing \nhome executives argued that state governments and Congress are to blame \nfor these evictions because they have set Medicaid reimbursements too \nlow. While Medicaid payments to nursing homes may need to be revised, \nplaying Russian roulette with elderly patients' lives is hardly the way \nto send that message to Congress. And while I am willing to engage in a \ndiscussion as to the equity of nursing home reimbursement rates, my \ncolleagues and I are not willing to allow nursing home facilities to \ndump patients indiscriminately.\n  The fact that some nursing home companies are willing to sacrifice \nelderly Americans for the sake of their bottom-line is bad enough. What \nis even worse is their attempt to evade blame for Medicaid evictions. \nThe starkest evidence of this shirking of responsibility is found in \nthe shell game many companies play to justify evictions. Current law \nallows nursing homes to discharge patients for inability to pay.\n  If a facility decreases its number of Medicaid beds, state and \nfederal governments are no longer allowed to pay the affected \nresidents' bills. They can then be conveniently and unceremoniously \ndumped for--you guessed it--their inability to pay.\n  Nursing home evictions have a devastating effect on the health and \nwell-being of some of society's most vulnerable members. A recent \nUniversity of Southern California study indicated that those who are \nuprooted from their homes undergo a phenomenon knows as ``transfer \ntrauma.'' For these seniors, the consequences are stark. The death rate \namong these seniors is two to three times higher than that for \nindividuals who receive continuous care.\n  Those of us who believe that our mothers, fathers, and grandparents \nare safe because Medicaid affects only low-income Americans need to \nthink again. A three year stay in a nursing home can cost upwards of \n$125,000. As a result, nearly half of all nursing home residents who \nenter as privately-paying patients exhaust their personal savings and \nlose health insurance coverage during their stay. Medicaid becomes many \nretirees' last refuge of financial support.\n  On April 19, 1998, the Florida Medicaid Bureau responded to evidence \nof Medicaid dumping in Tampa by levying a steep $260,000 fine against \nthe Tampa nursing home. That was a strong and appropriate action, but \nit was only a partial solution. Medicaid funding is a shared \nresponsibility of states and the federal government.\n  While the most egregious incident occurred in Florida, Medicaid \ndumping is not just a Florida problem. Nursing homes which were once \nlocally-run and family-owned are increasingly administered by multi-\nstate, multi-facility corporations that have the power to affect \nseniors across the United States.\n  Mr. President, let me also point out that the large majority of \nnursing homes in America treat residents well and are responsible \ncommunity citizens. Our bill is simple and fair and designed to prevent \nfuture abuses by bad actors. It would prohibit current Medicaid \nbeneficiaries or those who ``spend down'' to Medicaid from being \nevicted from their homes.\n  Adele Mongiovi was not just a ``beneficiary.'' She was also a mother \nand grandmother. To Ms. Mongiovi, the Rehabilitation and Health Care \nCenter of Tampa was not just an ``assisted living facility''--it was \nher home.\n  Mr. President, let us provide security and peace of mind for all of \nour nation's seniors and their families. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that letters of support for the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                             American Health Care Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to lend the support of \n     the American Health Care Association to the Nursing Home \n     Protection Amendments of 1999, which you introduced as S. \n     2308 last year and plan to reintroduce this year. This \n     legislation helps to ensure a secure environment for \n     residents of nursing facilities which withdraw from the \n     Medicaid program.\n       We know firsthand that a nursing facility is one's home, \n     and we strive to make sure resident are healthy and secure in \n     their home. We strongly support the clarifications your bill \n     will provide to both current and future nursing facility \n     residents, and do not believe residents should be discharged \n     because of inadequacies in the Medicaid program.\n       The bill addresses a troubling symptom of what could be a \n     much larger problem. The desire to end participation in the \n     Medicaid program is a result of the unwillingness of some \n     states to adequately fund the quality of care that residents \n     expect and deserve. Thus, some providers may opt out of the \n     program to maintain a higher level of quality than is \n     possible when relying on inadequate Medicaid rates. Nursing \n     home residents should not be the victims of the inadequacies \n     of their state's Medicaid program.\n       In 1996, the Congress voted to retain all standards for \n     nursing facilities. We support those standards. In 1997, \n     Congress voted separately to eliminate requirements that \n     states pay for those standards. These two issues are \n     inextricably linked, and must be considered together. We \n     welcome the opportunity to have this debate as Congress moves \n     forward on this issue.\n       Again, we appreciate the chance to work with you to provide \n     our residents with quality care in a home-like setting that \n     is safe and secure. We also feel that it would be most \n     effective when considered in the context of the relationship \n     between payment and quality and access to care.\n       Finally, we greatly appreciate the inclusive manner in \n     which this legislation was crafted, and strengthened. When \n     the views of consumers, providers, and regulators are \n     considered together, the result, as with your bill, is \n     intelligent public policy.\n       We look forward to working with you to further clarify \n     Medicaid policy and preserve our ability to provide the best \n     care and security for our residents.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Bruce Yarwood,\n     Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Senior Citizens\n\n\n                                                   Law Center,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1999.\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Last spring, the Vencor Corporation \n     began to implement a policy of withdrawing its nursing \n     facilities from participation in the Medicaid program. The \n     abrupt, involuntary transfer of large numbers of Medicaid \n     residents followed. Although Vencor reversed its policy, in \n     light of Congressional concern, state agency action, and \n     adverse publicity, the situation highlighted an issue in need \n     of an explicit federal legislative solution--the rights of \n     Medicaid residents to remain in their home when their nursing \n     facility voluntarily ceases to participate in the federal \n     payment program.\n       I supported the legislation you introduced in the last \n     Congress and have read the draft bill that you will introduce \n     to address this issue in this session. The bill protects \n     residents who were admitted at a time when their facility \n     participated in Medicaid by prohibiting the facility from \n     involuntarily transferring them later when it decides to \n     discontinue its participation. As you know, many people in \n     nursing facilities begin their residency paying privately for \n     their care and\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\n     choose the facility in part because of promises that they can \n     stay when they exhaust their private funds and become \n     eligible for Medicaid. In essence, your bill requires the \n     facility to honor the promises it made to these residents at \n     the time of their admission. It continues to allow facilities \n     to withdraw from the Medicaid program, but any withdrawal is \n     prospective only. All current residents may remain in their \n     home.\n       This bill gives peace of mind to older people and their \n     families by affirming that their Medicaid-participating \n     facility cannot abandon them if it later voluntarily chooses \n     to end its participation in Medicaid.\n       The National Senior Citizens Law Center supports this \n     legislation. We look forward to working with your staff on \n     this legislation and on other bills to protect the rights and \n     interests of nursing facility residents and other older \n     people. In particular, we suggest that you consider \n     legislation addressing a related issue of concern to Medicaid \n     beneficiaries and their families--problems of nursing \n     facilities' discriminatory admissions practices.\n       Many facilities limit the extent of their participation in \n     the Medicaid program by certifying only a small number of \n     beds for Medicaid. As a consequence of their limited \n     participation in the Medicaid program, they discriminate \n     against program beneficiaries by denying them admission. In \n     addition, residents who pay privately and become eligible for \n     Medicaid during their residency in the facility because of \n     the high cost of nursing facility care are also affected by \n     limited bed, or distinct part, certification. Once such \n     residents become impoverished and need to rely on Medicaid to \n     help pay for their care, they are often told that ``no \n     Medicaid beds are available'' and that they must move. \n     Facilities engage in other practices that discriminate \n     against people who need to rely on Medicaid for their care. \n     We would be happy to work with your staff in developing \n     legislative solutions to these concerns.\n       Thank you for your work and leadership on these important \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Toby S. Edelman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          AARP\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Graham: AARP appreciates your leadership in \n     sponsoring the Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999, \n     a bill that protects low-income nursing home residents from \n     discharge when a nursing home withdraws from the Medicaid \n     program.\n       Across the country, some nursing home operators have been \n     accused of dumping Medicaid residents--among the most \n     defenseless of all health care patients. As with similar \n     complaints about hospitals and physicians, these violations \n     can be serious threats to people's health and safety. Yet, \n     federal and state governments have been limited to their \n     oversight and enforcement capacities. This bill would \n     establish clear legal authority to prevent inappropriate \n     discharges, even when a nursing home withdraws from the \n     Medicaid program. AARP believes that this is an important and \n     necessary step in protecting access to nursing homes for our \n     nation's most vulnerable citizens.\n       This bill offers important protections because of the \n     documented that Medicaid patients face, especially people \n     seeking nursing home care. For years, there has been strong \n     evidence demonstrating that people who are eligible for \n     Medicaid have a harder time gaining entry to a nursing home \n     than do private payers. In some parts of the country, there \n     is a shortage of nursing home beds. Under such circumstances, \n     only private-pay patients have real choice among nursing \n     homes. Medicaid patients are often forced to choose a home \n     that they would not have otherwise chosen, despite concerns \n     about its quality of care or location.\n       Under the proposed legislation, government survey, \n     certification, and enforcement authority would continue, even \n     after the facility withdraws from the Medicaid program, and \n     the facility would be required to continue to comply with it. \n     The bill also protects prospective residents by requiring \n     oral and written notice that the nursing home has withdrawn \n     from the Medicaid program. Thus, the prospective nursing home \n     resident would be given notice that the home would be \n     permitted to transfer or discharge a new resident at such \n     time as the resident is unable to pay for care.\n       Access to quality nursing homes has been a long-standing \n     and serious concern for AARP. It is an issue that affects, in \n     a real way, our members and their families. The current \n     patchwork system of long-term care forces many Americans to \n     spend down to pay for expensive nursing home care. Therefore, \n     it is unfair to penalize such order, frail nursing home \n     residents who must rely on Medicaid at a critical time in \n     their lives.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this issue. If we \n     can be of further assistance, please give me a call or have \n     your staff contact Maryanne Keenan of our Federal Affairs \n     staff at (202) 434-3772.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B. Deets.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senators \nGraham, Roth, and Moynihan in introducing legislation that will be an \nimportant step in safeguarding our most vulnerable citizens. The \nNursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 will protect nursing home \nresidents who are covered by Medicaid from being thrown out of a \nfacility to make room for a more lucrative, private-pay patient.\n  It is hard to believe that a facility would uproot a frail individual \nfor the sole purpose of a few extra dollars. However, in the past year \nthere have been documented cases of Medicaid beneficiaries who have \nbeen at risk of being forced to leave a facility based solely on \nreimbursement status. The result is often severe trauma and a mortality \nrate that is two to three times higher than other nursing home \nresidents. This is no way to treat our elderly.\n  I want to make it clear that these situations are rare. The vast \nmajority of nursing homes are compassionate and decent facilities. My \nstate of Iowa has been privileged to have many nursing homes that stand \nas models of quality care. Unfortunately, a few bad apples can damage \nthe reputation of an entire industry. That is why I am pleased that \nthis bipartisan legislation has the support of the nursing home \nindustry as well as senior citizens' advocates.\n  This commonsense proposal would prevent nursing homes who have \nalready accepted a Medicaid patient from evicting or transferring the \npatient based solely on payment status. Nursing homes would still be \nentitled to decide who gains access to their facilities, however, they \nwould be required to inform new residents that if they spend down to \nMedicaid, they are entitled to discharge or transfer them to another \nfacility.\n  This legislation is an important step in protecting these frail \nindividuals. People move into nursing homes for around-the-clock health \ncare in a safe environment. The last thing they expect is to be put out \non the street. That's also the last thing they deserve. This bill \nprevents residents from getting hurt if their nursing home pulls out of \nMedicaid and ensures that people know their rights up front, before \nthey enter a facility.\n  This commonsense proposal has also been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Bilirakis where it has received strong \nbipartisan support. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to \ncosponsor this worthwhile proposal. And, I look forward to the passage \nof this resolution this year.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator \nMoynihan, Senator Graham, and Senator Grassley to introduce important \nlegislation to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens--nursing \nhome residents. Our bill will keep nursing home residents who rely on \nMedicaid from being ``dumped'' out of the facility they call home, \nshould that facility decide to drop participation in the Medicaid \nprogram.\n  The problem we will solve with this bill does not occur often. In \nfact, nearly 90 percent of all nursing homes participate in the \nMedicaid program. Pullouts are very rare and usually result from \nfacilities deciding to close. But when a still-functioning facility \ndecides to stop serving Medicaid clients, our bill will ensure that \ncurrent residents do not find themselves pushed out of the place they \nview as home.\n  Recently, Medicaid beneficiaries in facilities in Indiana and Florida \nfound themselves in precisely this horrible situation. They were forced \nout of nursing homes that decided to drop participation in the Medicaid \nprogram. Residents' well-being was disrupted and families were forced \nto scramble to develop other care alternatives.\n  Our new legislation, and H.R. 540, its companion bill in the House, \nwill protect current residents from displacement. The bill simply \nrequires that facilities withdrawing from the Medicaid program continue \nto care for current residents under the terms and conditions of the \nMedicaid program until those residents no longer require care. \nFacilities would essentially phase-down participation in Medicaid \nrather than dropping from the program overnight.\n  Both the nursing home industry and senior citizens' advocates support \nour legislation. This is a common sense, good-government bill that will \nenhance the peace of mind of low-income elderly and disabled \nindividuals.\n  I applaud the House Conference Committee for having already held a \nhearing on H.R. 540, and Representatives\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\nBilirakis and Davis are to be congratulated for their leadership on \nthis important issue. As we introduce our bill in the Senate today, I \nwould like to particularly thank Senator Bob Graham, whose commitment \nto this legislation has been pivotal. Working with him, Senator \nMoynihan, Senator Grassley, and other original Finance Committee \ncosponsors Senators Chafee, Mack, Rockefeller, Breaux, Bryan, and \nKerrey, I look forward to taking up the bill up in our committee.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Graham, Roth and Grassley in introducing this legislation--the \nNursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999. It is a modest \nmodification providing an enormous protection for nursing home \nresidents.\n  The situation today is as follows. Frail elderly individuals who \nrequire nursing home care are faced with costs of $40,000 to $50,000 on \naverage per year. These sums quickly deplete family savings. As a \nresult, about two-thirds of nursing home residents at some point spend \ndown their assets and require the assistance of Medicaid coverage. \nBecause Medicaid typically has low reimbursement rates, nursing homes, \nin turn, must carefully balance their finances by screening which \npatients to accept, limiting the number of Medicaid residents. When \nnursing homes can no longer operate with low Medicaid rates, they may \nchoose to reduce the number of beds available for Medicaid residents or \nno longer participate in the Medicaid program altogether.\n  What, then, happens to the residents who depend on Medicaid to cover \ntheir nursing home costs? The Wall Street Journal first reported on \nApril 7 of last year what has occurred: Vencor Inc., with the nation's \nlargest nursing home chain of 310 facilities, decided to withdraw \nparticipation in the Medicaid program. Residents covered by Medicaid \nwere so notified and told they would have to leave the nursing homes--\ntheir homes.\n  Industry analysts had predicted that some other companies may follow \nVencor's lead in jettisoning Medicaid residents. For example, \nRenaissance Healthcare Corp. withdrew from Medicaid the year before due \nto rising expenses.\n  The evictions in Vencor's Indiana and Florida nursing homes caused \npanic among residents and their families, and aggravated some patients' \nfrail medical conditions. In all, it was a wrenching experience for \nresidents and their families.\n  Our legislation is a small modification amid an otherwise larger \nproblem. The bill would merely protect current Medicaid residents in \nnursing homes from evictions if their nursing home decides to withdraw \nfrom the Medicaid program. Nursing homes will be able to continue to \nscreen patients for acceptance into their facility. The screening \nprocess is quite sophisticated and includes collection of information \nabout assets and income to determine when the individual will likely \nspend down his or her resources before requiring Medicaid coverage.\n  The larger dilemma still exists. We need a system that both covers \nour frail elderly in nursing homes after they spend themselves into \npoverty due to nursing home costs and ensures that nursing homes can \nstay in business in order to provide such services.\n  Momentum is moving behind this legislation. Our bill enjoys \nbipartisan support in Congress as well as support from the nursing home \nindustry and advocates. On the Senate side, we introduce this bill \ntoday with a total of 15 sponsors. Last week, the House Commerce \nSubcommittee on Health and Environment held a hearing on this \nlegislation. Chairman Roth and I are committed to marking up this bill \nin our Committee in the near future. I commend Senator Graham for his \nleadership in initiating this proposal, and urge its early adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 495. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to repeal the highway \nsanctions; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n  legislation to repeal clean air act to repeal the highway sanctions\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the purpose of this bill is simple and \nclear. The only thing the bill does is to repeal the highway sanction \nprovisions in the Clean Air Act.\n  I want to start by saying that I know what the so-called \nenvironmental community is going to say. Actually, they have already \nsaid it. I recall a press release that said, ``Another smoggy stealth \nattack is in the works,'' and ``sharpening the dirty-air knives.'' \nWell, that sounds fancy and exciting, but it is just flat wrong.\n  Mr. President, I ask you, where is the common sense? I do not want \ndirty air. And I do not think anybody in this room, in this body, wants \ndirty air. But any attempt to change the status quo gets some \nspinmeisters at work.\n  Let me explain where there is a real problem. There is a provision in \nthe Clean Air Act that allows the EPA Administrator, with the approval \nof the Secretary of Transportation, to halt highway funding for a \nnonattainment area. For instance, if a State does not have an approved \nclean air plan, after a certain period of time sanctions apply, and \nthose sanctions include halting highway funding. Now, transit funding \ncan continue and bike path money can go forward. There is also a \n``safety'' exemption where the Secretary of Transportation determines \nthat a ``project is an improvement in safety to resolve a demonstrated \nsafety problem and likely will result in a significant reduction in, or \navoidance of, accidents.''\n  I have several problems with that provision.\n  First, highway funding is a matter of safety. We dedicate \ntransportation funds to specific improvement programs, like railroad \ncrossings and programs on drunk driving. But highway safety is also an \nissue when it comes to road conditions.\n  In my own State of Missouri, I can tell you that highway fatality \nrates are higher than the national average because roads are more \ndangerous. In the period 1992 to 1996, 5,279 people died on Missouri \nhighways. Nationally, Federal Highways estimates that road conditions \nare a factor in about 30 percent of traffic fatalities. Well, I believe \nthat figure is higher in Missouri, because I have been on the narrow \ntwo-lane roads and have seen the white crosses where people have died.\n  Highway improvements, such as wider lanes and shoulders, adding or \nimproving medians, and upgrading roads from two lanes to four lanes can \nreduce traffic fatalities and accidents. The Secretary can grant \nexemptions from the current law to allow a project to go forward, but \nhe can also deny them. I have a problem with the Government, the \nFederal Government, micromanaging a State's transportation plan.\n  The law also says the State will have to submit data to justify that \nthe ``principal purpose of the project is an improvement in safety.'' \nTell that to the grandmother who has lost her granddaughter on a \nstretch of highway. She will never go to the prom, because she was \nkilled on that highway.\n  I would argue that highway construction and improvements are almost \nalways a matter of safety and that to have to seek an exemption is an \nunnecessary and inappropriate delay. Any further delay imposed by the \nFederal Government on highway projects which are necessary for safety \nis unacceptable.\n  Second, taking away or imposing any kind of delay on highway funding \ndoes nothing to improve air quality or to reduce congestion. According \nto the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials, ``Congestion damages air quality, increases travel times, \ncosts an estimated $43 billion annually in delays in the country's 50 \nlargest urban areas, and generates additional delay costs in rural and \nsuburban areas.''\n  Some will argue, ``If you build it, they will come.'' That normally \napplies to baseball diamonds, but they are talking about highways. I am \nnot denying that there is some truth to that, but congestion already \nexists. They are already there. People in our State and rural Missouri \nare driving, and they are driving on narrow highways because they have \nto. There are no trolleys; there are no regularly scheduled buses. \nHalting or delaying funds to address the problem is inappropriate.\n  I think the cliche, ``Pay now or pay more later,'' is appropriate. \nWhat we would be ``paying'' for is potentially the loss of life, loss \nof economic opportunities, and the loss of convenience for the \ntraveling public. Isn't this an issue of quality of life? I think so.\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\n  Third, the Highway Trust Fund is supported by highway users for \nhighway construction and maintenance. It is a dedicated tax for a \ndedicated purpose. The people of Missouri are paying highway fund taxes \nand not getting a full dollar back for their highways. And to take away \nsome of the money that they have put in because of totally unrelated \nconcerns is inappropriate as a punitive sanction.\n  The 105th Congress spent the entire Congress, almost, working on a \ntransportation policy.\n  One of the most contentious debates we had at the time and the \nsignificant outcomes of that debate was the issue of the trust fund. \nThe Congress finally agreed to and the President signed into law what I \nrefer to as the Bond-Chafee provision which says that the money goes in \nas the money comes out the next year for transportation and programs \nauthorized by law.\n  Included in TEA-21--highway dollars being spent on--is $8.1 billion \nover 6 years for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement \nProgram. This is money dedicated to helping States and local \ngovernments meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. Under current \nlaw, CMAQ--as it is called--funding will continue without interruption, \nbut highway construction could be halted or face a delay.\n  Using a ``dedicated tax for a dedicated purpose'' as a hammer in this \ninstance is, I believe, inappropriate and unfair.\n  I do not view this legislation as an attack on the Clean Air Act. It \nis a matter of common sense.\n  Some may ask, if they do not already know, what precipitated the \nintroduction of this legislation. I contemplated introducing this bill \nin the past but had other matters that were more important. But on \nNovember 8, 1998, the San Francisco-based Sierra Club filed suit in the \nDistrict of Columbia District Court against the EPA to force the EPA to \nmandate sanctions not just on St. Louis and the nonattainment area but \non the entire State of Missouri and to make these sanctions \nretroactive. That action, I believe, is irresponsible and extreme.\n  The EPA itself chose not to impose sanctions on the St Louis area or \nthe State of Missouri because the State and the nonattainment area are \ndoing everything that is necessary to come into compliance. The St. \nLouis area has adopted an inspection/maintenance program. They have \ninstituted a plan to reduce volatile organic compound emissions by at \nleast 15 percent. They have opted into EPA's reformulated gasoline \nprogram. And the St. Louis Regional Clean Air Partnership has been \nformed to encourage voluntary actions. In these circumstances, the \nSierra Club lawsuit is purely punitive and purely unwarranted, but it \nis possible as long as we have this legislation on the books.\n  I do not personally know one Member of the Senate who fought for \nhighway funding for his or her State's highway needs who would support \nactions to take that funding away, especially in a frivolous lawsuit by \na group with a different agenda, with different priorities than the \ncitizens of the State who are paying in the money. If this provision of \nlaw is left in place, what is happening in Missouri could happen \nelsewhere. Highway sanctions are in place for Helena, MT, and a \nsituation is developing in Atlanta, GA, which has been brought to my \nattention.\n  There are those who say you can count the number of times highway \nsanctions have been imposed on one hand, but that still is too many. I \ndisagree with the linking of highway funds and clean air attainment. We \nmust address both. Quality of life requires both clear air and safe \nhighways. I am dedicated to both. I hope we can have hearings and move \non this measure in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 496. A bill to provide for the establishment of an assistance \nprogram for health insurance consumers; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                the health care consumer assistance act\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health Care \nConsumer Assistance Act, along with my colleague from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden. This legislation creates a consumer assistance program that is \nkey to patient protections in the health insurance market.\n  In 1997, President Clinton's Health Quality Commission identified the \nneed for consumer assistance programs that allow consumers access to \naccurate, easily understood information and get assistance in making \ninformed decisions about health plans and providers. Today, only a \nloose patchwork of consumer assistance services exists. And, while a \nnumber of sources provide assistance, most are limited. Many consumer \ngroups have advocated for the establishment of consumer assistance \nprograms to support consumers' growing need of information.\n  The legislation I am introducing today gives states grants to \nestablish nonprofit, private health care ombudsman programs designed to \nhelp consumers understand and act on their health care choices, rights, \nand responsibilities. Under my bill, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices will offer funds for states to select an independent, \nnonprofit agency to provide the following services to consumers: \ninformation relating to choices, rights, and responsibilities within \nthe plans they select; operate a 1-800 telephone hotline to respond to \nconsumer requests for information, advice and assistance; produce and \ndisseminate educational materials about patients' rights; provide \nassistance and representation to people who wish to appeal the denial, \ntermination, or reduction of health care services, or a refusal to pay \nfor health services; and collect and disseminate data about inquiries, \nproblems and grievances handled by the consumer assistance program.\n  This program has been championed by Ron Pollack of Families USA and \nBeverly Malone of the American Nurses Association, who served as \nmembers of the President's Commission on Quality, as well as numerous \nother consumer advocates.\n  Mr. President, I have joined with many of my Democratic colleagues in \nsponsoring S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. I am pleased \nthat S. 6 would establish a consumer assistance program, similar to \nthat established by my legislation. My purpose today is to emphasize \nthe importance of such a consumer protection program. This legislation \nis not without controversy, but I believe that American consumers \ndeserve protection and assistance as they attempt to navigate the often \nconfusing and complex world of health insurance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of my bill \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as we speak, rescue crews are fighting \nvaliantly to contain the damage from the wreck of the tanker New \nCarissa off of Coos Bay, Oregon three weeks ago. But the clock is \nticking, the water is rising, and time is running short. An \nenvironmental disaster of truly alarming proportions is staring my \nstate in the face.\n  Thousands of gallons of fuel oil have already leaked out of the \nwrecked ship and thousands more may be spilled along our precious \ncoastline within days, if not hours.\n  As Oregonians struggle to make the best of a bad situation, it is not \ntoo early to start talking about how we prevent the next addition to \nthe legacy of New Carissa. It seems clear to me that we need to look at \nthe pernicious practice of foreign flagging. How many gallons of oil \nneed to spill and how many miles of coastline have to be destroyed \nbefore we stop allowing unseaworthy vessels manned by untrained crews \ninto our coastal waters.\n  It seems easier to register a supertanker in some foreign countries \nthan it is to register an automobile in Portland, Oregon. As long as \nthis so-called Flag of Convenience system continues, it's only a matter \nof time before the next New Carissa runs aground on a local beach. Yet \nour maritime policy continues to allow it.\n  Grave concerns have also been raised about the amount and quality of \ninformation being released to the public about this disaster. People \nwho live in the area simply have not been told what to expect. That is \nunacceptable. When disaster strikes, government has an ironclad \nresponsibility to give people as much information as possible.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that focuses on avoiding \ndisasters like the New Carissa. We need to stop playing Russian \nroulette with our coastal resources and the communities that depend on \nthem.\n  Congressman DeFazio has authored companion legislation in the House \nof Representatives, which was adopted as an amendment to the Coast \nGuard Reauthorization Bill.\n  This legislation requires all vessels, foreign and domestic, to \nnotify the Coast Guard when they intend to enter our country's \nterritorial waters, allows the Coast Guard to bar them from entry if \nthere are safety concerns, and gives the Coast Guard the authority to \ndirect the movements of such vessels in our waters in hazardous \nsituations. This bill would have given the Coast Guard the ability to \nblock the New Carissa from allowing its deadly course of sailing so \nclose to shore during a hazardous gale, a practice that local pilots \nshun.\n  In other words, had this bill been in place, the Coast Guard would \nhave had the ability to stop this tragedy before it occurred, instead \nof having to clean up after it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a congressional commemorative medal for \norgan donors and their families; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            the gift of life congressional medal act of 1999\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take great pleasure today in introducing \nthe Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act of 1999. With this \nlegislation, which doesn't cost taxpayers a penny, Congress has the \nopportunity to recognize and encourage potential donors, and give hope \nto over 52,000 Americans who have end-stage disease. As a heart and \nlung transplant surgeon, I saw one in four of my patients die because \nof the lack of available donors. Public awareness simply has not kept \nup with the relatively new science of transplantation. As public \nservants, we need to do all we can to raise awareness about the gift of \nlife.\n  Under this bill, each donor or donor family will be eligible to \nreceive a commemorative Congressional medal. It is not expected that \nall families, many of whom wish to remain anonymous, will take \nadvantage of this opportunity. The program will be coordinated by the \nregional organ procurement organizations [OPO's] and managed by the \nentity administering the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. \nUpon request of the family or individual, a public official will \npresent the medal to the donor or the family. This creates a wonderful \nopportunity to honor those sharing life through donation and increase \npublic awareness. Some researchers have estimated that it may be \npossible to increase the number of organ donations by 80 percent \nthrough public education.\n  Any one of us, or any member of our families, could need a life \nsaving transplant. We would then be placed on a waiting list to \nanxiously await our turn, or our death. The number of people on the \nlist has more than doubled since 1990--and a new name is added to the \nlist every 18 minutes. In my home State of Tennessee, 62 Tennesseans \ndied in 1998 while waiting, and more than 775 people are in need of a \ntransplant. Nationally, because of a lack of organs, close to 5,000 \nlisted individuals died in 1998.\n  However, the official waiting list reflects only those who have been \nlucky enough to make it into the medical care system and to pass the \nfinancial hurdles. If you include all those reaching end-stage disease, \nthe number of people potentially needing organs or bone marrow, very \nlikely over 120,000, becomes staggering. Only a small fraction of that \nnumber would ever receive transplants, even if they had adequate \ninsurance. There simply are not enough organ and tissue donors, even to \nmeet present demand.\n  Federal policies surrounding the issue of organ transplantation are \ndifficult. Whenever you deal with whether someone lives or dies, there \nare no easy answers. There are between 15,000 and 20,000 potential \ncadaveric donors each year, yet inexcusably, in 1997 there were only \nsome 5,400 actual donors. That's why we need you to help us educate \nothers about the facts surrounding tissue and organ donation.\n  Mr. President, there has been unprecedented cooperation, on both \nsides of the aisle, and a growing commitment to awaken public \ncompassion on behalf of those who need organ transplants. It is my very \ngreat pleasure to introduce this bill on behalf of a group of Senators \nwho have already contributed in extremely significant ways to the cause \nof organ transplantation. And we are proud to ask you to join us, in \nencouraging people to give life to others.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. \n        Helms):\n  S. 500. A bill to amend section 991(a) of title 28, United States \nCode, to require certain members of the United States Sentencing \nCommission to be selected from among individuals who are victims of a \ncrime of violence; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            united states sentencing commission legislation\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill \nthat I sponsored in the last Congress to give victims of crime a \ngreater voice in sentencing. My bill, which is being cosponsored by \nSenators Jeffords and Helms, would reserve two of the seven seats on \nthe United States Sentencing Commission for victims of violent crimes.\n  Mr. President, the Sentencing Commission is an independent entity \nwithin the judicial branch that establishes sentencing policies and \npractices for the Federal courts. This includes sentencing guidelines \nthat prescribe the appropriate form and severity of punishment for \noffenders convicted of Federal crimes.\n  The U.S. sentencing Commission is composed of seven voting members \nwho are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, for six-year terms. The Commission also includes two non-voting \nmembers. Of the seven voting members of the Sentencing Commission, \nthree must be Federal judges.\n  Under my bill, two of the four seats on the Sentencing Commission \nthat are not filled by Federal judges would be reserved for victims of \na crime of violence or, in the case of a homicide, an immediate family \nmember of such a victim. My bill utilizes the definition of a crime of \nviolence that is found in section 16 of title 18 of the United States \nCode.\n  All seven voting seats on the Sentencing Commission are vacant. Now \nis the right time to give victims of crime a voice by requiring that \ntwo of those vacant seats must be filled by Americans who have been \nvictimized by violent crimes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COMPOSITION OF UNITED STATES SENTENCING \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 991(a) of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after ``same political party,'' \n     the following: ``Of the members who are not Federal judges, \n     not less than 2 members shall be individuals who are victims \n     of a crime of violence (as that term is defined in section 16 \n     of title 18) or, in the case of a homicide, an immediate \n     family member of such a victim.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\n     any appointment made on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 501. A bill to address resource management issues in Glacier Bay \nNational Park, Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                       glacier bay fisheries act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am today introducing--together with \nmy good friend Senator Stevens--new legislation to ensure that the \nmarine waters of Glacier Bay National Park remain open to the fisheries \nthat have been conducted there for many, many years.\n  For a number of years, the Park Service has attempted to seize \nauthority over fisheries management in Glacier Bay from the State of \nAlaska, which holds title to the marine waters and submerged lands \nwithin Glacier Bay National Park. This is an infringement of the \nState's sovereignty under the constitutional doctrine of equal footing, \nas confirmed by Congress in the Submerged Lands Act, and the Alaska \nStatehood Act.\n  As my colleagues should all be aware, commercial fisheries have been \nconducted in these waters for well over 100 years, since long before \nthe federal government became interested in them. Subsistence fishing \nand gathering by local residents has been practiced for up to 9,000 \nyears, and perhaps longer.\n  Yet today, officials of the National Park Service want Glacier Bay \noff limits to those who have depended on it for their sustenance and \nlivelihoods for generations.\n  Most recently, agents of the Park Service harassed a number of \ncommercial crab fishermen who were fishing in areas which have always \nbeen open to them. Some of these were areas which may be closed under \nlegislation adopted last year, but for which the Park Service has not \nyet promulgated regulations to effect the closure.\n  Although Park Service officials now say they merely asked for \nvoluntary compliance and attempted to educate fishermen about their \nplans, the fishermen tell a different, and more sinister, story.\n  This particular crab fishery is only six days long, with the first \ntwo days being crucial to a fisherman's financial success. Because of \nthis, fishermen must work literally around the clock for the first 48 \nto 72 hours. After the first two days, their earning potential--even \nfor a top fisherman--drops from almost $60,000 per day to less than \n$20,000.\n  It is important to note that these are not large scale fisheries. We \nare talking about a small handful of fishermen, some working solely \nwith their families.\n  Out of the 14 vessels working in the Bay during the recent fishery, \n11 were boarded--right in the middle of those crucial first two days--\nby armed and intimidating Park Service agents. Many were either told \nthey were in closed waters, or threatened that if they did not move, \nthey would be prosecuted. Needless to say, these fishermen are law-\nabiding members of society, so they pulled up their fishing gear and \nmoved, taking very serious financial losses as a result.\n   Mr. President, let me ask you how difficult it would have been to \nwrite a letter before the season opened and send it to these 14 \nfishermen? How hard would it be to send a letter to 20 fishermen? or to \n50? In other words, Mr. President, how hard would it have been to avoid \nsuch confrontational and damaging tactics?\n  It would not have been hard at all, Mr. President, and the fact that \nthe agency did not choose to do so is just one more example of how \nunfairly the Park Service has behaved to those who live and work in \nAlaska.\n  It is time for this to stop, and to ensure that it does, I am today \noffering a simple, clean solution. First, the bill authorizes \nsubsistence fishing and gathering under the existing federal governing \nauthority for such activities. Second, the bill authorizes the State of \nAlaska to conduct its marine fisheries without interference, except a \nfishery for Dungeness crab, for which a compensation plan has already \nbeen adopted. And third, the bill authorizes the use of up to \n$2,000,000 per year--which the Park Service is already collecting but \nwhich it has failed to use for the purpose intended by Congress--to be \nused to pay damages to fishermen who were unfairly harmed.\n   Mr. President, this is a matter of simple fairness. These are not \nnew fisheries, but old ones--fisheries which throughout their long \nhistory have never caused a problem, and are today more tightly \ncontrolled than ever by State of Alaska law and regulation.\n  Fishermen have caused no harm here. The only harm has been caused \neither by the arrogant demands of those who want the park to \nthemselves, or those who are well-meaning but ignorant of the facts. It \nis time the former become better neighbors, and time for the latter to \nlearn the truth.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of our legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect social security; to the Committee on the \nBudget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to \nthe order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one Committee \nreports, the other Committee have thirty days to report or be \ndischarged.\n\n\n            The protect social security benefits act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ASCHROFT. Mr. President, there is no more worthy government \nobligation than ensuring that those who paid a lifetime of Social \nSecurity taxes will receive their full Social Security benefits. Social \nSecurity is a national, cultural and legal obligation. Social Security \nis our most import social program, a contact between the government and \nits citizens. Americans, including one million Missourians, depend on \nthis commitment.\n  This is more than just a governmental commitment. We have a \nresponsibility as a culture to care for the elderly. Social Security is \nthe only retirement income most of our seniors receive. It is our \nobligation, passed down from generation to generation, to provide \nretirement security for every American.\n  As individuals, all of us care about Social Security because we know \nthe benefits it pays to our mothers and fathers, relatives and friends. \nAnd we think of the Social Security taxes we and our children pay--up \nto 12.4 percent of our income. We pay these taxes with the \nunderstanding that they help our parents and their friends, and we hope \nthat our taxes will somehow, someday make it possible to help pay for \nour own retirements.\n  In my case, thinking of Social Security brings to mind friends and \nconstituents such as Lenus Hill of Bolivar, MO, who relies on her \nSocial Security to meet living expenses. Billy Yarberry lives on a farm \nnear Springfield and depends on Social Security. And there is Rev. \nWalter Keisker of Cape Girardeau, who will be 100 years old next July \nand lives on Social Security. These faces bring meaning to Social \nSecurity.\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\n  Whenever I meet with folks in Missouri, I am asked, ``Senator, you \nwon't let them use my Social Security taxes to pay for the United \nNations, will you?'' Or, ``Why can't I get my full benefits if I work \nafter 65?'' Or, ``You know I need my Social Security, don't you?''\n  And then there are the letters on Social Security I get every day.\n  Ed and Beverly Shelton of Independence, MO, write: ``Aren't the \nbudget surpluses the result of Social Security taxes generating more \nrevenue than is needed to fund current benefits? Therefore, the Social \nSecurity surplus is the surplus!* * * Yes, we are senior citizens and \nreceive a very limited amount of Social Security. We are children who \nsurvived the Great Depression and World War II so we know how to \nstretch a dollar and rationed goods--just wish Congress were as careful \nwith spending our money as we are!''\n  These concerns are why I am introducing today the Protect Social \nSecurity Benefits Act. Americans who have devoted 12% of their wages to \nthe Social Security Trust Fund deserve their full Social Security \npayments now and in the century to come. The bill is part of a five \npart package that, taken together, seeks to provide greater protection \nfor the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  The substance and message of these provisions is that Social Security \nmust be protected: protected from politicians who raid Social Security \nto finance additional deficits; protected from those who want to gamble \nwith Social Security in the stock market; protected so that investment \ndecisions ensure current and future benefits; protected so that seniors \nwho work get full benefits; protected so that we keep our commitment to \nAmerica's retirees.\n  The Ashcroft Protect Social Security Benefits Act of 1999 prevents \nthe use of surpluses in the Social Security Trust Funds to finance \ndeficits in the rest of the federal budget. We must build a wall so \nhigh around the Social Security Trust Funds so that it cannot be used \nto pay for new government spending. Social Security should not finance \nnew spending. But that is exactly what has happened in the past, is now \nhappening, and will continue happening in the future, unless changes \nare made. It must end.\n  Specifically, the bill makes it out of order for the House or Senate \nto pass, or even debate, a budget or bill that uses Social Security \nsurpluses to finance deficits in the rest of the budget. In both the \nHouse and Senate, a three-fifths vote, or a super majority, would be \nrequired to change that. Let me assure you that this is extremely \nunlikely. We have enough trouble getting 51 Senators to agree to \nanything, let alone 60. Thus, it would be extremely difficult to use \nthe Social Security surplus to fund new deficit spending.\n  Two other bills I am supporting will also reduce debt and thereby \nstrengthen our economy, Social Security and our future. The first bill \nstructures the payment of the national debt by amortizing it--paying it \noff in installments--over the next 30 years. The second bill reduces \nthe public debt limit every two years as an additional incentive to \nreduce borrowing. Additional surpluses in the Social Security Trust \nFund can buy down publicly-held debt. By reducing the public debt, my \nplan will make it easier for America to meet its Social Security \nobligations in three ways. First, over the long run, paying off the \ndebt will lower interest payments, which are now over $200 billion \nannually, equaling about 15% of the budget. Second, by relieving \nAmerica of the burden of the $3.8 trillion national debt over the next \n30 years, it will free up more resources that may be able to meet \nSocial Security obligations in the future. Finally, a debt-free America \nwill have a stronger, faster-growing economy, and will be better \nequipped to come up with the money to redeem the Trust Fund when we \nneed it.\n  We must remember that federal debt incurs very real costs, in the \nform of interest payments and higher interest rates. With that in mind, \nwe cannot afford not to pay off the debt. While it will cost money to \npay off the debt, it is better to budget for those costs now. On this \npoint, I agree with President Clinton. His idea to use Social Security \nsurpluses to pay down our existing debt is a wise one, and I am \noffering a responsible plan to make it happen.\n  Finally, and given the fact that Social Security surpluses are \nroutinely being used to finance deficits in the rest of the budget of \nthe federal government, it is time to decide carefully how Social \nSecurity should be treated in any proposed constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I have always supported a balanced budget \namendment. In the past, I have supported an effort that did not \ndistinguish between Social Security accounts and the rest of the \nfederal budget. However, last year's raid of the Social Security \nsurplus to fund other government spending under the guise of \n``emergency spending'' has convinced me that Social Security must be \nprotected under our constitution. Social Security must be walled off \nfor special treatment in any proposed balanced budget amendment. We \nmust make clear that the federal budget should be balanced without \ncounting any Social Security surpluses.\n  Walling off the trust funds is the first step, not the only step, \nneeded to protect Social Security. This is the right way to start the \neffort to improve Social Security so it is strong for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  To do this, we need to be honest, realizing that, for now, time is on \nour side to make thoughtful improvements. For the past few months, I \nhave comprehensively reviewed Social Security. My conviction is that \nunderstanding must always come before reforming. The following \nsummarizes the facts about Social Security.\n  Social Security does now and will in the near future accumulate \nannual surpluses. Together, income from payroll taxes and interest is \ngreater than the amount of benefits being paid out. The Social Security \nTrustees believe that these surpluses will continue each year for the \nnext 14 years. In that time, a $2.8 trillion total surplus will \naccumulate.\n  In the year 2013, however, when more baby boomers will be in \nretirement, annual benefit payments will exceed annual taxes received \nby Social Security through taxes and interest. As a result, Social \nSecurity will run an annual deficit. By 2021, annual benefit payments \nwill exceed annual taxes received by Social Security and interest \nearned on the accumulated surpluses. In the year 2032, Social Security \npayroll taxes will not only be insufficient to pay benefits; the \nsurpluses will be used up. Social Security will be bankrupt.\n  Bipartisan efforts are underway to address this long-term situation. \nI will take an active part in this work. We must strengthen Social \nSecurity's capacity to pay benefits in full beyond the year 2032.\n  But there is no getting around the fact that a key to the long-term \nsolvency of Social Security is how the current mushrooming Social \nSecurity surplus is invested, managed and spent. That's why the Protect \nSocial Security Benefits Act focuses on how the current Social Security \nsurplus is invested and managed.\n  Where is the Social Security surplus? This question helps us \nunderstand what the Social Security surplus is, and is not. In truth, \nthe Trust Funds have no money, only interest-bearing notes. It would be \nfoolish to have money in the trust fund that earned no interest or had \nno return. In return for the Social Security notes, Social Security \ntaxes are sent to the U.S. Treasury and mingled with other government \nrevenues, where the entire pool of cash pays the government's day-to-\nday expenses. While the Trust Funds records now show a total of $857 \nbillion in the fund, these assets exist only in the form of government \nsecurities, or debt. According to the Washington Post, ``The entire \nSocial Security Trust Fund, all [$857] billion or so of it, fits \nreadily in four ordinary, brown, accordion-style folders that one can \neasily hold in both hands. The 174 certificates reside in a plain \ncombination-lock filing cabinet on the third floor of the bureau's \noffice building.''\n  In recent years, Social Security surpluses have been used to finance \ndeficit spending in the rest of the federal budget. Take Fiscal Year \n1998 for example. The Social Security surplus was $99 billion. The \ndeficit in the rest of the government budget was $29 billion. So $29 \nbillion--or 30% of the Social Security surplus--financed other \ngovernment programs that were not paid for with general tax revenues. \nthis occurred despite President Clinton's promise to save ``every penny \nof any surplus'' for Social Security.\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\n  For next year, this money shuffling is even greater. To quote the \nSenate Budget Committee's February 1, 1999, analysis:\n\n       Conclusion: the President's budget, despite the rhetoric, \n     not only spends all the non-Social Security surplus over the \n     next five years, while providing no meaningful tax relief to \n     American families, but also dips in the Social Security \n     surplus for $146 billion to pay for the President's spending \n     priorities.\n\n  This kind of money shuffling must end. I cannot go back to Lenus Hill \nor Billy Yarberry and tell them that I stood by silently as the \ngovernment devoted--spent half of their retirement money to paying for \nthe President's new spending initiatives. We must stop the dishonest \npractice of hiding new government deficits with Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  The Protect Social Security Benefits Act of 1999 is designed to \ncripple attempts to use surpluses in the Social Security Trust Funds to \npay for deficits in the rest of the federal budget. Specifically, the \nbill states that it is out of order for the House and Senate to pass--\nor even debate--a budget that uses Social Security surpluses to finance \nnew debt in the rest of the budget. This provision could only be \noverridden if three-fifths of the House or Senate openly vote to bypass \nthis rule.\n  Three times Congress has passed laws that tried to take Social \nSecurity off-budget. These efforts have called for accounting \nstatements that require the government to keep the financial status of \nSocial Security separate from the rest of the budget. But these efforts \nare inadequate unless Congress puts in place safeguards that protect \nsurpluses in Social Security from financing new government spending.\n  Right now, such procedures do not exist in current law or in senate \nrules. On the contrary, current law and senate rules create 21 separate \npoints of order that apply to spending increases and tax increases, \nmaking it difficult to protect Social Security surpluses. But none \nactually stop these surpluses from paying for new budget deficits. We \nneed a point of order protecting Social Security surpluses from \nirresponsible government raiding.\n  The Protect Social Security Benefits Act would create precisely such \na point of order. This would prohibit the federal government from \nrunning a federal funds (on-budget) deficit without 60 votes, or what \nis known as a super-majority. With no on-budget deficit to finance, we \nwould use the entire Social Security surplus to shrink the publicly-\nheld federal debt. Reducing the publicly-held debt would cut annual \ninterest costs that now cost $200 billion and 15% of the entire federal \ngovernment budget. Eliminating this interest cost would provide more \nflexibility to address the long-term financing difficulties Social \nSecurity now faces that could someday jeopardize payment of full \nbenefits.\n  The only exception to this point of order would be in time of war. If \nCongress were to declare war, and the government needed to go into \ndeficit in order to protect our national security, then the point of \norder would not apply. It would remain in effect at all other times. In \nthe event that the House or Senate did not pass a budget resolution, \nthe point of order would apply to all appropriations bills passed after \nSeptember 1. This fail-safe would ensure that the President and the \nCongress could not raid the Social Security fund for irresponsible \nspending, as they did last year to the tune of $22 billion.\n  The Ashcroft Protect Social Security Benefits Act is the first \nprovision in a multi-part Social Security package that will address \nvital issues relating to the management, investment, and taxation of \nSocial Security. This plan is designed to protect the Social Security \nsystem. More importantly, it is designed to protect the American \npeople--from debt, from bad investments, from misinformation, and from \nattempts to spend our retirement dollars on current government \nspending. While I value the Social Security system, I value the \nAmerican people, people like Lenus Hill and the one million other \nMissourians who receive Social Security benefits, more. My primary \nresponsibility is to them. My plan to protect the Social Security \nsystem will protect the American people first, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in support of this plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 503. A bill designating certain land in the San Isabel National \nForest in the State of Colorado as the ``Spanish Peaks Wilderness''; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  SPANISH PEAKS WILDERNESS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, wilderness is described in the law as \nlands that are, ``* * * in contrast with those areas where man and his \nown works dominate the landscape, * * * an area where the earth and its \ncommunity of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a \nvisitor who does not remain.'' With today's introduction of the Spanish \nPeaks Wilderness bill congressmen Scott McInnis, Bob Schaffer and I are \nsetting aside around 18,000 acres of land that more than meets the \nintent of the authors of the 1964 Wilderness Act. This land will be an \nimportant addition to wilderness in Colorado.\n  Spanish Peaks had been considered for inclusion in previous \nwilderness bills. However, because of unresolved issues it was not \nappropriate to designate it in the past. Those issues included various \ninholdings, the use of an old access road in the wilderness area, as \nwell as the potential coal bed methane production on portions of the \nland. Those issues have either been resolved in this bill or they have \nbeen resolved through other methods. The resolution of these issues has \nmaintained the integrity of the proposed wilderness area as well as \nprotecting the needs of the local community.\n  Because of this, the legislation should have the backing of the local \ncommunity, Colorado environmental groups, and the majority of the \nColorado delegation. There is no reason why it cannot be passed \nquickly.\n  All Colorado wilderness bills should go through the process this bill \nwent through. Congressman McInnis, Congressman Schaffer and I decided \nthat cooperation, consensus, and communication were essential to \nsuccess. Therefore, we casted our net broadly for concerns, and when \nthey were raised in good faith we actually sat down and worked them \nout. I have been struck by the fact that when people are given the \nopportunity to be part of the process they feel like they have a stake \nin the outcome and they try to be constructive in their criticisms. \nBecause of constructive critics like the Huerfano County Commissioners, \nthis legislation is better now then it was when they first looked at \nit.\n  Whil the legislation is complete, we are still seeking clarification \non one point. The Huerfano County Commissioners are seeking to have a \ntrail that is slightly inside the wilderness area, as designated in the \nlegislation, excluded. My staff has spoken with the local Forest \nService staffer and they appear to have no objection to this change. It \nis still uncertain whether we actually need to change the legislation \nto do this or whether the map can be adjusted by the Forest Service \nwithout any legislative changes. If it is the former than we will make \nthat change prior to passing it out of the Senate. If it is the latter, \nwe will exchange letters with the Forest Service to ensure we are \ntalking about the same trail in the same place. This change should not \nbe of concern. It is only slightly inside the boundaries and any \nchanges we make to exclude it would be of only a slight impact on the \nentire designation.\n  I want to thank Congressman McInnis, Congressman Schaffer, and the \nlocal community for working through this process. When the Colorado \ndelegation works as a team they work the best for the State of \nColorado.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 504. A bill to reform Federal election campaigns; to the Committee \non Rules and Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2096-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2111-S2130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE FEDERAL ELECTION ENFORCEMENT AND DISCLOSURE REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President. I rise today to address the important \nissue of campaign finance reform. As we begin the 106th Congress, \ncampaign finance reform continues to be an important national need. \nTherefore, I am again introducing my Federal Election Enforcement And \nDisclosure Reform Act with the hope that this will be the year that \nCongress makes positive strides towards meaningful reform.\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\n  After participating in the Governmental Affairs Committee's extensive \n1997 campaign finance hearings, it was apparent to me that there is a \ncritical need for reform of our entire campaign finance system. What I \nwitnessed, heard and read made me even more convinced that we must \nstrengthen our campaign financing laws, and provide strong enforcement \nthrough the Federal Election Commission of these laws, or risk seeing \nour election process be swept away in a tidal wave of money. In spite \nof public support, and positive action in the House, the Senate failed \nlast year to enact meaningful legislation addressing these problems, \nand we have now gone through yet another election cycle in which the \nabuses continued to persist. With the record high of $1 billion spent \nin pursuit of federal office in 1996--a 73 percent increase since 1992, \nI had hoped that the 1998 election would at least reflect a natural \ndecline from the grossly inflated figures. However, post-election \nreports filed with the FEC show that spending in Senate general \nelection campaigns went from $220.8 million in 1996, to $244.3 in 1998, \nan 11% increase. It has been estimated that if these trends continue, \nby 2025 it will take $145 million to finance an average Senate \ncampaign. This absurd trend cannot continue.\n  Although the Senate failed last year to enact meaningful reform, I am \nhopeful that, with a new Congress, we will take up this important issue \nin earnest. The legislation I am re-introducing today, the Federal \nElection Enforcement and Disclosure Reform Act, addresses one of the \nmost serious problems with our current system, the inability of the \nFederal Election Commission (FEC) to adequately enforce our existing \ncampaign laws. I recently read a compelling article entitled ``No Cop \non the Beat,'' which appeared in the January 23, 1999 issue of the \nNational Journal. The author, Eliza Newlin Carney, perhaps summarizes \nbest the current judgment on the effectiveness of the FEC when she \nstates that ``[a] long-standing joke around town is that the commission \nis a government success story: It is precisely the weak and ineffective \nagency that Congress intended it to be.''\n  The article was written following a December 1998 FEC hearing on the \n1996 elections during which FEC auditors alleged that the national \ncampaign committees of both major parties violated campaign finance \nrules with respect to broadcast advertising. Although party leaders \nmaintained that the advertisements in question were legitimate \n``issue'' ads appropriately paid for by millions of dollars in ``soft'' \nmoney, based on their investigation, the FEC auditors alleged that they \nwere illegal ads which caused both major party Presidential campaigns \nto exceed the federal spending limit and, more importantly, allowed \nboth campaigns to ``essentially bilk . . . the federal Treasury out of \nno less than $25 million.'' The auditors recommended that the campaigns \nrepay the money. However, the commissioners unanimously rejected these \nrecommendations and refused to specifically address the alleged \ngrievous violations of federal campaign laws.\n  Although the author of the National Journal piece is very critical of \nthe enforcement system, her criticism correctly does not end with the \nFEC. ``[T]he FEC isn't the only cop that seems to have deserted the \nbeat.'' According to the author, the FEC's refusal to enforce the \ncampaign regulations has also had a chilling effect on the Justice \nDepartment's willingness to complete thorough investigations of the \nabuses in the 1996 election cycle. Furthermore, she points out that \nlast year Congress again failed to enact new campaign finance laws to \nhelp correct the problems. She concludes by mentioning the movement by \nsome politicians to totally deregulate the system--``By default, the \nno-holds-barred camp seems to be winning. Their deregulation model is \nstarting to look an awful lot like the system we have today.''\n  As we can see in the preliminary preparations already underway, the \n2000 election cycle is likely to be heading in the same direction and I \nbelieve that this is the optimal time for us to act in order to prevent \nsuch abuses. Although my bill will not address all of the campaign \nfinance system problems, it will revitalize the Federal Election \nCommission to enable it to more effectively enforce current campaign \nfinance laws, and to close some loopholes in current campaign \ndisclosure requirements in order to provide the American people with \nmore comprehensive and more timely information on campaign finances.\n  As I made clear last year, I do not intend my legislation to fix all \nof the problems with the campaign finance system. It is my \nunderstanding that Senators McCain and Feingold also intend to re-\nintroduce their important legislation, which I intend to again co-\nsponsor. I continue to believe that enactment of McCain-Feingold or \nsimilar legislation is an essential step for the Senate to take this \nyear in beginning the process of repairing a campaign finance system \nwhich is totally out of control. Banning soft money and imposing \ndisclosure and contribution requirements on sham issue ads aired close \nto an election, as provided for under McCain-Feingold, are absolutely \nvital reforms, without which the campaign finance system will only grow \nless accountable, and more vulnerable to the appearance, if not the \nfact, of undue influence by big money.\n  However, I want to broaden the scope of debate, and to begin the \nprocess of seeking common ground on important reforms which go beyond \nthe problems of soft money and issue ads. As previously discussed, one \nof the most glaring deficiencies in our current federal campaign system \nis the ineffectiveness of its supposed referee, the Federal Election \nCommission. The FEC, whether by design or through circumstance, has \nbeen beset by partisan gridlock, uncertain and insufficient resources, \nand lengthy proceedings which offer no hope of timely resolution of \ncharges of campaign violations.\n  Thus, the first major element of my bill is to strengthen the ability \nof the Federal Election Commission to be an effective and impartial \nenforcer of federal campaign laws. Among the most significant FEC-\nrelated changes I am proposing are the following:\n  Alter the Commission structure to remove the possibility of partisan \ngridlock by establishing a 7-member Commission, appointed by the \nPresident based on qualifications, for single 7-year terms. The \nCommission would be composed of two Republicans, two Democrats, one \nthird party member, and two members nominated by the Supreme Court.\n  Give the FEC independent litigating authority, including before the \nSupreme Court, and establish a right of private civil action to seek \ncourt enforcement in cases where the FEC fails to act, both of which \nshould dramatically improve the prospects for timely enforcement of the \nlaw.\n  Provide sufficient funding of the FEC from a source independent of \nCongressional intervention by the imposition of filing fees on federal \ncandidates, with such fees being adequate to meet the needs of the \nCommission--estimated to be $50 million a year.\n  A second major component of the Federal Election Enforcement and \nDisclosure Reform Act is to create a new Advisory Committee on Federal \nCampaign Reform to provide for a body outside of Congress to \ncontinually review and recommend changes in our federal campaign \nsystem. The Committee would be charged, ``to study the laws (including \nregulations) that affect how election campaigns for Federal office are \nconducted and the implementation of such laws and may make \nrecommendations for change,'' which are to be submitted to Congress by \nApril 15 of every odd-numbered year. As with the FEC, the Advisory \nCommittee would receive independent and sufficient funding via the new \nfederal candidate filing fees.\n  The impetus for the Advisory Committee is two-fold: (1) to build a \n``continuous improvement'' mechanism into the Federal campaign system, \nand (2) to address the demonstrable fact that Congress responds slowly, \nif at all, to the need for changes and updates in our campaign laws. In \nboth instances, the conclusion is the same: we cannot afford to wait \ntwenty-five years or until a major scandal develops to adapt our \ncampaign finance system to changing circumstances.\n  The final section of my bill seeks to enhance the effectiveness of \ncampaign\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\ncontribution disclosure requirements. As Justice Brandeis observed, \n``Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial \ndiseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric \nlight the most effective policeman.'' This is certainly true in the \nrealm of campaign finance, and perhaps the most enduring legacy of the \nWatergate Reforms of a quarter-century ago is the expanded campaign and \nfinancial disclosure requirements which emerged. By and large, they \nhave served us well, but as with everything else, they need to be \nperiodically reviewed and updated in light of experience. Therefore, \nbased in part on testimony I heard during the 1997 Governmental Affairs \nCommittee investigation and in part on the FEC's own recommendations \nfor improved disclosure, my bill will make several changes in current \ndisclosure requirements.\n  Specifically, I am recommending two reforms which will make it more \ndifficult for contributors and campaigns alike to turn a blind eye to \ncurrent disclosure requirements by, first, preventing a campaign from \ndepositing a contribution until all of the requisite disclosure \ninformation is provided; and second, requiring those who contribute \n$200 or more to provide a signed certification that their contribution \nis not from a foreign national, and is not the result of a contribution \nin the name of another person.\n  In addition, my legislation adopts a number of disclosure \nrecommendations made by the FEC in its 1997 report to Congress, \nincluding provisions: requiring all reports to be filed by the due date \nof the report; requiring all authorized candidate committee reports to \nbe filed on a campaign-to-date basis, rather than on a calendar year \ncycle; and mandating monthly reporting for multi candidate committees \nwhich have raised or spent, or anticipate raising or spending, in \nexcess of $100,000 in the current election cycle.\n  It is easy to be pessimistic when considering campaign finance reform \nefforts especially after last year's inaction by the Senate. The public \nand the media are certainly expecting Congress to fail to take \nsignificant action to clean up the scandalous campaign system under \nwhich we now run. But ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I suggest \nthat we cannot afford the luxury of complacency. We may think we will \nbe able to win the next re-election because the level of outrage and \nthe awareness of the extent of the vulnerability of our political \nsystem have perhaps not yet reached critical mass. But I am confident \nthat it is only a matter of time, and perhaps the next election cycle--\nwhich will undoubtedly feature more unaccountable soft money, more sham \nissue ads of unknown parentage, more circumvention of the spirit and in \nsome cases the letter of current campaign finance law--before the \nscales are decisively tilted in favor of reform.\n  We will have campaign finance reform. The only question is whether \nthis Congress will step up to the plate, and fulfill its \nresponsibilities, to give the American people a campaign system they \ncan have faith in and which can preserve and protect our noble \ndemocracy as we enter a new century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Summary of Federal Election Enforcement and Disclosure Reform Act\n\n\n                             i. fec reform\n\n       A. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) would be \n     restructured as follows:\n       The Commission will be composed of 7 members appointed by \n     the President who are specially qualified to serve on the \n     Commission by reason of relevant knowledge: two Republican \n     members appointed by the President; two Democratic members \n     appointed by the President; one member appointed by the \n     President from among all other political parties whose \n     candidates received at least 3% of the national popular vote \n     in the most recent Presidential or U.S. House or U.S. Senate \n     elections; in the event no third party reached this \n     threshold, the President may consider all third parties in \n     making this appointment; and two members appointed by the \n     President from among 10 nominees submitted by the U.S. \n     Supreme Court. One of these two members would be chosen by \n     the Commission to serve as Chairman.\n       Relevant knowledge (for purposes of qualification for \n     appointment to the FEC) is defined to include:\n       A higher education degree in government, politics, or \n     public or business administration, or 4 years of relevant \n     work experience in the fields of government or politics, and\n       A minimum of two years experience in working on or in \n     relation to Federal election law or other Federal electoral \n     issues, or four years of such experience at the state level.\n       Commissioners will be limited to one 7 year term.\n       B. The FEC would be given the following additional powers:\n       Electronic filing of all reports required to be filed with \n     the FEC would be mandatory, with a waiver permitted for \n     candidates or other entities whose total expenditures or \n     receipts fall below a threshold amount set by the Commission. \n     The requirement for the submission of hard (paper) copies of \n     such reports would be continued.\n       The Commission would be authorized to conduct random audits \n     and investigations in order to increase voluntary compliance \n     with campaign finance laws.\n       The FEC would be authorized to seek court enforcement when \n     the Commission believes a substantial violation is occurring, \n     failure to act will result in ``irreparable harm'' to an \n     affected party, expeditious action will not cause ``undue \n     harm'' to the interests of other parties, and the public \n     interest would best be served by the issuance of an \n     injunction.\n       The Commission would be authorized to implement expedited \n     procedures for complaints filed within 60 days of a general \n     election.\n       Penalties for knowing and willful violations of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act would be increased.\n       The Commission would be expressly granted independent \n     litigating authority, including before the Supreme Court.\n       Private individuals or groups would be authorized to \n     independently seek court enforcement when the FCC fails to \n     act within 120 days of when a complaint is filed. A ``loser \n     pays'' standard would apply in such proceedings.\n       The Commission would be authorized to levy fines, not to \n     exceed $5,000, for minor reporting violations, and to publish \n     a schedule for fines for such violations.\n       Candidates for the Senate would be required to file with \n     the FEC rather than the Secretary of the Senate.\n       C. The FEC would be provided with resources in the \n     following manner:\n       Consistent with its expanded duties, the FEC would be \n     authorized to receive $50 million in FY2000 and FY2001, with \n     this amount indexed for inflation thereafter.\n       The funding would be derived from a ``user fee'' imposed on \n     federal candidate and party committees. The FEC would \n     establish a fee schedule and determine the requisite fee \n     level to fund the operations of the FEC and the new Advisory \n     Committee on Federal Campaign Reform. This determination will \n     include a waiver for the first $50,000 raised by campaigns.\n\n\n           ii. advisory committee on federal campaign reform\n\n       A. A new Advisory Committee on Federal Campaign Reform \n     would be created.\n       B. The Committee would be composed of 9 members, who are \n     specially qualified to serve on the Committee by reason of \n     relevant knowledge, to be appointed as follows: 1 appointed \n     by the President of the United States, 1 appointed by the \n     Speaker of the House, 1 each appointed by the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders of the U.S. House and Senate, 1 appointed by \n     the Supreme Court, 1 appointed by the Reform Party (or \n     whatever third party's candidate for President received the \n     largest number of popular votes in the most recent \n     Presidential election), and 1 appointed by the American \n     Political Science Association. Committee members would elect \n     the Chairman.\n       C. Committee members would each serve four-year terms, and \n     would be limited to two consecutive terms.\n       D. The appointees by the Supreme Court, the Reform Party \n     (or other third party), and the American Political Science \n     Association must be individuals who, during the five years \n     before their appointment, have not held elective office as a \n     member of the Democratic or Republican Parties, have not \n     received any wages or salaries from the Democratic or \n     Republican Parties, or have not provided substantial \n     volunteer services or made any substantial contribution to \n     the Democratic or Republican Parties, or to a Democratic or \n     Republican party public office-holder or candidate for \n     office.\n       E. Relevant knowledge (for purposes of qualification for \n     appointment to the Committee) is defined to include:\n       A higher education degree in government, politics, or \n     public or business administration, or 4 years of relevant \n     work experience in the fields of government or politics, and\n       A minimum of two years experience in working on or in \n     relation to national campaign finance or other electoral \n     issues, or four years of such experience at the state level.\n       F. The Committee would be authorized to spend $1 million a \n     year in its first year, indexed for inflation thereafter. \n     Funding would be provided by the new campaign user fee \n     discussed above.\n       G. The Committee would be required to monitor the operation \n     of federal election laws and to submit a report, including \n     recommended changes in law, to Congress by April 15 of every \n     odd numbered year.\n       H. Congress would be required to consider the Committee's \n     recommendations under ``fast track'' procedures to guarantee \n     expeditious consideration in both houses of Congress.\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\n               iii. enhanced campaign finance disclosure\n\n       A. Campaign would be prohibited from putting contributions \n     which lack all requisite contributor information into any \n     account other than an escrow account from which money cannot \n     be spent. Contributions placed in such an account would not \n     be subject to the current ten-day maximum holding period on \n     checks.\n       B. A new requirement would be placed on contributions in \n     excess of $200 (aggregate): a written certification by the \n     contributor that the contribution is not derived from any \n     foreign income source, and is not the result of a \n     reimbursement by another party.\n       C. The current option to file reports submitted by \n     registered or certified mail based on postmark date would be \n     deleted, thus requiring all reports to be filed by the due \n     date of the report.\n       D. Authorized candidate committee reports would be required \n     to be filed on a campaign-to-date basis, rather than on a \n     calendar year cycle.\n       E. Monthly reporting would be mandated for multi candidate \n     committees which have raised or spent, or anticipate raising \n     or spending, in excess of $100,000 in the current election \n     cycle.\n       F. The requirement for filing of last-minute independent \n     expenditures would be clarified to make clear that such \n     report must be received within 24 hours after the independent \n     expenditure is made.\n       G. Campaign disbursements to secondary payees who are \n     independent subcontractors would have to be reported.\n       H. Political committees, other than authorized candidate \n     committees, which have received or spent, or anticipate \n     receiving or spending, $100,000 or more in the current \n     election cycle would be subjected to the same ``last minute'' \n     contribution reporting requirements as candidate committees. \n     (Under current law, all contributions of $1,000 or more \n     received after the 205th day, but before 48 hours, before an \n     election must be reported to the FEC within 48 hours.)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 506. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the provisions which allow nonrefundable personal \ncredits to be fully allowed against regular tax liability; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nensure that middle income working families receive the tax credits that \nCongress intended for them.\n  There are many absurdities in our tax code, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to reform and simplify our entire tax \nsystem. Today, however, I offer a small first step toward making our \ntax laws sensible. The legislation I am introducing will protect \nmillions of working families by allowing taxpayers to deduct their \nnonrefundable personal credits without having to include those credits \nin any determination of Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) liability. Tax \nlaws created to deal with wealthy folks who overuse tax shelters simply \nshould not apply to middle income families. This legislation is \nnecessary, and it will actually remove language from the tax code \nmaking it more simple and more user friendly.\n  Imagine for a moment two working parents in Arkansas making $33,800. \nThey work hard to spread their incomes far enough to pay their mortgage \nand care for their two school-age children and one in college. It may \nsurprise you to know that this family falls under a tax burden that was \ncreated to ensure that the very wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. \nThis family would have to pay the AMT.\n  While the threshold income limits of the AMT have been set since \n1986, incomes have slowly crept up due to inflation. This, coupled with \nthe inclusion of family tax credits in AMT liability determination, has \nled to the ironic situation that my legislation seeks to correct. The \nAlternative Minimum Tax must be changed so that a family will not be \nstrapped with an added tax burden simply because they choose to have \nchildren or educate them.\n  Not only must we change the AMT, we must change it permanently. Last \nyear, Congress provided a one year provision which removed the \nnonrefundable personal credits from AMT liability determination. I was \npleased to see the President extend this provision for two more years \nin his budget. But we need to fix this problem permanently rather than \nusing a band-aid approach of year-to-year alterations.\n  The AMT is a looming peril for a massive number of middle-income \nAmericans. Two Treasury Department economists recently projected that \nthe number of households earning from $30,000 to $50,000 that are \nsubjected to the AMT will more than triple in the coming decade. \nBecause the individual AMT parameters are not indexed for inflation, \n2.8 million taxpayers will completely lose these important family \ncredits by 2008. On top of this injustice, many unwitting taxpayers \nwill owe penalties and interest on underpaid taxes. Such a situation \ncannot be allowed to exist. While Congress must soon address the issue \nof indexing the AMT for inflation, permanently removing the \nnonrefundable personal credits from the reach of the AMT is the first \nstep to ensuring that America's middle-income taxpayers will receive \nthe financial relief they deserve while avoiding the confusion and \nfrustration of year-to-year tax legislation.\n  American families were given a child tax credit to help them raise \ntheir kids. Education credits were created to help make a college \neducation more affordable for all Americans. These tax credits are good \nfor families. They are important to working people and they are great \nfor the long term future of our economy. As our law currently stands, \nhowever, many middle-income families will not be able to use these \ncredits because they will be either totally eliminated or significantly \nreduced by the AMT. The education and child credits are not, however, \nthe only credits that stand to be voided by the growing menace of the \nAMT. People who bring children into their homes will lose the value of \nthe adoption credit. The credit for the elderly and the disabled will \nlose its value, and the dependant care credit will be effectively \ncanceled by the AMT. This is absurd and the problem must be rectified.\n  I would like to thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenate Moynihan, and his very capable staffer, Stan Fendley, for \nworking with me on this legislation. And I'd like to thank Senators \nMoynihan, Cochran, Breaux, Kerrey, and Landrieu for signing on as \noriginal co-sponsors. I encourage our colleagues to join us in this \ncommon sense approach to helping working families.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record with these comments as well as the January 10, 1999 New York \nTimes article by David Cay Johnston titled ``Funny, They Don't Look \nLike Fat Cats.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 506\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NONREFUNDABLE PERSONAL CREDITS FULLY ALLOWED \n                   AGAINST REGULAR TAX LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 26(a) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to limitation based on amount of tax) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Limitation Based on Amount of Tax.--The aggregate \n     amount of credits allowed by this subpart for the taxable \n     year shall not exceed the taxpayer's regular tax liability \n     for the taxable year.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 24(d) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking paragraphs (2) \n     and by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (2).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1998.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 10, 1999]\n\n                  Funny, They Don't Look Like Fat Cats\n\n                        (By David Cay Johnston)\n\n       Three decades ago, Congress, embarrassed by the disclosure \n     that 155 wealthy Americans had paid no Federal income taxes, \n     enacted legislation aimed at preventing the very rich from \n     shielding their wealth in tax shelters.\n       Today, that legislation, creating the alternative minimum \n     tax, is instead snaring a rapidly growing number of middle-\n     class taxpayers, forcing them to pay additional tax or to \n     lose some of their tax breaks.\n       Of the more than two million taxpayers who will be subject \n     this year to the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., about \n     half have incomes of $30,000 to $100,000. Some are single \n     parents with jobs; some are people making as little as $527 a \n     week. Over all, the number of people affected by the tax is \n     expected to grow 26 percent a year for the next decade.\n       But many of the wealthy will not be among them. Even with \n     the A.M.T., the number of taxpayers making more than $200,000 \n     who pay no taxes has risen to more than 2,000 each year.\n       How a 1969 law aimed at the tax-shy rich became a growing \n     burden on moderate earners illustrates how tax policy in \n     Washington can be a fall of mirrors.\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\n       While some Republican Congressmen favor eliminating the \n     tax, other lawmakers say such a move would be an expensive \n     tax break for the wealthy--or at lest would be perceived that \n     way, and thus would be politically unpalatable. And any \n     overhaul of the system would need to compensate for the $6.6 \n     billion that individuals now pay under the A.M.T. This year, \n     such payments will account for almost 1 percent of all \n     individual income tax revenue.\n       ``This is a classic case of both Congress and the \n     Administration agreeing that the tax doesn't make much sense, \n     but not being able to agree on doing anything about it,'' \n     said C. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban \n     Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.\n       Mr. Steuerle was a Treasury Department tax official in \n     1986, when an overhaul of the tax code set the stage for \n     drawing the middle class into the A.M.T.\n       In eliminating most tax shelters for the wealthy, Congress \n     decided to treat exemptions for children and deductions for \n     medical expenses just like special credits for investors in \n     oil wells, in they cut too deeply into a household's taxable \n     income.\n       Congress decided that once these ``tax preferences'' \n     exceeded certain amounts--$40,000 for a married couple, for \n     example--people would be moved out of the regular income tax \n     and into the alternative minimum tax. At the time, the \n     threshold was high enough to affect virtually no one but the \n     rich. But it has since been raised only once--by 12.5 \n     percent, to $45,000 for a married couple--while the cost of \n     living has risen 43 percent. And so the limits have sneaked \n     up on growing numbers of taxpayers of more modest means.\n       ``Everyone knew back then that it had problems that had to \n     be fixed,'' Mr. Steuerle recalled. ``They just said, `next \n     year.' ''\n       But ``next year'' has never come--and it is unlikely to \n     arrive in 1999, either. While tax policy experts have known \n     for years that the middle class would be drawn into the \n     A.M.T., few taxpayers have been clamoring for change.\n       Among those few, however, are David and Margaret Klaassen \n     of Marquette, Kan. Mr. Klaassen, a lawyer who lives and works \n     out of a farmhouse, made $89,751.07 in 1997 and paid $5,989 \n     in Federal income taxes. Four weeks ago, the Internal Revenue \n     Service sent the Klaassens a notice demanding $3,761 more \n     under the alternative minimum tax, including a penalty \n     because the I.R.S. said the Klaassens knew they owed the \n     A.M.T.\n       Mr. Klaassen acknowledges that he knew the I.R.S. would \n     assert that he was subject to the A.M.T., but he says the law \n     was not meant to apply to his family. ``I've never invested \n     in a tax shelter,'' he said. ``I don't even have municipal \n     bonds.''\n       The Klaassens do, however, have 13 children and their \n     attendant medical expenses--including the costs of caring for \n     their second son, Aaron, 17, who has battled leukemia for \n     years. It was those exemptions and deductions that subjected \n     them to the A.M.T.\n       ``What kind of policy taxes you for spending money to save \n     your child's life?'' Mr. Klaassen asked.\n       The tax affects taxpayers in three ways. Some, like the \n     Klaassens, pay the tax at either a 26 percent or a 28 percent \n     rate because they have more than $45,000 in exemptions and \n     deductions. Others do not pay the A.M.T. itself, but they \n     cannot take the full tax breaks they would have received \n     under the regular income tax system without running up \n     against limits set by the A.M.T. The A.M.T. can also convert \n     tax-exempt income from certain bonds and from exercising \n     incentive stock options into taxable income.\n       It may be useful to think of the alternative minimum tax as \n     a parallel universe to the regular income tax system, similar \n     in some ways but more complex and with its own \n     classifications of deductions, its own rates and its own \n     paperwork. The idea was that taxpayers who had escaped the \n     regular tax universe by piling on credits and deductions \n     would enter this new universe to pay their fair share. \n     (Likewise, there is a corporate A.M.T. that parallels the \n     corporate income tax.)\n       At first, the burden of the A.M.T. fell mainly on the \n     shoulders of business owners and investors, said Robert S. \n     McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a \n     nonprofit group in Washington that says the tax system favors \n     the rich. Based on I.R.S. data, Mr. McIntyre said he found \n     that 37 percent of A.M.T. revenue in 1990 was a result of \n     business owners using losses from previous years to reduce \n     their regular income taxes; an additional 18 percent was \n     because of big deductions for state and local taxes.\n       But that has begun to shift, largely as a result of the \n     1986 changes, which eliminated most tax shelters and lowered \n     tax rates.\n       When President Reagan and Congress were overhauling the tax \n     code, they could not make the projected revenues under the \n     new rules equal those under the old system. Huge, and \n     growing, budget deficits made it politically essential for \n     the official estimates to show that after tax reform, the \n     same amount of money would flow to Washington.\n       One solution, said Mr. Steuerle, the former Treasury \n     official, was to count personal and dependent exemptions and \n     some medical expenses as preferences to be reduced or ignored \n     under the A.M.T., just as special credits for petroleum \n     investments and other tax shelters are.\n       Mortgage interest and charitable gifts were not counted as \n     preferences, according to tax policy experts who worked on \n     the legislation, because they generated more money than was \n     needed.\n       But the A.M.T. has not stayed ``revenue neutral,'' in \n     Washington parlance.\n       The regular income tax was indexed for inflation in 1984, \n     so that taxpayers would not get pushed into higher tax \n     brackets simply because their income kept pace with the cost \n     of living.\n       The A.M.T. limits, however, have not been indexed. The \n     total allowable exemptions before the tax kicks in have been \n     fixed since 1993 at $45,000 for a married couple filing \n     jointly. For unmarried people, the total amount is now \n     $33,750, and for married people filing separately, it is \n     $22,500.\n       If the limit had been indexed since 1986, when the A.M.T. \n     was overhauled, it would be about $57,000 for married couples \n     filing jointly--and most middle-income households would still \n     be exempt.\n       Mr. Steuerle said he warned at the time that including \n     ``normal, routine deductions and exemptions that everyone \n     takes'' in the list of preferences would eventually turn the \n     A.M.T. into a tax on the middle class.\n       That appears to be exactly what has happened.\n       For example, a married person who makes just $527 a week \n     and files her tax return separately can be subject to the \n     tax, said David S. Hulse, an assistant professor of \n     accounting at the University of Kentucky.\n       And the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which allows a $500-a-\n     child tax credit as well as education credits, may make even \n     more middle-class families subject to the A.M.T. by reducing \n     the value of those credits.\n       Two Treasury Department economists recently calculated that \n     largely because of the new credits, the number of households \n     making $30,000 to $50,000 who must pay the alternative \n     minimum tax will more than triple in the coming decade. The \n     economists, Robert Rebelein and Jerry Tempalski, also \n     calculated that for households making $15,000 to $30,000 \n     annually, A.M.T. payments will grow 25-fold, to $1.2 billion, \n     by 2008.\n       Last year, many more people would have been subject to the \n     A.M.T. if Congress had not made a last-minute fix pushed by \n     Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, \n     that--for 1998 only--exempted the new child and education \n     credits. The move came after I.R.S. officials told Congress \n     that the credits added enormous complexity to calculating tax \n     liability. Figuring out how much the A.M.T. would reduce the \n     credits was beyond the capacity of most taxpayers and even \n     many paid tax preparers, the I.R.S. officials said.\n       EVEN if Congress makes a permanent fix to the problems \n     created by the child and education credits, it will put only \n     a minor drag on the spread of the A.M.T. as long as the tax \n     is not indexed for inflation. The two Treasury economists \n     calculated that revenues from the tax would climb to $25 \n     billion in 2008 without a fix, or to $21.9 billion with one.\n       In 1999, if there is no exemption for the credits, a single \n     parent who does not itemize deductions but who makes $50,000 \n     and takes a credit for the costs of caring for two children \n     while he works, will be subject to the A.M.T., estimated \n     Jeffrey Pretsfelder, an editor at RIA Group, a publisher of \n     tax information for professionals.\n       If the tax laws are not changed, 8.8 million taxpayers will \n     have to pay the A.M.T. a decade from now, the Congressional \n     Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last month. Add in the \n     taxpayers who will not receive the full value of their \n     deductions because they run up against the limits set by the \n     A.M.T., and the total grows to 11.6 million taxpayers--92 \n     percent of whom have incomes of less than $200,000, the two \n     Treasury economists estimated.\n       While many lawmakers and Treasury officials have criticized \n     the impact of the tax on middle-class taxpayers, there are \n     few signs of change, as Republicans and the Administration \n     talk past each others.\n       Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who as the \n     chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is the chief \n     tax writer, said the A.M.T. should be eliminated in the next \n     budget.\n       ``Unfortunately, the A.M.T. tax can penalize large \n     families, which is part of the reason why Republicans for \n     years have tried to eliminate it or at least reduce it,'' Mr. \n     Archer said. ``Unfortunately, President Clinton blocked our \n     efforts each time.''\n       Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said \n     the Administration was ``very concerned that the A.M.T. has a \n     growing impact on middle-class families, including by \n     diluting the child credit, education credits and other \n     crucial tax benefits, and we hope to address this issue in \n     the President's budget.\n       ``Subject to budget constraints, we look forward to working \n     with Congress on this important issue,'' he continued.\n       That revenue concerns have thwarted exempting the middle \n     class runs counter to the reason Congress initially imposed \n     the tax.\n       ``You need an A.M.T. because people who make a lot of money \n     should pay some income taxes,'' said Mr. McIntrye, of \n     Citizens for Tax Justice. ``If you believe, like Mr. Archer \n     and a lot of Republicans do, that the more you make the less \n     in taxes you should pay, then of course you are against the \n     A.M.T. But somehow I don't think some people see it that \n     way.''\n       The Klaassens, meanwhile, are challenging the A.M.T. in \n     Federal Court. The United\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\n     States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is scheduled to \n     hear arguments in March on their claim that the tax infringes \n     their religious freedom. The Klaassens, who are \n     Presbyterians, said they believe children ``are a blessing \n     from God, and so we do not practice birth control,'' Mr. \n     Klaassen said.\n       When Mr. Klaassen wrote to an I.R.S. official complaining \n     that a $1,085 bill for the A.M.T. for 1994 resulted from the \n     size of his family, he got back a curt letter saying that his \n     ``analysis of the alternative minimum tax's effect on large \n     families was interesting but inappropriate'' and advising him \n     that it was medical deductions, not family size, that \n     subjected him to the A.M.T.\n       Under the regular tax system, medical expenses above 7.5 \n     percent of adjusted gross income--the last line on the front \n     page of Form 1040--are deductible. Under the A.M.T., the \n     threshold is raised to 10 percent.\n       Still doubting the I.S.R.'s math, Mr. Klaassen decided to \n     test what would have happened had he filed the same tax \n     return, changing only the number of children he claimed as \n     dependents. He found that if he has seven or fewer children, \n     the A.M.T. would not have applied in 1994.\n       But the eighth child set off the A.M.T., at a cost of $223. \n     Having nine children raised the bill to $717. And 10 \n     children, the number he had in 1994, increased that sum to \n     $1,085--the amount the I.R.S. said was due.\n       ``We love this country and we believe in paying taxes,'' \n     Mr. Klaassen said. ``But we cannot believe that Congress ever \n     intended to apply this tax to our family solely because of \n     how many children we  choose to have. And I have shown that \n     we are subject to the AMT solely because we have chosen \n     not to limit the size of our family.''\n       The IRS, in papers opposing the Klaassens, noted that tax \n     deductions are not a right but a matter of ``legislative \n     grace.''\n       Mr. Klaassen turned to the Federal courts after losing in \n     Tax court. The opinion by Tax Court Judge Robert N. Armen Jr. \n     was summed up this way by Tax Notes, a magazine that \n     critiques tax policy: ``Congress intended the alternative \n     minimum tax to affect large families when it made personal \n     exemptions a preference item.''\n       Several tax experts said that Mr. Klaassen had little \n     chance of success in the courts because the statute treating \n     children as tax preferences was clear. They also said that \n     nothing in the AMT laws was specifically aimed at his \n     religious beliefs.\n       Meanwhile, for people who make $200,000 or more, the AMT \n     will be less of a burden this year because of the Taxpayer \n     Relief Act of 1997, which included a provision lowering the \n     maximum tax rate on capital gains for both the regular tax \n     and the AMT to 20 percent.\n       Mr. Rebelein and Mr. Tempalski, the Treasury Department \n     economists, calculated recently that people making more than \n     $200,000 would pay a total of 4 percent less in AMT for 1998 \n     because of the 1997 law. By 2008, their savings will be 9 \n     percent, largely as a result of lower capital gains rates and \n     changed accounting rules for business owners.\n       ``This law was passed to catch people who use tax shelters \n     to avoid their obligations,'' Mr. Klaassen said. ``But \n     instead of catching them it hits people like me. This is just \n     nuts.''\n\n\n                three ways to deal with a taxing problem\n\n       President Clinton, his tax policy advisers and the \n     Republicans who control the tax writing committees in \n     Congress all agree that the alternative minimum tax is a \n     growing problem for the middle class. But there is no \n     agreement on what to do. Here are some options that have been \n     discussed.\n       Raise the exemption--Representative Bill Archer, the Texas \n     Republican who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means \n     Committee, two years ago proposed raising the $45,000 AMT \n     exemption for a married couple by $1,000. But that would \n     leave many middle-class families subject to the tax, because \n     it would not fully account for inflation. To do that would \n     require an exemption of about $57,000, followed by automatic \n     inflation adjustments. That is the most widely favored \n     approach, drawing support from people like J.D. Foster, \n     executive director of the Tax Foundation, a group supported \n     by corporations, and Robert S. McIntyre, executive director \n     of Citizens for Tax Justice, which is financed in part by \n     unions and contends that the tax system favors the rich.\n       Exempt child and education credits--For 1998 only, Congress \n     exempted the child tax credit and the education tax credits \n     from the AMT. But millions of taxpayers will lose these \n     credits, or get only part of them, unless Congress makes a \n     fix each year or permanently exempts them.\n       Eliminate it--Mr. Archer and other Republicans want to get \n     rid of the AMT but have not proposed how to make up for the \n     lost revenue, which in a decade is expected to grow to $25 \n     billion annually. Recently, however, Mr. Archer has said that \n     in a period of Federal budget surpluses, it may be time to \n     scrap the budget rules that require paying for tax cuts with \n     reduced spending or tax increases elsewhere.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Bennett, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 507. A bill to provide for the conservation and development of \nwater and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \nconstruct various projects for improvements to rivers and harbors of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n              the water resources development act of 1999\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nlegislation to reauthorize the civil works mission of the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  I am joined today by the Chairman of the Committee on Environment and \nPubic Works, Senator Chafee; the Committee's Ranking Member, Senator \nBaucus; the new Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, Senator Voinovich; Senator Bennett, Senator Lautenberg, \nand Senator Boxer in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Since 1986, it has been the policy and practice of the Congress to \nreauthorize Corps of Engineers civil works activities--projects for \nflood control, navigation, hurricane protection and erosion control, \nand environmental restoration--on a two-year cycle. Last year, the \nSenate passed S. 2131 by unanimous consent. Regrettably, the House was \nunable to consider companion legislation.\n  In an effort to keep these critically needed projects on schedule, I \nam pleased that the Chairman Chafee and Majority Leader Lott have \nindicated their strong support for promptly considering this bill this \nyear. The bill I am introducing today mirrors S. 2131 passed last year \nwith updated cost estimates and project revisions provided by the Corps \nof Engineers.\n  This legislation authorizes the construction of 37 new flood control, \nnavigation, environmental restoration, hurricane protection and \nshoreline erosion control and recreation projects. It modifies 43 \npreviously authorized projects and calls on the Corps of Engineers to \nconduct 29 studies to determine the economic justification of future \nwater resource projects.\n  Mr. President, the landmark Water Resources Development Act of 1986 \nestablished the principle of cost-sharing of economically justified \nprojects that have a federal interest. Local interests are required to \nshare 35 percent of the cost of construction of flood control and \nhurricane protection and shoreline erosion control projects. The non-\nfederal financial requirements for navigation projects depend on the \ndepth of the project and range from 25 percent to 50 percent of the \ncost of construction.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is consistent with the cost \nsharing provisions of prior water resource laws. Also, the Committee \nhas been consistent in requiring that every new construction project \nreceive a cmpleted project report by the Chief of Engineers before it \nis included in this legislation.\n  As the former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, I commend Chairman Chafee and Senator Baucus for \nstanding firm in support of these cost-sharing and economic benefits \ntests. These policies have proven effective in authorizing projects \nthat are worthy of federal investment and have the strong support of \nlocal sponsors. No other approach has been more effective in weeding \nout questionable projects than requiring either a state or the local \ngovernment to contribute to the cost of engineering, design and \nconstruction of a project.\n  I am pleased that this financial commitments from local sponsors, \nthat have been thoroughly evaluated and received a report from the \nChief of Engineers, and have demonstrated that the economic benefits to \nbe achieved by the project exceed the federal costs.\n  These fundamental requirements are applied to each project and only \nthose that meet all of these tests are included in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is critically important to many \ncommunities who have already contributed significant resources to \nprepare these projects for authorization. There is ample evidence to \nconfirm that the federal investment in water resource projects is a \nwise investment of taxpayer dollars. In 1997 alone, Corps flood control \nprojects prevented approximately $45.2 billion in damages. The \ncontinued maintenance and deepening of our commercial waterways remains \ncritical to the U.S. successfully competing in a one-world marketplace. \nThe value of commerce on these waterways\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\ntotaled over $600 billion in 1996, generating 15.9 million jobs.\n  It is important for the Committee to enact this bill prior to the \nappropriations cycle this year. I pledge to work with my colleagues so \nthat the full Senate can soon consider this bill.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 507\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join other members \nof the Committee on Environment and Public Works in introducing the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1999. This measure, similar to water \nresources legislation enacted in 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1996, is \ncomprised of water resources project and study authorizations and \npolicy modifications for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works \nprogram.\n  The bill we are proposing today is virtually identical to legislation \nthat was approved unanimously by the Senate last October. That measure, \nS. 2131,\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\nwas sent to the House late in the previous Congress and, despite and \nbest efforts of our colleagues in the other body, went no further. As \nsuch, it is our desire to advance this year's bill as expeditiously as \npossible.\n  We have carefully reviewed each item within the bill and have \nincluded those that are consistent with the committee's traditional \nauthorization criteria. Mr. President, let me take a few moments here \nto discuss these criteria--that is--the criteria used by the Committee \nto judge project authorization requests.\n  On November 17, 1986, President Reagan signed into law the Water \nResources Development Act of 1986. Importantly, the 1986 act marked an \nend to the 16-year deadlock between Congress and the Executive Branch \nregarding authorization of the Army Corps Civil Works program.\n  In addition to authorizing numerous projects, the 1986 act resolved \nlongstanding disputes relating to cost-sharing between the Army Corps \nand non-federal sponsors, waterway user fees, environmental \nrequirements and, importantly, the types of projects in which Federal \ninvolvement is appropriate and warranted.\n  The criteria used to develop the legislation before us are consistent \nwith the reforms and procedures established in the landmark Water \nResources Development Act of 1986.\n  Is a project for flood control, navigation or some other purpose \ncost-shared in a manner consistent with the 1986 act?\n  Have all of the requisite reports and studies on economic, \nengineering and environmental feasibility been completed for a project?\n  Is a project consistent with the traditional and appropriate mission \nof the Army Corps?\n  Should the federal government be involved?\n  These, Mr. President, are the fundamental questions that we have \napplied to each and every project included here for authorization.\n  This legislation, only slightly modified from last year's Senate-\npassed bill, authorizes the Secretary of the Army to construct some 36 \nprojects for flood control, navigation, and environmental restoration. \nThe bill also modifies 43 existing Army Corps projects and authorizes \n29 project studies. In total, this bill authorizes an estimated federal \ncost of 2.1 billion dollars. The only significant changes in this \nyear's version are that we have extracted projects authorized in the \nFT99 Omnibus Appropriations Act.\n  Mr. President, this legislation includes other project-specific and \ngeneral provisions related to Army Corps operations. Among them are two \nprovisions sought by Senator Bond and others to enhance the environment \nalong the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. We have also included a \nmodified version of the Administration's so-called Challenge 21 \ninitiative to encourage more non-structural flood control and \nenvironmental projects. In addition, we are recommending that the cost-\nsharing formula be changed for maintenance of future shoreline \nprotection projects.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to indicate that we have encouraged \nour colleagues in the House of Representatives to try to resolve their \ndifferences on the proposed Sacramento, California, flood control \nproject. It seems to me that there are legitimate concerns and issues \non both sides, but I am optimistic that they will reach an agreement. I \nstand ready to do whatever I can to facilitate a successful resolution.\n  This legislation is vitally important for countless states and \ncommunities across the country. For economic and life-safety reasons, \nwe must maintain our harbors, ports and inland waterways, our flood \ncontrol levees and shorelines, and the environment. I ask for the \ncooperation of colleagues so that we can swiftly complete this \nunfinished business from 1998. It would be my strong desire to complete \naction on this bill within the next several weeks so that we can \nprepare for WRDA 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 509. A bill to amend the Peace Corps Act to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal years 2000 through 2003 to carry out that \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2111-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2130-S2136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Peace Corps Act Amendments\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Peace Corps \nand to join with my colleague Senator Paul Coverdell to introduce \nlegislation to make technical modifications to the Peace Corps Act.\n  The changes made by this legislation are purely technical and largely \ndesigned to remove certain outmoded restrictions on Peace Corps \nactivities. I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na section-by-section analysis of this bill at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Now let me turn to the general subject of the Peace Corps as today is \nthe thirty eighth anniversary of its establishment. Thirty eight years \nago, a young President recognized the power that American ingenuity, \nidealism and, most of all, volunteerism could have on the lives of \npeople around the world. In order to harness that energy, President \nKennedy formed a small army, not of soldiers to make war, but of \nvolunteers to build peace through mutual understanding.\n  Since its inception in 1961, more than 151,000 Peace Corps volunteers \nhave battled against the scourges of malnutrition, illiteracy and \neconomic underdevelopment in 132 countries around the world. I can \nspeak with some personal experience about the Peace Corps as I have had \nthe privilege to serve as a volunteer. In fact, slightly more than \nthirty years ago, I arrived back in the United States after spending \ntwo years as a Peace Corps Volunteer in a rural village in the \nDominican Republic. Like many who heeded President Kennedy's call to do \nsomething larger than ourselves, to be a part of something greater than \nour own existence, my service in the Peace Corps remains one of the \nmost important periods in my life.\n  When I served in the Peace Corps, nearly all of us volunteers had \nsimilar experiences. We worked in small isolated villages with little \nin the way of modern conveniences. The world since that time has \nchanged and the Peace Corps has been evolving to meet new demands. \nToday's volunteers specialize in education, the environment, small \nbusiness, agriculture and other fields. In 1996, the Peace Corps \ndeveloped a ``Crisis Corps'' to provide short term emergency and \nhumanitarian assistance in situations ranging from natural disasters to \nrefugee crises. While many volunteers continue to live in remote \nvillages, this is no longer an iron clad rule. Some now labor in urban \nareas, passing on the skills needed to start and run businesses.\n  The more than 6,500 volunteers who today serve in 87 nations are a \nmore diverse group than the one I joined three decades ago. When I \nserved, the Corps was mostly male and mostly young. Today, however, \nnearly sixty percent of all volunteers are women, a quarter are over \n29, and six percent are over fifty. While the face and methods of the \nPeace Corps have changed over the years, its goal has remained \nconstant: to help people of other countries meet their needs for \ntrained personnel; to help promote understanding of the American people \nby those we serve; and to help promote better understanding among the \nAmerican people about the world beyond our borders.\n  By building bridges between the United States and other countries, \nthe Peace Corps advances our foreign policy by communicating America's \nvalues and ideas to other peoples around the globe.\n  It is an indication of the success of the Peace Corps that, while the \ncurrent class of volunteers is providing new services and working in \ncountries never served before, the demand continues to outpace supply. \nWe need only look at a newspaper, Mr. President, to see where Peace \nCorps volunteers are needed. In the Caribbean countries ravaged by \nHurricane Georges and Mitch, in formerly war-torn areas of Africa and \nin countries where the skills needed to start a business have been \nnearly erased by decades of communist rule. In order to meet these \nneeds, Congress and President Clinton have set the admirable goal of \nreaching 10,000 Peace Corps volunteers by 2000.\n  The Peace Corps, Mr. President, stands as an example of what is great \nabout the United States. Our volunteerism, humanity and sense of \njustice are proudly displayed in the face of each volunteer we send \noverseas. And\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\nevery time I meet volunteers about to embark on their two years of \nservice, I share their sense of excitement. If each of us, in our daily \nlives, work in the same spirit as those volunteers--helping those \naround us and sharing the values of our nation--the United States will \nindeed have a proud and bright future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was orderd printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Posts and \n     individuals must make decisions in this area at the risk of \n     having their travel costs disallowed. The Committee believes \n     that administrative provisions affecting foreign service \n     agencies should be as consistent as possible. For instance, a \n     Peace Corps employee who is flying with an AID employee to \n     attend a meeting should be able to fly on the same plane \n     without fear of being penalized under section 40118. This \n     provision would extend to Peace Corps employees and \n     Volunteers the same treatment now available to other foreign \n     service agency employees.\n       Section 2(b) makes technical changes to sections 5, 10 and \n     15 of the Peace Corps Act (hereinafter the Act) to reflect \n     changes in statutory citations that have occurred since \n     enactment of the Act.\n       Section 2(b)(1) strikes out `Civil Service Commission' in \n     section 5(f)(1)(B) and inserts in lieu thereof `Office of \n     Personnel Management.' The Civil Service Commission was \n     replaced by the Office of Personnel Management in 1966.\n       Section 2(b)(2) amends section 5(h) of the Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2504(h)) in several respects. It strikes out references to \n     the Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955 (5 U.S.C. 2171 et \n     seq.), the Act of June 4, 1954, chapter 264, section 4 (5 \n     U.S.C. 73b-5, the Act of December 23, 1944, chapter 716, \n     section 1, as amended (31 U.S.C. 492a) and inserts references \n     to 5 U.S.C. 5732 and 31 U.S.C. 3342. The Federal Voting \n     Assistance Act has been repealed and replaced by a provision \n     (42 U.S.C. 1973cc et seq.) which is available to all American \n     citizens overseas. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider \n     Volunteers federal employees to provide them with the \n     benefits of the Act; therefore, the reference to voter \n     assistance in this provision can be deleted. The replacement \n     of references to sections of titles 5 and 31 with references \n     to 5 U.S.C. 5732 and 31 U.S.C. 3342 reflect recodification of \n     provisions relating to reimbursement for the cost of \n     transportation of baggage and effects, and check cashing \n     privileges in those titles. No substantive change is \n     involved.\n       Section 2(b)(3) replaces the reference to `section 1757 of \n     the Revised Statutes of the United States, as amended (5 \n     U.S.C. 16)' with `section 3331 of title 5, United States \n     Code,' reflecting the codification of the statutory oath for \n     employees in 1966.\n       Section 2(b)(4) replaces the reference to 31 U.S.C. 665(b) \n     with `31 U.S.C. 1342,' reflecting the 1982 revision of title \n     31.\n       Section 2(b)(5) amends section 15(c)2\n       [Footnote] by striking out `Public Law 84-918 (7 U.S.C. \n     1881 et seq.)' and inserting in lieu thereof subchapter VI of \n     chapter 33, title 5, United States Code (5 U.S.C. 3371 et \n     seq.).' Section 15(c) of the Peace Corps Act authorizes \n     training for employees at private and public agencies. The \n     statutory provisions relating to employee training were \n     transferred from title 7 to title 5 in 1970.\n       [Footnote] 222 U.S.C. subsection 2514(c).\n       Section 2(b)(6) amends paragraph 15(d)(2)3\n       [Footnote] by striking out `section 9 of Public Law 60-328 \n     (31 U.S.C. 673)' and inserts in lieu thereof 31 U.S.C. 1346.' \n     This section of the Peace Corps Act authorizes the payment of \n     expenses to attend meetings related to the Peace Corps Act. \n     No substantive change is intended. It is another change \n     required by the 1982 revision of title 31.\n       [Footnote] 322 U.S.C. subsection 2514(d)(2).\n       Section 2(b)(7) strikes out `without regard to section 3561 \n     of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 543)'. This statute, which \n     contained a restriction on currency exchanges, has been \n     repealed and apparently was not replaced.\n       Section 2(b)(8) strikes out `Foreign Service Act of 1946, \n     as amended (22 U.S.C. 801 et seq.)' and inserts in lieu \n     thereof: `Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (22 U.S.C. \n     3901 et seq.)'. The Foreign Service Act was rewritten and \n     renamed in 1980.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, and my colleagues in the House, in \nintroducing a reauthorization of the Peace Corps Act. This legislation \nauthorizes a 12 percent increase for the fiscal year Peace Corps budget \nand is part of a multi-year plan to enable the Peace Corps to reach its \ngoal of 10,000 volunteers. Reaching this level has been a long standing \ngoal--set into law in 1985--and I am pleased that this legislation \nwould accomplish this as the Peace Corps readies to enter the 21st \ncentury.\n  As former Director of the Peace Corps, I have learned first-hand of \nthe tremendous impact that the relatively small amount we spend on the \nPeace Corps has throughout the world. Not only does the Peace Corps \ncontinue to be a cost effective tool for providing assistance and \ndeveloping stronger ties with the international community, it has also \ntrained over 150,000 Americans in the cultures and languages of \ncountries around the world. Returned volunteers often use these skills \nand experiences to contribute to myriad sectors of our society--\ngovernment, business, education, health, and social services, just to \nname a few. What a rich resource the Peace Corps is for the United \nStates as the world grows closer.\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\n  Peace Corps volunteers continue to provide unique leadership around \nthe world by representing the finest characteristics of the American \npeople: a strong work ethic, generosity of spirit, and a commitment to \nservice. The interpersonal nature of the Peace Corps has allowed \nvolunteers to establish a collective record of public service that is \nwell respected and recognized in all corners of the world.\n  Several Members of Congress, including Senator Dodd, have contributed \nto this legacy of service and volunteerism. I believe they have \nexperienced the value of the Peace Corps and its commitment to serving \nothers, and I am certain that my colleague from Connecticut would \nconsider this Peace Corps experience invaluable to his work today. As I \nhave said before and I think it deserves repeating, virtually every \nambassador and official representative I have met from countries with \nvolunteers is an enthusiastic supporter of the Peace Corps. They all \nhave viewed the Peace Corps as the most successful program of its kind.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the time is right to expand the number \nof Peace Corps volunteers. As the needs of people in developing \ncountries continue to grow, so too does the number of enthusiastic \nAmericans desiring to serve. Over the last 4 years, the number of \nAmericans requesting information about joining the Peace Corps \nincreased by almost 40 percent. Yet, during the same period, the Peace \nCorps has only been able to support a 2 percent-increase in volunteers.\n  In addition, the Peace Corps has taken steps to streamline agency \noperations to channel more resources in support of additional \nvolunteers. Headquarter staffing has been reduced 13 percent since \n1993. Five of 16 domestic recruiting offices and 13 country programs \nhave been closed since fiscal year 1996. Financial savings in basic \nbusiness operations have been achieved by realigning the headquarters \norganization and improving overseas financial operations. The sum of \nall the financial savings have contributed to a 14 percent-reduction in \nthe average cost per volunteer (in constant dollars) since 1993.\n  Today, nearly 6,700 volunteers serve in 80 countries around the \nworld, working with local communities to build a better future. This \nincrease in Volunteers will help the Peace Corps expand in areas such \nas the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Africa as well as in Jordan, China, \nBangladesh, and Mozambique. Increased funding will also help expand the \nwork of the ``Crisis Corps,'' a group of experienced Peace Corps \nvolunteers who have the necessary background to make valuable \ncontributions in emergency situations. Crisis Corp volunteers, by the \nway, are serving today in Central America, assisting the region in its \nrecovery from the terrible devastation of Hurricane Mitch.\n  Finally, this proposed authorization will serve to strengthen the \nPeace Corps as it prepares to enter the 21st century, putting it on the \nfirm footing it needs and deserves. I firmly believe that a rejuvenated \nPeace Corps will help ensure that America continues to be an engaged \nworld leader, and that we continue to share with other countries our \nown legacy of freedom, independence, and prosperity. This is an \ninvestment in our country and our world that we need to make.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Gorton, and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 510. A bill to preserve the sovereignty of the United States over \npublic lands and acquired lands owned by the United States, and to \npreserve State sovereignty and private property rights in non-Federal \nlands surrounding those public lands and acquired lands; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the american land sovereignty protection act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the American Land \nSovereignty Protection Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Craig, Kyl, Crapo, Gorton, and Grams who are \noriginal cosponsors of the bill.\n  This bill enforces our position as strong supporters of American \npublic lands and private property rights, and is based upon legislation \nwhich I introduced in the 105th Congress, S. 2098. Since then I have \nreceived input from Coloradans and revised the bill accordingly, as I \nam concerned about the setting aside of public lands by the federal \ngovernment for international agreements and oversight.\n  The absence of congressional oversight in such programs as the United \nNations Biosphere Reserve is of special concern to me. The United \nNations has designated 47 Biosphere Reserves in the United States which \ncontain a total area greater than the size of my home state of \nColorado.\n  The United Nations remains the only multi-national body to share \nperspectives on a global scale. The United States, as the leading \neconomic and military world power, should maintain an influential role. \nHowever, the intrusive implications of the U.N. Biosphere Reserve \nprogram have created a problem that must be addressed by the Congress.\n  A Biosphere Reserve is a federally-zoned and coordinated region that \ncould prohibit certain uses of private lands outside of the designated \ninternational area. The executive branch is agreeing to manage the \ndesignated area in accordance with an underlying agreement which may \nhave implications on non-federal land outside the affected area. For \nexample, when residents of Arkansas discovered a plan by the United \nNations and the administration to advance a proposed Ozark Highland Man \nand Biosphere Reserve without public input, the plan was withdrawn in \nthe face of public pressure. This type of stealth tactic to accommodate \ninternational interests does not serve the needs and desires of the \nAmerican people. Rather, it is an encroachment by the Executive branch \non congressional authority.\n\n  We are facing a threat to our sovereignty by the creation of these \nland reserves in our public lands. I also believe the rights of private \nlandowners must be protected if these international land designations \nare made. Even more disturbing is the fact the executive branch elected \nto be a party to this ``Biosphere Reserve'' program without the \napproval of Congress or the American people. The absence of \ncongressional oversight in this area is a serious concern.\n  In fact most of these international land reserves have been created \nwith minimal, if any, congressional input or oversight or public \nconsultation. The current system for implementing international land \nreserves diminishes the power and sovereignty of the Congress to \nexercise its constitutional power to make laws that govern lands \nbelonging to the United States. Congress must protect individual \nproperty owners, local communities, and state sovereignty which may be \nadversely impacted economically by any such international agreements.\n  As policymaking authority is further centralized by the executive \nbranch at the federal level, the role of ordinary citizens in the \nmaking of this policy through their elected representatives is \ndiminished. The administration has allowed some of America's most \nsymbolic monuments of freedom, such as the Statue of Liberty and \nIndependence Hall to be listed as World Heritage Sites. Furthermore the \nUnited Nations has listed national parks including Yellowstone National \nPark--our nation's first national park--as a World Heritage Site.\n  Federal legislation is needed to require the specific approval of \nCongress before any area within the borders of the United States is \nmade part of an international land reserve. My bill reasserts Congress' \nConstitutional role in the creation of rules and regulations governing \nlands belonging to the United States and its people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record and \nurge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Land Sovereignty \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The power to dispose of and make all needful rules and \n     regulations governing lands belonging to the United States is \n     vested in the Congress under article IV, section 3, of the \n     Constitution.\n\n[[Page S2133]]\n\n       (2) Some Federal land designations made pursuant to \n     international agreements concern land use policies and \n     regulations for lands belonging to the United States which \n     under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution can only be \n     implemented through laws enacted by the Congress.\n       (3) Some international land designations, such as those \n     under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man \n     and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, \n     Educational, and Cultural Organization, operate under \n     independent national committees, such as the United States \n     National Man and Biosphere Committee, which have no \n     legislative directives or authorization from the Congress.\n       (4) Actions by the United States in making such \n     designations may affect the use and value of nearby or \n     intermixed non-Federal lands.\n       (5) The sovereignty of the States is a critical component \n     of our Federal system of government and a bulwark against the \n     unwise concentration of power.\n       (6) Private property rights are essential for the \n     protection of freedom.\n       (7) Actions by the United States to designate lands \n     belonging to the United States pursuant to international \n     agreements in some cases conflict with congressional \n     constitutional responsibilities and State sovereign \n     capabilities.\n       (8) Actions by the President in applying certain \n     international agreements to lands owned by the United States \n     diminishes the authority of the Congress to make rules and \n     regulations respecting these lands.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To reaffirm the power of the Congress under article IV, \n     section 3, of the Constitution over international agreements \n     which concern disposal, management, and use of lands \n     belonging to the United States.\n       (2) To protect State powers not reserved to the Federal \n     Government under the Constitution from Federal actions \n     designating lands pursuant to international agreements.\n       (3) To ensure that no United States citizen suffers any \n     diminishment or loss of individual rights as a result of \n     Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international \n     agreements for purposes of imposing restrictions on use of \n     those lands.\n       (4) To protect private interests in real property from \n     diminishment as a result of Federal actions designating lands \n     pursuant to international agreements.\n       (5) To provide a process under which the United States may, \n     when desirable, designate lands pursuant to international \n     agreements.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN WORLD HERITAGE \n                   SITE LISTING.\n\n       Section 401 of the National Historic Preservation Act \n     Amendments of 1980 (Public Law 96-515; 94 Stat. 2987) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a) in the first sentence, by--\n       (A) striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``Subject to \n     subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e), the Secretary''; and\n       (B) inserting ``(in this section referred to as the \n     `Convention')'' after ``1973''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(d)(1) The Secretary of the Interior may not nominate any \n     lands owned by the United States for inclusion on the World \n     Heritage List pursuant to the Convention, unless--\n       ``(A) the Secretary finds with reasonable basis that \n     commercially viable uses of the nominated lands, and \n     commercially viable uses of other lands located within 10 \n     miles of the nominated lands, in existence on the date of the \n     nomination will not be adversely affected by inclusion of the \n     lands on the World Heritage List, and publishes that finding;\n       ``(B) the Secretary has submitted to the Congress a report \n     describing--\n       ``(i) natural resources associated with the lands referred \n     to in subparagraph (A); and\n       ``(ii) the impacts that inclusion of the nominated lands on \n     the World Heritage List would have on existing and future \n     uses of the nominated lands or other lands located within 10 \n     miles of the nominated lands; and\n       ``(C) the nomination is specifically authorized by a law \n     enacted after the date of enactment of the American Land \n     Sovereignty Protection Act and after the date of publication \n     of a finding under subparagraph (A) for the nomination.\n       ``(2) The President may submit to the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives and the President of the Senate a proposal \n     for legislation authorizing such a nomination after \n     publication of a finding under paragraph (1)(A) for the \n     nomination.\n       ``(e) The Secretary of the Interior shall object to the \n     inclusion of any property in the United States on the list of \n     World Heritage in Danger established under Article 11.4 of \n     the Convention, unless--\n       ``(1) the Secretary has submitted to the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and the President of the Senate a \n     report describing--\n       ``(A) the necessity for including that property on the \n     list;\n       ``(B) the natural resources associated with the property; \n     and\n       ``(C) the impacts that inclusion of the property on the \n     list would have on existing and future uses of the property \n     and other property located within 10 miles of the property \n     proposed for inclusion; and\n       ``(2) the Secretary is specifically authorized to assent to \n     the inclusion of the property on the list, by a joint \n     resolution of the Congress after the date of submittal of the \n     report required by paragraph (1).\n       ``(f) The Secretary of the Interior shall submit an annual \n     report on each World Heritage Site within the United States \n     to the Chairman and Ranking Minority member of the Committee \n     on Resources of the House of Representatives and of the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, that \n     contains for the year covered by the report the following \n     information for the site:\n       ``(1) An accounting of all money expended to manage the \n     site.\n       ``(2) A summary of Federal full time equivalent hours \n     related to management of the site.\n       ``(3) A list and explanation of all nongovernmental \n     organizations that contributed to the management of the site.\n       ``(4) A summary and account of the disposition of \n     complaints received by the Secretary related to management of \n     the site.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \nHandicapped Act to ensure the equal right of individuals with \ndisabilities to vote, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n\n\n  Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act Amendments\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with my \ndear friend Senator John Kerry which would protect every American's \nfundamental right to vote. Our bill, ``Improving Accessibility to \nVoting for Disabled and Elderly Americans'' will ensure that every \ncitizen who wants to vote will be able to vote despite physical \ndisabilities.\n  The McCain-Kerry bill would strengthen and redefined the existing \nlaw, ``Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped.'' As many \nof my colleagues know, Congress implemented this law in 1984 in an \nattempt to ensure that all Americans has access to voter registration \nand polling places. At the time this was quite a progressive initiative \nsince it was 15 years prior to the landmark Americans with Disabilities \nAct which as since helped opened the door for millions of disabled \nAmericans in many aspects of their lives.\n  As a Member of the House of Representatives, I proudly supported the \noriginal 1984 law and was confident that it would eliminate the \nbarriers facing millions of disabled and elderly citizens when they \nexercise their basic right to vote. Unfortunately, it did not. While it \nwas a step in the right direction it has not completely eradicated \ninaccessible polling facilities. According to the most recent Federal \nElection Commission report, which relies on self-reporting by local \nelection officials during the 1992 election, there were at least 19,500 \ninaccessible polling places. This is not including 9,500 polling places \nwhich did not file reports. And since this information is based on \nself-reporting I am afraid that the actual number of inaccessible \npolling places may be much higher.\n  It is deplorable that millions of disabled and elderly voters are not \nvoting because they are faced with too many obstacles, including \ninaccessible polling places and ballots which are not accessible to \nblind or visually impaired voters. I find it particularly disconcerning \nthat many of our nation's disabled veterans, the very men and women who \nhave sacrificed so much for our country, are unable to cast their vote \nbecause of polling facilities which are not accessible. This is simply \nwrong. The right to vote is the heat and soul of our democracy, and we \nmust work together to eliminate barriers preventing millions from \nparticipating in our democracy.\n  As America works together for our journey into the new millennium we \nmust ensure that our Democracy continues to include everyone and \naddress the unique needs of each citizen. I am concerned about voter \nturnout in the last election cycle, 1998 was the lowest since 1942--\nonly 36 percent of eligible voters participated. It is difficult to \nhave representation of the people by the people if the majority of \npeople are not participating.\n  I find this lack of participation quite disturbing, particularly as \nour Nation prepares to enter the next century facing a multitude of \nimportant issues. What is even more disturbing is the number of \ncitizens who wanted to participate in our election process but were \nunable to because of inaccessible polling facilities. This is why I am \ncommitted to working with Senator Kerry to get this bill passed so that \nevery citizen, particularly the men and women who pledged their lives, \nfortunes and sacred honor to preserve and protect our Nation, can \nparticipate in the voting process.\n  I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will work with us to enact \nthis important piece of legislation this year so that all Americans can \nexercise their right to vote with dignity and respect.\n  This legislation is supported by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nAmerican Foundation for the Blind, New Hampshire Disabilities Rights \nCenter, New Hampshire Developmental Disabilities Council, Granite State \nIndependent Living Foundation, and National Association of Protection \nand Advocacy Systems. I would like to thank each of them for their \ncommitment to protecting the rights of disabled and elderly Americans.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that a copy of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the test of the bill was to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 511\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend John \nMcCain to introduce the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \nHandicapped Act, to ensure that our disabled and elderly citizens have \nthe same opportunity to vote as the rest of us--in private and at a \npolling place. Despite the intention of a voter accessibility law \npassed in 1984, many individuals with physical challenges are literally \nleft outside the polling place, unable to exercise their fundamental \nright to vote without embarrassing themselves or relying on others to \ncast their ballot for them.\n  As abysmally low as voter turnout is for the population as a whole, \nit is estimated that the rate of voter participation by persons with \ndisabilities is even lower--as much as 15-20 percent according to some \nsurveys. Among the reasons for this gap is that polling places are not \naccessible to people with physical disabilities. This is the case, \ndespite the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act \n(VAEHA) of 1984, which requires polling places to be physically \naccessible to both older voters and voters with disabilities. \nUnfortunately, the VAEHA does not define an ``accessible'' voting \nplace, nor does it place responsibility for making a voting place \naccessible with any particular agency or official.\n  Since the 1984 act was passed, many polling places have improved \ntheir accessibility. Nevertheless, according to the Federal Election \nCommission, which tracks accessibility under the 1984 act, there were \nsome 19,500 inaccessible polling places in 1992--the last time for \nwhich statistics are available. And, since the FEC report relied on \nself-reporting by voting precincts, the actual number of inaccessible \npolling places in likely to be even higher.\n  The result is that there are still too many instances where disabled \nvoters must resort to what is known as ``curbside voting.'' According \nto a survey by the National Voter Independence Project, 47 percent of \npolling places are inaccessible because they don't have a wide enough \npath from the street, there are no signs directing disabled people \nwhere to go, or stairs or narrow doorways block wheelchair access. \nDisabled voters who go to inaccessible polling places are told to honk \ntheir car horn, or ask a passerby to get the attention of the polling \nofficial, who must then bring a ballot out to the disabled voter or \ncarry him or her into the voting place. Rather than face this \nindignity, many disabled voters choose not to vote.\n  Why shouldn't they just vote by absentee ballot? Because voting is a \ncommunity event in which those without disabilities can choose to \nparticipate. Disabled voters deserve the same voting rights as everyone \nelse. If they vote by absentee ballot, they should do so because they \nchoose to, not because they have to.\n  Visually impaired voters--many of whom are older Americans--also \noften face certain indignities when they attempt to exercise their \nfundamental right of a secret vote. If they cannot see the ballot, they \nare told to bring someone into the voting booth with them, to read the \nballot for them and cast their vote. An extraordinary 81 percent of \nvisually impaired individuals had to rely on others to mark their \nballots for them, according to the National Voter Independence Project. \nThe secret ballot is so basic to our democratic system that it is \nshocking that it is denied to so many.\n  The right to vote at a polling place and in private can be provided \nto the elderly and disabled for a very low price. State election \nagencies may incur some costs in bringing their polling places into \ncompliance, however, these are expenses already required of the states \nby the 1984 law. More importantly in most cases, the costs are not \nlikely to be high. The FEC noted that improvements seen in 1992 ``were \nin many cases achieved merely by relocating polling places to \naccessible buildings at no cost to the taxpayers.'' Where polling \nplaces are not accessible to individuals with physical disabilities, \nthey can be moved to already accessible buildings, such as malls, \npublic libraries and schools. In many instances, access would be \nimproved by putting up signs directing persons with disabilities to \naccessible entrances. These and other simple solutions have been \nimplemented by some precincts at only minimal cost.\n  Improving access for the visually impaired can also be a low-cost \nendeavor for states. Many visually impaired individuals would be able \nto vote independently if the ballots were simply in larger type. \nProviding a tape recording of the ballot for the visually impaired to \nlisten to is another solution that has been implemented by a few \nprecincts for very low cost. It is a small price to pay to guarantee \nour fundamental rights to all of our citizens.\n  Those who would benefit from this bill include the men and women who \nwere injured serving our country in the armed forces. Other \nbeneficiaries would be elderly citizens who may have voted regularly \nthroughout their lives, and only their failing vision keeps them from \nvoting now. Still others on whose behalf we offer this bill are victims \nof accidents, illnesses, or genetic disorders. Is there any one among \nthose individuals who should be denied the right to participate in the \nvoting process? Of course not. It is for them, Mr. President, that we \noffer this very important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 512. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe expansion, intensification, and coordination of the activities of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services with respect to research on \nautism; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              advancement in pediatric autism research act\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, I will introduce legislation that \nwill build on current scientific advances in understanding autism and \nwill promote additional research in this promising field. I introduced \na very similar bill last year and am greatly encouraged by the progress \nin this field. In the last 12 months, we've seen an increase in the \nnumber of researchers interested in this field, additional funding for \nautism research and greater public awareness about this disability. It \nis\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\nmy hope that we can continue this momentum and pass meaningful \nlegislation this year.\n  Many think autism is rare. In fact, it is the third most prevalent \nchildhood disability, affecting an estimated four hundred thousand \nAmericans and their families. It is also a condition that doctors and \nscientists believe can be cured. It is not something that we simply \nmust accept.\n  When people think of autism they might remember the character played \nby Dustin Hoffman in the movie ``Rainman.'' Yet autism has many faces; \nit affects people from every background, social and ethnic category. \nChildren with autism may be profoundly retarded and may never learn to \nspeak, while other may be extremely hyperactive and bright. Some may \nhave extraordinary talents, such as an exceptional memory or skill in \nmathematics. However, all share the common traits of difficulty with \ncommunication and social interaction. And for reasons we do not yet \nunderstand, eighty percent of those with autism are males.\n  But autism is not about statistics or medical definitions--it is \nabout children and families. The Kruegers, from Washington state, have \nan all too typical story. Their little girl Chanel developed like any \nother child--she happily played with her parents, took her first steps, \nlearned some of her first words and then she started to regress. In \nfour short months, by the time she was two, Chanel had become almost \ncompletely enveloped in her own private world. Chanel's mother told me \n``it was like somebody came in the middle of the night and took my \nchild.''\n  Like many children with autism, the Krueger's daughter no longer \nresponded when her parents called her name; words she once spoke \nclearly became garbled; and socializing became more and more difficult. \nFortunately, due to her parents' dedication and intervention Chanel \nKrueger at age 5, is doing remarkably well.\n  But, many autistic children completely lose the ability to interact \nwith the outside world. The hours these kids should be spending in \nlittle league or playing with their friends are often spent staring out \nthe window, transfixed by the dust floating in the sunlight or the \npattern of leaves on the ground.\n  Even today, with advances in therapy and early intervention, few of \nthese children will go to college, hold a regular job, live \nindependently or marry. More than half never learn how to speak.\n  The facts about autism can be sobering--but there is hope. Early \nintervention and treatment has helped many children. Science has also \nmade great strides in understanding this disorder. We now know that \nautism is a biological condition, it is not an emotional problem and it \nis not caused by faulty parenting. Scientists believe that autism is \none of the most heritable developmental disorders and is the most \nlikely to benefit from the latest advances in genetics and neurology. \nOnce the genetic link is discovered, the opportunities for \nunderstanding, treating, and eventually curing autism are endless.\n\n  The promise of research is exactly why I am introducing this \nlegislation. This bill will increase the federal commitment to autism \nresearch. Its cornerstone is authorization for five Centers of \nExcellence where basic researchers, clinicians and scientists can come \ntogether to increase our understanding of this devastating disorder.\n  Because so little is known about the prevalence of autism, I have \nadded a provision that establishes at the Centers for Disease Control \nat least three centers of expertise on autism in an effort to identify \nthe causes of autism. The epidemiology research will help us confirm or \ndismiss whether a genetic disposition to autism may be triggered by \nenvironmental factors. If so, identifying those factors may help us in \ntaking steps to prevent autism from developing.\n  A library of genetic information will be a valuable tool for \nresearchers trying to identify the genetic basis for autism. The bill \nincludes a provision to fund a gene and brain tissue bank developed \nfrom families affected with autism to be available for research \npurposes.\n  While we are hoping to advance our understanding and treatment of \nautism through research, it is also important that pediatricians and \nother health professionals have the most current information so that \nchildren and their families can receive help as early as possible. The \nbill includes authorization for an Autism Wareness Program to educate \ndoctors and other health professionals about autism.\n  Finally, it is vital that we encourage collaboration among the \nscientists conducting this important work throughout the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. The bill establishes an Inter-Agency Autism \nCoordinating Committee to bring together the scientists at the various \nInstitutes at the NIH, at the Centers for Disease Control and other \nagencies conducting autism research.\n  While the focus of this bill is on autism, advances in this area are \nalso likely to shed light on related problems such as attention deficit \ndisorder, obsessive compulsive disorders, and various seizure disorders \nand learning disabilities.\n  Research is the key to unlocking the door and freeing those with \nautism from the isolation and loneliness of their private world. This \nbill is intended to give the NIH and the CDC the resources to take \nadvantage of the tremendous opportunity before us to find more \neffective treatments and ultimately a cure for autism. The promise is \nreal. Fulfillment of that promise only requires our commitment. I urge \nmy Senate colleagues to support this important investment in the future \nof our children and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2130-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2136-S2138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 38\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Hutchinson) was added as a cosponsor of S. 38, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase out the estate and gift taxes \nover a 10-year period.\n\n\n                                 S. 51\n\n  At the request of Mr. Biden, the names of the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 51, a bill to reauthorize the Federal \nprograms to prevent violence against women, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 52\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bond, the names of the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Mack) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Coverdell) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 52, a bill to provide a direct check for education.\n\n\n                                 S. 67\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the name of the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings) was added as a cosponsor of S. 67, a bill to \ndesignate the headquarters building of the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development in Washington, District of Columbia, as the ``Robert \nC.

Mr. President, between the time I made my \nstatement in the closed Senate deliberations on February 11th and the \ntime I cast my vote on February 12th, I consulted with the \nParliamentarian and examined the Senate precedents and found that if I \nvoted simply ``not proven,'' that I would be marked on the voting roles \nas ``present.'' I also found that a response of ``present,'' and \ninferentially the equivalent of ``present,'' could be challenged and \nthat I could be forced to cast a vote of ``yea'' or ``nay.''\n  I noted the precedent on June 28, 1951, recorded on pages 7403 and \n7404 of the Congressional Record, when Senator Benton of Connecticut \nand Senator Lehman of New York voted ``present'' during a roll call \nvote. Senator Hickenlooper of Iowa challenged these votes and argued \nthat a senator must vote either ``yea'' or ``nay'' unless the Senate \nvotes to excuse the senator from voting. Senator Hickenlooper's \nchallenge was upheld, and the Senate voted against excusing these \nSenators from voting by a vote of 39 to 35 in the case of Senator \nLehman and a vote of 41 to 34 in the case of Senator Benton.\n  I also noted the precedent on August 3, 1954, on page 13086 of the \nCongressional Record, when Senator Mansfield of Montana voted \n``present'' during a roll call vote. Senator Cordon of Oregon objected \nand asked that the Senate vote on whether Senator Mansfield should be \nexcused from voting. By voice vote, the Senate voted against excusing \nSenator Mansfield from voting.\n  In order to avoid the possibility that some Senator might challenge \nmy vote, I decided to state on the Senate floor, ``not proven, \ntherefore not guilty,'' when my name was called on the roll call votes \non Article I and Article II of the Articles of Impeachment. That \navoided the possibility of a challenge and also more accurately \nrecorded my vote as ``not guilty'' since I did not wish to be recorded \nas merely ``present.'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2140-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING THE NEBRASKA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD'S 24TH MEDICAL COMPANY ON \n                       THEIR DEPLOYMENT TO BOSNIA\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, now that the Senate has passed the \nSoldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, \nI would like to take a few moments to express my appreciation for a \ngroup of dedicated Nebraskans who have chosen to serve their country in \nthe Nebraska Army National Guard.\n  Most of the fifty-nine members of the Nebraska Army National Guard's \n24th Medical Company left Lincoln on February 21st, for Fort Benning, \nGeorgia. This week, having completed some additional training, these \nsoldiers from the Nebraska Guard are traveling, along with five of the \nunit's UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, to participate in Operation Joint \nForge in Bosnia, where they are scheduled to serve up to 270 days \noverseas. The 24th Medical Company will be only the second air medical \nevacuation unit deployed to Bosnia, where their mission will be to care \nfor casualties as they are flown from the front lines to hospitals.\n  Earlier this month, I visited with members of the medical unit in \ntheir hangar in Lincoln, Nebraska. Mr. President, I am very impressed \nby the dedication and training of these fine individuals. We are \nincreasingly calling upon our nation's Reserve units to provide support \nfor missions such as Bosnia, as part of America's down-sized military. \nUnlike the active duty forces, the citizen soldier puts a uniform on, \nserves his or her country, takes the uniform off, and goes back to \nwork. We Americans should not take this dedication for granted. This \ncurrent deployment may last for nine months, and that is nine months of \ntime away from their families, their jobs, their education, and their \nlives. They realize the importance of their mission, and they are \nwilling to make the sacrifices such a mission entails.\n  Mr. President, I am encouraged by last week's vote in this chamber to \nincrease base pay and benefits for our military forces. The men and \nwomen who dedicate their lives to keeping our nation safe need and \ndeserve a pay raise. The decision to join the military is \nextraordinary, and those who do so need to be properly compensated. \nHowever, money has never been and never will be the motivating factor \nfor people who wish to join the Armed Services. We must ensure that the \nsoldiers in our military are not driven away from service by a poor \nquality-of-life standard. We can accomplish this by making sure that \nour military have adequate housing, a good, responsive medical care \nsystem, proper training and equipment, and support for their families. \nEven more importantly, we who are not actively involved in military \nservice must continue to hold up individuals such as the 24th Company \nas exemplars of service and sacrifice in our country. Theirs are the \nstories that need to be told.\n  In closing, I would like to give a personal ``Thank you'' to each and \nevery one of the fifty-nine members of the Nebraska Army National \nGuard's 24th Medical Company. I wish you success in your journey and \nlook forward to your return from what is the noblest mission in the \nArmy, the mission to save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2140-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2140-S2141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the month of February has been \ndesignated as African-American History Month, however, African-American \nhistory is American history. The contributions of African-Americans to \nAmerica encompass almost every area of American life. African-Americans \nare recorded in America as early as 1619, one year before the Mayflower \nlanded at Plymouth Rock. The oldest established African-American family \nare descendants of William Tucker, born in Jamestown, Virginia in 1624.\n  Unfortunately for many of our youth, African-American role models are \nlimited to those known for their achievements in the world of sports \nand entertainment. Although their accomplishments in this field are \nsubstantial and important, few of our youth know, for instance, about \nthe many African-Americans who, throughout history, displayed \ntremendous courage and honor in times of war. Cripus Attuk, an African-\nAmerican, was killed in the Boston Massacre in 1770, becoming the first \ncasualty of the American Revolution. Most of the 5,000 blacks that \nfought in the Revolutionary War were slaves that fought in place of \ntheir owners. After the war had been won, they were immediately put \nback to work on their plantations, still slaves. More than 200,000 \nAfrican-Americans served in the Civil War. After the Civil War, many of \nthese trained soldiers were sent west and were reorganized as the 9th & \n10th Cavalries, where they were called the ``Buffalo Soldier'' by the \nIndians they were fighting. The Tuskeegee Airmen of World War II, an \nair squadron, had the most impressive war record in their theater of \naction, never losing a bomber they were assigned to escort. Against \nalmost insurmountable odds and racial discrimination, African-Americans \nhave faithfully served America.\n  Significant in another aspect of America's history are the African-\nAmericans whose endeavors helped fuel\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\nthe industrial revolution, contributing to the economic prosperity and \nstandard of life all Americans enjoy today. George Washington Carver \ndiscovered over 500 products with the peanut, the sweet potato, and \ncorn. Many important inventions were made by African-Americans with \nthousands of patents made that have benefitted not only America, but \nthe world. Jan Matzeliger invented the first shoe making machine. \nElijah McCoy had forty-two patents, most for lubricating different \ntypes of steam engines and machines, as well as the first graphite \nlubricating device. Garrett A. Morgan invented the three-way traffic \nlight which he sold to General Electric. Frederick McKinley Jones \ninvented a workable way to refrigerate trucks and railroad cars, as \nwell as manufactured movie sound equipment. George R. Curruthers \ninvented image converters for detecting electromagnetic radiation. He \nwas also one of the two people responsible for the development of the \nlunar service ultraviolet camera/specter graph. Dr. Charles R. Drew is \ncredited with the discovery of blood plasma which supplants blood in \ntransfusions, as was the first person to set up and establish blood \nbanks. Dr. Daniel Hale Williams is the first doctor to successfully \nperform open heart surgery.\n  Some of the people mentioned played an important role in America's \npast wars. Many African-Americans I encounter today, however, are the \nunsung heroes of a different kind of war. They battle for the hearts \nand minds of our inner city youth. For example in Philadelphia, The \nReverend Herb Lusk, and ``People for People,'' are providing welfare to \nwork training, after school tutoring for grade school children, as well \nas GED and computer training for the poor and disadvantaged. The \nReverend Dr. Ben Smith's Deliverance Church, which owns and operates a \nshopping mall and sixty-five outreach ministries, has long served the \ngreater community. C. Delores Tucker currently organizes the largest \nMartin Luther King Center for Non-violence in the nation. One of the \nmany things she does for the community is to arrange for many to gather \nand celebrate our great Civil Rights leader on his birthday at an \nannual luncheon.\n  It is fitting that all Americans salute the invaluable services and \ncontributions of African-Americans and the role that they have played \nand continue to play in American History.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2140-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SOLDIERS', SAILORS', AIRMEN'S AND MARINES' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I support giving our troops a pay \nraise, and I support improving the retirement package of career \nmilitary personnel. However, the bill the Senate has considered, S. 4, \nthe Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights, is not \nonly too expensive, it was also brought to the floor too hastily, \nwithout holding hearings on its provisions, and before we considered \nhow the bill might affect the rest of the budget. Even though I want to \nsee a pay raise and retirement reform, I had to vote against this \nexcessively costly bill.\n  When S. 4 was reported out of committee, it already cost $12 billion \nmore than the President requested over the next five years. The bill as \npassed by the Senate is estimated to cost $17 billion more than the \nPresident asked for. That is just for the next five years. Using \nCongressional Budget Office (CBO) figures, S. 4 would consume one-\nquarter of the projected non-Social Security surplus in the next fiscal \nyear. Once personnel start to retire under its provisions, costs will \nskyrocket. CBO estimates that the retirement changes in S. 4 will \neventually raise the costs of military pensions by a whopping 18 \npercent. These increased costs will come due at the same time the baby \nboom generation retires, with the attendant strain on Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  It is impossible to justify these steep increases in costs, \nparticularly since not one hearing was held on S. 4. We all agree there \nare problems with recruitment and retention in the military, but we did \nnot get the benefit of expert testimony--or any testimony at all--as to \nwhy, nor did we get input on how best to address these problems before \npassing this very expensive solution. Last year Congress asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to do a detailed study of recruitment \nand retention problems. GAO has been conducting surveys and \ninterviewing troops in the field to find out why they may plan to leave \nthe service. GAO's preliminary findings show that ``money has been \noverstated as a retention factor.'' GAO's report is due in just a few \nmonths. Similar studies by CBO and the Pentagon are due out shortly. \nSome experts have said that dissatisfaction over military health care \nand the operations tempo were more important issues for those leaving \nthe military.\n  I find it most troubling that this bill was brought to the floor \nbefore we passed a budget resolution, and outside of the normal Defense \nAuthorization bill. With no budget caps, and no other defense \npriorities to consider, the bill brought us into a never, never land of \nwishful thinking. The bill sets out the most generous package of \nbenefits, but does not consider what might happen to the rest of the \ndefense budget if these cost increases go into effect. Will we have to \ncut readiness, operations and maintenance, or procurement accounts? \nWill we be able to fund steps that could reduce the operations tempo or \nmake it more predictable? Will we be able to fund improvements in \nmilitary health care?\n  The so-called firewalls between defense and domestic discretionary \nspending are down. That means that, rather than cutting other parts of \nthe defense budget to pay for these increases, we may have to cut \ndomestic programs instead, like education, the environment, or \ntransportation. According to the Concord Coalition, 57 percent of the \nbudget was devoted to entitlements in 1998, but we are now on track to \ndevote 73 percent of the budget to entitlements by 2009. This bill will \nworsen the entitlement picture, and mean that more and more \ndiscretionary spending will have to be cut to cover growing \nentitlements.\n  This was a very sad first bill for the Senate to consider after we \nfinally turned the corner on deficits. We cannot go back to pre-1974 \nBudget Act spending patterns. We must not abandon fiscal discipline and \nspend the surplus before we even see a penny of it. I hope and expect \nthat fiscal sanity will be restored and that, when the bill returns \nfrom conference or as part of a larger measure, I will be able to vote \nfor a well-deserved pay raise for our military personnel and a \nreasonable retirement package, but a package that fits within the \nbudget framework and discipline we have all embraced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2141-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2141-S2142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FUTURE LEADERS OF THE BIG SKY STATE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in my view, public service is the \nmost noble human endeavor. Today, more than ever, we must look to the \nyounger generation as leaders for tomorrow. For their commitment to \ncommunity service, I am pleased to recognize two of Montana's young \nleaders.\n  Their community work demonstrates an ability to make a difference in \nthe lives of others. The work of these two young Montanans sets an \nimpressive standard for their peers.\n  I would like to congratulate and honor two young Montana students who \nhave achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in \ntheir communities. Mindi Kimp of Corvallis, Montana, and Jill Lombardi \nof Helena, Montana, have been named State Honorees in The 1999 \nPrudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor \nconferred on only one high school and one middle school student in each \nstate, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n  Ms. Kimp is being recognized for her work in coordinating a ``senior \ncitizen prom'' for seniors living in Missoula and Ravalli counties. \nMindi, a 4-H member and junior class president, enjoys a close \nrelationship with her grandparents. In helping to plan her own Hamilton \nHigh School prom, she conceived the idea of a senior citizen prom. She \nbelieved that this would be a great way to honor grandparents and help \nrestore faith in today's younger generation. Mindi worked closely with \nthe Council on Aging in planning the event. She solicited donations to \nmake the event free to all seniors. She also used it to provide prizes, \ndecorations, and a rose for every lady. The event was so successful \nthat she will speak at the State Student Council Convention on how to \nplan a senior citizen prom.\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nThe event will now be held annually at Hamilton High School.\n  Ms. Lombardi, a member of the Helena Youth Advisory Council, is being \nrecognized for her leadership role in two projects: a skateboard park \nand ``Martin Luther King Volunteer Day.'' Jill served on and \nestablished the first-ever Helena Youth Advisory Council. As a member, \nJill recruited interested skateboarders to advise the council on the \ndesign of the park. She also helped to obtain a $50,000 grant from the \nTurner Foundation for the park's construction. In planning the \nvolunteer day, Jill worked with the council to organize activities such \nas community clean-up and youth reading programs. She recruited \nvolunteers, analyzed community needs, arranged volunteer projects, and \ncoordinated celebration activities. The event's success has inspired \nthe council to host the event again next year.\n  Young volunteers like Ms. Kimp and Ms. Lombardi are inspiring \nexamples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better \ntomorrow. It is important that we recognize their achievements and \nsupport their contributions. Numerous statistics indicate that \nAmericans today are less involved in their communities than they once \nwere, and it is critical that the work of these young people is \nencouraged.\n  The program that brought these young role models to our attention--\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by The \nPrudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress \nupon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically \nimportant and highly valued, and to inspire other young people to \nfollow their example. In only four years, the program has become the \nnation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community \nservice, with more than 50,000 youngsters participating.\n  Ms. Kimp and Ms. Lombardi should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of \ntheir recognition, they will come to Washington in early May, along \nwith other 1999 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country. \nWhile here in Washington, ten will be selected as America's top youth \nvolunteers of the year by a distinguished national selection committee.\n  I heartily applaud Ms. Kimp and Ms. Lombardi for their initiative in \nseeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the \npositive impact they have had on the lives of Montanans. I also would \nlike to salute two young people in Montana who were named Distinguished \nFinalists by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their \noutstanding volunteer service: Nadia Ben-Youssef and Angela Bowlds.\n  All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and \ndeserve our sincere admiration and respect. These young Montana leaders \nshow commendable community spirit and tremendous promise for America's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2141-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CUMBERLAND ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE WITH SPECIAL THANKS TO DON BARGER \n                           AND TAVIA McCUEAN\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, last week, after more than two \nyears of negotiations, an agreement was finally reached to release \nfunding for land acquisition on Cumberland Island National Seashore. \nLocated off the coast of Georgia, Cumberland provides a unique \nexperience for visitors by enabling them to view seemingly endless \nundeveloped beaches and dunes in pristine condition. The beautiful \ncoastline is contrasted by marshes and vast forests of mixed hardwoods. \nThe natural environment plays a critical role in habitat protection for \nseveral threatened and endangered species including the bald eagle, the \nloggerhead sea turtle and the manatee.\n  The Island also allows individuals to visit the incredible cultural \nand historical remnants which exist on the Island. The remarkable \nhistory of the island indicates human habitation dating back thousands \nof years. First occupied by the Spanish in the early days of the \ncolonial period, the island was eventually claimed by the English in \nthe mid-1700s. Cumberland also has historical connections to the \nRevolutionary and Civil Wars. One unique historical reference to the \nisland--brought to my attention by the Senate's own resident historian, \nthe distinguished Senior Senator from West Virginia, relays the story \nthat after his duel with Alexander Hamilton on July 11, 1804, Aaron \nBurr fled to Cumberland Island in exile--only to eventually leave after \nbeing snubbed by the island residents.\n  With this agreement, we have not only preserved the Island in \naccordance with its designation as a National Seashore, but we have \ntaken the critical steps necessary to restore and maintain the historic \nand cultural resources on Cumberland which had been seriously neglected \nfor several years. The agreement also provides additional access to \nindividuals wishing to visit the historic resources on the island. By \nreleasing the monies for the land purchase and implementing these \nchanges, we will be making the ultimate benefactors the future \ngenerations of Americans who will have the opportunity to experience \nthe natural and historical treasures possessed by Cumberland Island.\n  I would like to take a moment to publicly recognize and express my \nsincere appreciation to Don Barger, Southeast Regional Director of the \nNational Parks and Conservation Association (NPCA), for his assistance \nin resolving the issues on Cumberland Island National Seashore. Don has \nbeen with NPCA since 1992. Having once climbed Mount Rainier, Don \ntransfers this same motivation and dedication to his work. He is an \navid and passionate defender of preserving and protecting our National \nPark System.\n  Don played a vital role in crafting the Cumberland agreement by \nactively engaging and compromising with numerous interested \nstakeholders while at the same time fulfilling his duty to preserve the \nintegrity of the Wilderness Act and the National Park System. His \ntireless effort and willingness to commit his time, energy and \nenthusiasm to this process reflect well upon him and on the National \nParks and Conservation Association.\n  I would like to pay special thanks to Tavia McCuean, Georgia State \nDirector of The Nature Conservancy, who vigilantly pursued the critical \nland acquisition funds for Cumberland. The Cumberland agreement would \nnot have been possible without the generous commitment of The \nConservancy to contribute $6 million for the land purchase.\n  There were certainly several occasions over the past two years in \nwhich Tavia and The Nature Conservancy could have lost all patience as \nrepeated efforts to obtain the land acquisition funds were blocked. \nHowever, Tavia tirelessly and patiently focused her energy and that of \nher dedicated staff towards securing the release of these funds. Future \ngenerations visiting Cumberland Island will owe a great debt of \ngratitude for this experience to the efforts of Tavia McCuean and The \nNature Conservancy.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``The nation behaves well if \nit treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to \nthe next generation increased, and not impaired, in value.'' Both Tavia \nMcCuean and Don Barger have done well in upholding this doctrine and \ntruly represent the best of public spiritedness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2142-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2142-S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF HENRY WOODS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, if you consult any of the \nnumerous Congressional directories that are published here in \nWashington, you will see that they all list six members of the Arkansas \nCongressional Delegation--two Senators and four House members. But for \nthe past 25 years, there has been an unofficial seventh member of our \ndelegation: a dynamic, hard-working, can-do staffer named Henry Woods. \nAfter two decades in the nation's capital, Henry is retiring, and the \nstate of Arkansas is losing a Washington institution.\n  Henry has helped one Congressman and three Senators from Arkansas to \ncourt and inform constituents, direct Arkansans to the assistance they \nneed, provide intern opportunities for the state's young people, and \nstage events to advance his members' priorities at home and the state's \ninterest in Washington. For the past 25 years, people\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\nworking in the state congressional delegation knew that if you wanted \nto launch an ambitious project and have it done well, you wanted Henry \nWoods to be in charge of it.\n  His institutional memory is as incredible as it has been invaluable. \nIt is not uncommon for him, at a moment's notice, to recall the name of \na constituent's wife, the ages of their children and which schools they \nattend, which of his cousins serve in the State Legislature, and what \ncivic groups he belongs to and who he supported in the last campaign. \nHe can also cite zip code after zip code, not to mention phone prefixes \nfor cities and towns across Arkansas.\n  Over the years he has made many friends in the halls of the House and \nSenate, from the doorkeepers to the printing clerks, from the \nrestaurant workers to the Rules Committee staffers who have all helped \nhim accomplish things for the members and constituents. He has an \namazing way of finding the people and the resources to accomplish any \nproject he is given.\n  Henry, a proud Hot Springs native, is legendary for his political \nsavvy and quick wit. His fellow staffers often wondered why someone as \nbusy as Henry was so willing to serve as driver for his employer \nwhenever one was needed. After a while, they realized that those \noccasions gave Henry as much as a half-hour of interrupted access to \nthe member, which he used to full effect. He has often been heard \ncautioning members and staffers alike that certain visitors waiting to \nsee them ``may not be right, but they're convinced.'' Another popular \nHenry-ism has been an admonition to disgruntled staffers that they \n``can just get glad in the same clothes they got mad in.''\n  Henry has set up and run intern programs that have easily helped more \nthan 1,000 Arkansas students become familiar with the working of \nCongress and the federal government. His intern program has been so \nsuccessful that it has been emulated by countless other congressional \noffices. Henry's interns never sat idly in the office waiting for the \nnext tour, softball game or free reception. He made sure each one had \nthe chance to work in a variety of capacities and learn a number of \nskills in the offices. It is not surprising that many of his interns \nhave gone on to run for public office and serve in the state's leading \ncorporations, commissions, and charitable organizations.\n  In addition to his official efforts, he kept the Arkansas State \nSociety and the University of Arkansas alumni society running \nefficiently for many years, working countless hours of his personal \ntime to organize events ranging from the cherry blossom reception to \nfootball watch parties and trips to the horse races--all aimed at \nkeeping Arkansans in Washington in touch.\n  Several of his friends established an award in his name last year at \nhis beloved University of Arkansas, where he served on the Board of \nDirectors of the Alumni Association. A cash award will be given each \nyear to a student who shows an interest in internships or government \nservices. The award will be formally announced at the University on \nApril 22.\n  To put it briefly, no matter which office he was working in, Henry \nquickly became indispensable, a fact that was recognized by countless \npeople both on and off the Hill as the following letters attest. Now he \nis leaving for sunnier climes in the southern-most point of the \ncontinental United States. We are going to miss him, and we are going \nto be poorer without him. We wish him well, and we want to let him know \nthat the key will be under the doormat for him any time he wants to \ncome back.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the four letters regarding Henry Wood's \nretirement be printed in the Record.\n  The letters follow:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1999.\n     Henry Woods,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Henry: As you retire from your lifetime of public \n     service on Capitol Hill, I want to congratulate you and thank \n     you for your commitment, hard work, and generous leadership.\n       In particular, I am so grateful for your efforts on behalf \n     of the people from our home state. The warm hospitality you \n     have provided to Arkansas visiting the Capitol throughout \n     these 25 years has given them a special feeling of \n     connectedness to their representatives here in Washington. \n     The guidance you have provided people of all ages--and \n     especially youth and students--leaves a wonderful legacy . . \n     . and big shoes to fill!\n       Hillary joins me in sending our best wishes for all \n     possible happiness in this next phase of your life.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 22, 1999.\n     Mr. Henry Woods,\n     Office of Senator Lincoln, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Henry: You came to Washington for a summer and stayed \n     a career! And what an illustrious career you've had working \n     in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n       You've held many positions during your tenure, and done a \n     superb job in each one. You developed an intern program that \n     has proved to be one of the best on Capitol Hill. Over the \n     years, you have been very involved with the Arkansas State \n     Society. Some would say, ``If it wasn't for Henry, there \n     wouldn't be a State Society.'' You've worked in more \n     campaigns than I have run. Your tent parties are legendary. \n     You helped coach the winning Capitol Hill softball team in \n     1982--the Pryorities. You are--the Razorbacks' biggest fan!\n       Henry, how can we thank you for the tremendous contribution \n     you made to our state, our country--and to all of us.\n       Barbara and the entire Pryor family join me in wishing you \n     the very best in the years ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Pryor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Attorney General of Arkansas,\n\n                               Little Rock, AR, February 19, 1999.\n     Mr. Henry Woods,\n     Office of Senator Lincoln, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Henry: First let me add my congratulations to the many \n     I know you are receiving from friends and colleagues on \n     Capitol Hill as you retire from 25 years of government \n     service. I can't imagine the Arkansas delegation without \n     Henry. You have done so much for so many (including myself) \n     over the years, we cannot begin to properly thank you.\n       I remember one of my early campaigns for the Arkansas State \n     Legislature. You took time off and came to Arkansas to help \n     organize a ``Get Out the Vote'' effort. You and your army of \n     ``intern alumni'' worked tirelessly to get me elected, and I \n     will never forget it.\n       Henry, Capitol Hill will miss you--but not half as much as \n     Arkansas will miss you!\n       I wish you all the best in your new life.\n           With warm regards,\n     Mark Pryor.\n                                  ____\n\n                               Little Rock, AR, February 11, 1999.\n     Mr. Henry Woods,\n     Senator Blanche Lincoln's Office,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Henry: I'm still in denial. I can't imagine Washington \n     without you, and if I could change your mind, I would do so \n     in a heartbeat.\n       But knowing that's not possible, let me just say that \n     ``friends are friends forever'' and our friendship--which \n     began at the University of Arkansas and continues through \n     today--will always be special.\n       I thank you for being so responsive to so many. I thank you \n     for designing and implementing the best intern program on \n     Capitol Hill. I thank you for giving so many Arkansas young \n     people the chance to participate.\n       In just a few weeks, we will dedicate the ``Henry Woods \n     Award'' at the University of Arkansas.

Mr. President, I rise today to help increase the \npublic's awareness of mental retardation as we focus on the needs and \nabilities of the nation's 7.2 million Americans with mental \nretardation. The Arc, the nation's largest organization of volunteer \nadvocates for people with mental retardation, consists of more than \n1,000 local and state chapters. For 21 years, the Arc has sponsored the \nrecognition of March as National Mental Retardation Awareness Month.\n  The Arc began in 1950 as a small army of friends and parents in \nMinneapolis, Minnesota came together to create the National Association \nof Parents and Friends of Mentally Retarded Children. From this spark \nin 1950, Arc members have become advocates not only for their own \nchildren, but all children and other Americans denied\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nservices and opportunities because of mental retardation.\n  According to Arc, a person with mental retardation is one who, from \nchildhood, develops intellectually at a below-average rate and \nexperiences difficulty in learning, social adjustment and economic \nproductivity. Otherwise, he or she is just like anyone else--with the \nsame feelings, interests, goals, needs and desire for acceptance. This \nintellectual delay requires not only personal support, but \nenvironmental support for them to live independently.\n  There are more than 250 causes of mental retardation. Among the most \nrecognized are chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, and \nprenatal influences, such as smoking or alcohol use by a pregnant \nmother, which may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome or other \ncomplications. Malnutrition, lead poisoning and other environmental \nproblems can also lead to mental retardation in children.\n  Experts estimate that 50% of mental retardation can be prevented if \ncurrent knowledge is applied to safeguarding the health of babies and \ntoddlers. Some of the keys are abstinence from alcohol use during \npregnancy, obtaining good prenatal care, education programs for \npregnant women, and the use of child seats and safety belts for \nchildren.\n  The theme for this year's observance is the elimination of waiting \nlists for community-based services. In a study conducted by the Arc, \nmore than 218,000 people were identified as waiting for placement in a \ncommunity-based residential facility, a job training program, a \ncompetitive employment situation or other support.\n  In Minnesota, over 6,600 members in fifty chapters make up the Arc \nnetwork, each working to both prevent the causes of mental retardation \nand lessen its effects. With the guidance of the Arc, it is these local \nand state chapters working at the grassroots levels which have made and \ncontinue to make the greatest impact for Americans with mental \nretardation.\n  Mr. President, I truly appreciate the unabated commitment to the \nneeds and abilities of people with mental retardation the Arc has \ndemonstrated over the years and am honored to help further public \nawareness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2143-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2144-S2145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   LEO MELAMED REFLECTS ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues an essay written by a great Chicagoan, and the father of our \nmodern-day futures industry, Leo Melamed. I believe his essay, \nReflections on the Twentieth Century, eloquently captures the essence \nof this great nation.\n  Mr. President, Leo Melamed had to travel a long hard road to reach \nthe pinnacle of success. As a boy, he survived the Holocaust, coming to \nthe United States to find a better life for his family. Growing up on \nthe streets of Chicago, Leo was able to climb the ladder of opportunity \nand make that better life for himself and his family. His early \nexperiences gave him a deep appreciation of the importance of a free \nsociety and an open economy.\n  Leo Melamed's heroic story embodies the American Dream. The young man \nwho came to Chicago with little has, through hard work, tenacity, \nintellect and energy, given much to the world. In 1972, he launched the \nInternational Monetary Market (IMM), the first financial futures \nmarket. He has also achieved the position of Chairman Emeritus and \nSenior Policy Advisor for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and is \nthe author of several books. His leadership over the past quarter \ncentury has been critical in helping transform the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange from a domestic agricultural exchange to the world's foremost \nfinancial futures exchange.\n  Currently, Melamed serves as chairman and CEO of Sakura Dellaher, \nInc., a global futures organization which he formed in 1993 by \ncombining the Sakura Bank, Ltd., one of the world's largest banks, and \nDellaher Investment Company, Inc., a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) \nhe established in 1965. As a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange \nand the Chicago Board of Trade, and with an ability to operate in all \nworld futures markets, Sakura Dellaher, Inc., assists financial \ninstitutions in their management of risk. Because of Leo's exemplary \naccomplishments and contributions to the field of financial futures, he \nhas been recognized as ``the father of the futures market concept.''\n  I should also add, Mr. President, that the March 1999 issue of \nChicago magazine has chosen Leo Melamed as one of the Most Important \nChicagoans of the 20th Century. The article states: ``As de facto \nleader of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for a quarter of a century, \nMelamed transformed the moribund exchange, introducing foreign currency \nand gold as commodities to be auctioned off in the trading pits. Thanks \nto those decisions, Chicago is today the world capital of currency \nfutures trading.'' Leo Melamed deserves great recognition for his \noutstanding contributions to the city he loves so much.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of Leo Melamed's essay, \nReflections on the Twentieth Century, be printed in the Record.\n  The essay follows:\n\n                  Reflections on the Twentieth Century\n\n                            (By Leo Melamed)\n\n       The Twentieth Century, my father told me before his death, \n     represented a new low in the history of mankind. ``The \n     Holocaust,'' he said, ``was an indelible blot on human \n     conscience, one that could never be expunged.''\n       Still, my father always tempered his realism with a large \n     dose of optimism. He had, after all, against all odds, \n     managed to save himself and his immediate family from the \n     inevitability of the gas chambers. Were that not the case, \n     this kid from Bialystok would not be here to receive this \n     incredible Weizmann Institute honor nor tell his story. And \n     quite a story it is!\n       I don't mean simply the story of how my father snatched his \n     wife and son from the clutches of the Nazis. I don't mean \n     simply the story of how my parents outwitted both the Gestapo \n     and the KGB during a time in history when, in Humphrey \n     Bogart's words, ``the world didn't give a hill of beans about \n     the lives of three people.'' I don't mean simply the story of \n     our race for freedom across Europe and Siberia during a \n     moment in history when the world had gone quite mad. And I \n     don't mean simply the story of Consul General Chiune \n     Sugihara, the Japanese Oscar Schindler who chose the follow \n     the dictates of his God rather than those of his Foreign \n     Office and, in direct violation of their orders, issued life \n     saving transit visas to some 6000 Jews trapped in Lithuania--\n     the Melamdoviches among them. Six months later all of us \n     would have been machine-gunned to death along with 10,000 \n     others in Kovno.\n       No, I don't mean simply all of that, although all of that \n     is a helluva story. But there is yet another dimension to the \n     story here. I mean the story of the splendor of America! For \n     it was here, here in this land of the free and home of the \n     brave that the kid from Bialystok was given the opportunity \n     to grow up on the streets of Chicago, to climb the rungs of \n     social order without money or clout, and to use his \n     imagination and skills so that in a small way he could \n     contribute to the growth of American markets. In doing so he \n     not only justified fate's decision to spare his life, but \n     more important, attested to the majesty of this nation.\n       Because within my story lies the essence of America, the \n     fundamental beauty of the United States Constitution and the \n     genius of its creators. For throughout the years, thru ups \n     and downs, thru defeats and victories, thru innovations which \n     challenged sacred market doctrines, and ideas which defied \n     status quo, no one ever questioned my right to dream, nor \n     rejected my views simply because I as an immigrant, \n     without proper credentials, without American roots, \n     without wealth, without influence, or because I was a Jew. \n     Intellectual values always won out over provincial \n     considerations, rational thought always prevailed over \n     irrational prejudice, merit always found its way to the \n     top. Say what you will, point out the defects, protest the \n     inequities, but at the end of the day my story represents \n     the real truth about America.\n       For these reasons, after all was said and done, my parents \n     were optimists. They agree, that in spite of the two World \n     Wars, in spite of the horrors and atrocities, the Twentieth \n     Century was nevertheless a most remarkable century. They \n     watched the world go from the horse and buggy--to main form \n     of transportation at their birth--to Apollo Eleven which in \n     1969 took Neil Armstrong to the moon.\n       Indeed, it is hard to fathom that at the dawn of my \n     parent's century, Britannia was still the empire on which the \n     sun never set; the railroads were in their Golden Age, \n     automobiles were considered nothing but a fad, the phonograph \n     was the most popular form of home entertainment, and life \n     expectancy for the American male was but 48. Sigmund Freud \n     first published his ``Interpretation of Dreams,'' and Albert \n     Einstein, the foremost thinker of the century, had just \n     published his theory of relativity.\n       Of course, the event that would have the most profound \n     effect on the direction of our present century occurred back \n     in 1848--smack dab in the middle of the Nineteenth Century: \n     Karl Marx and his associate, Friedrich Engels, published the \n     Communist Manifesto. The concept of communism would dominate \n     the political thought of Europe and later Asia for most of \n     the Twentieth Century.\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\n       Today, some 150 years after the concept was conceived, we \n     know it to have been an unmitigated failure. Indeed, those of \n     us, citizens of planet Earth fortunate enough to be present \n     in the final decade of the Twentieth Century, have been \n     privileged to witness events equal to any celebrated \n     milestone in the history of mankind. In what seemed like a \n     made for TV video, we were ringside spectators at a global \n     rebellion. In less than an eye-blink the Berlin Wall fell, \n     Germany was unified, Apartheid ended, Eastern Europe was \n     liberated, the Cold War ceased, and a doctrine that impaired \n     the freedom of three generations and misdirected the destiny \n     of the entire planet for seven decades was decisively \n     repudiated.\n       What a magnificent triumph of democracy and freedom. What a \n     glorious victory for capitalism and free markets. What a \n     majestic tribute to Thomas Jefferson, Adam Smith, Abraham \n     Lincoln, and Milton Friedman. What a divine time to be alive. \n     Surely these events represented some of the defining moments \n     of the Twentieth Century. Ironically, the lynch-pin of all \n     that occurred will not be found in the political or economic \n     arena, but rather in the sciences. One hundred years after \n     the Communist Manifesto, to be precise, on December 23, \n     1947--smack dab in the middle of the Twentieth Century--two \n     Bell Laboratory scientists invented the first transistor. It \n     was the birth of a technology that would serve to dominate \n     the balance of this century and, I dare say, much of the \n     Twenty-first as well. The Digital Age was upon us.\n       Transistors and their offspring, the microchip, transformed \n     everything: the computer, the space program, the television, \n     the telephone, the markets, and, to be sure, \n     telecommunications. Modern telecommunications became the \n     common denominator which gave everyone the ability to make a \n     stark, uncompromising comparison of political and economic \n     systems. The truth could no longer be hidden from the people. \n     We had migrated said Walter Wriston of Citicorp from the gold \n     standard to the ``information standard.''\n       In a very real sense, the technology of the Twentieth \n     Century moved mankind from the big to the little. It is a \n     trend that will surely continue. In physics, this century \n     began with the theory of General Relativity; this dealt with \n     the vast, with the universe. From there we journeyed to \n     comprehension of the infinitesimal, to quantum physics. \n     Physicists were now able to decode nature's age-old secrets. \n     Similarly, in biology we also moved from macro to micro--from \n     individual cells to gene engineering. We entered an era of \n     biomedical research where we can probe the fundamental \n     components of life and remedy mankind's most distressing \n     afflictions.\n       Thus, in stark contrast to the signals at the turn of the \n     last century, the evidence today is overwhelming that the \n     next century will be dominated by the information standard. \n     Today, millions of transistors are etched on wafers of \n     silicon. On these microchips all the world's information can \n     be stored in digital form and transmitted to every corner of \n     the globe via the Internet. This will change the way we live, \n     the way we work, and the way we play. Indeed, the Digital \n     Revolution will direct the next century just as the \n     Industrial Revolution directed much of the Twentieth.\n       So there you have it: the pain, the progress, and the \n     promise of my parent's century. It would be grand to believe \n     that we have learned from our mistakes, that only enlightened \n     times await us, but I am afraid that would be a bit \n     pollyannaish. Still, we stand on the threshold of immense \n     scientific breakthroughs and the future looks brighter than \n     it ever was.

Mr. President, today it is my great privilege \nand honor to salute one of South Carolina's foremost jurists and public \nservants, South Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Ernest A. Finney.\n  On February 23, Chief Justice Finney announced he would retire from \nthe Court after 14 years. This is a bittersweet day for my state. All \nof us who admire Judge Finney and appreciate his legacy are sorry to \nsee him leave the bench; but we also are happy for Judge Finney if he \nhas decided it is time to take a richly deserved rest from the rigorous \ndemands of public service--demands he has shouldered over five decades.\n  When Ernest Finney graduated from law school in 1954, blacks were not \nallowed to join the South Carolina bar or serve on juries. Judge Finney \nworked as hard as anyone in the country to change that. One of only a \nhandful of black lawyers in South Carolina in the 1950s, he began his \nlegal career as an advocate for equal rights and desegregation.\n  Ernest Finney and his law partner, Matthew Perry, who went on to \nbecome the first black federal Judge in South Carolina, tirelessly \nrepresented over 6,000 defendants arrested during civil rights \ndemonstrations in the 1960s. Although they lost all the cases at the \nstate level, they won almost all of them on appeal in federal courts.\n  After helping lead the fight to desegregate South Carolina, Ernest \nFinney turned his attention to another form of public service. In 1973, \nhe became one of the first blacks elected to the South Carolina House \nin this century. He served until 1976, during which time he founded the \nSouth Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.\n  From 1976 to 1985, Judge Finney sat on the South Carolina Circuit \nCourt bench. Always the pioneer, he was the first black Circuit Court \njudge in South Carolina.\n  In 1985, he became the first black member of the state Supreme Court \nsince Reconstruction. He served with great distinction as an Associate \nJustice and earned respect and accolades from his peers and from \nattorneys appearing before the Court.\n  In 1994, Judge Finney was elected Chief Justice, the first black \nSouth Carolinian to attain that position. Without a doubt, he is one of \nthe finest jurists in South Carolina history. As senior Associate \nJustice Jean Toal commented on the announcement of Judge Finney's \nretirement: ``He's a giant of the judicial system in South Carolina. \nHis tenure will be remembered as one of the outstanding tenures of the \nmodern system.''\n  Mr. President, today it is my immense pleasure to salute the gigantic \nachievements of Judge Ernest Finney, one of the most estimable public \nservants in recent South Carolina history. I join his friends and \nadmirers in wishing him well as he begins his retirement, during which \nI suspect he will continue influencing South Carolina for the \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2145-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2145-S2146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE IN SIERRA LEONE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues \nfrom Wisconsin and Tennessee in co-sponsoring Senate Resolution 54, \nwhich was introduced on February 25. This resolution makes a strong, \nand much needed statement about U.S. concern and commitment to African \npeace and stability.\n  In the past several years, Sierra Leonians have seen their country go \nthrough a tumultuous period. On May 24, 1997, the Armed Forces \nRevolutionary Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) \nseized control of Sierra Leone. The United States demanded that \ndemocratically elected President Tejan Kabbah be reinstated \nimmediately.\n  Although diplomatic efforts by the United States and the Economic \nCommunity of West African States failed, a West African intervention \nforce, (ECOMOG), was authorized by the international community to \nintervene, and it was successful in removing the unrecognized military \nrulers from power. On March 10, 1998, President Kabbah returned after \n10 months in exile and reassumed control.\n  Unfortunately violence continues to ravage the country. In January of \nthis year, RUF launched an offensive to take the capital, Freetown. \nThough ECOMOG drove rebel forces from the city, numerous reports of \nrape, mutilations, kidnapping of children for forced combat, and \nkillings of innocent civilians by RUF forces continue to surface.\n  Official estimates report that in the last 2 months alone, the death \ntoll has reached 2,000 to 3,000 people, with many also dying from lack \nof food and medicine. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \nestimates the number of refugees fleeing to Guinea and Liberia at \n440,000.\n  The administration has expressed shock and horror regarding the \ndesperate situation in Sierra Leone and I am pleased that they have \nindicated they will provide $1.3 million for logistical support for \nECOMOG in 1999, and $55 million for humanitarian assistance for the \npeople of Sierra Leone. This Resolution builds on the administration's \nefforts, and calls for a strong U.S. commitment to end the violence and \nsuffering in Sierra Leone.\n  First, it condemns the violence committed by the rebel troops and \nthose\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\nthat provide them with financial, political, and other types of \nassistance.\n  Second, it supports increased U.S. political and logistical support \nfor ECOMOG, while recognizing the need for ECOMOG to improve its \nperformance and increase its respect for humanitarian law.\n  Third, it calls for immediate cessation of hostilities and \nthe observance of human rights.\n\n  Fourth, it supports a dialogue between members of the conflict in \norder to bring about a resolution.\n  Finally, it expresses support for the people of Sierra Leone in their \nendeavor to create and maintain a stable democratic society.\n  The situation in Sierra Leone and the influx of refugees to \nneighboring countries threatens the stability of the entire West \nAfrican region. This is not a time for the United States and the \ninternational community to turn our backs. The people of Sierra Leone \nhave already suffered too much and will suffer even more if we do not \nact. Rather, this is the time to stand firmly on the side of peace and \ndemocracy and the betterment of the lives of all Sierra Leonians.\n  By passing this legislation, we are making a strong statement in \nsupport of the efforts to contain and bring to a peaceful end this \nconflict. We have seen all too many times, in all too many places \naround the world the price that is paid if we choose to avert our eyes \nand allow violence to flourish. We should not make that mistake. We \nshould not hesitate to raise our voice. I encourage all my colleagues \nto vote in favor of this resolution and in favor of human rights and \njustice in Sierra Leone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2145-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2146-S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DR. GLENN T. SEABORG\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a \npioneering scientist and a great American, Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, who \ndied on February 25 at the age of 86. Although a chemist by training, \nDr. Seaborg is best remembered for his contributions to nuclear \nphysics. Dr. Seaborg was the co-discoverer of plutonium, and led a \nresearch team which created a total of nine elements, all of which are \nheavier than uranium. For this he was awarded the Nobel Prize in \nChemistry in 1951 which he shared with Dr. Edwin M. McMillan.\n  In 1942, as a member of the Manhattan Project, Dr. Seaborg was \nassigned to a laboratory at the University of Chicago. There he headed \na unit that worked to isolate plutonium from uranium--the fuel used in \nthe atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. After the war ended, Dr. Seaborg \nreturned to the University of California at Berkeley until 1961, when, \nat the request of President John F. Kennedy, he became chairman of the \nAtomic Energy Commission (AEC). It was a position he held for ten \nyears, spanning three administrations. Dr. Seaborg was the first \nscientist to direct the Commission. It was in this capacity that Dr. \nSeaborg acted as an advisor to the U.S. negotiator, Averell Harriman, \nin talks that led to the Limited Test Ban Treaty and was an advocate \nfor the peaceful use of atomic energy.\n  Dr. Seaborg kept a journal while chairman of the AEC. The journal \nconsisted of a diary written at home each evening, correspondence, \nannouncements, minutes, and the like. He was careful about classified \nmatters; nothing was included that could not be made public, and the \njournal was reviewed by the AEC before his departure in 1971. \nNevertheless, more than a decade after his departure from the AEC, the \nDepartment of Energy subjected two copies of Dr. Seaborg's journals--\none of which it had borrowed--to a number of classification reviews. He \ncame unannounced to my Senate office in September of 1997 to tell me of \nthe problems he was having getting his journal released, saying it was \nsomething he wished to have resolved prior to his death. I introduced a \nbill to return to Dr. Seaborg his journal in its original, unredacted \nform but to no avail, so bureaucracy triumphed. It was never returned. \nNow he has left us without having the satisfaction of resolving the \nfate of his journal. It is devastating that a man who gave so much of \nhis life to his country was so outrageously treated by his own \ngovernment.\n  Dr. Seaborg continued to lead a productive life until the very end. \nAfter his tenure as chairman of the AEC, Dr. Seaborg returned to the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley where he was a University \nProfessor--the highest academic distinction--and later a professor in \nthe university's graduate school of education as a result of his \nconcern about the quality of science education. He was the director of \nthe Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and until his death its director \nemeritus.\n  And there were well deserved accolades. In 1991 Dr. Seaborg was \nawarded the nation's highest award for scientific achievement, the \nNational Medal of Science. In 1997 the International Union of Pure and \nApplied Chemistry named an element after a living person for the first \ntime. Thus element 106 became Seaborgium (Sg), and Dr. Seaborg was \nimmortalized as a permanent part of the periodic table to which he had \nalready added so much.\n  So today I remember Dr. Seaborg for his contributions to nuclear \nphysics, and I salute him for his service as chairman of the Atomic \nEnergy Commission. Dr. Seaborg's family is in my prayers at this time \nof great loss; his wife of 57 years, Helen, and five of their six \nchildren: Lynne Annette Seaborg, Cobb, David Seaborg, Stephen Seaborg, \nJohn Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Karole Seaborg. Their son Peter Glenn \nSeaborg died in May of 1997.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Dr. Seaborg's obituary, which appeared in \nthe Washington Post on Saturday, February 27, 1999, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 1999]\n\n                Nobel-Winning Chemist Glenn Seaborg Dies\n\n                            (By Bart Barnes)\n\n       Glenn T. Seaborg, 86, the chemist whose work leading to the \n     discovery of plutonium won a Nobel Prize and helped bring \n     about the nuclear age, died Feb. 25 at his home near \n     Berkeley, Calif.\n       He had been convalescing since suffering a stroke in August \n     while being honored at a meeting in Boston of the American \n     Chemical Society.\n       Dr. Seaborg was a major player on the team of scientists \n     that developed the world's first atomic bomb used in warfare, \n     which was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945, in \n     the closing days of World War II. His research was later a \n     critical element in the peacetime operation of nuclear power \n     plants.\n       For 10 years, during the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon \n     administrations, he was chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy \n     Commission. It was a period of Cold War tension and mounting \n     international anxiety over the nuclear arms race. As the \n     president's primary nuclear adviser, Dr. Seaborg participated \n     in negotiations that led to the Limited Nuclear Test Ban \n     Treaty of 1963, and he was an articulate and forceful \n     advocate for the peaceful use of atomic energy.\n       A former chancellor of the University of California at \n     Berkeley, Dr. Seaborg returned to the university as a \n     chemistry professor on leaving the AEC chairmanship in 1971.\n       It was at the Berkeley laboratories three decades earlier \n     that he created from uranium a previously unknown element \n     that he called plutonium. The amount was infinitesimally \n     small, about a millionth of a millionth of an ounce, and it \n     could not be seen with the naked eye.\n       The process by which this was achieved--the transmutation \n     of uranium into plutonium by bombarding it with neutrons--\n     would win the 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry, which Dr. \n     Seaborg shared with a Berkeley colleague, Edwin M. McMillan. \n     A form of this new element--known as plutonium 239--was found \n     to undergo fission and to release great energy when bombarded \n     by slow neutrons.\n       That, Dr. Seaborg would say later, gave plutonium 239 ``the \n     potential for serving as the explosive ingredient for a \n     nuclear bomb.''\n       In 1942, at the age of 30, Dr. Seaborg took a leave of \n     absence from the University of California to join the \n     Manhattan Project, the code name for the U.S. World War II \n     effort to develop an atomic bomb. Since Nazi Germany was \n     believed to be engaged in a similar effort, the project was \n     given the highest wartime priority.\n       Assigned to a laboratory at the University of Chicago, Dr. \n     Seaborg was chief of a Manhattan Project unit that was trying \n     to devise a way of isolating large amounts of plutonium from \n     uranium. By 1943, they had separated enough plutonium to send \n     samples to the Manhattan Project scientists working at the \n     laboratories at Los Alamos, N.M., where it was needed for \n     some crucial experiments.\n       To arrange for the return of the plutonium to the Chicago \n     laboratory, Dr. Seaborg had to devise a shortcut around the \n     cumbersome and top secret wartime security apparatus. Lacking \n     clearance to enter the Los Alamos laboratories, he took his \n     wife on a vacation to nearby Santa Fe, where one morning he \n     had breakfast with one of the Los Alamos physicists. At the \n     restaurant after the meal, the physicist handed over the \n     plutonium, which Dr. Seaborg placed in his suitcase and took \n     back to Chicago on a train.\n       By 1945, there had been enough plutonium produced to build \n     two atomic bombs, including the one dropped on Nagasaki, \n     Japan,\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\n     three days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Shortly \n     thereafter, Japan capitulated and on Aug. 14, 1945, the war \n     ended.\n       In 1946, Dr. Seaborg returned to Berkeley as a full \n     professor, where he continued his prewar research on the \n     discovery of new elements. He was associate director of the \n     Lawrence Radiation Laboratory and chief of its nuclear \n     chemistry research section from 1954 to 1958. He became \n     chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley in \n     1958 and served in that capacity until his 1961 appointment \n     as chairman of the AEC.\n       Glenn Theodore Seaborg was born in the small mining town of \n     Ishpeming, on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At the age of \n     10, he moved to a suburb of Los Angeles with his family. He \n     was first in his class and valedictorian in high school, and \n     in September 1929, he entered the University of California at \n     Los Angeles. To raise money for his college expenses he was a \n     stevedore, an apricot picker, a laboratory assistant at a \n     rubber company and an apprentice Linotype operator for the \n     Los Angeles Herald. He was an assistant in the UCLA chemistry \n     laboratory and a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n       On graduating from UCLA, he transferred to the University \n     of California's Berkeley campus where he had a teaching \n     assistantship and a fellowship to study nuclear chemistry \n     under the noted chemist, Gilbert N. Lewis. He received a \n     doctorate in chemistry at Berkeley in 1937, then became a \n     research associate under Lewis and later an instructor in \n     chemistry.\n       He was a popular classroom teacher, but it was in the \n     laboratory that Dr. Seaborg made his mark in the scientific \n     community. There his co-worker, McMillan, he demonstrated \n     that by bombarding uranium with neutrons, a new element--\n     heavier than uranium--could be identified and produced. He \n     called it neptunium after Neptune, the planet beyond Uranus \n     in the solar system.\n       Building on this demonstration, Dr. Seaborg directed a team \n     that employed a similar process to isolate the next of what \n     came to be known as the transurnium elements--those with \n     nuclei heavier than uranium, which had been the heaviest of \n     the known elements. This next new element was named \n     plutonium, after Pluto, the planet beyond Neptune in the \n     solar system.\n       This would become the critical element in the development \n     of atomic war weapons. After World War II, Dr. Seaborg \n     continued his work on transuranium elements in the Berkeley \n     laboratories, discovering substances later called \n     berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, \n     nobelium and ``seaborgium,'' which was officially accepted \n     as the name for element 106 in August 1997.\n       In his presentation speech on the awarding of the 1951 \n     Nobel Prize, A.F. Westgren of the Royal Swedish Academy said \n     Dr. Seaborg had ``written one of the most brilliant pages in \n     the history of discovery of chemical elements.''\n       As a member of the General Advisory Committee of the AEC, \n     Dr. Seaborg endorsed--reluctantly--the postwar crash program \n     that developed the hydrogen bomb.\n       ``Although I deplore the prospect of our country's putting \n     a tremendous effort into the H-bomb, I must confess that I \n     have been unable to come to the conclusion that we should \n     not,'' he said.\n       On his appointment as chancellor of the University of \n     California at Berkeley in 1958, Dr. Seaborg gave up his \n     research work. For the next three years, he supervised what \n     Newsweek magazine called ``possibly the best faculty in the \n     United States.''\n       His 1961 appointment as AEC chairman made him the first \n     scientist to direct the commission, and he was an insider and \n     adviser to President Kennedy and U.S. negotiator Averell \n     Harriman in the talks with the Soviet Union that led to the \n     Limited Test Ban Treaty. Ratified by the Senate in September \n     1963, the treaty banned above-ground nuclear tests and \n     committed the United States and the Soviet Union to seeking \n     ``discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons \n     for all time.'' For Dr. Seaborg, who had hoped for \n     comprehensive prohibition of nuclear tests, the treaty was \n     only a partial victory.\n       On leaving the AEC in summer 1971, Dr. Seaborg told NBC's \n     ``Meet the Press'' that the commission's major achievement \n     under his leadership was ``the development of economic \n     nuclear power and the placement of that in the domain of \n     private enterprise.'' In addition to the Limited Nuclear Test \n     Ban Treaty, he also mentioned the start-up of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency and the signing of the \n     Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n       He observed, somewhat ruefully, that it was the Department \n     of the Defense, not the AEC, that had full control of the \n     U.S. nuclear weapons program.\n       On rejoining the faculty of the University of California at \n     Berkeley, following his departure from the AEC, Dr. Seaborg \n     held the rank of university professor--the highest academic \n     distinction. In 1983, concerned with the quality of science \n     education, he became a professor in the university's graduate \n     school of education.\n       He was a former president of the American Association for \n     the Advancement of Science, and a recipient of the Enrico \n     Fermi Award of the AEC and the Priestly Medal of the American \n     Chemical Society. In 1991, he received the National Medal of \n     Science, the nation's highest award for scientific \n     achievement.\n       In 1942, Dr. Seaborg married Helen L. Griggs, with whom he \n     had four sons and two daughters. When his children were \n     young, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist was an enthusiastic \n     participant in family baseball, volleyball and basketball \n     games and in swimming contests.\n       One of his sons, Peter Glenn Seaborg, died in May of \n     1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2146-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n\n Mr. HATCH.

Res. 20, Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources name was changed to Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions on January 19, 1999.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  The rules follow:\n\n    Rules of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\n           (As adopted in executive session January 20, 1999)\n\n       Rule 1.--Subject to the provisions of rule XXVI, paragraph \n     5, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, regular meetings of \n     the committee shall be held on the second and fourth \n     Wednesday of each month, at 10:00 a.m., in room SD-430, \n     Dirksen Senate Office Building. The chairman may, upon proper \n     notice, call such additional meetings as he may deem \n     necessary.\n       Rule 2.--The chairman of the committee or of a \n     subcommittee, or if the chairman is not present, the ranking \n     majority member present, shall preside at all meetings.\n       Rule 3.--Meetings of the committee or a subcommittee, \n     including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the \n     public except as otherwise specifically provided in \n     subsections (b) and (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.\n       Rule 4.--(a) Subject to paragraph (b), one-third of the \n     membership of the committee, actually present, shall \n     constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business. \n     Any quorum of the committee which is composed of less than a \n     majority of the members of the committee shall include at \n     least one member of the majority and one member of the \n     minority.\n       (b) A majority of the members of the subcommittee, actually \n     present, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of \n     transacting business: provided, no measure or matter shall be \n     ordered reported unless such majority shall include at least \n     one member of the minority who is a member of the \n     subcommittee. If, at any subcommittee meeting, a measure or \n     matter cannot be ordered reported because of the absence of \n     such a minority member, the measure or matter shall lay over \n     for a day. If the presence of a member of the minority is not \n     then obtained, a majority of the members of the subcommittee, \n     actually present, may order such measure or matter reported.\n       (c) No measure or matter shall be ordered reported from the \n     committee or a subcommittee unless a majority of the \n     committee or subcommittee is actually present at the time \n     such action is taken.\n       Rule 5.--With the approval of the chairman of the committee \n     or subcommittee, one member thereof may conduct public \n     hearings other than taking sworn testimony.\n       Rule 6.--Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and \n     matters before the committee or a subcommittee if the absent \n     member has been informed of the mater on which he is being \n     recorded and has affirmatively requested that he be so \n     recorded.

Such records shall contain the vote cast by each \n     member of the committee or subcommittee on any question on \n     which a ``yea and nay'' vote is demanded, and shall be \n     available for inspection by any committee member.

The presiding officer at \n     any hearing is authorized to limit the time of each witness \n     appearing before the committee or a subcommittee. The \n     committee or a subcommittee shall, as far as practicable, \n     utilize testimony previously taken on bills and measures \n     similar to those before it for consideration.\n       Rule 10.--Should a subcommittee fail to report back to the \n     full committee on any measure within a reasonable time, the \n     chairman may withdraw the measure from such subcommittee and \n     report that fact to the full committee for further \n     disposition.\n       Rule 11.--No subcommittee may schedule a meeting or hearing \n     at a time designated for a hearing or meeting of the full \n     committee.

In the event there are \n     supplemental, minority, or additional view, and appropriate \n     opportunity shall be given the majority to examine the \n     proposed text prior to filing or publication.\n       Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue \n     subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear \n     subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has \n     been authorized by majority vote of the committee.\n       (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn \n     testimony or hear subpoenaed witnesses, three members of the \n     committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum: \n     provided, with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, a single \n     member may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony.\n       (c) the committee may, by a majority vote, delegate the \n     authority to issue subpoenas to the chairman of the committee \n     or a subcommittee, or to any member designated by such \n     chairman. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any \n     other member so requesting, shall be notified regarding the \n     identity of the person to whom it will be issued and the \n     nature of the information sought and its relationship to the \n     authorized investigative activity, except where the chairman \n     of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, determines that such notice would \n     unduly impede the investigation. All information obtained \n     pursuant to such investigative activity shall be made \n     available as promptly as possible to each member of the \n     committee requesting same, or to any assistant to a member of \n     the committee, designated by such member in writing, but the \n     use of any such information is subject to restrictions \n     imposed by the rules of the Senate. Such information, to the \n     extent that it is relevant to the investigation shall, if \n     requested by a member, be summarized in writing as soon as \n     practicable. Upon the request of any member, the chairman of \n     the committee or subcommittee shall call an executive session \n     to discuss such investigative activity or the issuance of any \n     subpoena in connection therewith.\n       (d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing, or any \n     witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel \n     of his own choosing who shall be permitted, while the witness \n     is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.\n       (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential \n     material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of \n     the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made \n     public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary, \n     unless authorized by a majority of the members of the \n     committee or subcommittee.\n       Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of \n     their background and financial interests, including the \n     financial interests of their spouse and children living in \n     their household, on a form approved by the committee which \n     shall be sworn to as to its completeness and accuracy. The \n     committee form shall be in two parts--\n       (I) information relating to employment, education and \n     background of the nominee relating to the position to which \n     the individual is nominated, and which is to be made public; \n     and,\n       (II) information relating to financial and other background \n     of the nominee, to be made public when the committee \n     determines that such information bears directly on the \n     nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the \n     individual is nominated.\n       Information relating to background and financial interests \n     (parts I and II) shall not be\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\n     required of (a) candidates for appointment and promotion in \n     the Public Health Service Corps; and (b) nominees for less \n     than full-time appointments to councils, commissions or \n     boards when the committee determines that some or all of the \n     information is not relevant to the nature of the position. \n     Information relating to other background and financial \n     interests (part II) shall not be required of any nominee when \n     the committee determines that it is not relevant to the \n     nature of the position.\n       Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or \n     meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation, \n     shall not be initiated until at least five days after the \n     nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the \n     chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority \n     member, waives this waiting period.\n       Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the \n     committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the \n     committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at \n     any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire \n     membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice, \n     or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.\n       Rule 20.--In addition to the foregoing, the proceedings of \n     the committee shall be governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate and the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization \n     Act of 1946, as amended.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [Excerpts from the Standing Rules of the Senate]\n\n                                Rule XXV\n\n\n                          standing committees\n\n       1.

The majority leader or his designee shall \n     announce to the Senate whenever consent has been given under \n     this subparagraph and shall state the time and place of such \n     meeting. The right to make such announcement of consent shall \n     have the same priority as the filing of a cloture motion.\n       (b) Each meeting of a committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be \n     open to the public, except that a meeting or series of \n     meetings by a committee or a subcommittee thereof on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the members of the committee \n     or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or \n     meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       (c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or \n     subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be \n     broadcast by radio or television, or both, under such rules \n     as the committee or subcommittee may adopt.\n       (d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting \n     that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval \n     or disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance of \n     any such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to \n     enforce order on his own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Senator.

In the spirit of \n     section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the \n     committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the \n     development of hearings:\n       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in \n     the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement \n     of such hearing.\n       2. Seven days prior to public notice of each committee or \n     subcommittee hearing, the committee or subcommittee should \n     provide written notice to each member of the committee of \n     the time, place, and specific subject matter of such \n     hearing, accompanied by a list of those witnesses who have \n     been or are proposed to be invited to appear.\n       3.

When statements are received in advance of a \n     hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as appropriate) \n     should distribute copies of such statements to each of its \n     members.\n\n\n         executive sessions for the purpose of marking up bills\n\n       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to \n     assist each member of the committee so that there may be full \n     and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a \n     subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be \n     followed:\n       1. Seven days prior to the proposed date for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice \n     to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific \n     subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing \n     each bill or other matters to be considered and including:\n       (a) two copies of each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       (b) two copies of a summary of the provisions of each bill, \n     joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       2.

Mr. President, I ask that the article entitled ``A \nMilitary Problem Money Can't Solve,'' which appeared in this morning's \nNew York Times, be printed in the Record. It helps to illustrate why \nthe Senate should have taken a closer look at the provisions of S. 4 \nbefore voting on it. Had hearings been held on the bill, and had we \nawaited the completion of studies by the CBO, GAO and Defense \nDepartment, perhaps some Senators would have had a chance to become \nfamiliar with the reasons that our service men and women leave the \nmilitary. As this article makes clear, retention may depend more on \nimproving quality of life than increasing pay and pensions.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [The New York Times, Tuesday, Mar. 2, 1999]\n\n                  A Military Problem Money Can't Solve\n\n                      (By Lucian K. Truscott 4th)\n\n       Los Angeles.--While members of the armed services are \n     underpaid and over-worked, the bill recently passed by the \n     Senate that gives them a pay raise doesn't address the real \n     problem: keeping skilled officers and noncommissioned \n     officers from leaving in mid-career.\n       The Army, Navy and Air Force now face serious enlistment \n     shortfalls. For example, last year the Navy fell 7,000 short \n     of its recruitment goal. The bill would raise military pay \n     4.8 percent and increase reenlistment bonuses and retirement \n     benefits.\n       But even if the improved benefit package helps attract more \n     recruits, there will continue to be a shortfall unless the \n     military does more to keep mid-career soldiers from \n     resigning.\n       Over the past few years, I have been in touch with more \n     than 100 men and women who have resigned from the service, \n     chiefly because my last two books have been about the \n     military. Not once have I heard them say that they left the \n     service because the pay was low. For many, quality-of-life \n     factors drove them away.\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\n       They complain that junior officers and enlisted men and \n     women with families are assigned to military housing that is \n     old and badly maintained. On many bases both here and abroad, \n     there is a shortage of housing, forcing many young families \n     to live off the base. Civilian landlords in neighborhoods \n     near military bases often charge above-market rents because \n     they know military families are a captive market.\n       Deployments to far-off ``peace-keeping'' missions are \n     another reason for mid-career attrition. With all of the \n     services shorthanded, assignments to these hardship missions \n     are far more frequent than in the past. Moreover, to soldiers \n     who have been trained to fight, many of these peacekeeping \n     missions seem pointless.\n       But the complaint I've heard as often as any other has been \n     about the system for advancement. One former officer told me \n     that the military's traditional ``zero defects'' policy now \n     applies to careers, not just to the readiness of a unit or to \n     effectiveness in combat. One bad rating from a senior officer \n     can end a career. ``Everyone seems afraid to take the \n     slightest chance at making a mistake,'' he said, for fear of \n     getting a bad review.\n       So the mid-level officers may be jumping ship because the \n     solution--which would include dissolving the unfair ratings \n     system--is too radical to ever be considered.\n       Dissatisfaction with the overall ratings system for \n     officers also helps to explain why the 20 percent increase in \n     retirement benefits called for in the Senate bill is unlikely \n     to improve retention rates. There are fewer slots as you go \n     higher in rank, so promotions get harder.\n       In the past, for example, a major who wasn't promoted to \n     lieutenant colonel could stay at the same rank and still get \n     full retirement benefits after 20 years of service. Now many \n     of those who don't get promoted are asked to leave the \n     military.\n       The new officer rating system, established a year ago, has \n     rigorous quotas that insure that only a certain number of \n     soldiers are promoted--and reach retirement age. The ratings \n     system uses four levels, but no more than half of the \n     soldiers a superior officer oversees can be given the top \n     rating. Soldiers who consistently score at the top are the \n     ones who will qualify for retirement benefits, the bulk of \n     which kick in at 20 years of service.\n       But that means the other half has little or no chance of \n     qualifying for retirement, and it's this group that is more \n     likely to resign from the service at mid-career. Several \n     former military men have told me that after receiving what \n     they considered to be unfair low ratings as junior officers \n     they drew the conclusion that they would never be able to \n     serve 20 years and reach retirement. Each of them decided to \n     resign early rather than stick around and learn late in his \n     career that his services were no longer wanted by the \n     military.\n       ``They tell you that if you're not going to go all the way \n     to 20, you'd better get out by the end of your eighth year, \n     because the corporate world won't take you after that,'' one \n     former soldier explained.\n       Many former soldiers I have corresponded with have \n     described their decisions to resign from the military as \n     complex and painful. But the emotion they express most \n     frequently is anger.\n       ``I think the most important reason for leaving is that the \n     Army pays lip service to taking care of its own, but it \n     really doesn't,'' one former officer wrote.\n       Still another former military man described the plight of \n     the mid-career professional soldier this way: ``They are sent \n     to far-off places with inadequate support, pointless missions \n     and foolish rules of engagement so the cocktail party set \n     back in D.C. . . . can have their consciences feel good.''\n       Many of the military men and women I've interviewed see no \n     one in senior leadership positions standing up and telling \n     the politicians that while a pay raise is nice, there are a \n     lot of other problems that need to be addressed. As one \n     former officer wrote me, ``Money would help, but it will not \n     cure.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2152-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL TRIO DAY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues \nattention to the celebration of National TRIO Day which took place on \nSaturday, February 28. National TRIO Day--which was created by a \nconcurrent resolution during the 99th Congress--is celebrated every \nyear on the last Saturday of February, and serves as a day of \nrecognition for the Federal TRIO Programs.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the TRIO Programs actually consist of \nseveral educational programs: Talent Search; Upward Bound; Upward Bound \nMath/Science; Veterans Upward Bound; Student Support Services; Ronald \nE. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program; and Educational \nOpportunity Centers. These programs, established over 30 years ago, \nprovide services to low-income students and help them overcome a \nvariety of barriers to obtaining a higher education, including class, \nsocial, and cultural barriers.\n  Currently, 2,000 colleges, universities and community agencies \nsponsor TRIO Programs, and more than 780,000 low-income middle school, \nhigh school, and adult students benefit from the services of these \nprograms. By lifting students out of poverty, these students can pursue \ntheir highest aspirations and achieve the American dream, even as our \nnation is collectively lifted to new heights.\n  Mr. President, there are 15 TRIO Programs in my home State of Maine \nthat serve 6,000 aspiring students each year. I know that these \nprograms work because I have seen and heard of the tangible impact the \nprograms have had--and continue to have--on individuals in Maine.\n  The impact of the TRIO Programs speaks for itself when considering \nthat TRIO graduates can be found in every occupation one can think of, \nincluding doctors, lawyers, astronauts, television reporters, actors, \nstate senators, and even Members of Congress. In fact, two of our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives--Congressman Henry Bonilla \nand Congressman Albert R. Wynn--are graduates of the TRIO Programs.\n  In closing, as we celebrate National TRIO Day, I would like to \nencourage my colleagues to learn more about the TRIO Programs in their \nrespective states, and see for themselves the impact the programs have \nhad--and continue to have--on their constituents. Ensuring that all of \nour nation's students who desire a higher education are able to attain \nit is a goal that I think we can all agree on--and TRIO makes it \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/02/senate-section/article/S2153-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination on the Executive Calendar: No. 9.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements relating to \nthe nomination appear at this point in the Record, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return \nto legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the nomination.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nin favor of the nomination of James M. Simon, Jr., to be the Assistant \nDirector of Central Intelligence for Administration. As part of the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (S. 1718), the \nSenate Created the Office of the Director of Central Intelligence \n(ODCI), clarified the DCI's responsibilities for managing the \nIntelligence Community, and crated three new leadership positions in \nthe ODCI: the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\n(ADCI) for Collection, the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence \nfor Analysis and Production, and the Assistant Director of Central \nIntelligence for Administration. According to the Act, the ADCIs were \nto be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n  At Conference, the House agreed to create the three new positions \nprovided that the position of Deputy Director of Central Intelligence \nfor Community Management (DDCI/CM) also be created as a position \nrequiring the advise and consent of the Senate. Therefore the \nConference Report included the three ADCI positions and added the DDCI/\nCM position within he Office of the DCI. The ADCIs report directly to \nthe DDCI/CM. This new leadership structure was enacted into law by P.L. \n104-293.\n  The intent was to create a ``Goldwater-Nichols'' equivalent \nlegislation for the intelligence Community by breaking down the \nbarriers to effective community management erected by the very powerful \ndirectors of various intelligence agencies. In many cases, these \ndirectors act unilaterally on the day-to-day decisions concerning \ncollection, production, and administration within the Community. On May \n22, 1998, the Committee favorably reported the nomination of Joan \nDempsey to be the first DDCI/CM. The Senate confirmed her on May 22, \n1998.\n  A great deal of the responsibility for management improvement within \nthe Intelligence Community will lie with the Assistant Director of \nCentral Intelligence for Administration. Therefore, the position \nrequires a strong and determined individual that is prepared to \nconfront and overcome the inevitable resistance of an entrenched and \ncalcified bureaucracy.\n  Mr. James M. Simon, Jr., a career intelligence officer, was nominated \nby the President to be the first Assistant Director of Central \nIntelligence for Administration, and the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence held open hearings on his nomination on February 4, 1999. \nOn February 24, 1999, the Committee voted to favorably report the \nnomination of Mr. Simon to he full Senate.\n  Mr. Simon was born in Montgomery, Alabama on 1 July 1947. He is \nmarried to Susan Woods of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n  Mr. Simon was commissioned in the US Army in 1969, retiring in 1997 \nfrom the active reserve. Trained as a signal officer and in \nintelligence, he has commanded a SIGINT/EW company and has been \noperations officer of a psychological warfare battalion. He is a \ngraduate of the Military Intelligence Officers Advanced Course, the \nCommand and General Staff College, and has completed the Security \nManagement Course from the national War College.\n  After discharge, Mr. Simon became a research intern at Radio Free \nEurope and served as teaching assistant to the Dean of the University \nof Southern California's Graduate Program in International Relations in \nGermany prior to returning to the United States to study for a Ph.D.\n  Mr. Simon has a B.A. in political science from the University of \nAlabama and a M.A. in international relations from the University of \nSouthern California. He held both Herman and Earhart fellowships while \npursuing a Ph.D at USC with emphasis in national security, bureaucracy, \nSoviet studies, and Marxism-Leninism. He has given lectures at Harvard, \nCornell, Utah State, the Joint Military Intelligence College, the \nCommand and General Staff College, the Navy War College, the Air War \nCollege, and the national War College. For two years, he taught Soviet \nwar fighting at he Air University's course for general officers.\n  Mr. Simon left USC before completing his dissertation and joined the \nCIA in 1975 through its Career Training Program. He served briefly in \nthe clandestine service before joining he Directorate of Intelligence's \nOffice of Strategic Research as a military analyst specializing in \ntactics and doctrine. He served as chief of a current intelligence \nbranch as well as of two branches concerned with Soviet military \nstrategy, doctrine, and plans. From 1986 to 1990 he was in charge of \nthe intelligence community organization responsible for asking the \nimagery constellation. In 1990, he was assigned as the senior \nintelligence representative to the US delegation for the Conventional \nForces in Europe (CFE) Treaty in Vienna where he was principal \nnegotiator for the Treaty's information exchange protocol. After \nratification, in 1991, Mr. Simon was reassigned as Chief of ACIS Rhein \nMain in Frankfurt; the Community's facility responsible for the \npreparation, debriefing, and reporting of information gained by arms \ncontrol inspection teams throughout Europe. In 1993, Mr. Simon became \nchief of a division in the Office of European Analysis and in 1996 was \nnamed Chief of the Collection Requirements and Evaluation Staff.\n  The Intelligence Committee believes that Mr. Simon is well qualified \nfor this new position. Accordingly,I again urge my colleagues to \nsupport this nomination and vote in favor of the Nominee.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join Chairman Shelby in \nrecommending to the Senate that Mr. James M. Simon be confirmed as the \nnew Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration. Mr. \nSimon has demonstrated the essential qualities required for this \nposition, and I believe the Director of Central Intelligence has acted \nwisely in proposing to the President Mr. Simon's nomination.\n  I am glad the Director of Central Intelligence is fulfilling one of \nthe obligations imposed by the Fiscal Year 1997 Intelligence \nAuthorization Act. In that Act, Congress--after extended discussions \namong the relevant committees--created a new management structure for \nthe Office of the DCI. That structure included the new positions of \nAssistant Directors of Central Intelligence--one for intelligence \ncollection, one for intelligence analysis, and one for community \nadministration. The nomination to be considered by the Senate, the \nAssistant Director for Administration, will help to play an important \nrole in ensuring the Intelligence Community is effectively managed.\n  To date, the DCI has taken the interim steps of appointing acting \nAssistant Directors for collection and for analysis. I expect \nPresidential nominations for these positions will be forthcoming soon. \nI must say, the Senate's wisdom in the Fiscal Year 1997 Intelligence \nAuthorization Act has been confirmed by the DCI's interim appointments. \nPrior to the appointments of Mr. Charles Allen and Mr. John Gannon, \nCongress and the American people looked to the DCI to manage both the \ncollection of intelligence information and the analysis of that \ninformation. Without any assistance in these areas, it was literally \nhis personal responsibility. When the intelligence community fails to \ncollect adequate information to prevent policy-makers from being \nsurprised, Congress and the American people blame the DCI. Further, \nwhen the intelligence community fails to marshal its resources to \nanalyze tough intelligence targets, Congress and the American people \nagain blame the DCI. The blame was clear, for example, in last year's \nIndian nuclear test incident. Affixing the responsibility on the DCI \nwas warranted, but he did not have the management structure in place to \nhelp him fulfill his responsibilities. The Fiscal Year 1997 \nIntelligence Authorization Act created a structure to help the DCI \ndischarge his responsibilities and, following the Indian nuclear tests, \nthe DCI began filling the new structure. So far, the results of Mr. \nAllen's and Mr. Gannon's work demonstrate that community-wide \ncoordination is appropriate and sorely needed.\n  Mr. Simon is eminently qualified. He is a career intelligence \nofficer. He has demonstrated throughout his career the ability to make \ntough calls and to be held accountable for those calls. In his most \nrecent assignment as the head of the CIA's Requirements Evaluation \nStaff, he has taken on a task to fix something that has long been \nbroken. He is working on a way to place a value on the different kinds \nof intelligence we collect. To the uninitiated this may sound fairly \nunimportant and, perhaps, even easy. But is not. It is hard because it \ndirectly challenges the directors of the heads of the agencies within \nthe Intelligence Community. For example, it forces the head of signals \nintelligence to justify the quality of his efforts relative to the \nefforts of another agency that controls human intelligence. It has a \nsimilar effect on judging the value of satellite collection relative to \nthe other ways we obtain\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\nour intelligence information. No agency director likes this evaluation \nbecause it forces questions to be answered on such fundamental issues \nas to whether or not community-wide budget and personnel resources are \nbeing directed in the right areas. Directors naturally resist a \ncomparison of the value of their agency's work versus the value of the \nwork of other agencies. Nonetheless, Mr. Simon chose to take on the \nagency heads in the Intelligence Community because it was the right \nthing to do.\n  The DCI has made an excellent choice in recommending Mr. Simon to the \nPresident. Mr. Simon should be confirmed by the Senate. I believe his \nservices as the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for \nAdministration will have a significant and lasting impact on the \nIntelligence Community. I urge my colleagues to support this \nnomination.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed follows:\n\n\n                          central intelligence\n\n       James M. Simon, Jr., of Alabama, to be Assistant Director \n     of Central Intelligence for Administration.

Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce this \nResolution with my colleague Senator Hutchison, who, like me, is a \nformer Girl Scout. This Resolution designates next week as National \nGirl Scout Week. I am so happy that we are able to recognize the \nimportant achievements of the Girls Scouts with such broad bipartisan \nsupport. Scouting instills the values that really matter--duty, honor, \npatriotism and service. I am so proud to honor the Girl Scouts for all \nthey do to prepare our young women to be leaders for the future.\n  As a Girl Scout, you participate in a broad range of activities--from \ntaking nature hikes to taking part in the arts. You serve in local food \nbanks and learn about politics. The skills, values and attitudes you \nlearn as a Girl Scout can help guide you through your life. As your \nskills grow, so will your self confidence. Eventually you will earn \nyour badges which will serve as symbols that you are succeeding and \ndoing something constructive for your community. You learn the \nimportance of treating other people fairly and with the dignity they \ndeserve. You have the confidence to know that you can reach your goals. \nYou can learn to be a leader.\n  In today's hectic world, Scouts are more important than ever. Young \nboys and girls desperately need before and after school activities to \nkeep their active minds' focused. They need adult role models like \ntheir Girl Scout leaders, who are dedicated to inspiring young people.\n  As the Senator from Maryland, one of my highest priorities is to \npromote structured, community-based after school activities to give \nchildren more help and more ways to learn. After school activities also \nkeeps children stay out of trouble and keeps them productive. That's \njust what the Girl Scouts do. They promote character & responsibility. \nThey teach the arts and cultural activities. They give kids the tools \nfor success.\n  I applaud the Girl Scouts. I also thank them for what they did for me \nand what they do for millions of young women across the country. I hope \nthe Resolution that Senator Hutchison and I have introduced here today \ncalls more attention to the good work of the Girl Scouts. I hope it \nshows that there are solid after school activities that children can \nactively participate in while learning real life skills. Mr. President, \nI congratulate the Girl Scouts as they celebrate their 87th \nanniversary. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant Resolution.\n  Mr. ALLARD.
