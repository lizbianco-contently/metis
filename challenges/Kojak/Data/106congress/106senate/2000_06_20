Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak on the \ntopic of bankruptcy reform. As many of my colleagues may know, Congress \nis on the verge of enacting fundamental bankruptcy reform. Earlier this \nyear, the Senate passed bankruptcy reform by an overwhelming vote of \n83-14. Almost all Republicans voted for the bill and about one-half of \nthe Democrats voted for it as well. Despite this, a tiny minority of \nSenators are using undemocratic tactics to prevent us from going to \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  As I'm speaking now, the House and Senate have informally agreed on \n99 percent of all the issues and have drafted an agreement which has \nbicameral and bipartisan support. The remaining three issues are sort \nof side shows, and I'm confident we'll be able to move from the one \nyard line to the end zone. My remarks this morning relate the agreement \nwe've reached on the core bankruptcy issues and the continuing need for \nbankruptcy reform.\n  As I've stated before on the Senate floor, every bankruptcy filed in \nAmerica creates upward pressure on interest rates and prices for goods \nand services. The more bankruptcies filed, the greater the upward \npressure. I know that some of our more liberal colleagues are trying to \nstir up opposition to bankruptcy reform by denying this point and \nsaying that tightening bankruptcy laws only helps lenders be more \nprofitable. This just isn't true. Even the Clinton administration's own \nTreasury\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\nSecretary Larry Summers indicated that bankruptcies tend to drive up \ninterest rates. Mr. President, if you believe Secretary Summers, \nbankruptcies are everyone's problem. Regular hardworking Americans have \nto pay higher prices for goods and services as a result of \nbankruptcies. That's a compelling reason for us to enact bankruptcy \nreform during this Congress.\n  Of course, any bankruptcy reform bill must preserve a fresh start for \npeople who have been overwhelmed by medical debts or sudden, unforeseen \nemergencies. That's why the bill that passed the Senate--as well as the \nfinal bicameral agreement--allows for the full, 100 percent \ndeductibility of medical expenses. This is according to the \nnonpartisan, unbiased General Accounting Office. Bankruptcy reform must \nbe fair, and the bicameral agreement on bankruptcy preserves fair \naccess to bankruptcy for people truly in need.\n  These are good times in our Nation. Thanks to the fiscal discipline \ninitiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American people, we \nhave a balanced budget and budget surplus. Unemployment is low, we have \na burgeoning stock market and most Americans are optimistic about the \nfuture.\n  But in the midst of this incredible prosperity, about 1\\1/2\\ million \nAmericans declared bankruptcy in 1998 alone. And in 1999, there were \njust under 1.4 million bankruptcy filings. To put this in some \nhistorical context, since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings \nhas increased almost 100 percent.\n\n  With large numbers of bankruptcies occurring at a time when Americans \nare earning more than ever, the only logical conclusion is that some \npeople are using bankruptcy as an easy out. The basic policy question \nwe have to answer is this: Should people with means who declare \nbankruptcy be required to pay at least some of their debts or non? \nRight now, the current bankruptcy system is oblivious to the financial \ncondition of someone asking to be excused from paying his debts. The \nrichest captain of industry could walk into a bankruptcy court tomorrow \nand walk out with his debts erased. And, as I described earlier, the \nrest of America will pay higher prices for goods and services as a \nresult.\n  I would ask my liberal friends to think about that for a second. If \nwe had no bankruptcy system at all, and we were starting from scratch, \nwould we design a system that lets the rich walk away from their debts \nand shift the costs to society at large, including the poor and the \nmiddle class? That wouldn't be fair. But that's exactly the system we \nhave now. Fundamental bankruptcy reform is clearly in order.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know that the bicameral \nagreement preserves the Torricelli-Grassley amendment to require credit \ncard companies to give consumers meaningful information about minimum \npayments on credit cards. Consumers will be warned against making only \nminimum payments, and there will be an example to drive this point \nhome. As with the Senate-passed bill, the bicameral agreement will give \nconsumers a toll-free phone number to call where they can get \ninformation about how long it will take to pay off their own credit \ncard balances if they make only the minimum payments. This new \ninformation will truly educate consumers and improve the financial \nliteracy of millions of American consumers.\n  The bicameral agreement also makes chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code \npermanent. This means that America's family farms are guaranteed the \nability to reorganize as our farm economy continues to be weak. As we \nall know from our recent debate on emergency farm aid, while prices \nhave rebounded somewhat, farmers in my home State of Iowa and across \nthe Nation are getting some of the lowest prices every for pork, corn, \nand soybeans. And fuel prices have shot up through the roof. The \nbicameral agreement broadens the definition of ``family farmer'' and \npermits farmers in chapter 12 to avoid crushing capital gains taxes \nwhen selling farm assets to generate cash flow. It would be highly \nirresponsible of my liberal friends to continue blocking bankruptcy \nprotections for our family farmers in this time of need.\n  The bicameral agreement is solidly bi-partisan and will pass by a \nhuge margin when it comes up for a vote. The bill is fair and contains \nsome of the broadest consumer protections of any legislation passed in \nthe last decade. So, how can any person possibly argue against a bill \nwhich strengthens consumer protections while cracking down on abuses by \nthe well-to-do?\n\n  The tiny handful of fringe radicals who oppose bankruptcy reform have \nwaged a disinformation campaign worthy of a Soviet Commissar. A recent \narticle in Time Magazine is a case in point. This article purports to \nprove that bankruptcy reform will harm low-income people or people with \nhuge medical bills. This article is simply false.\n  What's most interesting about this Time article is what it fails to \nreport. Time, for instance, fails to mention that the means test, which \nsorts people who can repay into repayment plans, doesn't apply to \nfamilies below the median income for the State in which they live. The \nTime article then proceeds to give several examples of families who \nwould allegedly be denied the right to liquidate if bankruptcy reform \nwere to pass. Each of these families, however, would not even be \nsubjected to the means test since they earn less than the median \nincome. While this sounds technical, it's important--not even one of \nthe examples in the Time article would be affected by the means test. \nFor the convenience of my colleagues, I have collected the actual \nbankruptcy petitions of the families referred to in the Time article, \nand I will provide them to any Senator.\n  Time fails to mention the massive new consumer protections in our \nbankruptcy reform bill. Time fails to mention the new disclosure \nrequirements on credit cards regarding interest rates and minimum \npayments. In short, the Time article fails to tell the whole truth. I \nthink that the American people deserve the whole truth.\n  The truth is that these bankruptcies represent a clear and present \ndanger to America's small businesses. Growth among small businesses is \none of the primary engines of our economic success.\n  The truth is bankruptcies hurt real people. Sometimes that will be \ninevitable. But it's not fair to permit people who can repay to skip \nout on their debts. I think most people, including most of us in \nCongress, have a basic sense of fairness that tells us bankruptcy \nreform is needed to restore balance. Let me share what my constituents \nare telling me.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have some of their comments printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          What Real People Are Saying About Bankruptcy Reform\n\n       ``The present [bankruptcy laws] are a joke . . . One local \n     man has declared bankruptcy at least four times at the \n     expense of suppliers to him. He just laughs at it . . .''--\n     Washington, Iowa.\n       ``It is way too easy to avoid responsibility.''--Cedar \n     Falls, Iowa.\n       ``If one assumes debt they need to pay it off . . . We've \n     got to take responsibility for our purchases!''--\n     Independence, Iowa.\n       ``Too many people use bankruptcy as an out, we need to make \n     sure people are held accountable for all their debts.''--\n     Harlan, Iowa.\n       ``Personal responsibility is a must in our country . . . \n     Sickness or loss of a job is one thing, but the majority of \n     people just don't pay, but spend their money elsewhere \n     knowing they can unload the debt with the help of the \n     courts.''--Fort Madison, Iowa.\n       ``I think people taking bankruptcy should have to pay the \n     money back . . . They should have learned to work for and pay \n     for what they get.''--Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n       ``It is insane that such a practice has been allowed to \n     continue, only causing higher prices to the consumer . . . \n     Debtors should be required to repay their debt.''--Des \n     Moines.\n       ``Bankruptcies are out of hand. It's time to make people \n     responsible for their actions--do we need to say \n     this!!!??''--Keokuk, Iowa.\n       ``We need to make people more responsible for their \n     decisions, while at the same time protecting those who fall \n     on hard times. I realize that this is a delicate balance, but \n     the way it is now, there is very little shame in going this \n     route.''--Floyd, Iowa.\n       ``People need to be more responsible for their debts. As a \n     small business owner, I have had to withstand several large \n     bills people have left with me due to poor management and \n     bankruptcy.''--Fontanelle, Iowa.\n       ``Bankruptcy reform will force the American people to \n     become more responsible for their actions, bankruptcy does \n     not seem to carry any degree of shame; it is almost regarded \n     as a right or entitlement.''--Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n       ``Many don't think the business is who loses. We make it \n     too easy now.''--Waverly, Iowa.\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, bankruptcy reform will happen. Our cause \nis right and just, and average Americans are strongly supportive of \nrestoring fairness to the bankruptcy system.\n  I am going to yield the floor now. Before I do, I thank Senator \nBiden, who is next to speak on this subject. If it had not been for \nSenator Biden working with us in a bipartisan way to get bankruptcy \nreform, it would never have passed by the wide margin of 84-13. He is a \nsincere person working on this. He has contributed immensely to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my colleague from \nIowa. He and I have worked together on a lot of issues. We tend to \napproach issues from a slightly different perspective but often end up \nin the same place, and that is the case here.\n  My concern in the reform of the bankruptcy code was not as much \ndriven by those who were avoiding debt as his was but about making sure \nthe overall consumer is protected. When people avoid debts they can \npay, it is a simple proposition: My mother living on Social Security \npays more at the department store to purchase something, my sons, who \nare beginning their careers, and my daughter pay more on their credit \ncard bill because someone else does not pay.\n  In recent days, a number of my colleagues have brought the Time \nmagazine article to my attention and to the attention of the Senator \nfrom Iowa and others. If you took a look at the Time magazine article \nand read it thoroughly, you would think we were about to tread on the \ndowntrodden, deserving Americans who are about to be, and I quote from \nthe article, ``soaked by the Congress.'' My colleagues have pointed \nthis out to me. They find it a very disturbing article. It tells a tale \nof corruption and greed and heartlessness, claims that hard-working, \nhonest, American families are about to be cut off from the fresh start \npromised by the bankruptcy code, and that lenders, who have driven \nthese families into economic distress, are about to kick them when they \nare down.\n  Most shocking in the article, perhaps, from my perspective, is the \nclaim that the U.S. Congress, by passing the bankruptcy reform \nlegislation which passed out of here overwhelmingly, will make all this \nhappen. As I said, it is a very disturbing article. It is hard to see \nhow anyone, in my view, could vote for bankruptcy reform if, in fact, \nthe essence of the article were true. But I remind my colleagues that \nbankruptcy reform legislation, not this imaginary legislation described \nin the article, passed the House by a vote of 313-108, and the Senate \nby 84-13. So this article claims a vast majority of both our parties in \nboth Houses of Congress are conspirators in an alleged plot to hit \nthose who are down on their luck.\n  The problem with this portrayal is the bankruptcy reform bill now in \nconference is the antithesis of what they have said. Their article is \nsimply dead wrong. I do not ever recall coming to the floor of the \nSenate in my 28 years and saying unequivocally: One of the most \nrespected periodicals and magazines in the country, with a major \narticle, is simply dead, flat, absolutely wrong. I don't recall ever \nbeing compelled to do that or being inclined to do that.\n  I will make one admission at the outset. It is the intent of the \nbankruptcy reform to tighten the bankruptcy system; that is true, to \nassure that those who have the ability to pay do not walk away from \ntheir legal debts. The explosion of bankruptcy in the early and mid-\n1990s revealed a problem with our system and the reform legislation is \na response to that by the strong bipartisan vote of both Houses.\n  I am more on that liberal side, as my friend from Iowa talks about. I \nadmire his pride that everybody should pay their debts, and I think \nthey should.\n  I am more inclined to let someone go than to hold them tightly. I \nadmit that part. But I came here with this reform legislation because \nall these bankruptcies are causing debts to be driven up by other \npeople. Interest rates go up on credit cards, not that credit card \ncompanies do not like high interest rates anyway. Interest rates go up \non automobile loans. Interest rates go up all over the board. The cost \nof borrowing money goes up when people who can pay do not pay. It means \ninnocent middle-class people and poor folks end up paying more.\n  Yes, bankruptcy reform is intended to require more repayment by those \nwho can afford it, more complete and verified documentation, and to \ngenerally discourage unnecessary and unwarranted filings. When the \nbankruptcy system is manipulated by those who can afford to pay, we all \npay.\n  This article claims that bankruptcy reform legislation is driven \nsolely by the greed of lenders, that abuse of the bankruptcy code is a \nmyth created by those who want to wring more money out of those who do \nnot have more money. That is not the position of the Justice \nDepartment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled ``U.S. Trustee \nProgram'' be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, back to the Time article. One would think \nthere was no reason to tighten up the current system, that those of us \nwho support bankruptcy reform--a large bipartisan majority--had lost \nour hearts, our souls, and possibly our minds. Some folks might find \nthat easy to believe, but if they simply compare the language of the \nlegislation to the case studies in the article, they will find that in \nvirtually every significant claim and detail, the charges leveled \nagainst this reform legislation are not true. They are simply false; \nthey are flat wrong; and they are easily and conclusively refuted by a \nquick look at the facts.\n  First, a little primer on the bankruptcy code reform. Chapter 7 of \nthe bankruptcy code requires a liquidation of any assets and a payout \nto as many creditors as possible from the proceeds. Chapter 13 allows \nthe filer to keep a home, a car, and so on, but requires them to enter \ninto a repayment plan. The irony is, chapter 13 was put in to help \npeople from the rigors of chapter 7. I do not have time to go into \nthat, but it is a basic premise that is missed by the article.\n  The bankruptcy reform legislation that is the cause for such alarm in \nthis article asks a question that I think most Americans would be \nsurprised to learn is never even asked under the present system. The \nquestion is: Do you have the ability to pay some of those debts that \nyou want forgiven?\n  If the answer is yes, then you will have to file for bankruptcy under \nchapter 13 and have what they call a workout, a repayment plan. No \none--I repeat, no one--who needs it would ever, as this article puts \nit, be denied bankruptcy assistance. That cannot happen now, and it \nwill not happen under this legislation. So it is not the idea you are \ndenied bankruptcy, it is how you file for bankruptcy--under chapter 7 \nor chapter 13.\n  Only a few filers of bankruptcy, no more than 10 percent of those now \nfiling under chapter 7--maybe even less--would see any change at all in \ntheir status. Those who have demonstrated an ability to pay would be \ntold to file under chapter 13 and would follow the kind of repayment \nplan their resources would allow.\n\n  A key point must be stressed: Chapter 13 is not some kind of debtor's \nprison. It is a practical solution to the problem of too many creditors \nchasing a debtor with too few resources. The article suggests that any \nchange in the availability of chapter 7 will be the equivalent of the \nwhip and the lash and the restoration of debtor's prison. The truth is \ndifferent.\n  Chapter 13 was added to the bankruptcy code in the 1930s as the more \ndesirable alternative to the draconian liquidation required under \nchapter 7. It was conceived as the ``wage earner's'' form of \nbankruptcy, for those who had an income and the ability to pay some of \ntheir creditors but who needed protection of the system to keep their \ncreditors from hounding them.\n  Although this may seem like a quaint notion these days, it was \nintended to preserve some of the debtor's dignity at a time when \nbankruptcy carried more of a stigma for some people than it does today.\n  A profoundly mistaken view of the difference between chapter 7 and \nchapter 13 is not the most serious flaw in\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\nthis article. The real impact of this article comes from its stories of \nhard-working, honest, everyday American families who have fallen on \nhard times. These are the people who will, according to the article, \nfind the door to a fresh start shut to them.\n  As disturbing as these stories are, they are all based on a \ndemonstrably false premise. As the Senator from Iowa said, virtually \nnone of the low- to moderate-income working families whose stories were \nso compellingly told in that article would be touched by the reforms \naffecting the availability of chapter 7.\n  That is right. In each and every case, given their income and their \ncircumstances as presented, those families and individuals who were \ntalked about in the article would still be eligible for chapter 7 \nprotection. The central claims about the impact of bankruptcy reform on \nthe families described in this article are flat wrong.\n  I know a lot of my colleagues have been concerned about these \ncharges, and I urge them to take a simple test. Compare the financial \ncircumstances of the individuals in the article and the stories that \nare told with the terms of our bankruptcy legislation. My colleagues \nwill see the claims that these families will be cut off are not true.\n  They are wrong chiefly because the reform legislation contains what \nwe call a safe harbor which preserves chapter 7, with no questions \nasked, for anyone earning the median income or less for the region in \nwhich they live. This is a protection I sought along with other \nsupporters of bankruptcy reform. It was a key element of the Senate \nbill, and it has been accepted in conference.\n  There is even more protection: Those with up to 150 percent of the \nmedian income will be subject to only a cursory look at their income \nand obligations, not a more detailed examination.\n  These provisions provide that the door to chapter 7 remains open for \njust the kind of family the article claims will be most hurt.\n  I will not chronicle all of them, but I ask you to listen to this one \nstory. Of all the cases chronicled in the article, I read most \ncarefully the story of Allen Smith of Wilmington, DE, my hometown. A \nWorld War II veteran, he had worked in our Newark, DE, Chrysler plant \nuntil the downsizing of the 1980s cost him his job.\n\n  Struck by cancer, my constituent from Wilmington, DE, was also hit \nwith the tragedy and expense of his wife's diabetes and then her death. \nHealth care costs drove him deeper and deeper into debt, and he filed \nfor bankruptcy under chapter 13. Further financial troubles led to the \nfailure of his chapter 13 plan, and he was then switched to chapter 7 \nunder which he will lose his home to pay some of his obligations.\n  I searched in vain to find any relevance of this profound human \ntragedy to the bankruptcy reform legislation. To the extent it has \nanything at all to do with the supposed point of the story, Mr. Smith's \nstory is presented to show us someone who is going to lose his home in \nbankruptcy, because he is now in chapter 7, exactly what the authors \npreviously argued should be the preferred chapter for individuals in \nhis circumstances. His sad story is an argument for catastrophic health \ninsurance, not against bankruptcy reform.\n  They contrast his case with that of a wealthy individual who uses the \nprotection of the present bankruptcy code by purchasing an expensive \nhome under Florida's unlimited homestead exemption to protect assets \nfrom creditors. One would never know it from reading the article, but \nin the Senate we voted to get rid of that unlimited exemption that now \nis in the law.\n  More recently, the conferees have agreed to eliminate precisely the \nkind of abuse criticized in this article. The article discusses at \nlength a case that has nothing to do with reform but criticizes an \nabuse that is actually fixed by this reform bill.\n  There are other profound inconsistencies and factual errors in the \narticle, including the assertion that medical expenses would not be \nconsidered in calculating a filer's ability to pay or would not be \ndischargeable after bankruptcy or that family support payments, such as \nchild support or alimony, would be a lower priority than a credit card \ndebt. None of these assertions is true.\n  However, without these errors, there would be no article.\n  In many cases, in terms of the new, additional protections for family \nsupport payments and improved procedures for reaffirmations, filers in \nthe kind of circumstances chronicled in the other stories in this \narticle would be better off, not worse off, when this legislation \npasses.\n  I know my colleagues have expressed their worries about this article. \nI truly ask them, look at the language of the legislation, look at the \narticles that are written, and you will find that, although this is not \na perfect bill, that none of the families chronicled in that article \nwould be affected at all except their circumstances improved, if in \nfact anything was to happen.\n  I know that my colleagues who have expressed their worries about this \narticle are sincere in their concern about the fairness of bankruptcy \nreform legislation. I urge them to apply the simple test of fairness to \nthis article, to compare the situations of those families in the \narticle to the actual provisions in the bankruptcy reform legislation. \nThey will find those families's access to the full protection of \nChapter 7 unchanged by this bill.\n  I ask them to do it for themselves: they don't have to take my word \nfor it.\n  This is not a perfect bill. It is not the even bill that I would have \nwritten by myself. But it is a bill that can pass that test.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues assembled on the floor \nfor the additional 4 minutes. I realize it is a tight day and time is \nof the essence. I appreciate their courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    [Bankruptcy Criminal Cases 1999]\n\n                          U.S. Trustee Program\n\n  (Criminal Cases: The United States Trustee Program's duties include \n    policing the bankruptcy system for criminal activity, referring \n suspected criminal cases to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, \n   and assisting in investigating and prosecuting those cases. Some \n   significant bankruptcy-related criminal cases are described here)\n\n                                  1999\n\n\n                                alabama\n\n       Attorney John C. Coggin III of Birmingham, Ala., was \n     sentenced July 26 to 36 months in prison for conspiracy \n     consisting of bankruptcy fraud, money laundering, and false \n     statements to a federal officer. Coggin hid more than \n     $200,000 that was due to creditors in his bankruptcy case, \n     using a corporation set up for that purpose.\n\n\n                                arizona\n\n       Bankruptcy petition preparer Richard S. Berry of Tempe, \n     Ariz., was sentenced April 20 in the District of Arizona to \n     six months in prison for criminal contempt of court, after \n     being fined $1 million in 1998 for willfully violating \n     Bankruptcy Court orders. Since January 1997, several court \n     orders addressed Berry's violations of the Bankruptcy Code's \n     provisions regulating bankruptcy petition preparers. The \n     Bankruptcy Fraud Task Force for the District of Arizona \n     sought criminal contempt charges against Berry based on his \n     violation of a January 1997 Bankruptcy Court order limiting \n     his fees.\n       Lawrence R. Costilow of Tucson pleaded guilty February 19 \n     to two counts of bankruptcy fraud arising from his actions as \n     a creditor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Costilow loaned \n     $50,820 to a married couple, obtaining an unsecured \n     promissory note in return. After the spouses filed for \n     bankruptcy, Costilow altered the note so it purposed to take \n     a security interest in their property. Costilow recorded the \n     note and later testified in bankruptcy court as to it \n     validity.\n\n\n                               california\n\n       Sherwin Seyrafi of Encino, Calif., pleaded guilty December \n     28 in the District of Arizona to bankruptcy fraud, misuse of \n     a Social Security number, and failure to file a corporate tax \n     return. The counts for bankruptcy fraud and misuse of an SSN \n     arose from Seyrafi's filing of a bankruptcy petition with the \n     knowledge that it contained a false spelling of his name and \n     a false Social Security number.\n       Judy Scharnhorst Brown, a Spring Valley, Calif., real \n     estate broker, was sentenced Nov. 9 in the Southern District \n     of California to 15 months in custody followed by three years \n     of supervised release and ordered to pay $75,000 in \n     restitution and fines for a bankruptcy fraud and mail fraud \n     scheme. On March 30, a jury convicted Brown on one count of \n     conspiracy, three counts of bankruptcy fraud, and eight \n     counts of mail fraud after a two-week jury trial.\n       On April 21 a federal jury in Los Angeles convicted \n     Faramarz Taghilou of Castaic, Calif., on two counts of \n     concealing his private airplane in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy \n     case. Taghilou failed to disclose in his bankruptcy documents \n     that he owned a Cessna 310Q insured for $120,000 and was \n     paying monthly leasing fees to have the airplane kept at Van \n     Nuys airport. Additionally, Taghilou's bankruptcy schedule \n     omitted a\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\n     creditor who had placed a mechanic's lien on the airplane; \n     the debtor paid that creditor two weeks after filing for \n     bankruptcy.\n       Theresa Marie Thompson-Snow pleaded guilty March 17 in the \n     Central District of California to false representation of a \n     Social Security number and bankruptcy fraud. Through an \n     error, Thompson-Snow obtained loan documents belonging to a \n     college classmate--now an English professor--with a similar \n     name. She subsequently assumed the professor's identity to \n     obtain thousands of dollars in credit, and ultimately filed \n     for bankruptcy in her victim's name.\n       Tricia Mendoza of Norwalk, Calif., was sentenced Jan. 11 to \n     one year in prison and ordered to pay almost $250,000 in \n     restitution for embezzling from a Chapter 13 trustee \n     operation. Mendoza, who was the trustee office's \n     receptionist, changed names and addresses in the computer \n     system to the name and address of an accomplice, thereby \n     diverting payments intended for creditors to an address she \n     controlled.\n       Stephen Martin Zuwala was sentenced June 9 to 57 months in \n     federal prison and 36 months supervised release, and ordered \n     to pay more than $50,500 in restitution, based on his \n     conviction on five counts of mail fraud, three counts of \n     criminal contempt, and four counts of misuse of a Social \n     Security number. Non-lawyer Zuwala contacted individuals \n     facing home foreclosure and offered assistance through \n     ``little-known federal relief programs'' that turned out to \n     be filing for bankruptcy. Zuwala typically charged $500 to \n     $1,000 per case, but disclosed only part of his fees in \n     documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court. All criminal \n     contempt counts arose from Zuwala's violation of a prior \n     judgment obtained by the United States Trustee to permanently \n     enjoin him from preparing bankruptcy documents for filing in \n     the Northern and Eastern Districts of California.\n       Bankruptcy petition preparers Regina Green and Raymond Zak \n     were sentenced April 15 based on their earlier convictions \n     for criminal contempt and bankruptcy fraud. Because of \n     misconduct, Green and Zak had been ordered by the Bankruptcy \n     Court for the Northern District of California to stop \n     preparing bankruptcy petitions, and they were prosecuted for \n     violating that order. Green was sentenced to seven months in \n     prison for contempt of court and forgery, and Zak was \n     sentenced to six months in a halfway house for bankruptcy \n     fraud. Both defendants were ordered to pay restitution and \n     were barred from acting as bankruptcy petition preparers.\n\n\n                                colorado\n\n       James Francis Cavanaugh pleaded guilty Oct. 8 to bankruptcy \n     fraud in the District of Colorado. When Cavanaugh filed for \n     bankruptcy, he falsely stated that he had sold certain horses \n     from his Colorado horse breeding operation for $10,000, \n     although he had earlier valued the horses at $124,000. He \n     also failed to disclose to the bankruptcy court that he had \n     interests in two bank accounts in Missouri.\n\n\n                                florida\n\n       After a jury trial in the Middle District of Florida, \n     certified public accountant Kenneth A. Stoecklin was \n     convicted July 8 for embezzlement from the bankruptcy estate \n     of Chapter 11 debtor Commonweal Inc. and obstruction of the \n     administration of the internal revenue laws. Stoecklin, the \n     controlling corporate officer of Commonweal Inc., transferred \n     substantially all of his assets to the real estate \n     development company in an apparent attempt to avoid an \n     individual income tax liability exceeding $137,000. He \n     subsequently withdrew funds from an account established to \n     provide the government with ``adequate protection'' pending \n     the outcome of tax-related litigation.\n       Warren D. Johnson Jr. was sentenced June 23 to 97 months \n     imprisonment and ordered to pay more than $5 million \n     restitution after being convicted of bankruptcy fraud, bank \n     fraud, and money laundering. During a June 1998 bond hearing, \n     Johnson testified that he had no interest in stocks or other \n     assets in the Turks and Caicos Island, when he actually held \n     around $25 million worth of stock in a publicly traded \n     company. In addition, Johnson claimed he was indigent and \n     could not pay restitution despite the fact that the \n     controlled more than $10 million in assets placed in the \n     names of family members and off-shore shell corporations. \n     Johnson's bankruptcy convictions resulted from a 1992 \n     bankruptcy case in which he claimed over $7.2 million in debt \n     and no assets, when he actually expected to receive at least \n     $1.2 million in real estate sale profits. Johnson laundered \n     approximately $250,000 of these profits by transferring the \n     funds to his wife and then using them for living expenses. \n     The bank fraud conviction resulted from Johnson's filing \n     false financial statements to obtain a $600,000 loan that he \n     did not repay.\n\n\n                                Georgia\n\n       The District Court for the Northern District of Georgia \n     entered judgment on December 13 against David Alvin Crossman \n     of Atlanta following his guilty plea to one count of filing a \n     false income tax return and one count of bankruptcy fraud. \n     Crossman set up a car leasing scheme under which he created \n     false financial statements and tax returns to lease cars as \n     if he were fleet leasing for a business, and then re-leased \n     the vehicles to individuals with poor credit. In his \n     individual and corporate Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, he \n     failed to turn over lease payments to the bankruptcy \n     trustees.\n       Craig D. Butler pleaded guilty Sept. 17 to bankruptcy fraud \n     and income tax evasion. In October 1995, Butler filed a \n     bankruptcy petition in which he made false representations \n     and statements to evade payment of federal income taxes. \n     During the bankruptcy case, Butler, who formerly practiced \n     medicine in Albany, Ga., used funds of his professional \n     corporation to pay his personal expenses and those of his \n     family members, while designating the payments as business-\n     related expenditures.\n\n\n                                 Hawaii\n\n       On December 10 a federal jury in the District of Hawaii \n     found attorney Stacy Moniz of Kaneohe guilty of filing a \n     false income tax return, structuring cash transactions to \n     evade currency reporting requirements, failing to report the \n     receipt of $15,000 cash in the operation of his law office, \n     making false statements to the IRS, and making a false \n     statement under penalty of perjury in a bankruptcy \n     proceeding. The bankruptcy count arose from Moniz's falsely \n     reporting a client to be a creditor in his August 1997 \n     bankruptcy case.\n       Arthur Kahahawai pleaded guilty Oct. 4 in the District of \n     Hawaii to two counts of bankruptcy fraud. Kahahawai concealed \n     from the bankruptcy trustee and his creditors a $71,517 \n     workers' compensation settlement that he received less than \n     one month before filing for bankruptcy.\n       Miyoko Mizuno, a/k/a Miyoko Proctor, pleaded guilty in the \n     District of Hawaii Sept. 24 to concealment of assets in her \n     bankruptcy case. The debtor attempted to discharge \n     approximately $185,000 in unsecured debts by filing for \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She listed no interests in real \n     property, when in fact she had deeded to her son a \n     condominium and her residence while retaining a life interest \n     in both properties, which could generate substantial rental \n     income.\n       Edward O'Kelley, former owner and president of HOJE \n     Construction, was sentenced April 23 in the District of \n     Hawaii to 33 months in prison for bankruptcy fraud \n     (concealment of assets and fraudulent transfer), and money \n     laundering. O'Kelley had been found guilty in a jury trial \n     for his role in putting HOJE Construction into Chapter 7 \n     bankruptcy and hiding its assets in bank accounts in Alaska \n     and Texas. HOJE performed subcontracting work on military \n     projects in Hawaii and Alaska from 1992 through 1995. \n     O'Kelley and HOJE operations manager Harry Jordan conspired \n     to hide more than $450,000, which the bankruptcy trustee \n     recovered.\n       Harry Jordan pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud Feb. 8 in \n     the District of Hawaii; he was sentenced to one year \n     probation with one month home confinement, and ordered to pay \n     $75,000 in restitution. The court took into account that \n     Jordan, the former operations manager of HOJE Construction \n     Inc., cooperated with the United States Attorney and \n     testified against HOJE president Edward O'Kelley, who was \n     found guilty of bankruptcy fraud and money laundering. HOJE \n     performed subcontracting work on military projects in Hawaii \n     and Alaska from 1992 to 1995, when it filed for bankruptcy. \n     More than $450,000 in concealed assets have been recovered.\n\n\n                                Illinois\n\n       A federal jury in the Northern District of Illinois Oct. 22 \n     convicted Vincent M. Gramarossa on two counts of bankruptcy \n     fraud and eight counts of money laundering. Gramarossa \n     defrauded bankruptcy creditors by skimming more than $580,000 \n     from his business, a State Farm Insurance agency in suburban \n     Chicago. Gramarossa's confirmed Chapter 11 reorganization \n     plan directed that he pay half his profits to creditors, but \n     Gramarossa devised a scheme under which he diverted \n     commissions to conceal approximately one-third of his \n     commissions.\n\n\n                                Indiana\n\n       Bankruptcy debtors' attorney David T. Galloway of Porter \n     County, Ind., pleaded guilty April 5 in the Northern District \n     of Indiana to criminal contempt and agreed to resign from the \n     practice of law for three years. Galloway served as counsel \n     for a Chapter 7 debtor who concealed a pending personal \n     injury action from the bankruptcy case trustee. The debtor \n     testified at the Section 341 meeting of creditors that his \n     medical debts resulted from illness. After the Section 341 \n     meeting, the United States Trustee's office in South Bend, \n     Ind., and the case trustee investigated the nature of the \n     medical debts, leading to the discovery of the personal \n     injury lawsuit.\n\n\n                                Kentucky\n\n       Debtors Daniel Caldera and Martha Kay Caldera of \n     Elizabethtown, Ky., were sentenced Oct. 20 in the Western \n     District of Kentucky for bankruptcy fraud. Daniel Caldera \n     pleaded guilty to concealing a $101,295 payment from C \n     Carpentry Service Inc.'s bankruptcy estate. He was \n     sentenced to 21 months imprisonment plus two years \n     supervised release, and ordered to pay $11,272 in \n     restitution. Martha Kay Caldera pleaded guilty to filing a \n     bankruptcy petition containing a materially false \n     declaration--that she and/or her spouse did not own an \n     annuity when in fact her spouse did. She was sentenced to \n     24 months probation, including six months of home \n     incarceration.\n\n\n                               Louisiana\n\n       Former district attorney James A. Norris, Jr. was sentenced \n     June 22 in the Western District of Louisiana to 33 months in \n     prison\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\n     and three years supervised release, and ordered to pay \n     $490,000 in restitution for bankruptcy fraud. On March 10, a \n     jury found Norris guilty of four counts of making false oaths \n     in a bankruptcy proceeding, in connection with his four \n     statements under oath that he had burned $500,000 cash in his \n     backyard. In 1989, Norris withdrew approximately $500,000 \n     from his law partnership's account in a dispute over business \n     decisions; his former law partners ultimately obtained a \n     court judgment against him and filed an involuntary \n     bankruptcy petition against him.\n       Attorney Betty L. Washington was sentenced Jan. 20 in the \n     Eastern District of Louisiana to 33 months in prison, and \n     ordered to pay approximately $5,000 in restitution, based on \n     a jury verdict finding multiple counts of fraud, including \n     bankruptcy fraud. In her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case Washington \n     concealed her right to receive legal fees from a client. \n     Further, as part of a scheme to obtain more than $20,000 in \n     automobile loans, Washington tried to mislead a bank into \n     believing her bankruptcy case had been concluded.\n\n\n                                 Maine\n\n       On June 8 Catherine Duffy Petit was sentenced in the \n     District Court for the District of Maine to 15 years and \n     eight months in prison and three years supervised release, \n     and ordered to forfeit nearly $164,000 and to pay restitution \n     of nearly $8 million, based on her conviction on 54 counts \n     (reduced by the court from 78) of conspiracy, bankruptcy \n     fraud, securities fraud, and other violations. Petit and co-\n     conspirators had raised almost $7 million--ostensibly for \n     litigation expenses--by selling interests in Petit's state \n     court suit against a bank.\n\n\n                             Massachusetts\n\n       On July 8 attorneys Wendy Golenbock and Cheryl B. Stein of \n     Weston, Mass., were each sentenced in the District of \n     Massachusetts to 21 months in jail for bankruptcy fraud. The \n     attorneys attempted to conceal their property interest in a \n     Cape Cod, Mass., vacation home from their bankruptcy trustee \n     and creditors. In March 1999, a jury found them guilty of \n     bankruptcy fraud and conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud.\n       Prosecutors in Boston announced Feb. 9 the settlement of \n     charges filed against Sears, Roebuck & Co. for improper debt \n     collection from Chapter 7 debtors. Sears agreed to pay a $60 \n     million criminal penalty, which is the largest ever paid in a \n     bankruptcy fraud case. The monies will be deposited into the \n     Crime Victims' Fund. Sears already paid over $180 million in \n     restitution and $40 million in civil fines to state attorneys \n     general, in connection with civil settlements in the case.\n\n\n                               Minnesota\n\n       Mark John McGowan of Mound, Minn., was sentenced Sept. 1 to \n     one year in prison and two years of supervised release for \n     bankruptcy fraud and perjury. In his Chapter 7 bankruptcy \n     schedules, McGowan listed a $100,000 house that he claimed \n     exempt as his homestead although he actually rented the house \n     and had no intent to occupy it.\n       Daniel J. Bubalo of Edina, Minn., was sentenced June 8 to \n     21 months in prison and ordered to pay $85,000 in restitution \n     following his conviction on two counts of bankruptcy fraud. \n     After Bubalo's bankruptcy case was converted from Chapter 11 \n     to Chapter 7, and without the Chapter 7 trustee's knowledge, \n     Bubalo sold for $70,000 a Duluth, Minn., bar valued at \n     $175,000. He later testified that the property's status had \n     not changed since his case was converted.\n\n\n                                Missouri\n\n       Keith D. Linhardt of Warrenton, Mo., pleaded guilty Feb. 12 \n     in the Eastern District of Missouri to bankruptcy fraud and \n     perjury. Linhardt admitted that he concealed financial \n     accounts as well as his interests as primary beneficiary of \n     seven life insurance policies--totaling more than $1.5 \n     million--on his wife, who died on a camping trip in April \n     1998. In July 1998, at his Section 341 meeting with \n     creditors, Linhardt testified to the trustee concerning his \n     non-debtor spouse as though she were alive. On January 15, \n     1999, Linhardt pleaded guilty to second degree murder of his \n     wife and was sentenced to life in prison. He also pleaded \n     guilty to four counts of insurance fraud and was sentenced to \n     20 years in prison, consecutive to the life sentence.\n\n\n                               New Jersey\n\n       Michelle A. Pruyn of Medford, N.J., pleaded guilty Oct. 1 \n     in the District of New Jersey to concealing company income \n     from her creditors, the Bankruptcy Court, and the IRS during \n     her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Pruyn was the former president \n     and owner of Sigma Acquisition Corp., Televid Media Buying \n     Inc., and other New Jersey-based video production-related \n     companies. She concealed assets worth at least $240,000 from \n     the court and her creditors by failing to disclose her \n     equitable interest in a Pennsauken, N.J., commercial building \n     and the existence of an investment account held in the name \n     of the Cogan Corp., to which she diverted part of the \n     receipts of Sigma and the other companies she owned.\n       Alexander Alegria of Fords, N.J., pleaded guilty July 21 to \n     filing a false bankruptcy petition. He admitted that he \n     falsely stated his Social Security number on the petition and \n     that he sought to discharge approximately $25,000 in debt he \n     had incurred under the false SSN.\n\n\n                                 Nevada\n\n       John and Rena Kopystenski of Las Vegas were sentenced on \n     December 2 to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay $67,000 \n     in restitution after pleading guilty in the District of \n     Nevada to bankruptcy fraud, money laundering, and aiding and \n     abetting. The Kopystenskis were principals of debtor Quality \n     Ice Cream Inc., which went through several bankruptcies under \n     different names with essentially the same assets.\n\n\n                                New York\n\n       Joseph W. Kennedy Jr. of Rochester, N.Y., was sentenced \n     Nov. 3 to 27 months in prison and three years supervised \n     release, and ordered to pay $235,000 in restitution, based on \n     his conviction on three counts of bankruptcy fraud.

In 1996, the United States Trustee obtained an order \n     fining Tank approximately $10,000 and prohibiting him from \n     engaging in certain deceptive practices or practicing law in \n     Oregon. Tank violated the order, and the United States \n     Trustee obtained a national permanent injunction against him. \n     Tank continued to prepare bankruptcy petitions, and engaged \n     in a series of violations of various orders.\n       Former Chapter 11 trustee Thomas G. Marks was sentenced \n     March 15 in the District of Oregon to twelve months plus one \n     day in prison, three years probation, and payment of \n     restitution, for embezzling funds in three Chapter 11 \n     bankruptcy cases where he acted as a fiduciary after the case \n     was confirmed. The United States Trustee discovered the \n     embezzlement of approximately $108,000 based on an inquiry \n     from Marks' former business partner. The United States \n     Trustee obtained Marks' resignation as fiduciary in the \n     cases, and arranged the appointment of successor fiduciaries \n     to pursue bond claims relating to the losses.\n\n\n                              pennsylvania\n\n       On Nov. 15 the District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Pennsylvania sentenced Philadelphia attorney Steven Bernosky, \n     and barred him from practicing law for three years, for \n     embezzling approximately $14,000 from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy \n     estate. Bernosky served as debtor's counsel in the Chapter 11 \n     bankruptcy case of Morris Schiff Co. The debtor company's \n     property was sold for approximately $14,150, and Bernosky \n     improperly deposited a check for the sale proceeds into his \n     personal account. Bernosky made partial restitution of \n     $11,000 before sentencing and produced a check for the \n     balance at the sentencing hearing. He was sentenced to five \n     years probation and ordered to pay a $2,500 fine.

Wiles had assumed the identity of a\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\n     deceased person and fraudulently obtained credit in the \n     decedent's name for 2\\1/2\\ years, before filing for \n     bankruptcy twice in the decedent's name. He pleaded guilty to \n     13 counts including false statement in bankruptcy, bankruptcy \n     fraud, false statements to obtain a HUD-insured mortgage, \n     false statements in loan and credit applications, credit card \n     fraud, wire fraud, interstate transportation of stolen goods, \n     and use of an unassigned Social Security number.\n\n\n                             south carolina\n\n       Auctioneer J. Max McCaskill pleaded guilty Nov. 2 in the \n     District of South Carolina to two counts of embezzlement from \n     bankruptcy estates. McCaskill was a former Bankruptcy Court \n     deputy clerk and a former employee of a bankruptcy trustee in \n     South Carolina. While employed to auction bankruptcy estate \n     property, he sold the property but failed to turn over the \n     proceeds to the bankruptcy trustee.\n\n\n                                 texas\n\n       Tronnald Dunnaway of Richardson, Texas, was sentenced Oct. \n     3 to 13 months in jail and three years supervised release and \n     ordered to pay $23,959 in restitution for his role in a \n     bankruptcy foreclosure scam. Dunnaway pleaded guilty in June \n     on the eve of trial; on June 22, his co-defendant Shelby \n     Daniels was found guilty of 14 counts of bankruptcy fraud in \n     connection with the scam. Daniels and Dunnaway contacted \n     homeowners facing foreclosure, offering to help them with \n     their mortgage problems. They persuaded the homeowners to \n     transfer a part interest in their homes to companies \n     controlled by, or individuals working with, the scam \n     operators. Those companies and individuals then filed for \n     bankruptcy to delay foreclosure on the properties, but \n     the victims ended up losing their homes.\n       On June 22, after a five-day jury trial, Shelby Daniels of \n     Dallas was found guilty of 14 counts of bankruptcy fraud for \n     his role in a bankruptcy foreclosure scam. Daniels \n     represented himself as a real estate consultant and contacted \n     homeowners facing foreclosure, persuading them to transfer a \n     part interest in their homes to companies he controlled or \n     individuals working with him. The companies and individuals \n     filed for bankruptcy to delay foreclosure. Homeowners paid \n     Daniels a $500 ``set up'' fee plus $500 per month, assuming \n     he was working to address their mortgage problems. They ended \n     up losing their homes. On the eve of trial, Tronnald \n     Dunnaway, who was indicted with Daniels, pleaded guilty to \n     one count of bankruptcy fraud.\n\n\n                                Virginia\n\n       Lee W. Smith Sr., the principal in the Chapter 11 case of \n     Lee's Contracting Services Inc., was sentenced Nov. 10 to 21 \n     months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of \n     bankruptcy fraud and one count of tax evasion. Smith diverted \n     monies from the corporation to personal accounts during the \n     pendency of the Chapter 11 case, which was ultimately \n     dismissed because the debtor owed more than $1 million in \n     unpaid employee withholding taxes.\n       The District Court for the Southern District of West \n     Virginia August 4 sentenced Donald S. Pritt to 30 months \n     imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and \n     restitution of $193,990 following his conviction on one count \n     of mail fraud and two counts of bankruptcy fraud. Pritt \n     claimed to be permanently disabled following an all-terrain \n     vehicle accident. He filed disability insurance claims under \n     several recently issued policies and engaged in litigation \n     with the insurance companies and ATV manufacturer. Pritt was \n     ordered to pay in excess of $600,000 in attorney fees to the \n     manufacturer. The bankruptcy counts arose from his transfer \n     and concealment of assets, which began after the state court \n     litigation and continued during the bankruptcy case.\n       Ethel Mae Martin was sentenced June 15 in the Eastern \n     District of Virginia to 27 months in prison and 3 years of \n     supervised release for one count of bankruptcy fraud. Martin \n     used at least three Social Security numbers to obtain credit \n     and filed her bankruptcy petition using a fourth SSN.\n       Elizabeth Baker pleaded guilty June 8 to one count of \n     making a false oath in connection with her bankruptcy. Baker \n     and her husband filed a Chapter 13 petition in 1995; when her \n     husband later died, Baker received over $99,000 in life \n     insurance proceeds. She converted the bankruptcy case to a \n     Chapter 7 liquidation but did not disclose the receipt of \n     funds to the bankruptcy trustee. Baker's bankruptcy discharge \n     was revoked after the trustee discovered the receipt of funds \n     as well as Baker's false testimony that there were no assets \n     other than those listed in the bankruptcy schedules.\n\n\n                               Wisconsin\n\n       The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit July 20 upheld \n     the March 1998 conviction of attorney John Gellene for false \n     material declarations in a bankruptcy proceeding, and upheld \n     the trial court's sentencing determinations. Gellene did not \n     disclose that his law firm represented a senior secured \n     creditor as well as the Chapter 11 debtor, giving rise to a \n     conflict of interest in representation. He was convicted \n     after a jury trial in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, \n     sentenced to 15 months in prison, and fined $15,000. In its \n     ruling, the Appeals Court rejected Gellene's argument that \n     his false statements were not material, finding it beyond \n     doubt that ``a misstatement in a Rule 2014 statement by an \n     attorney about other affiliations'' is material.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5389-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5389-S5410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, before I get into the \nsubstance of the amendment, I hope it may be possible we can reduce the \ntime on this debate. I know there are other matters to be considered. \nWe have 2 hours, but this may not take that much time. It is not a \nterribly complicated proposal. I think a lot of our colleagues may \nalready be aware of the substance of it.\n  Let me begin these brief remarks by, first of all, expressing my \ndisappointment, in a sense, that I have to offer an amendment that my \ngood friend from Florida strongly disagrees with, Senator Connie Mack. \nHe is in his last few months in this body. He is one of my best friends \nin the Senate. It may be hard for some people who do not follow this \ninstitution carefully to understand that two people of different \npolitical persuasions, from different parts of the country, can be good \nfriends, but we are.\n  As I feel strongly about this amendment, he feels strongly about it. \nI would prefer that he were my ally. He will not be. I presume he might \nwish I were his ally. So it will be somewhat of a disappointment for me \nto be offering something about which my good friend so strongly \ndisagrees, as he prepares to leave this body and to which he has made \nsuch a significant contribution during his tenure.\n  I will miss him very much in the coming years. I do not offer this \namendment with any great pleasure. I do think it is the right \namendment. I want him to know that I do not do so with any sense of \npersonal animus in the slightest as I offer it. There are others who \ndisagree as well.\n  Last Friday, I spoke at some length about why I believe the amendment \nthat was originally proposed by another good friend, the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, and I, which we offered \nsome time ago to establish a bipartisan commission to review United \nStates policy towards Cuba, why we believe it is in our national \ninterest.\n  The amendment I have just offered, as the Warner amendment, would \nprovide for the appointment of a bipartisan commission to review U.S. \npolicy with respect to Cuba and to make recommendations on how to bring \nthat policy into the 21st century.\n  I regret that because Senator Warner is the manager of the underlying \nbill he has had to withdraw his support for this amendment. While \ncertainly Senator Warner is fully capable of speaking for himself, I \nbelieve Senator Warner still thinks that the proposal I am making today \nis a good idea, even if he must disagree with the vehicle to which it \nis sought to be attached.\n  Very briefly, the commission would be composed of 12 members, chosen \nby the following: six by the President of the United States, six by the \nCongress; equally divided between the legislative and executive \nbranches. There would be four members chosen by the House and Senate \nRepublicans leaders and two by the Democratic leaders.\n  Senator Warner and I had originally crafted this legislation to \nensure that the commission would have a balanced and diverse \nmembership, not bipartisan in the sense of two parties because this \nissue ought not be divided by party. In fact, it is not divided by \nparty. There are people who sit on this side of the aisle in the Senate \nwho will disagree with this amendment. There are Members on the other \nside who will agree with this amendment. This country is not divided \nalong strictly partisan lines--Democrats and Republicans--as it reviews \nCuban policy. But what we are seeking with the commission is to have a \ndiversity of opinion, not a diversity of party necessarily, although \nthat may occur anyway.\n\n  So the idea was to have members who would be selected from various \nfields of expertise--including human rights, religious, public health, \nmilitary, business, agriculture, the Cuban American community, and also \nthe agricultural community where there is such strong interest. \nCreating that kind of diversity is what we seek in a commission. It \nwould make recommendations to us which we may or may not follow. They \nare recommendations.\n  Other commissions in the past have been appointed that have made \nrecommendations which Congress has sought to follow and in other cases \nCongress has totally ignored. So a commission is really an opportunity \nto see if we can get this out of the partisan politics which have \ndominated this debate for far too long and to make some solid long-term \nrecommendations on how we might begin to prepare for an intelligent, \nsoft landing, to use the words of Zbigniew Brzezinski some years ago \nwhen he provided the necessity of us beginning to think to arrange for \na relationship with the island of Cuba in a post-Castro period.\n  The commissioners would have 225 days from the date of enactment to \nundertake their review and report their findings. The original Warner \namendment provided for 180 days.\n  Some have said: Why do this now? We are only a few months away from a \nnew administration. Why not let a new administration take on this \nresponsibility?\n  I argue that, in fact, this is exactly the right time to be doing it, \nwith an administration that is leaving, in a sense, to be able to \nprovide for a new administration some ideas and thoughts on how we \nmight proceed.\n  So whether it is a Bush administration or a Gore administration that \nis sworn into office on January 20 of the coming year, this commission \nwould report back in the late spring of next\n\n[[Page S5391]]\n\nyear, and the new administration could have the benefit of some solid \nthinking rather than waiting for a new administration with all of the \nproblems associated with that in terms of how they begin their efforts.\n  The idea of establishing a commission is not a new idea. It is not \neven originally my idea. The establishment of a commission was first \nproposed by our colleague from Virginia almost 2 years ago in a letter \nto President Clinton.\n  Who supported the idea of the Warner commission at that time? Senator \nWarner was encouraged to propose such an idea in 1998 by a very \ndistinguished group of foreign policy experts. Let me list some of the \nindividuals who urged that such a commission be created: former \nSecretaries of State Lawrence Eagleburger, George Shultz, and Henry \nKissinger; former Majority Leader Howard Baker; former Defense \nSecretary Frank Carlucci; former Secretaries of Agriculture John Block \nand Clayton Yeutter; former Ambassadors Timothy Towell and J. William \nMiddendorf; former Under Secretary of State William Rogers; former \nAssistant Secretary of State for Latin America and Distinguished Career \nAmbassador Harry Shalaudeman; and another distinguished former \ncolleagues of ours, Malcolm Wallop.\n  The United States Catholic Conference has also gone on record in \nsupport of the establishment of such a committee.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent that the letters that accompanied \nthese recommendations be printed in the Record. One of the letters is \ndated September 30, 1998, signed by Howard Baker, Frank Carlucci, Henry \nKissinger, Bill Rogers, Harry Shalaudeman, and Malcolm Wallop, who \ncalled for this commission 2 years ago.

John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: As Americans who have been engaged in \n     the conduct of foreign relations in various positions over \n     the past three decades, we believe that it is timely to \n     conduct a review of United States policy toward Cuba. We \n     therefore encourage you and your colleagues to support the \n     establishment of a National Bipartisan Commission on Cuba.\n       I am privileged to be joined in this request by: Howard H. \n     Baker, Jr., Former Majority Leader, U.S. Senate; Frank \n     Carlucci, Former Secretary of Defense; Henry A. Kissinger, \n     Former Secretary of State; William D. Rogers, Former Under \n     Secretary of State; Harry W. Shalaudeman, Former Assistant \n     Secretary of State; and Malcolm Wallop, Former Member, U.S. \n     Senate.\n       We recommend that the President consider the precedent and \n     the procedures of the National Bipartisan Commission on \n     Central America chaired by former Secretary of State Henry A. \n     Kissinger, which President Reagan established in 1983. As you \n     know, the Kissinger Commission helped significantly to \n     clarify the difficult issues inherent in U.S. Policy in \n     Central America and to forge a new consensus on many of them.\n       We believe that such a Commission would serve the national \n     interest in this instance as well. It could provide the \n     Administration, the Congress, and the American people with \n     objective analysis and useful policy recommendations for \n     dealing with the complexities of our relationship with Cuba, \n     and in doing so advance the cause of freedom and democracy in \n     the Hemisphere.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence S. Eagleburger.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 13, 1998.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We, the undersigned, recommend that you \n     authorize the establishment of a National Bipartisan \n     Commission to review our current U.S.-Cuba policy. This \n     Commission would follow the precedent and work program of the \n     National Bipartisan Commission on Central America, (the \n     ``Kissinger Commission''), established by President Reagan in \n     1983, which made such a positive contribution to our foreign \n     policy on that most difficult and controversial issue over 15 \n     years ago.\n       We recommend this action because there has not been a \n     comprehensive review of U.S.-Cuba policy, or a measurement of \n     its effectiveness in achieving its stated goals, in over 38 \n     years since President Eisenhower first canceled the sugar \n     quota on July 6, 1960 and President Kennedy imposed the first \n     total embargo on Cuba on February 7, 1962. Most recently, \n     Congress passed the Cuban Democracy Act in 1992 and the \n     Helms-Burton Act in 1996. Since the passage of both of these \n     bills there have been significant changes in the world \n     situation that warrant a review of our U.S.-Cuba policy \n     including the termination, in 1991, or billions of dollars of \n     annual Soviet economic assistance to Cuba, and the historic \n     visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba in 1998.\n       In addition, during the past 24 months numerous delegations \n     from the United States have visited Cuba, including current \n     and former Members of Congress, representatives from the \n     American Association of World Health, and former U.S. \n     military leaders. These authoritative groups have analyzed \n     the conditions and capabilities on the island and have \n     presented their findings in the areas of health, the economy, \n     religious freedom, human rights, and military capacity. Also, \n     in May 1998, the Pentagon completed a study on the security \n     risk of Cuba to the United States.\n       However, the findings and reports of these delegations, \n     including the study by the Pentagon, and the call by Pope \n     John Paul II for the opening of Cuba by the world, have not \n     been broadly accepted by all U.S. policy makers. As Members \n     of the U.S. Senate, we believe it is in the best interest of \n     the United States, our allies, and the Cuban people to review \n     these issues.\n       We therefore recommend that a National Bipartisan \n     Commission be created to conduct a thoughtful, rational, and \n     objective analysis of our current U.S. policy toward Cuba and \n     to make recommendations that will improve this policy's \n     effectiveness to achieve our country's stated foreign policy \n     goals for Cuba.\n       We recommend that the members of this Commission be \n     selected from a bipartisan list of distinguished Americans \n     who are experienced in the field of international relations. \n     These individuals should include representatives from a cross \n     section of U.S. interests including public health, military, \n     religion, human rights, business, and the Cuban American \n     community.\n       The Commission's tasks should include the delineation of \n     the policy's specific achievements and the evaluation of 1) \n     the national security risk of Cuba to the United States and \n     the role of the Cuban government in international terrorism \n     and illegal drugs, 2) the indemnification of losses incurred \n     by U.S. certified claimants with confiscated property in \n     Cuba, and 3) the domestic and international impacts of the 36 \n     year old U.S.-Cuba economic, trade and travel embargo on: a) \n     U.S. international relations with our foreign allies; b) the \n     political strength of Cuba's leader; c) the condition of \n     human rights, religious freedom, freedom of the press in \n     Cuba; d) the health and welfare of the Cuban people; e) the \n     Cuban economy; f) the U.S. economy, business, and jobs.\n       More and more Americans from all sectors of our nation are \n     becoming concerned about the far-reaching effects of our \n     present U.S.-Cuba policy on United States interests and the \n     Cuban people. Your establishment of this National Bipartisan \n     Commission would demonstrate your leadership and \n     responsiveness to the American people.\n       We strongly urge you to take immediate action on this \n     proposed initiative and we thank you in advance for your \n     thoughtful consideration.\n       Sincerely,\n         Senators Warner, Grams, Hagel, Jeffords, Enzi, Chafee, \n           Gordon Smith, Thomas, Kerrey, Bumpers, Santorum, Dodd, \n           Kempthorne, Roberts, Bond, Lugar, Leahy, Moynihan, \n           Specter, Reed, Cochran, Murray, Domenici, Boxer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 13, 1998.\n     Hon William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We, the undersigned, recommend that you \n     authorize the establishment of a National Bipartisan \n     Commission to review our current U.S.-Cuba policy.

William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As Former Secretary of State in the \n     Reagan Administration I was proud to be a part of the \n     successful effort that brought about the downfall of \n     communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.\n       Today we have another opportunity to expand democracy in \n     the world and to rid our hemisphere of the last bastion of \n     communism. To do this the United States needs to review and \n     analyze its current foreign policy toward Cuba. This analysis \n     can most effectively be conducted by the National bipartisan \n     Commission proposed by my colleagues and by Senator Warner in \n     his letter to you of October 13, 1998.\n       This Commission, like the National Bipartisan Commission on \n     Central America authorized by President Reagan in 1983, would \n     conduct an objective analysis of our current foreign policy \n     and would provide your Administration and the Congress, \n     critically important insights needed to improve the policy's \n     effectiveness in achieving its stated foreign policy goals. \n     The formation of this Commission is in the best interest of \n     the United States and its conclusions and recommendations \n     will provide the greatest opportunity for our country to \n     determine the most effective ways to assist the Cuban people \n     in their struggle to achieve increased freedom and self-\n     determination and to prepare them for the transition to \n     democracy.\n       I therefore join with my colleagues, who have devoted most \n     of their professional careers to fighting communism, and \n     strongly support and endorse Senator Warner's request to you \n     to authorize the establishment of a National Bipartisan \n     Commission to review U.S.-Cuban policy.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     George P.

John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner, I write to commend you, and the other \n     Senators who have\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\n     joined with you, in urging the President to authorize the \n     establishment of a Bipartisan Commission on U.S.-Cuban \n     relations. In recent years, voices of respected and \n     influential leaders in many different fields have been raised \n     to express dissatisfaction with aspects of our present policy \n     toward Cuba. The Catholic Bishops of this country, through \n     our national body, the United States Catholic Conference, \n     have long shared this view that our policy has the need, in \n     the words of the Holy Father last January, ``to change, to \n     change.''\n       We are sympathetic with the sense of frustration that many \n     in our government experience as they search for some signs \n     from Cuba that its government is prepared seriously to engage \n     the United States and to address its valid concerns about \n     basic freedoms and respect for human rights. But as they \n     search in vain for such signs, untold numbers of our Cuban \n     brothers and sisters continue to suffer intolerable \n     deprivation and hardships, both spiritual and material. As a \n     society, we must find ways to change the present unacceptable \n     Status quo and move confidently toward a new policy.\n       The Creation of a National Bipartisan Commission would well \n     prove the needed catalyst for moving us toward that goal. I \n     thank you and your colleagues for this initiative and pray \n     that it prosper.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Most Reverend Theodore E. McCarrick,\n       Archbishop of Newark, Chairman, Committee on International \n     Policy, United States Catholic Conference.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Hogan & Hartson, L.L.P.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1998.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President, The White House, Washington, DC.\n\n     Re: the Proposed National Bipartisan Commission on Cuba.\n\n       Dear President Clinton: As an American who has served in \n     cabinet and subcabinet positions of four U.S. presidents, I \n     have seen firsthand the influence of U.S. foreign policy \n     throughout the world, its effects on the governments and \n     citizens of foreign countries, and its reciprocal effects on \n     the U.S. economy, businesses and jobs. I have also seen the \n     use of unilateral sanctions grow into becoming a long-\n     standing tool of U.S. foreign policy to be employed against \n     foreign governments and their leaders whose behavior the U.S. \n     Government finds unacceptable.\n       Cuba is one of those countries where U.S. sanctions have \n     been employed, in their case for nearly 40 years, including a \n     total economic embargo which has been unilateral for over 36 \n     years. The stated purpose of these sanctions and the embargo \n     is to bring down the communist government bring freedom and \n     self-determination to the Cuban people, and to prepare them \n     for a transition to democracy. Now nearly four decades later, \n     the communist government is still in place, the Cuban people \n     have very few freedoms, and the country is now recovering \n     from the departure, in 1991, of the Soviet Union and its five \n     billion dollars of annual aid and assistance.\n       I therefore welcome Senator Warner's request to your \n     Administration to establish a National Bipartisan Commission \n     to review U.S.-Cuba policy, and I respectfully join former \n     Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and his distinguished \n     colleagues in support of Senator Warner and his Senate \n     colleagues' request.\n       The establishment of this Commission will conduct a long \n     overdue objective analysis of our current Cuba policy and we \n     can look forward to the Commission producing recommendations \n     that will improve the overall effectiveness of our U.S.-Cuba \n     policy so we might more effectively achieve our country's \n     stated goals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Clayton Yeutter.\n\n  That suggested the course of this commission be established as a way \nto try to sort out how best to establish a better relationship with the \n11 million people who live 90 miles off our shore.\n  Further, highly respected human rights advocates who remain in Cuba--\nthose dissidents who remain in Cuba and subject themselves every day to \nthe difficulties of living under a dictatorship--seeking to promote \npolitical change have called upon the United States to rethink our \npolicy when it comes to Cuba. Elizardo Sanchez, President of the Cuban \nCommission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation, sent a letter \nin April of this year urging the United States to change its policies. \nHe wrote:\n\n       It is unfortunate that the government of Cuba still clings \n     to an outdated and inefficient model that I believe is the \n     fundamental cause of the great difficulties that the Cuban \n     people suffer, but it is obvious that the current Cold War \n     climate between our two governments and unilateral sanctions \n     will continue to fuel the fire of totalitarianism in my \n     country.\n\n  That is from a letter from dissidents inside Cuba talking about how \nto create change there.\n  There is a double standard when it comes to Cuba. A number of other \ncountries are far more of a threat to U.S. national security and \nantithetical to U.S. foreign policy interests. Yet our sanctions \nagainst Cuba are among the harshest. We have concerns about nuclear \nproliferation with respect to India, Pakistan, Iran, China, and North \nKorea. Yet Americans may travel freely to each and every one of those \nnations. In fact, Americans are free to travel to many countries that I \nwould not consider to be bastions of democracy: Iran, Sudan, Burma, the \nformer Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Cambodia, to mention a few.\n  We have just entered a new millennium and the United States has moved \nin most areas to bring U.S. policy into line with the new realities of \nthe 21st century. On the Korean peninsula, North Korean and South \nKorean leaders met last week in a historic summit which will hopefully \npave the way to reconciliation and reunification for two countries that \nfought a bloody and costly war in the last century. To encourage that \neffort, the Clinton administration announced it was prepared to lift \nsanctions against one of our oldest adversaries.\n  With respect to China, the United States has a number of deeply \nserious disagreements with that Government, including workers' rights, \nrespect for human rights, nuclear proliferation and economic policies, \nhostility towards Taiwan--the list goes on. Yet the United States has \nfull diplomatic relationships with Beijing. Moreover, I predict the \nSenate will soon follow the House and support permanent normal trade \nrelations with China, thereby clearing the way for its entry into the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  Let us talk about Vietnam. The Vietnam conflict left an indelible \nmark on the American psyche. Just a few blocks from here, the names of \n53,000 Americans who lost their lives in that country are listed on a \nwall. Yet today a Vietnam veteran and former Congressman, Pete \nPeterson, represents U.S. interests in Vietnam as U.S. Ambassador. \nAmerican citizens are free to travel and do business there. We have \nlearned to somehow change and move forward. Do we agree with the \npolicies of Vietnam? No. Do we agree with what is going on in China? \nNo. Do we agree with what is going on in North Korea? No, obviously \nnot. But we are seeking in the 21st century to try to move \nthese nations in the right direction. We don't do it by isolation. We \ndon't do it by creating a Berlin Wall off the coast of Florida between \nour two countries. We do it by contact, by communication, by engaging. \nThose are the ways we create change. We have seen that in place after \nplace all over the globe.\n\n  Around the world, old adversaries are attempting to reconcile their \ndifferences: in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, and the Korean \npeninsula. The United States has actively been promoting such efforts \nbecause we think it is in our national interest to do so.\n  I ask a simple question: Isn't it time that we at least took an \nhonest and dispassionate look at our relations with a country in our \nown hemisphere, 90 miles off our shores, where 11 million good people, \nnot Communists but good people, are living under extremely difficult \ncircumstances? Isn't it in our interest and the interest of the 11 \nmillion people there to try and see if we can't begin some new way to \nbring about change in that country other than following the 40 years of \nisolation that is still the centerpiece of the U.S.-Cuban relationship?\n  Opponents of this measure point to the fact that Cuba remains on the \nterrorist list. Why? Because, according to a 1999 State Department \nreport on global terrorism, Cuba ``continued to provide a safe haven to \nseveral terrorists and U.S. fugitives . . . and it maintained ties to \nother state sponsors of terrorism and Latin American insurgents.''\n  Castro's biggest crime last year, according to this report, appears \nto be that he hosted a series of meetings between the Colombian \nGovernment officials and the ELN, a Colombian guerrilla organization. \nRather curious in light of the fact that the United States publicly \nsupports President Pastrana's efforts to undertake a political dialog \nwith the guerrilla organizations in that country as a means of ending \nthe civil conflict in Colombia.\n  The same report found that Islamic extremists from around the world \ncontinued to use Afghanistan as a training\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\nground and base of operation for their worldwide terrorist activities. \nUsama Bin Ladin, the Saudi terrorist indicted for the 1998 bombing of \ntwo U.S. Embassies in Africa, continues to be given sanctuary by that \ncountry. Yet Afghanistan is not on the terrorist list. There are no \nprohibitions on the sale of food or medicine to that country. Americans \ncan travel freely to that country.\n  Last week, the Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing to review \nthe findings of the National Commission on Terrorism. During the course \nof that hearing, Paul Bremer, the chairman of the commission, admitted \nthat Cuba's behavior with respect to terrorist matters had improved \nover the past 4 years. In fact, it is the only country, he said, that \nhas shown any improvement.\n  I ask the question again: Isn't it time we start to measure our Cuban \npolicy against the same yardstick that we measure our relations with \nthe rest of the nations of the world? Isn't it time we follow a policy \nthat is truly in our national interest, one that promotes positive \nrelations with the 11 million people who live on the island of Cuba, \nand one that promotes a peaceful change in self-determination for a \nproud people who have been done a huge disservice and injustice by the \nCastro regime?\n  Many of my colleagues have told me privately that they believe \nSenator Warner and I are on the right course. I appreciate those kind \nwords. I also hope the time has finally come for them to stand up and \nbe counted on this issue.\n\n  This is an important question. This is not a radical idea. It is not \na revolutionary idea. We form commissions all the time in order to get \nsome distance between the politics of an issue and the dispassionate \nview of people who can bring knowledge and ideas and experience. I \ndon't think that Henry Kissinger or George Shultz or Frank Carlucci or \nHoward Baker are Castro supporters--hardly. But they do understand that \nit is in the interest of the United States for us to try and move \nbeyond the present wall that distances us from these people as we seek \na change in our policy.\n  That is all this commission is proposing to do. It doesn't say that \nanyone has to agree with the recommendations or vote for them. It \ndoesn't bind the Senate. It merely says, as we begin a new \nadministration, why not have the benefit of the solid thinking of \npeople who dedicate their lives to addressing foreign policy issues? \nWhy should we be allowed to travel to Libya, to open up relations with \nIran, to have relationships with Vietnam? Maybe some don't think we \nought to do any of those. That I would understand. But for people here \nto tell me it is OK to have normal relationships with China and Vietnam \nand to promote lifting sanctions in North Korea and talk about moving \nto have a relationship with Iran, and then simultaneously tell me we \ncan't even form a commission to analyze whether or not we could do a \nbetter job resolving the differences between our two peoples, does not \nmake a great deal of sense to me.\n  I will put up, for the benefit of our colleagues, this little chart. \nI know people use charts all the time. This is the last couple of \nweeks. They are photographs that have appeared in national newspapers. \nThe picture at the top is the two leaders of North and South Korea, \nmeeting just a week or so ago to resolve differences. The next picture \nis our own Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, meeting with Yasser \nArafat. If you met with him 10 years ago or you even talked to the guy, \nyou were in political jeopardy. Now we welcome him and embrace him at \nthe White House as we try to resolve differences in the Middle East.\n  The picture on the further side is the Prime Minister of Great \nBritain and the Prime Minister of Ireland signing the accords that may \nbring about the end of years of hostility in Northern Ireland. The \nbottom is the President and the leader of the People's Republic of \nChina. These are examples of what can happen with creative engagement. \nIf there was a policy in South Korea that said we could never talk to \nanybody in North Korea, that photograph would not appear. What if we \nsaid, despite any of the efforts to bring about peace in the Middle \nEast, no one could meet or talk about meeting with the Palestinians or \nNorthern Ireland or in China? All I am asking is, why don't we try \nsomething a little different when it comes to the island of Cuba, and \nsee if we can't create the kind of change that is reflected in these \nphotographs of the 21st century. That is what this amendment is \ndesigned to do. It is a bipartisan effort.\n\n  Again, the list of our colleagues I have recited demonstrates that \npeople on both sides of the aisle care about this very much and made \nrecommendations some years ago that we move in this direction. Again, \ndistinguished former administration officials--Republican as well as \nDemocratic administrations--indicate the sound thinking, in my view, \nacross the board when it comes to the establishment of such a \ncommission.\n  Again, I know you are going to hear a lot about how bad the Castro \ngovernment is, and I am not going to disagree. They are. I am not here \nto stand up and tell you I think that is a good government. It is not. \nI would not last 5 minutes there. It is repressive, a dictatorship, and \nthe things they do to their own people are outrageous. But we have \nfound a way to break new ground, to at least reach out. That is all I \nam asking for today--a commission to try to reach out with some new \nideas with one nation in our hemisphere, which is a shorter distance \nfrom our shores than it is from here to Hagerstown, MD. Let's see if we \ncan improve the relationship.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield such time as he \nmay consume to the Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I begin by saying to my friend, Senator \nDodd, how much I appreciate his comments at the beginning of his speech \nto the Senate. I appreciate the relationship we have developed. \nCertainly, one of the things I will truly miss as I leave the Senate at \nthe end of this year is the relationships that have been developed and \nthe opportunity to expand on those relationships with others. Again, it \nhas been a delight. However, we do have very strong differences of \nopinion on this issue.\n  I will begin by pointing at the chart that has been put up next to \nSenator Dodd. There is one very fundamental difference. Each of those \nleaders reached out; they wanted to bring about change. We have seen \nabsolutely, positively none of that from Fidel Castro. There is no \nindication--not an iota of evidence--that Fidel Castro wants to change.\n  Later today, we will be voting on this amendment to the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill, which is designed to establish a \ncommission to review and report on the United States policy toward \nCuba.\n  I have spoken with many colleagues recently about this amendment and \nthe idea of forming a commission. I understand from some Senators that \nthey have concerns that they want a chance to discuss regarding Cuba. \nBut the goal of those Senators seems to be either broad sanctions \nreform or the enactment of specific changes in our policies toward \nCuba. But today we are debating an amendment on forming a \ncommission. This commission is blatantly political, in my opinion, so \nmuch so that no serious effort can come from a commission designed to \nbe so skewed. This commission accomplishes nobody's goal.\n\n  Let me make three points: First, we don't need a national commission \nto study only Cuba sanctions; second, we should not tie the hands of \nthe next President to set his own Cuba policy; and, third, we should \nnot set policy through a partisan commission outside of the normal \nconduct of foreign policy by the executive branch.\n  The legislation on which you are being asked to vote establishes a \n12-person panel to review and report on various aspects of Cuba policy. \nBut this is why we have a Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, an \nInternational Relations Committee in the House, and a U.S. Department \nof State. Why are we making Government bigger and more expensive than \nit needs to be? Especially, as my friend from Connecticut has argued, \nthis amendment does not take a position or implement a policy.\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\n  Let me highlight a few of the details. This commission is appointed \nas follows--and, again, I note that my friend indicated this is not a \npartisan issue, but we who have been around here for a long time all \nknow these issues end up being influenced by politics.\n  What we are going to have is a commission of 12 people, 6 appointed \nby the current President. The current President will put six members on \na commission to tell the next President what his policy toward Cuba \nshould be. And there will be three from each House--two majority, one \nminority. That means two-thirds of the commission would be appointed by \nDemocrats; that is, 8 of the 12 members of the commission would be \nappointed by Democrats. One-third, that is, four members of the \ncommission, would be Republicans. That is not the way to set foreign \npolicy.\n  Our current policy, set by the State Department and the President, \nhas been endorsed by the Congress over the years with significant \nlegislation. The only reason for this special commission is to try to \nchange current policy through abnormal means.\n  Let me talk for a moment about American foreign policy in general. I \nhear the rhetoric often that, after 39 years, clearly, our Cuba policy \nhas not brought democracy to Cuba and therefore it must be abandoned as \na failure. Think about that argument for a moment. What if Ronald \nReagan had come into office and declared in 1980: After 40 years, since \nthere is no democracy in the Soviet Union, our Soviet policy must be \nabandoned?\n  Reagan did the opposite. He had the courage to call the Soviet Union \nwhat it was, an ``evil empire.'' His courage and commitment brought \ndemocratic reform to Russia. America's foreign policy must reflect \nAmerica's commitment to the principles we believe in: freedom, \ndemocracy, justice, and respect for human dignity.\n  My friend from Connecticut has stated that the policy is aimed at one \nman, Fidel Castro, but it denies basic necessities to the entire 11 \nmillion people of Cuba. The reality is that Cuba can purchase goods \nfrom the entire world. By closing the American market to Cuba, we are \ndenying the people nothing. Fidel Castro keeps Cuba poor, not the \nUnited States embargo.\n  By maintaining the current policy, however, of isolating Fidel \nCastro, we are doing as a Nation what we have done for so many \ngenerations: We are standing shoulder to shoulder with people \nstruggling for freedom. We are standing for truth and dignity and \nsupporting heroes when we oppose Fidel Castro and deny him the means to \nbuild up his resources.\n\n  Since trade has been an important issue of discussion lately given \nthe pending vote on trade with China, perhaps some more detail would be \nhelpful on the differences between China and Cuba.\n  Simply stated, China began policy changes and economic reforms as \nearly as 1978. Today, they continue to open their economy, seek \nengagement in the community of nations, and look for investment and \ntrade.\n  Let me tell you about Cuba. I will provide details from a study \nconducted by the University of Miami: Cuba does not permit trade \nindependent from the state; most of Cuba's exportable products to the \nUnited States are produced by Cuban state-run enterprises with workers \nbeing paid near slave wages; many of these products would compete \nunfairly with United States agriculture and manufactured products, or \nwith other products imported from the democratic countries of the \nCaribbean into the United States; Cuba does not permit individual \nfreedom in economic matters; investments in Cuba are directed and \napproved by the Government of Cuba; it is illegal for foreign investors \nto hire or fire Cuban workers directly and the Cuban Ministry of Labor \ndoes the hiring; foreign companies must pay the wages owed to their \nemployees directly to the Cuban Government in hard currency; the Cuban \nGovernment then pays the workers in Cuban pesos, worth one-twentieth of \na dollar, and the Government pockets 90 percent of the wages paid in by \nthe investor; Cuba has no independent judicial system to settle \ncommercial disputes.\n  In short, Fidel Castro has failed to make any of the changes made by \nBeijing. An investment in China today can empower a Chinese middle \nclass and move power away from the center. An investment in Cuba today \nbenefits Fidel Castro and disadvantages the 11 million people \nstruggling for freedom. It is that simple.\n  As recently as 1997, Fidel Castro argued against the wisdom of \neconomic reforms and reasserted the supremacy of Communist ideology. In \naddition, political parties remain outlawed. Dissidents are either \nexiled, banished to the far reaches of the island, or simply \nimprisoned. The church continues to complain that the promises made \nduring the Pope's visit have not been complied with. The daily \nactivities of the average Cuban citizen continue to be monitored by the \nstate's notorious ``neighborhood watch committees,'' known as the \nCommittee for the Defense of the Revolution. These have been in place \nfor 40 years and continue in place today. Amnesty International counts \nat least 400 prisoners of conscience, but this does not include the \nthousands convicted under trumped up charges for political purposes.\n  I am not simply arguing ideology here today. We have empirical \nevidence of the failure of the policy recommendation to trade with \nCuba; we need only to look at Canada's recent experiences. After \narguing for a policy of opening trade with Cuba, our neighbors to the \nNorth are now pulling out. I will quote from The Globe and Mail of June \n30, 1999:\n\n       The Canadian government had hoped that investing directly \n     in the Cuban economy by building plants and infrastructure \n     would not only deliver an economic return, but also lead to \n     wider-ranging reforms. Those hopes have been largely dashed \n     as Canadian companies report woeful tales of pouring good \n     money into bad investments in Cuba.\n\n  Mr. President, policies of so-called engagement with Castro have \nfailed for those who have tried. We all shared great hope when the Pope \nvisited Cuba in January 1998. The United States promised to respond \npositively to any changes made by the Castro regime following the \nPope's visit. We expected to see more space for the Cuban people: \nfreedom of speech and more freedom of religious expression. We know now \nthat even these hopes have been dashed. The Pope just last December \nexpressed his disappointment in the changes in Cuba. A December 2, 1999 \nReuters wire story reports,\n\n       The clear wording of the Pope's speech indicated that the \n     Vatican felt that not much has changed on the predominantly \n     Catholic island in two years.\n\n  We know that President Reagan's wisdom remains true--after 39 years \nof isolating Cuba, we must not fear calling things as we see them. \nFidel Castro is an evil tyrant. He impoverishes the Cuban people in \nspite of the efforts of many to open the society to freedom and the \neconomy to investment. Fidel Castro denies his people the basic \nnecessities for life, liberty, and happiness.\n  Mr. President, I do not object to evaluating our policies, but we \nmust be honest, this is not the way. When Cuba changes, the United \nStates must also change. Until then, we must remain committed to our \nprinciples, because it is our principles which make us strong. No \nmissile system, no fleet of warships, will keep the United States the \nshining city on the hill--the beacon of freedom which we all saw when \nRonald Reagan was President. I hope that my colleagues will join me. \nAnd I hope that they will stand with me for freedom. stand with me for \ndemocracy, stand with me for justice, and stand with me for respect for \nthe human dignity of the 11 million people in Cuba.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague \nfrom Florida for his leadership. He has been stalwart over the years he \nhas been a Senator from the State of Florida, as well as a Congressman, \nin his efforts to bring the end to the Castro regime. I applaud his \nleadership on that issue. We will miss him when he leaves the Senate.\n  This amendment establishes a commission on U.S. Cuban policy. The \nproblem is it is totally irrelevant to the underlying legislation. It \nis an important issue, no question. But this deals with a controversial \nforeign policy matter, not a defense matter. It doesn't belong on the \nDefense authorization bill where we are funding programs that are vital \nto our national security. This is just one more issue that\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\ncomes before the Senate and causes heartburn for all who are trying to \nget a Defense authorization bill passed.\n  I know it is of great frustration to the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Warner, who is a strong and steadfast supporter of the fine men \nand women in our Armed Forces. We have the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee; we have the House International Relations Committee. They \nare composed of Members who have been duly elected, as we were, by the \nAmerican people. It is their responsibility to examine United States \npolicy toward Cuba. I think those committees have done a commendable \njob in overseeing U.S. Cuban policy.\n  This administration has had almost 8 years to reexamine or redirect, \nif they so choose, a policy towards Cuba. Why a commission now, in the \ntwilight hours of the administration, providing 8-4 representation of \nthe President's party to ``reexamine U.S. policy toward Cuba''? As the \nSenator from Florida said, it is political. Why should this \nadministration, with 6 months left, tie the hands of the next \nadministration, whatever that administration is?\n  As the Senator from Connecticut said on the floor last Friday, the \ncommission is supposed to take a new look at Cuba because the Senator \nbelieves current policy is not working. That leaves me to suspect that \nthis commission is stacked and will have a predetermined outcome based \non its flawed composition. We can make that case. I believe its \nobjective is to support lifting the embargo originally supported by \nJohn F. Kennedy but given teeth by passage of the Helms-Burton law, \nsigned by President Clinton. President Clinton wants to open relations \nnow with Castro, appoint six members of the commission and, for the \nminority, two more. It is pretty obvious what the objective is.\n  I don't understand how the Senator from Connecticut could have so \nvigorously supported economic sanctions against South Africa, because \nof apartheid, but believes we should lift sanctions against Communist \nCuba. As a matter of fact, Jeff Jacoby, in an article in the Boston \nGlobe in 1998, said it best when talking about those who support this \nlifting of the embargo:\n\n       When they looked at the Filipino dictatorship, America's \n     foreign policy said, ``Marcos must go.''\n       When they look at Chilean dictatorship, they said, \n     ``Pinochet must go.''\n       When they looked at the Haitian dictatorship, they said, \n     ``Cedros must go.''\n       Of Zaire they say, ``Mobutu must go.'' Of South Africa they \n     said, ``Apartheid must go.'' Of Burma they say, ``SLORC'' \n     (as the dictatorship is called) must go. Of East Timor \n     they say, ``The Indonesian occupiers must go.''\n       But of Cuba, which bleeds under the bitterest and most \n     implacable tyrannies on the planet, they say: The U.S. \n     embargo must go.\n\n  You can't say it much better than that.\n  The Senator from Connecticut believes the embargo has impoverished \nCubans. This is the old ``blame America'' argument. It is Castro who \nimpoverished Cuba, no one else. We know that. Cuba trades with the rest \nof the world and its economy is still a basket case. That is because \nthe Soviet Union is no longer in existence and no longer propping them \nup. The Senator from Connecticut says U.S. policy should not be focused \non one individual. But it is that individual who dictated that trade \nwith Cuba could only be conducted with himself and its ruling elite--no \none else. So it is Castro who is the issue.\n  Cuba, according to the standards of the Department of State, is a \nstate cosponsor of international terrorism. Why should America reward a \ndeclared terrorist nation by reconsidering our appropriate tough stance \ntoward Fidel Castro and its cruel regime? Cuba is a major international \ntrafficker of illegal drugs, drugs which fuel crime in this country, \nspousal and child abuse in this country, and other social ills in \nAmerica which result in the deaths of some 14,000 young people every \nyear.\n  Congressman Ben Gilman, who chairs the International Relations \nCommittee, called for a thorough investigation of Cuba's link to drug \ntrade, noting seizure of 7.5 metric tons of cocaine consigned from \nCuba.\n  I don't understand the logic of this issue, aside from the fact it is \non the wrong legislation.\n  Our Drug Enforcement Administration testified that such a massive \nshipment did not represent the first time Cuba was involved in \ntransiting illegal drugs. Regrettably, despite this enormous seizure, \nthe administration declined to include Cuba as a major drug transit \nnation. Imagine, declining to include 7.5 metric tons of cocaine from \nCuba, and yet we didn't see fit to list them as a major drug transit \nnation.\n  We don't need a taxpayers' subsidized commission to figure out what \nis wrong with Cuba. We have plenty of evidence, and it is Fidel Castro. \nThe State Department lists Cuba in its annual State Department country \nreports on human rights practices, citing the deplorable record of \nabuse by the Castro regime. Amnesty International has condemned Cuba's \nhuman rights violations.\n  Last month, the United Nations Human Rights Commission condemned Cuba \nfor the eighth time for its systematic violation of human rights.\n  Let's not forget something that is very important, which I do not \nthink anyone else will bring up here today but I will. It has been \nstuck in my craw for a long time. That is how Cuba treated American \nPOWs during the Vietnam war. I want to get into a little bit of detail \nbecause these people who did this are still free in Cuba, still have \nthe opportunity to conduct their lives as usual. We have never brought \nthem to justice.\n  From August 1967 until August 1968, a small detachment of Cubans, \nunder the direct leadership of Fidel Castro, brutally tortured a select \ngroup of American POWs at a POW camp on the outskirts of Hanoi known as \nthe Zoo, appropriately named. The goal of this Cuban detachment was \nmost likely to test new domination techniques and involved a \ncombination of brutal physical torture and cruel psychological \npressure.\n  During the first phase of this program, 10 American POWs were \nselected and separated from the remainder of the prison population. The \nPOWs were then unmercifully beaten and tortured in ways I will not even \ndiscuss here on the floor of the Senate they were so bad. Other \nprisoners were often forced to watch what the Cubans did, torturing \ntheir cellmates. Despite their heroic efforts, by Christmas all 10 POWs \nwere broken.\n  Not satisfied with breaking the 10 American POWs, the Cubans began to \nselect a second group of POWs in early 1968 and the torture started \nagain. John Hubbell, in his classic study of the POW experience in \nVietnam, described one of the Cuban's victims:\n\n       The man could barely walk; he shuffled slowly, painfully. \n     His clothes were torn to shreds. He was bleeding everywhere, \n     terribly swollen, and a dirty, yellowish black and purple \n     from head to toe . . . his body was ripped and torn \n     everywhere; hell cuffs appeared almost to have severed the \n     wrists, strap marks still wound around the arms all the way \n     to the shoulders, slivers of bamboo were embedded in the \n     bloodied shins and there were what appeared to be tread marks \n     from a hose across the chest, back and legs.\n\n  That POW later died as a result of his torture, and those individuals \nwho did that still survive in Cuba. They still have not been brought to \njustice. We will lift the embargo right after we find out who those \npeople were and we bring them to justice, Mr. President, with all due \nrespect. The Cuban program ended in 1968. The North Vietnamese \ncontinued to utilize the barbaric methods that the Cubans taught them \nunder the direction of Fidel Castro. They learned their torture well.\n  Who were these barbarians? Only Castro knows for certain. We should \nalso demand that the Cuban murderers of the ``Brothers to the Rescue,'' \nunarmed civilian American pilots whom President Clinton promised would \nbe punished in 1996, be brought to justice as well.\n  In Castro's Cuba, the Code for Children, Youth, and Family, provides \nfor a 3-year prison sentence for any parent who teaches a child an idea \ncontrary to communism. Imagine that, a 3-year prison sentence for any \nparent who teaches a child ideas contrary to communism. The code states \nthat no Cuban parent has a right to ``deform'' the ideology of his \nchildren. And the State is the true ``father.''\n  That is parental rights, Cuban style. Welcome back to Cuba, Elian.\n  At the age of 12, children are separated from their parents for \nmandatory service in a work camp. According to the renowned Cuban \ndissident Armando Valladares, children in these camps\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\nsuffer from venereal diseases and teen pregnancies which inevitably end \nin forced abortions.\n  You know what. We don't need a commission to figure this stuff out. \nWe know what is going on. The best way to bring it down is to keep the \npressure on Castro.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 40 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will in a moment yield to my colleague \nfrom North Dakota to share some thoughts. Let me briefly respond to \nsome of the statements that have been made here.\n  First of all, if we follow the same sort of logic that has been just \nsuggested here, President Nixon never should have gone to China when \nthere was hardly any freedom, when even free market principles were not \nthought of at the time. I suppose President Carter should not even have \nthought about the Camp David accords, given the reputation of the PLO. \nThis body, under the leadership of John McCain and John Kerry, should \nnot even have thought about normalizing relations with Vietnam, if we \nhad followed the logic just suggested. When it comes to how we \nestablish relations and reach out, I suspect we wouldn't have had \nGeneral MacArthur in Japan, and we would not be working with people in \nGermany. The list goes on.\n  Certainly to go back and recite the horrors of war and those who \nviolated the Geneva accords when it comes to the treatment of POWs--I \nwill not take a back seat to anybody in my abhorrence of what goes on.\n  What we are talking about is a commission to take a look at Cuban-\nU.S. policy. My colleagues who oppose this may want to say this is \nsomehow lifting the embargo. I do think we ought to change policies. I \nthink we ought to move in that direction. But I know full well I am not \nin a majority in that view in this Chamber. There are plenty of others \nwho do not think we ought to do that but who support the idea of a \ncommission to take a look at policy and how we might improve things.\n  We did this in other places. We did it under the Reagan \nadministration in Central America; it was the Kissinger commission. We \ncertainly had a Foreign Relations Committee there. In fact, the Foreign \nRelations Committee was at that time controlled by the majority party \ntoday. Yet a commission was established to take a look at how we might \nresolve and extricate ourselves from the conflict in Central America.\n  Today, under the leadership of Senator Helms and the majority of the \nForeign Relations Committee, we have a Commission on Terrorism. That is \nnot because we don't have a Foreign Relations Committee or an \nIntelligence Committee. The thought was that we ought to step back a \nlittle bit and take a look at the issue of terrorism and recommend some \npolicy ideas, how we might do a better job. I hope I do not have to go \ndown the long list of commissions that have been established because \npeople thought that made sense as a vehicle to determine new ideas.\n  I do not like this amendment on this bill either, frankly. I wish it \nwere not on DOD. But I would not pick this one out. We have adopted \nsome 45 amendments that have nothing to do with the DOD bill. They have \nbeen agreed to by the majority. If you are going to establish a rule \nthat nothing is included unless it is relevant, you better go back and \nundo 50 percent of the bill.\n  I make the case this is more relevant than a lot of stuff on this \nbill because we are dealing with a national security issue that could \nbecome a serious problem. If you end up with great civil conflict in \nCuba in a post-Castro period, where do you think the people are going \nto go? They are not going to travel to Colombia. They are not going to \nMexico. They are not going to Europe. They are coming 90 miles to this \ncountry. Then we may look back and say: A commission and some ideas \nthat might have abated that potential problem from occurring might have \nmade some sense.\n  That is all the suggestion is here, to try to come up with some ideas \nthat might ease potential problems that many people believe are coming \ndown the line.\n  I don't want to keep reiterating the point. I do not believe the \npeople I listed before, as ones supporting this commission, would \nnecessarily believe this is somehow agreeing with Castro's policies in \nCuba. When you go down the list of people such as George Shultz and \nFrank Carlucci and Malcolm Wallop--maybe people know something I don't \nknow, but those people support a commission. Do you think Howard Baker \nis a supporter of terrorism? George Shultz thinks that Cubans were \ninvolved in dreadful acts against POWs but somehow does not care about \nthat issue? I do not think so. Henry Kissinger and Frank Carlucci have \nsomehow gone soft on the issues? I don't think so. They feel as \nstrongly about it today as they have over the years. This does not tie \nour hands, a commission. This issue is not divided along partisan \nlines.\n  Does this President show partisanship when he asks John Danforth and \nHoward Baker to look at such issues as Los Alamos or the FBI conduct at \nWaco? Those are the people he appointed to a commission. I am talking \nabout serious people who know something about making a recommendation \nto Congress. That is all it is. Some are trying to create a monster out \nof a commission, suggesting somehow this is contrary to our interest. \nIt is in our interest to do it.\n  I am saddened, in a way, that my colleagues who disagree with me \nspecifically on the issues might find some merit in the idea of doing \nthis. This ought not be a place where it is seen as somehow anti one \nparticular group or another. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the \ncommission would not be a bona fide commission, in my view, if it did \nnot include people who disagree or who agree with the present policies.\n  Certainly, the Cuban American community, the exile community, for \nwhom I have the highest respect--what has happened to them and their \nfamilies is dreadful and deplorable. My view is our policy ought not to \nbe determined in the United States by any small particular group. It is \nwhat is in the U.S. interest, not the interest of some group in our \ncountry. It should be in everyone's interest. The commission, in my \nview, will help us provide road signs and guidance on how we ought to \nproceed.\n  Lastly, with regard to the drug issue--and I pointed out a week ago--\ndrug czar Barry McCaffrey has absolved the Cuban Government of \nallegations that it is involved in the drug trade and has called for \ngreater cooperation with Cuba on drug policy. I do not think Gen. Barry \nMcCaffrey is somehow weak when it comes to communism or drug issues. He \nhas been as tough a drug czar as this country has had. Those are his \nviews. In fact, he encouraged the idea that there be greater \ncooperation. We can never get that if one listens to the debate. It \nmight make a difference.\n  Despite assertions by Castro's opponents in the United States that \nthe Cuban Government and Castro personally are involved in the drug \ntrade, the UN International Drug Control Program, the U.S. Drug \nEnforcement Administration, and Gen. Barry McCaffrey's office reject \nthe claim. ``There is no evidence of Cuban government `complicity with \ndrug crime.' '' That is a quotation from Gen. Barry McCaffrey.\n  The allegations about that are ludicrous. If one wants to be against \nthe commission, be against the commission but do not raise issues that \nhave nothing to do with the establishment of a commission which may \nhelp sort this out and avoid the very partisan bickering this issue has \nprovoked over the years.\n  I have spoken longer than intended. My colleague is here, and I yield \n5 minutes to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by \nSenator Dodd from Connecticut. Fidel Castro has no supporters in the \nSenate. I deplore the miserable human rights record of the Government \nof Cuba and the lack of freedom that is accorded the folks who live in \nCuba. I deplore the conditions that have persuaded and forced so many \npeople to leave Cuba. So there is no support for the Castro regime in \nthe Senate. That is not the issue.\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\n  The issue is an amendment that is a small step in the right direction \nto create a commission that will evaluate a series of things with \nrespect to this country's policy about Cuba.\n  The commission will look for the development of a national consensus. \nI say to my colleague from Connecticut, I frankly think a consensus \npretty much exists, not necessarily in this Chamber, but most of the \nAmerican people believe that after 40 years of an embargo against the \ncountry of Cuba--40 years of an embargo that has not accomplished \nanything in terms of dislodging the Communist government in Cuba--the \nembargo has failed, and that there might be an alternative that can be \nused to find a way to bring freedom to that island.\n  Pope John Paul had some comments about these issues. I have been \ntalking on the floor about the issue of continuing sanctions with \nrespect to the shipment of food and medicine to Cuba. Just food and \nmedicine, and that runs into great controversy.\n  This is what Pope John Paul had to say:\n\n       Sanctions . . . ``strike the population indiscriminately, \n     making it ever more difficult for the weakest to enjoy the \n     bare essentials of decent living--things such as food, \n     health, and education.''\n\n  Everyone in this Chamber knows in their hearts that when we take aim \nat a dictator, we hit poor people, we hit sick people, and we hit \nhungry people. That is the absurdity of having food and medicine as \npart of the sanctions.\n  Today in the Washington Times--and other newspapers--it says: ``White \nHouse ends embargo on trade with North Korea.'' We have decided we are \ngoing to trade with North Korea and not have an embargo or sanctions \nwith respect to North Korea. We have debated in this Chamber permanent \nnormal trade relations with China. China is a Communist country. North \nKorea is a Communist country. Cuba is a Communist country. Yet we have \nthose who say we must maintain the embargo with respect to Cuba.\n  That is not what this amendment is about. This amendment is about a \nvery modest step in the right direction to study a series of options \nwith respect to policies this country has on the subject of Cuba.\n  I have been to Cuba. I have talked to dissidents in Cuba. Frankly, \nyou will run into dissidents, the harshest critics of the Cuban \nGovernment, who will say: Fidel Castro uses current U.S. policy as an \nexcuse for the collapse of the Cuban economy. If you say to Fidel \nCastro: Look around you, this economy has collapsed--he says: Yes, yes, \nof course it has collapsed. The American fist around the neck of the \nCuban economy for 40 years, of course, is what caused that collapse.\n  Current policy with respect to Cuba is the most convenient excuse \nFidel Castro has for a collapsed economy and for a government that does \nnot work. He continues to use it year after year. I happen to think, as \nsome dissidents do, that a much different strategy with respect to Cuba \nwould probably very quickly hasten the exit of Fidel Castro from the \nscene.\n  I want to add another point. While we are, as a country, beginning to \nthink more clearly about this subject of whether or not we should \ncontinue sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine--and we will \nremove those sanctions with respect to North Korea and many other \ncountries--we have people rigidly insisting: No, we must maintain all \nof these sanctions with respect to Cuba. I ask them--aside from just \nthe immorality of that policy, and I think it is basically immoral to \nuse food as a weapon--I ask them to address family farmers.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask them to address, for example, \nfarmers in America, and explain to them why the Canadian farmers will \nsell to Cuba, why the European farmers will sell to Cuba, why the \nVenezuelan farmers will sell to Cuba, but American farmers who see \ntheir prices collapse are told: No, these markets, including Cuba, are \noff limits to you; we have sanctions. We want to penalize those \ngovernments, and included in those penalties is a desire to say we will \nnot allow food and medicine to move to those countries.\n  I hasten to say I have no difficulty at all and fully support the \nproposition that our country should impose economic sanctions on \ncountries that behave outside the international norm, but those \nsanctions should never, in my judgment, include food and medicine. That \nis, in my judgment, an immoral policy. The proposition offered by the \nSenator from Connecticut today is just the first modest step in \nbeginning a national discussion about whether 40 years of failure with \nthe current embargo ought to be continued, or whether there ought to be \nsome new evaluation of new strategies dealing with Cuba. It is very \nsimple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I hope my colleagues will support this modest and simple \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 6 \nminutes to the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Helms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Helms is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to deliver my remarks seated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I look around the Chamber, I see nobody \nexcept myself who is old enough to remember a Prime Minister of Great \nBritain who went over to Munich, before the United States entered World \nWar II, sat with Adolph Hitler and made a deal with him. He came back \nand he told the British people: We can have peace in our time. I trust \nthis man.\n  Castro's own daughter has publicly condemned him over and over for \nthe atrocities he has committed against the Cuban people. He is a \nbloodthirsty tyrant; and it is well known that he is. That is why I \nsupport the motion to table the amendment offered by my friend, Chris \nDodd, who is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. We work \ntogether amiably and effectively, I think. I do so for several \npractical reasons--including the one I have just stated--that I hope \nSenators will bear in mind as they consider Senator Dodd's proposal.\n  First, the proposal is to create a national commission on Cuba. I \nwould remind the Senators here, and those who may be watching by \ntelevision in their offices, that such a panel already exists. It is \ncalled the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, consisting of 18 \nSenators, all duly elected representatives of the American people. \nThere is a similar committee over in the House of Representatives.\n  The Senate committee has been quite active on Cuba, as my friend, \nSenator Dodd, will testify. In this session alone, we have held \nhearings on Castro's repression of the Cuban people. We adopted a \nresolution supporting a United Nations resolution on Cuba and even \napproved language that would modify the U.S. embargo on Cuba. I do not \nsupport the latter proposal--which was the Ashcroft amendment--but it \nwas reported out of committee as part of a broader foreign affairs \nbill. In short, we have a committee on Cuba consisting of elected \nrepresentatives of the American people. I think it works just fine, \nthank you.\n  Secondly, what on Earth has Fidel Castro done to earn the forbearance \nof the United States? Does every cruel dictator in the world deserve a \ncommission to study how U.S. foreign policy has done him wrong? Why not \na national commission on Iraq or Libya or North Korea or China?\n  The problem is not that U.S. policy toward Cuba has not changed. The \ntragedy for 11 million Cubans is that Fidel Castro has not changed.\n  U.S. policy toward Cuba is based on sound, clear principles. Our \neconomic and political relations will change when Cuba's regime frees \nall prisoners of conscience, legalizes political activity, permits free \nexpression, and commits to democratic elections.\n  But that bar is too high for Fidel Castro. That is his problem. It is \nnot our problem. But making unilateral concessions to a dictatorship on \nits last legs is the worst sort of appeasement. Neville Chamberlain \nwould be proud of this proposition.\n  Third, why single out Cuba? Is there any Senator who does not expect \nthe\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nnext President of the United States to review our entire foreign policy \nacross the board? A lot of Americans are counting the days when the \nUnited States has someone in the White House who will turn around our \nforeign policy for the better. That brings me to my fourth and final \npoint.\n  It will be the prerogative of the next President of the United States \nto review U.S. foreign policy across the board and to formulate his own \npolicies in close consultation with a new Congress. The next \nadministration should not be saddled with the recommendations of a \nlameduck ``Clinton Commission'' on Cuba.\n  For these reasons, I hope Senators will vote to table the amendment \nof my friend, Chris Dodd.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Graham from Florida is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, 7 months and 75 minutes from today we will \nnot be in this Senate Chamber. We will be standing, probably on the \nwest-facing flank of the Capitol, hearing the next President of the \nUnited States being inaugurated into office.\n  What is the significance of that statement of fact and place to the \ndebate we are having today?\n  The significance is that the issue before us today is not, What \nshould be U.S. policy towards Cuba? The amendment that is before us \nproposes to establish a commission to try to answer the question, What \nshould be U.S. policy towards Cuba?\n  In a few days, we are going to be debating a proposition to change \nthe embargo as it relates to Cuba. But the question before us today on \nthe issue of establishing this commission is, Who should have primary \nresponsibility for establishing U.S. foreign policy and, specifically, \nforeign policy towards Cuba?\n  My answer to that question, of course, is, the people of the United \nStates. The way in which the people of the United States will \nparticipate is not through an elite commission appointed by an \nadministration in its last 7 months but, rather, through the electoral \nprocess which is going to take place in November of this year.\n  We are in the midst of a robust Presidential campaign in which many \nissues of domestic and foreign importance to the United States are \nbeing debated before the American people. Frankly, I think this has \nbeen one of the most constructive Presidential campaigns in recent \nyears thus far. I hope it continues in that path from now to election \nday in November.\n  One of the issues which will certainly be debated during this \nPresidential campaign will be the issue of the United States \nrelationship to Cuba. The American people will have an opportunity to \nparticipate, to understand, to add their opinions to this debate. Then \nthey will decide. They will decide by the election of the next \nPresident of the United States of America.\n  Under our Constitution, the President has the primary responsibility \nfor foreign policy. Why in the world would we today, on the day exactly \n7 months before the next President will take the oath of office, \nsupport a proposition that would establish a commission dominated by \nmembers of the current President's administration, which would have the \nintention of shackling the range of options of the President that will \nbe elected by the American people in November, thus frustrating the \nability of the American people to influence what our policy should be \nrelative to Cuba?\n  There are a lot of things that we can say about Cuba.\n  Clearly, Cuba is an authoritarian regime. Examples of that have \nalready been cited. Cuba, within the last few weeks, has been cited \nagain by the United Nations for its denial of human rights.\n  Cuba, within the last few days, has been again identified by Amnesty \nInternational as one of the egregious human rights violators.\n  Cuba has again been placed on the terrorist list of states, those \nstates which support and harbor terrorist activities.\n  All of those issues are matters of public knowledge and record. All \nof those, I am certain, will be further debated at the appropriate \ntime, when we commence the consideration of whether it is in U.S. \nnational policy interests to loosen the embargo on Cuba.\n  But today the issue is not whether Cuba is an authoritarian state, a \nwell-established principle but, rather, the question of whether we \nshould lift from the hands of the American people and place into an \nappointed commission the primary responsibility for direction on our \nCuba policy.\n  There is a ``common sense'' in these debates about Cuba, that the \nUnited States and Cuba are the only two nations in the world, that they \nare locked in a singular bilateral relationship.\n  The fact is, many countries in the world have various forms of \nrelations with Cuba. Many of them have the type of relationship which I \nbelieve the advocates of this commission would like to see achieved for \nthe United States; that is, open, political, and economic recognition \nand relationship. While the approaches to Cuba have been different \namong the countries of the world, the result of those approaches has \nbeen consistently the same.\n  What is the result of that policy, whether it is ours or the \nCanadians or the Spanish or a series of countries in Latin America? The \nresult of that policy has been a continuation of 40 years of one of the \nmost egregious violators of human rights, deniers of even the most \nbasic principles of democracy, and a Communist economic system which \nhas driven what had been one of the most affluent countries in Latin \nAmerica into one of the most desperate countries in Latin America.\n  The idea that by the United States changing our policy, we are \nautomatically going to have the effect of changing the policy of Fidel \nCastro in Cuba defies 40 years of other countries' efforts through an \nopen, normal relationship with Cuba to achieve that result. I believe \nthese are serious issues. They are issues which deserve to be decided \nby the American people through the electoral process.\n  The distinguished list of Americans cited by the proponent of this \ncommission to establish such a commission signed their letter on \nSeptember 30, 1998, almost 2 years ago. I wonder if these same \ndistinguished citizens would be advocating this commission on the very \neve of a Presidential election which will select a new President, \nwhether they would advocate that in June of 2000 we should be removing \nfrom the hands of the American people and placing in the hands of this \ncommission the primary responsibility to examine American policy \ntowards Cuba; and, further, whether we should be establishing a \ncommission which has such a narrow and quite obviously tilted \norientation as to what the results would be.\n  If we look at what is required of the commission to evaluate, it is \nissues which are largely selected to determine in advance what the \nrecommendations will be. For instance, missing from this list is what \nis one of the most fundamental questions of American policy towards \nCuba; that is, what should we be doing now in order to influence the \nkind of environment that will exist in Cuba when the opportunity for \nreal change is available. Will we have a Cuba that will make a change \nlike Czechoslovakia, a velvet revolution from communism to democracy, \nor will we have a Romania, where thousands of people are killed, \nviolence which scars the country even today.\n  The fact that some of these fundamental questions are left off the \nlist of what should be the focus of American policy towards Cuba leaves \nme to believe that the purpose of this commission is to certify a \nforegone conclusion rather than do what the American people are going \nto do in the weeks between now and November, and that is have a \nthoughtful consideration of what are our real issues and interests in \nCuba and how should we go about selecting a President who will carry \nout those real interests.\n  We are going to have an opportunity for a full and open debate. Some \nof that debate will occur soon and on this floor. Much of it will occur \nin the living rooms of the American people. We should allow the \nAmerican people to decide this issue. In 7 months, we will be listening \nto a President inaugurated who, hopefully, in that inaugural speech, \nwill make some comments\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nabout his feeling as to what the American people desire relative to our \npolicy towards Cuba.\n  I urge that we vote for the motion to table this misguided and \nmistimed proposition of a lame duck commission on Cuba at this time and \nthat we let the American people and the next President of the United \nStates provide the leadership on this important foreign policy issue.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for yielding \nthe time.\n  If this argument seems familiar to my colleagues, it is because it \nis. We have had this debate three times in as many years, always to the \nsame bipartisan conclusion.\n  I approach it today from several perspectives; first, from the \ninstitutions. Is what we are proposing and arguing to the American \npeople really fair? The American farmer is being told in the midst of \nan agricultural crisis that if only you could sell some crops to Cuba, \nyour problems would be relieved--11 million people in the Caribbean who \nearn $10 a month. Rather than coming to this floor honestly and dealing \nwith agricultural crises and agricultural policies which have left \nfarmers in my State and most States in genuine trouble, instead we hold \nup this false promise.\n  The truth is, Cuba can buy agricultural products from every other \nnation in the world today. From Australia, Canada, Argentina, they can \nbuy corn and they can buy wheat. They do not. Yet the false promise is \nheld on this floor that somehow, magically, they would buy those \nproducts from us. If they don't buy them from Canada, for the same \nreason they will not buy them from the Dakotas or Nebraska or Iowa--\nCuba has no money. The average Cuban earns $10 per month. The Nation is \nbankrupt. Yet somehow Castro, in the last totalitarian state in the \nAmericas, the most repressive dictator of human rights possibly in the \nworld, is being seen somehow as victimized and the United States is the \naggressor.\n  This argument has been made so many times but never seems to register \nwith my colleagues. Let me say it again: Since 1992, the United States \nhas issued 158 licenses for medicine--virtually every license request \nfiled. We have given $3 billion worth of humanitarian assistance to \nCuba. There is no relationship between two peoples on Earth where one \nnation has given more food and medicine to another than the United \nStates to Cuba. We have given more food and medicine to Cuba than we \nhave given to our closest ally of Israel or other nations struggling in \nLatin America. We have given food and medicine.\n  Say what you will about the policy, but be fair to the United States \nof America. We are a generous people. This policy has a moral \nfoundation. No Cuban is suffering because of the U.S. Government. They \nare suffering because of Fidel Castro and failed Marxism. We have said \nit every year, and every year we return to the same point. It is not \nright and it is not fair to the United States.\n  Then we hear the argument that this has failed for 40 years, how \ncould we go on? This policy was instituted by Bill Clinton in 1993 on a \nbipartisan vote with the leadership of a Republican Congress and a \nDemocratic administration. Until then, there essentially was no \nembargo. You can say 40 years as long as you want; it does not make it \ntrue.\n  Until 1993, corporations were trading through Europe. Every American \ncorporation was able to trade with Cuba through European affiliates. \nUntil 1990, the Soviet Union was putting $5 billion worth of aid into \nCuba. There was no embargo. Is 7 years too long to take a stand for the \nfreedom of the Cuban people? We waited 50 years with North Korea.\n  We fought apartheid with an embargo for 30 years--the international \ncommunity. With Iraq, we have waited 12 years. We can't give 7 years to \ntry to bring some hope to the Cuban people in this moment of \nextraordinary despair?\n  Why do you choose this moment? Why now? The Clinton administration \nhas but 7 months left in office. A new President, with a mandate of the \nAmerican people, will want his own foreign policy, be it Gore or Bush. \nYet you would saddle this new administration with a commission not of \nits choosing, with a policy not of its directive for 4 years that do \nnot belong to Bill Clinton?\n  What message is this to Fidel Castro? It is not as if things in Cuba \nhave gotten better. If, indeed, my colleagues were coming to this floor \nand saying, you know, Senator, there has been an election, there is now \nan opposition threat, and the Cubans are now acting responsibly, they \nare finally recognizing the rights of our people and we must respond--\nin fairness to my colleagues, they don't even make that argument. \nThings are not getting better. Indeed, things are not even the same.\n  Human rights organizations have classified last year as the worst \nyear in a decade for human rights in Cuba. This is the reality to which \nyou respond. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva voted to \ncondemn Cuba several months ago, accusing it of ``continuing violations \nof human rights, fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, \nassociation, and assembly.'' The U.S. State Department, a few months \nago, called Cuba a totalitarian state that ``maintains a pervasive \nsystem of vigilance through undercover agents, informers, and rapid \nresponse brigades in neighborhood communities to root out any and all \ndissent.''\n  Since last November, Cuban police have detained 304 dissidents, \nrestricted the movements of another 201, and have been holding 22 more \nfor possible trials.\n  The Cuban statutes were changed last year to make it a felony to \ncommunicate with the U.S. Government, against the law to communicate \nwith American Government agencies, or to be interviewed by the American \nmedia. This is the reality to which you are responding. I do not say it \nlightly, but it is a reward for deteriorating circumstances in Cuba.\n  Several years ago, in 1994, 72 men, women, and children attempted to \nleave Havana Harbor for Miami in a tugboat. They were intercepted. The \nCuban police restricted their movements. They began to fire water hoses \non the boat. Women held up 20 babies to show the police that they had \ninfants on board, with a belief that this would stop the water hoses. \nInstead, the pressure increased. That day, 72 men, women, and infants \nwent to the bottom of Havana Harbor. Several days later, the relatives \nasked permission to retrieve their bodies. They didn't get it that day; \nthey haven't gotten it since. Those babies are at the bottom of Havana \nHarbor. This is Fidel Castro's Cuba. This is what you are responding \nto--a deteriorating, despicable situation.\n  There will come a change in American policy to Cuba. It is in the \nlaw. The burden is on Fidel Castro. It is the fault of his policies, \nnot our own. Hold an election, allow a free press, allow free \nexpression, release political prisoners, and everything is possible. \nYou may disagree with that policy, but it is the law. It is bipartisan. \nBut at least until you do, be fair to this country. We have not abused \nCuba. Fidel Castro has abused Cuba.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 26 minutes. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am a very strong supporter of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Connecticut. Very simply, it is \na no-brainer. It is a bipartisan commission to look at our policy, \nwhich is supported by good Republicans--Howard Baker and Jack Danforth, \nformer Senators of this body. It is not directed at agriculture, it is \nnot directed at other points raised on this floor; it is just a \nbipartisan commission to reassess our policy with Cuba. Nothing could \nbe more simple, direct, and appropriate than that.\n  I also want to speak about Cuba with respect to trade. We have \ntargeted Fidel Castro for four decades. For the last 40 years, believe \nit or not, we have maintained a special category in our\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\ntrade and foreign policy with Cuba--a one-country category: Cuba. We \nhave special legislation for trade with Cuba. We have special rules for \ntravel to Cuba. We have a special system for claims on Cuba.\n  Why does Cuba get so much of our attention? When the United States \nbegan targeting Fidel Castro, we had very serious national security \nconcerns. Castro was openly hostile to us. He was a Soviet client and \njust 90 miles away from us. Thanks to Soviet aid, he had military and \neconomic muscle to make him someone to take seriously. Castro worked \nagainst the United States throughout the sixties, seventies, and \neighties. Bankrolled by the Soviet Union, he exported revolution \nthroughout the Western Hemisphere. He sent troops to support \nrevolutionaries as far away as Africa. Castro backed international \nterrorists who targeted Americans. He was a clear adversary.\n  What is the situation today? Does Castro still favor revolution? I am \nsure he does. Does he still oppose American interests? Absolutely. But \ndoes he still have military and economic muscle to threaten our \nnational security? The answer, obviously, is no.\n  The Soviet Union is now in the dustbin of history. Their demise cut \noff Castro's lifeline. Today, his economy is in shambles. With 11 \nmillion educated, dynamic people, Cuba produces only $22 billion a \nyear. It only exports about $1.4 billion worth of goods. The Cuban \neconomy remains stuck in the 1960s in terms of trade and technology.\n  Sugar is still the country's top export earner. Cuban farmers are \nforced to sell over half the country's agriculture output to the \nGovernment at below-market prices. Since Castro can no longer trade \nsugar for Soviet oil, his people suffer tremendously, for example, from \nrolling power blackouts. Since he defaulted on foreign debt payments in \nthe 1980s, Cuba pays double-digit interest rates on short-term loans to \nfinance sugar trade.\n  With this country in desperate financial shape, Castro is in no \nposition to export revolution--none whatsoever. According to the \nPentagon, Castro presents no real threat to our national security.\n  Times have changed. Forty years ago, Castro was a clear danger. \nToday, he is not a present danger. Has our policy toward Cuba changed? \nNot really. Cuba still occupies a unique position in American policy.\n  I believe it is time for the United States to have a normal \nrelationship with Cuba, especially a normal trade relationship. I have \ncosponsored legislation which we passed here by an overwhelming margin \nlast year to lift unilateral sanctions on food and medicine.\n  I believe we should go beyond this. We should repeal the laws that \nmake Cuba a specific target. That includes the anti-Cuba laws we passed \nin 1992 and 1996, as well as other laws developed over the past 40 \nyears. We should end our embargo of Cuba and eliminate the trade \nsanctions.\n  Last month, I introduced bipartisan legislation to end the Cuba trade \nembargo, the Trade Normalization With Cuba Act of 2000. Senator Dodd, \nwho is the main author of today's amendment, is one of the cosponsors \nof my bill to eliminate this special category we have created just for \nCuba.\n  For the past 10 years, I have worked to normalize U.S. trade with \nChina. I am working to end the Cuban embargo for many of the same \nreasons--first, and most importantly, to benefit the United States. \nEliminating the embargo will provide economic opportunities for \nAmerican workers, American farmers, and businesses.\n  Last week, a study was released on the impact of lifting the embargo \non food and medicine--not the whole embargo, only on food and medicine. \nIt concluded that American farmers and workers could sell $400 million \nin just agricultural products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture \nestimated a potential Cuban market of $1 billion.\n  The second reason to lift the embargo is to encourage the development \nof a Cuban private sector. Since he can no longer rely on Soviet \nsubsidies, Castro has taken steps to allow for limited development of \nprivate business, mostly in service professions. Private business leads \nto a middle class which demands accountability of its government and a \ngreater say in how things are decided.\n  The third reason to end the embargo is to increase our contacts. \nNormal relations allow us to bring our social and ethical values. That \nhas an impact over the years.\n  Mr. President, we have in place a policy that has not worked for \nforty years. It was a different world in 1960. Ending the Cuba embargo \nis long overdue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have often expressed my opposition to our \nanachronistic and self-defeating policy toward Cuba, so I will be very \nbrief. I strongly support this amendment and congratulate the senior \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who has been the leader on this \nissue for quite some time.\n  It is profoundly ironic that the United States is about to lift \nsanctions against North Korea, where we have 37,000 American troops \npoised to go to war on a moment's notice, and yet we continue to impose \nan economic blockade against a tiny island that poses no security \nthreat to the United States.\n  If the Elian Gonzalez fiasco has taught us anything, it is that \nCubans and Americans are far more alike than different, and that the \nviews of the Cuban-American community in Miami are both outdated and at \nodds with the overwhelming majority of Americans. Of course we abhor \nthe repressive policies of Fidel Castro, but the issue is how best to \nprepare for the day when he is no longer ruling Cuba. That day is \napproaching, and the longer we wait to use the intervening period to \nbuild closer relations with that island nation, the worse it will be.\n  This amendment is extremely modest. As Senator Dodd has said, it \nwould normally be adopted on a voice vote. It should be. What is wrong \nwith a commission, representing a wide range of views, to review a \npolicy that has, by any objective standard, failed miserably? It is \nlong overdue.\n  So Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support this amendment. When I \nvisited Cuba a year ago the Cuban officials I met with repeatedly \nblamed the U.S. embargo for all that is wrong in Cuba. I could not \ndisagree more. A great deal of the misery that the Cuban people suffer \nis caused by the absurd and oppressive policies of their own \ngovernment. But the embargo is not blameless, and it is a convenient \nexcuse.\n  We should eliminate that excuse. We should seek to promote democracy \nand better relations with Cuba through the power of our ideas and our \neconomy, just as we are about to do with North Korea, and just as we \nare doing with China, Vietnam, and other countries with which we have \nprofound disagreements. This amendment will set the stage for a new day \nin our relations with Cuba, and I urge other Senators to support it.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  I rise in opposition to the Dodd-Warner amendment. Let's make no \nmistake about this amendment. It is intended to presage a lifting of \nUnited States sanctions on Cuba. I do not believe the United States \nshould change its policy toward Cuba. I believe Cuba should change its \npolicy toward the United States of America.\n  I supported normalization of relations between the United States of \nAmerica and Vietnam. That was based on a roadmap where, in return for \ncertain specific actions taken by Vietnam, the United States would take \nactions in return. That took place. The Vietnamese troops left \nCambodia. Reeducation camps were emptied. There was an increase in \nhuman rights and improvements made in a variety of ways which led to \neventual normalization.\n  I don't expect Cuba to become a functioning democracy. It was a \ntotalitarian, repressive government 30 years ago; it is a repressive, \ntotalitarian government today. The latest example is two doctors who \nhave been detained in Zimbabwe who wanted freedom, who are still not \nfree, who are being brought back to Cuba for, obviously, horrific \ntreatment because of their desire to no longer be associated with \nCastro's regime.\n  On July 23, 1999, Human Rights Watch issued a highly critical report \non the human rights situation in Cuba. The report describes how Cuba \nhas developed a highly effective machinery of repression and has used \nthis to restrict severely the exercise of fundamental human rights, of \nexpression, association, and assembly. According to the report: In \nrecent years, Cuba has added\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nnew repressive laws and continued prosecuting nonviolent dissidents \nwhile shrugging off international appeals to reform and placating \nvisiting dignitaries with occasional releases of political prisoners.\n  I urge every Senator to read Human Rights' reports on Cuba before we \ntake steps to improve relations.\n  This is the same regime that sent its troops to Africa to further the \ncause of communism there. This is the same regime that continues to \nrepress and oppress its people.\n  Not too long ago, Mr. Castro decided to allow people to operate a \nrestaurant within their own homes. Somehow that became a threat to the \nstate, and Mr. Castro shut down even that rudimentary form of a free \nenterprise system.\n  It is not an accident that the automobile of choice in Cuba today is \na 1956 Chevrolet.\n  It is deplorable that Mr. Castro and his government should encourage \nyoung women to engage in prostitution in order to gain hard currency \nfor their regime.\n  The latest manifestation is the detainment of two decent men who are \ndoctors who wanted freedom.\n  There is no freedom in Cuba.\n  The day that Castro decides to allow progress in human rights, in the \nfree enterprise system, in the exercise of the basic rights of men and \nwomen that we try to guarantee to all men and women throughout the \nworld, is the day I take the floor and ask that we consider a roadmap \nor certain incentives for Mr. Castro to become anything but the \ninternational pariah that he and his regime deservedly are branded as \ntoday.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. Again, I am more than willing \nto lay out a roadmap for Mr. Castro to follow, but there has not been \none single indication that Mr. Castro is prepared to even grant the \nmost fundamental and basic rights to the citizens of his country, which \nis the reason they continue to attempt to flee his regime at every \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. This amendment is about the establishment of a commission \non U.S. Cuban policy. This commission was recommended by Howard Baker, \nFrank Carlucci, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Malcolm Wallop, and \nWilliam Rogers. This is not lifting sanctions. This is not taking a \nposition where we have endorsed free travel or somehow sanctioned what \nthe Castro government is doing. It is a commission. It is a commission \nto analyze U.S. policy. That is all it is.\n  It is pathetic to hear the opposition discussing the issue. Have we \nreached a point where we can't even discuss United States policy with \nregard to Cuba? If we had followed that policy, Nixon never would have \ngone to China. We never would have established a roadmap of Vietnam. \nPresident Bush and President Carter wouldn't have been able to do \nanything in the Middle East. Ronald Reagan wouldn't have met with \nGorbachev and Yeltsin. There is a long list. You can't even sit down \nand talk about this issue.\n  I find it stunning, at the beginning of the 21st century, that we are \nso obsessed with this one individual that we are willing to squander \nbuilding a relationship in a post-Castro period with 11 million people \nof Cuba. That is stunning to me.\n  We have listened to Members of Congress. I argue the leading \ndissident in Cuba, who has done time in jail, has suffered, his family \nsuffers; all of the things my colleague has talked about, this \nindividual has suffered. Don't listen to me; listen to him. Listen to \nhis words, inside Cuba, not living in the luxury of democracy and \nfreedom here but living inside Cuba.\n  I read the letter, as follows:\n       Dear Friend, I am writing to you and to other U.S. \n     lawmakers to assure you that the great majority of dissident \n     groups and leaders in Cuba do not support the unilateral \n     economic sanctions imposed by the government of the United \n     States against the Cuban government. This position is clearly \n     reflected in the last paragraph of the ``We Are All United'' \n     (``Todos Unidos'') proclamation approved last November 12th \n     in Havana and signed by more than fifty dissident groups.\n       My friends and I recognize the moral and political support \n     of many U.S. lawmakers for efforts to change Washington's \n     policy towards Cuba that will end the current situation that \n     harms the basis for free trade and coexistence between \n     sovereign nations.\n       It is unfortunate that the government of Cuba still clings \n     to an outdated and inefficient model that I believe is the \n     fundamental cause for the great difficulties that the Cuban \n     people suffer, but it is obvious that the current Cold War \n     climate between our governments and the unilateral sanctions \n     will continue to fuel the fire of totalitarianism in my \n     country.\n       Moving forward towards fully normalized relations requires \n     mutual respect between our two nations. Such as path will \n     inevitably lead us to develop mutually beneficial relations \n     that will assist the Cuban people in reconstructing our \n     country while we preserve our independence, sovereignty and \n     identity.\n       On behalf of the best interests of our people I invite you \n     to support new proposals to end a conflict that has lasted \n     more than forty years.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                  Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz,\n\n                           Presidente, Comision Cubana de Derechos\n                                Humanos y Reconciliacion Nacional.\n\n  Mr. President, again let me read a letter, if I may, signed by our \ncolleagues a year and a half ago.\n\n       We the undersigned, recommend that you authorize the \n     establishment of a National Bipartisan Commission to review \n     our current U.S.-Cuba policy. This commission would follow \n     the precedent and work program of the National Bipartisan \n     Commission on Central America (the ``Kissinger Commission''), \n     established by President Reagan in 1983, which made such a \n     positive contribution to our foreign policy in that troubled \n     region 15 years ago.\n\n  The letter goes on about all the reasons such a commission would make \nsense and how it should be formed.\n\n       More and more Americans from all sectors of our nation are \n     becoming concerned about the far-reaching effects of our \n     present U.S.-Cuba policy on United States interests and the \n     Cuban people. Your establishment of this National Bipartisan \n     Commission would demonstrate leadership and responsiveness to \n     the American people.\n\n  Signed in this and a subsequent letter by the following Members: John \nWarner, Rod Grams, Chuck Hagel, Jim Jeffords, Mike Enzi, John Chafee, \nGordon Smith, Craig Thomas, Robert Kerrey, Dale Bumpers, Rick Santorum, \nmyself, Dirk Kempthorne, Pat Roberts, Kit Bond, Richard Lugar, Pat \nLeahy, Pat Moynihan, Arlen Specter, Jack Reed, Thad Cochran, Patty \nMurray, Pete Domenici, and Barbara Boxer.\n  That is about as bipartisan as it gets. That is a year and a half \nago, with a significant number of our colleagues saying a commission \nmakes some sense, to try to formulate a policy that would allow us at \nleast to begin to analyze how our policy might improve in the coming \nyears.\n  Those letters have already been printed in the Record earlier today.\n  Mr. President, last:\n\n       Dear Senator Warner, as Americans who have been engaged in \n     the conduct of foreign relations in various positions over \n     the past three decades, we believe that it is timely to \n     conduct a review of the United States policy towards Cuba. We \n     therefore encourage you and your colleagues to support the \n     establishment of a National Bipartisan Commission on Cuba.\n\n  Signed by Howard Baker, former majority leader, U.S. Senate; Frank \nCarlucci, former Secretary of Defense under Republican administrations; \nHenry Kissinger, former Secretary of State; William Rogers, former \nUnder Secretary of State in a Republican administration; Harry \nShalaudeman, former Assistant Secretary of State under Republican \nadministrations; and Malcolm Wallop, former conservative Republican \nMember of this body; Larry Eagleburger, former Secretary of State under \nPresident Bush.\n  Calling people Neville Chamberlain, citing all the horrors that go on \nthat we know about in repressive governments--does anybody think these \npeople, our colleagues here who signed these letters, former \nadministration officials, myself, or others--somehow this is un-\nAmerican for us to at least sit down in a cooler environment, to \nanalyze how we might establish a better relationship with the nation of \nCuba?\n  I really find it incredible. It is worrisome to me. It is worrisome \nto me that our own self-interest, the U.S. interest, could be so \ndominated by a relatively small group of people in this country who are \nable to provoke this kind of opposition to the simple idea of a \ncommission that has been endorsed by leading Republican foreign policy \nexperts as well as Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber across the \nboard, representing the entire ideological spectrum.\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\n  What are we afraid of about a commission to look at these issues? \nThat automatically it means we are going to be bound and shackled? What \nbetter timing than to have one right now, so we can absolutely provide \nsome guidance? That is all it is. The new administration coming in \nsometime next spring, do they believe commission recommendations would \nbind them to some action? Have previous commissions bound other \nadministrations? Cite one for me. Cite one, where a commission has \nbound this Congress to take action. There is not a single example of \nit. But this issue has become so inflamed here, you cannot even talk \nabout a commission.\n  This amendment does not say lift the embargo on food and medicine. I \nsupport that. But that is not what this says. This amendment does not \nsay you ought to travel freely to Cuba or any other country around the \nglobe for that matter, although I support it. I don't like my \nGovernment telling me where I can't go. Let the Cuban Government tell \nme I can't come in, but don't have my Government tell me where I can't \ntravel. In fact, it is about the only place in the world where our \nGovernment says that. We travel to all the other nations around the \nglobe that harbor terrorists who are on the lists. The answer here is \nno.\n  No, this amendment merely says we ought to step back and take a \ncooler look at what our policy ought to be in the 21st century before \nwe go much further and end up with a train wreck in Cuba, where we find \npeople pouring to our shores, civil conflict persisting, and innocent \nand decent people in that country losing their lives.\n  Let me conclude on this point. I said earlier I have great respect \nfor the exile community. I have great respect for what they have been \nthrough and what their families have been through. I have great respect \nfor the people inside Cuba. I have been there. I have spent time with \nthem. I have talked to people.\n  We owe it to them, we owe it to decent, good people who are not \ncaught up in the foreign policies--I don't know how many of my \ncolleagues saw the photograph yesterday of a mother and daughter \nembracing in Cuba. They would not give out their names because they \nwent there illegally, because our Government prohibited that daughter \nfrom going to visit her mother 90 miles off our shore. A mother and \ndaughter can travel to China, to Vietnam, Iran, Libya, almost anywhere \nelse in the world, and we do not have a law prohibiting it. But that \ndaughter could not visit her mother in Cuba unless she went illegally. \nI think we ought to review that policy. I don't think that makes me a \nradical or a revolutionary.\n  When we prohibit families from even spending time with each other, 90 \nmiles off our shore, something is wrong. Something is wrong. The \nestimates are that thousands of Americans every year violate the laws \nof the United States by traveling to Cuba to see their family members. \nWe ought not make their actions illegal. This amendment does not even \naddress that issue. It just says let's look at the entire policy. That \nis all it does.\n  I suspect this amendment is going to lose. It is going to be tabled. \nI am saddened by that. I think it is a step backwards. As I said \nearlier, had we followed a similar policy with China and Vietnam and \nKorea, we would not have the kind of improvements we have seen today \nall across the globe. But because courageous and bold people did not \nlet the past so cripple them they could not begin to deal with the \nfuture, there are prospects for peace on Northern Ireland and the \nMiddle East today. There are even prospects for peace in the peninsula \nof Korea, even moving to improve substantially conditions in Vietnam \nand China. That is all because there were courageous, bold leaders. \nThere were the Richard Nixons who did not listen to the voices here who \nsaid: You cannot go to China. It is an outrageous government. It does \nnot deserve the presence of an American President.\n\n  It was a pretty compelling argument. But that President said: No, I \nthink we ought to try something new. At least try--try. Because he \ntried, there is hope today for a billion more people--more than a \nbillion people in the PRC.\n  Because we had some courageous people who said let's at least try to \nbreak new ground in Vietnam, we have a roadmap. I cannot even sit down \nto determine whether or not we can have a roadmap if this amendment is \ndefeated, when it comes to Cuba.\n  George Miller, Albert Reynolds, Tony Blair--Prime Minister, Gerry \nAdams, David Trimble--these people are told by their constituents: \nDon't you dare sit down with those Catholics. Don't you dare sit down \nwith those Protestants. Don't you dare go to Belfast.\n  They said: I am going to go anyway, and I am going to try. I am going \nto try to make a difference because I am not going to live in the past. \nI am not going to live back then and just recite the litany of every \nwrong. I am going to try to make a better future for my children.\n  And they went. Today the facts are things are improving and there is \na chance for peace. There is a chance. With North Korea, it is the same \nthing; the Middle East, it is the same thing. It has failed. It has \nfailed again, but people keep trying. All I am saying is let's try. \nLet's just try. Let's sit back ourselves and see if we can try and do \nsomething different. Don't the 11 million people on that island country \nwho care about that issue deserve that much? Isn't it in the national \ninterest?\n  It is telling that there are people here who are so fixated and \nobsessed with Fidel Castro that they even want to deny a father and son \nbeing together. They are so fixated they would say a father and son \nshould not be allowed to be together. There are those of us who made \nthe point there are good parents in bad countries, just as there are \nbad parents in good countries and fathers and sons, mothers and \ndaughters, fathers and daughters, and mothers and sons ought to be \ntogether.\n  I never thought asking for a bipartisan commission would demand \ncourage saying to people who may be supporters and backers: I disagree \nwith you on this one because we are going to try.\n  I regret it is on this bill. I do not have any other choice. If I do \nnot offer it here, I cannot offer it. It is not like there are other \nvehicles available to me. My colleagues know the other bills are \nappropriations bills, and I am prohibited from offering this on an \nappropriations bill without getting a supermajority vote. I do not like \ndoing it. Don't tell me not to do it here when this bill is cluttered, \nby the way, with nonrelevant amendments. I would not be offering it on \nthis bill if I had some other choice. I do not. I regret that. I do not \nnormally offer nonrelevant amendments on bills, but when I was left \nwith no other choice, I felt I had to do it on this bill, and I thought \nthis was the right time, a transitional period.\n\n  This is not about Clinton appointments, when the President appointed \nHoward Baker and John Danforth. He did not appoint partisan people. \nThat will be the case here, in my view. It deserves an effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this. There will be a tabling motion. \nI am hopeful we will win. I am not all that confident because of what I \nhave been told privately by many colleagues: They agree with this, they \nthink I am right, but, once again, they just cannot support it at this \ntime.\n  When is the right time? When is the right hour when we can at least \nmake a difference and do something a bit courageous to at least sit \nback and see if we cannot come up with some better ideas. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment to \ncreate a Commission on Cuba. I do so with some personal reluctance \nbecause of my deep affection and respect for my colleague from \nConnecticut who is the sponsor of the amendment and who I know is \nacting with the best of intentions. We simply have come to a different \nconclusion on this question.\n  Some might say: What can be the harm of a commission to study Cuban-\nAmerican relations? I oppose the idea of a commission because I believe \nthe current state of America's policy toward Cuba is right.\n  It has been sustained now over four decades. It began and has \ncontinued as\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\na bipartisan policy which originates from Castro's Communist takeover \nof that country in 1959, and his attempts to spread communism to other \nparts of this hemisphere and to the world.\n  Although I think our policy has helped prevent Castro's communism \nfrom expanding to the Americas, thanks to the strong leadership of \nourselves and other countries, his regime continues to subject the \nCuban people to a form of government that deprives them of their basic \nand inalienable human rights. He is now one of the last of less than a \nhandful of old-style Communist leaders, and his regime's human rights \nrecord remains abysmal.\n  Throughout my years in the Senate, I have been a strong supporter of \nour policy toward Cuba, and I remain a strong supporter because I \nbelieve it is right. It is based on principle, and Castro has done \nnothing to justify a change in that policy. In fact, every time we give \nhim an opportunity to show he has changed, he refuses to take that \nopportunity.\n  I quote from the State Department's most recent Annual Human Rights \nReport for Cuba, issued in 1999:\n\n       Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by President Fidel \n     Castro. * * * The Government continued to control all \n     significant means of production and remained the predominant \n     employer. * * * The Government's human rights record remained \n     poor. It continued systematically to violate the civil and \n     political rights of its citizens. * * * The authorities \n     routinely continued to harass, threaten, arbitrarily arrest, \n     detain, imprison, and defame human rights advocates and \n     members of independent professional associations, including \n     journalists, economists, doctors, and lawyers, often with the \n     goal of coercing them into leaving the country. * * * The \n     Government denied citizens the freedom of speech, press, \n     assembly, and association. * * * The Government denied \n     political dissidents and human rights advocates due process \n     and subjected them to unfair trials.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this regime has done nothing to justify \na change in our policy toward it. For that reason, I will vote against \nthis amendment. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, although I will vote to table this \namendment, I would like to make it clear to my colleagues that I \nsupport the concept of establishment of a bipartisan commission to \nstudy U.S. policy towards Cuba.\n  For years, an often emotional and politically charged debate on our \nCuba policy has gone on here in the U.S. In such an atmosphere, it is \noften prudent to let a bipartisan commission take a careful look at our \npolicy, assess how well it has worked, and make recommendations for \nchange, if necessary. I think such a solution would be appropriate with \nrespect to our policy towards Cuba.\n  However, I am not convinced that this is the proper time and place to \ncreate such a commission. Indeed, under this amendment many of the \ncommissioners would be appointed by a lame-duck President, infringing \non the ability of the new President to develop his own Cuba policy.\n  It has become increasingly clear that the 39-year U.S. trade embargo \nhas not succeeded in effecting change in Cuba. Fidel Castro's regime \nremains in power, and the Cuban people continue to suffer under his \nbrutal dictatorship and a floundering economy. I believe a bipartisan \ncommission would be useful in taking a fresh look at the efficacy of \nour embargo. Now, however, is not the time to do this.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I will vote with against tabling \nSenator Dodd's amendment which creates a commission to evaluate United \nStates policy with respect to Cuba. Contrary to the opinion of some in \nthis Chamber, this amendment does not represent a seachange in our \ncountry's position toward Cuba or the Castro regime. The Castro regime \nremains totalitarian and profoundly anti-democratic. My contempt for \nCastro and his despotic rule over Cuba has not changed; I remain \ncommitted to spreading democracy to our island neighbor to the south. \nAs Chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I was a leading supporter of TV Marti and Radio Marti \nsince their inception. Just last year as ranking member of this \nsubcommittee, I fought a House attempt to ground TV Marti. I have \nsupported spreading democratic ideas to the Cuba people during my \nentire career in public policy. However, much to my display and \ndisappointment, our Cuba policy to this point has not yielded the \ndesired results. As I look for answers that explain why this policy has \nfailed, I believe creating a commission may provide the key to \nunderstanding. I want an expert panel to review our policy towards Cuba \nto search for the facts. Only then can we accurately determine what \npolicy changes, if any, should be pursued.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember the revolution in Cuba and the \noverthrow of the Batista regime. I remember it well. I also remember \nthe United States at the brink of nuclear war in October 1962. American \nU-2 planes spotted Russian ballistic missiles sites on Cuba and tested \nthe resolve of the young American President to respond to the threat. \nMany Americans, including this Senator, were hardwired to despise the \nCuban regime as a result of these two tumultuous events.\n  In the 1970s and 1980s the Cuban regime destabilized Central America \nwith inflammatory revolutionary rhetoric and aided socialist movements \nin the region. Cuban revolutionaries exported their vitriol to faraway \nBolivia and Angola in Africa. The national security risk posed to our \nshores by Castro during the Cold War was palpable and I challenge \nanyone who believes otherwise. The hardline policies that successive \nadministrations put in place to counter and neutralize the Castro \nregime were a necessary and appropriate response to that risk.\n  The political landscape is very different now. Just today I read \nabout our thawing of relations with North Korea. The Clinton \nadministration has formally eased ``wide-ranging sanctions'' imposed on \nNorth Korea nearly 50 years ago. This is something that I did not \nbelieve would happen for many years given the security concerns on the \npeninsula and the heavy presence of the United States military. This \naction is curious to me especially given our characterization of North \nKorea as a ``rogue'' state. It was reported in today's Washington Post \nthat Secretary Albright has replaced the ``rogue state'' designation \nwith the less confrontational term--``states of concern.'' Maybe this \nexplains our departure in policy toward North Korea. Regardless, we are \nengaging a country that has the capability to threaten the United \nStates in ways that Cuba will never be able to do.\n  My support for Senator Dodd's Cuba amendment is a vote for a \ncomprehensive review of U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba. This amendment \nis not flimflam election-year politicking. To the contrary, the \ncommission makes recommendations to the next President of the United \nStates and not the Clinton administration. The amendment provides for a \ncommission composed of a dozen experts from a wide range of \ndisciplines, half to be appointed by the President and half by the \nCongress. The commission will be bipartisan and should include \nheavyweights in American foreign policy--Henry Kissinger, George \nShultz, and Howard Baker, for example--to provide distinction to the \npolicy recommendations.\n  This panel would also make United States policy recommendations with \nrespect to the indemnification of losses incurred by U.S. certified \nclaimants with confiscated property in Cuba. Should we achieve the goal \nof political reform in Cuba, the United States government needs to \nprepare itself for the resulting confusion and complex legal questions. \nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The regime in Cuba has \nbeen constant for many years but nonetheless we should be ready for an \nabrupt internal political change in Cuba. To refuse to plan for a post-\nCastro Cuba, indeed the current endgame of American foreign policy \ntowards Cuba, is myopic. We need to be prepared for developments in \nCuba and this Commission is an important first step.\n  It has been argued that the United States is not on trial here, and \nthat the Castro government needs a public policy review. I do not take \nexception to this but rather believe that the commission should look at \nchanges for the Cuban government to adopt. As a Senator charged with \nmaking foreign policy for this country, I support this amendment \nbecause it provides our\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\nPresident with a road map of how to achieve its foreign policy goals \nwith respect to Cuba. The President can accept or refuse the \nrecommendations, whatever they may be. It would be the President's \nprerogative.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I rise in opposition to the Dodd amendment establishing a \ncommission to evaluate U.S.-Cuban relations.\n  Ordinarily, Mr. President, I find it difficult to rationalize \nopposing a study of a complex issue. I do not have such difficulties, \nhowever, with regards to the amendment before us today. Make no \nmistake, the commission proposed in the Dodd amendment is intended to \npresage a lifting of U.S. sanctions on Cuba, and to do so by presenting \na false dichotomy involving United States policies in other regions of \nthe world.\n  For 40 years, Fidel Castro has run Cuba as a totalitarian bastion in \nthe Western Hemisphere, his policies in Latin America and the Caribbean \nand on the African continent have been and continue to be implacably \nhostile to U.S. interests. He was driven in that direction, as some \nwould have us believe, by U.S. opposition to the revolution that he \ncontinues to seek to foster beyond his shores. Rather, he rose to power \ndedicated to undermining U.S. influence abroad and has never--not \nonce--deviated from that path. The fact that his ability to act abroad \nhas been severely curtailed since the demise of the Soviet Union has \nnot dampened his ardor for spreading the gospel of Marx and Lenin \nwherever he finds a receptive audience.\n  Virtually every day, we are provided reminders of the anachronistic \ndictatorship near our shores. Most recently, the case of two Cuban \ndoctors who defected in Zimbabwe--a country itself in the throes of \nturbulence stemming from its adherence to authoritarian policies--\nillustrates yet again the desire of the Cuban people for the freedom \nthat swept that country's former allies in Eastern Europe and across \nLatin America. A 1999 report by Human Rights Watch on Cuba described \nits development of ``a highly effective machinery of repression'' that \nit has used ``to restrict severely the exercise of fundamental human \nrights of expression, association, and assembly.'' The report \ncontinues, noting that, ``in recent years, Cuba has added new \nrepressive laws and continued prosecuting nonviolent dissidents while \nshrugging off international appeals for reform and placating visiting \ndignitaries with occasional releases of political prisoners.''\n  Similarly, the State Department's annual report on human rights \nstates that the\n\n       . . . authorities routinely continued to harass, threaten, \n     arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison, and defame human rights \n     advocates and members of independent professional \n     associations, including journalists, economists, doctors, and \n     lawyer, often with the goal of coercing them into leaving the \n     country.\n\n  Let me emphasize, Mr. President, that Cuba is not an authoritarian \nregime that holds promise of transitioning to a free-market economy \nwith gradual democratization, such as has occurred in other countries. \nIt remains a staunch Marxist dictatorship providing no freedom \nwhatsoever. Rare instances where minor economic freedoms were permitted \nwere rapidly retracted when it became obvious that capitalism provided \na viable and desirable alternative to state socialism.\n  On the security front, we should not be deceived by the straw man \nargument that the absence of a military threat to the United States \nfrom Cuba undermines the current U.S. policy towards that country. Few \namong us believe such a threat exists. What does exist, however, is a \ncontinued effort at undermining democracy in Latin America and in \nAfrica, and in undermining the U.S. position in those regions. Cuba's \ncontinued hosting of the Russian military's main signals intelligence \nfacility at Lourdes remains a threat to U.S. national and economic \nsecurity. According to the liberal Federation of American Scientists, \nthe strategic significance of the Lourdes facility ``has possibly grown \nsince 07 February 1996 [pursuant to a] directive from Russian President \nBoris Yeltsin directing the Russian intelligence community to step up \nthe acquisition of American and other Western economic and trade \nsecrets.''\n  Additionally, the United States must remain wary of the future of the \nSoviet-designed nuclear reactors at Cienfuegos. Any accident at these \nfacilities--understanding that they remain uncompleted--would directly \nand severely impact the eastern seaboard of the United States.\n  The political and security situations vis-a-vis Cuba can be \nsummarized by quoting directly from Secretary of Defense Cohen's May \n1998 letter to then-Chairman of the Armed Services Committee Strom \nThurmond:\n\n       While the assessment notes that the direct conventional \n     threat by the Cuban military has decreased, I remain \n     concerned about the use of Cuba as a base for intelligence \n     activities directed against the United States, the potential \n     threat that Cuba may pose to neighboring islands, Castro's \n     continued dictatorship that represses the Cuban people's \n     desire for political and economic freedom, and the potential \n     instability that could accompany the end of his regime \n     depending on the circumstances under which Castro departs . . \n     . Finally, I remain concerned about Cuba's potential to \n     develop and produce biological agents, its biotechnology \n     infrastructure, as well as the environmental health risks \n     posed to the United States by potential accidents at the \n     Juragua nuclear power facility.\n\n  Mr. President, I supported the establishment of diplomatic and trade \nrelations with Vietnam because that country met a set of carefully \nestablished criteria that brought it in our direction, and did not \nforce the United States to move in its direction. I would fully support \na similar approach to Cuba. We don't need a commission to study our \nrelations with Cuba; what we need is to establish a road map that the \nCastro regime must follow in order to facilitate a lifting of the \nsanctions it purports to find so odious. As with Saddam Hussein and Kim \nIl Sung, Castro has within his power the ability to fundamentally \ntransform his country for the better and to reintroduce it fully into \nthe community of nations. The ball is in Castro's court. Whether he \npossesses the wisdom to do what is right, unfortunately, is sadly \nunlikely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat on the expiration of the 2 minutes Senator Warner, the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, be allowed to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in closing, I want to \nrespond to a few remarks that have been made. The Sun-Sentinel, in an \narticle entitled ``Why Trade With Such A Deadbeat?'' says:\n\n       If the U.S. trade embargo is lifted and Castro gets fresh \n     U.S. lines of credit to buy American products that Castro \n     can't and won't repay, it will be the American taxpayer who \n     will then be stuck with the bottom line.\n\n  Our colleagues should be reminded of the fact we will extend credit, \nbut we will wind up paying for it because Castro will write off the \ndebt and will not bother taking the time and trouble to pay us back.\n  Also, the School of International Studies, University of Miami, \npoints out:\n\n       Without major internal reforms in Cuba, the Castro \n     Government and the military, not the Cuban people, will be \n     the main beneficiary of lifting of the embargo.\n\n  I respond to my colleague who made a point of saying Nixon went to \nChina in 1972. Look at China today: forced abortions and some of the \nworst human rights violations in the history of mankind. There is still \na regime in power that represses human rights worse than any regime in \nhistory.\n  Let's compare that to Ronald Reagan who stood up to the Soviet Union \nand said: This is the evil empire, and I will not back down in doing \nthe right thing, which is to keep the pressure on them until they fade \naway.\n  The differences in history are pretty obvious. It is not that \ndifficult to understand. Cuba was a small country when Fidel Castro \ntook power, and now 1.5 million people have left that country. We \nshould not be working at all to remove the embargo from that country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak on this issue for not to exceed about 6 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3267\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the situation is as follows: For close to \n2 or 3 years, I have been working with my good friend, Senator Dodd, on \na wide range of issues relating to Cuba. Senator Dodd and I have spent \na great deal of time studying and, indeed, traveling in relation to \nthis matter. It is our belief that we should, as a nation, remove those \nlegal impediments, to allow food and medicine to go into Cuba. We \nembarked on the effort to legislate, to have the Senate adopt measures \nto allow food and medicine to go into Cuba.\n  I remember one of our former distinguished colleagues, Malcolm \nWallop, brought into my office some American physicians who had \nundertaken to travel down to Cuba to see for themselves the plight of \nthese people who have been denied up-to-date, state-of-the-art medical \nequipment. Cuba has good doctors, but they have not the medical \nequipment nor the medicine. Anyway, those efforts failed.\n  In the course of the Elian Gonzalez case, it became apparent to me \nthat America--outside of Florida and elsewhere--began to wake up to the \nrelationship between the United States and Cuba and the inability, over \n40 years, to succeed in our goal to allow that nation to receive a \ngreater degree of democracy, trade, and other relationships.\n  So Senator Dodd and I have at the desk an amendment, the Warner-Dodd \namendment, calling for the appointment of the commission. It is \nessentially the same as the Dodd amendment that is up now.\n  But as a manager of this bill and, indeed, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, I have to decide my priorities. My priorities are \nthat this bill is in the interest of the security of this Nation; $300-\nplus billion providing all types of equipment for the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces--salary, medical care for retirees. The committee has \nworked on this bill for 6 months.\n  This issue of the commission to determine the future relationships \nbetween the United States and Cuba is not germane. I thought perhaps we \ncould discuss it, so I offered the amendment, and it is now the pending \nbusiness. But it is clear to me that this piece of legislation could \nbecome an impediment for this bill being passed.\n  I have no alternative but to say two things. One, I remain \nphilosophically attuned and in support of the Warner-Dodd amendment, \nwhich is at the desk. At some point in time, I hope to rejoin the \neffort, with others, to try to bring about some of the objectives in \nthe Warner-Dodd amendment. But it has to be withdrawn at this time in \norder for this bill to move forward and the Dodd amendment to be \nconsidered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3267, Withdrawn\n\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nWarner-Dodd amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment \nNo. 3267 is withdrawn.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation.\n  I see my colleague from Florida is here. I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a previous order.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Washington is recognized \nto offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I have some time under the UC agreement, I yield it to \nmy distinguished colleague from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3475\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I merely seek recognition to move to table \nthe Dodd amendment No. 3475, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. I understand that vote will take place at 3:15 p.m. among \nthree stacked votes, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are four stacked votes; that is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, consistent with what I said earlier, I \nwill have to support the motion to table so that this amendment is not \nan impediment to the passage of the bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business and that \nthe time not be counted against the time reserved for the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first thank my colleague from \nWashington for her courtesy in allowing me to speak for a few minutes \non a very important matter that is of great significance to parts of my \nState and other States, as well.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2755 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized to offer an amendment on which there will be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3252\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the restriction on the use of Department of Defense \n               facilities for privately funded abortions)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment at the desk, No. \n3252, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Jeffords, \n     and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 3252.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 270, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 743. RESTORATION OF PREVIOUS POLICY REGARDING \n                   RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   MEDICAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (b); and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``Restriction on Use of \n     Funds--''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors Senators Boxer, Mikulski, Schumer, Jeffords and Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today we are offering the Murray-Snowe amendment. It \nis an amendment which would lift restrictions on privately funded \nabortions at military facilities overseas.\n  This is the identical amendment we have offered every year since \n1995, and I assure my colleagues that we will continue to offer this \namendment until we restore this important health care protection for \nour women who are serving abroad.\n  It is simply outrageous that today we deny military personnel and \ntheir dependents access to safe, affordable, and legal reproductive \nhealth care services. We ask these women to serve their country and \ndefend our Government, but we deny them basic rights that are afforded \nall women in this country.\n  I come to the floor year after year during this DOD authorization in \nan effort to educate my colleagues in the hope of convincing a majority \nof them to stand up for all military personnel. I also offer this \namendment to highlight the record of those who do stand up for women \nand their right to a safe and legal abortion at their own cost.\n  To be clear, this is not about Federal funding of abortion. Many of \nour military personnel serve in hostile areas or in countries that do \nnot provide safe and legal abortion services. Military personnel and \ntheir families who serve us overseas should not be forced to seek back \nalley abortions or abortions in facilities that do not meet the same \nclinical standards we expect and demand in this country. Sadly, that is \nexactly the case today.\n  Protecting all military personnel and their dependents has always \nbeen a priority of the Department of Defense, which is why the \nSecretary of Defense supports the amendment Senator Snowe and I are \noffering today. This\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\namendment is also supported by the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists because they recognize the danger that these women \nface outside this country.\n\n  Some Members will undoubtedly argue that women are afforded access to \na legal and safe abortion with the current restriction in place. They \nwill point out that under the current policy, a woman who needs an \nabortion can request transportation back to the United States for \ntreatment. It is true that she can request a temporary leave from her \ncommanding officer and will be transported at the expense of our \nmilitary to a location where she would have access to an abortion. To \nme, that is unacceptable. It forces a woman to provide detailed medical \nevidence and records to her superior officer with no guarantee or \nprotection that this information will be kept confidential. Then once \nshe gets the commanding officer's permission, she needs to find \ntransportation home, often on a military plane, such as a C-17.\n  I don't know of any other medical procedure that requires a soldier \nto have to endure such public scrutiny. If there are Members who \nbelieve that these women are protected and have access to a basic right \nthat is guaranteed by our Constitution to a safe and legal abortion, I \nwill tell my colleagues this is not the case. Do not be fooled. The \ncurrent ban on privately funded abortions at military facilities \noverseas places the women who serve our country in great danger.\n  This amendment is not about Federal funding of abortions. This \namendment does not require direct Federal procurement for abortion \nservices. This amendment would, in fact, require the woman, not the \ntaxpayer, to pay the cost of her care at a military facility. This \namendment would simply allow the woman to use existing facilities that \nare currently operational to provide health care to our active duty \npersonnel and their families.\n  This amendment does not call for providing any additional services. \nIt is simply services that are already available. These clinics and \nhospitals are already functioning and providing care. There would be no \nadded burden. For those who are concerned about Federal tax dollars \nbeing used to provide abortion services, I point out that the current \npractice results in more direct expenditures of Federal funds than \nsimply allowing a woman to pay for the cost of abortion-related \nservices at a military facility. Current policy requires transportation \ncosts that in some cases could be far more expensive than a privately \nfunded abortion.\n  I also point out that there is a direct, positive impact on our \nmilitary readiness when a woman is forced to take extended leave to \ntravel for an abortion.\n  As we all know, women are no longer simply support staff in the \nmilitary. Women command troops and are in key military readiness \npositions. Their contributions are beyond dispute. While women serve \nside by side with their male counterparts, they are subjected to an \narchaic and seemingly mean-spirited health care restriction. Women in \nour military deserve more respect and better treatment.\n  I think it is also important to remind my colleagues that this \namendment will not change the current conscience clause for medical \npersonnel. Health care professionals who object to providing safe and \nlegal health services to women could still refuse to perform an \nabortion. No one in the military would be forced to perform any \nprocedures that he or she objected to as a matter of conscience.\n  The current policy places our women at risk. Because the current \npolicy is so cumbersome, women could be forced to undergo an abortion \nlater in their pregnancy when risks and complications increase. They \ncan, of course, try to obtain safe and legal abortion services in the \nhost country in which they are serving--if there are no language or \ncultural barriers that hinder their access.\n  We should not tolerate situations that are occurring, such as what \noccurred to a woman serving our country in Japan. Because of our \ncurrent policy, she was denied access to abortion services at the \nmilitary facility, even at her own expense, and she was forced to go \noff base to secure a safe and legal abortion. She had no escort and no \nhelp from the military as she went to a foreign facility. She didn't \nunderstand the medical questions or the instructions, and she was \nterrified. I have her letter, and I will read it into the Record later. \nOur Government should never have forced her, as she was serving us \noverseas, into that circumstance.\n  Regardless of what some of my colleagues may think about the \nconstitutional ruling guaranteeing a woman the right to a safe abortion \nwithout unnecessary burdens or obstacles, this is the law of the land. \nWhile some may oppose this right to choose, the Supreme Court and a \nmajority of Americans support this right. It is the law of the land. \nHowever, active duty servicewomen stationed overseas surrender this \nright when they make the decision to volunteer to defend all of us. It \nis sadly ironic that we send them overseas to protect our rights; yet \nin the process we rob them of vital constitutional protections.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murray-Snowe amendment. Please \nallow women in the military the right to make their own health care \nchoices without being forced to violate privacy and jeopardize their \nhealth and their careers. This is and must remain a personal decision. \nWomen should not be subject to the approval or disapproval of their \ncoworkers.\n  I stress this is not about Federal funding of abortions. This is \nabout protecting women serving overseas and providing privately funded, \nsafe, and legal abortions. I urge my colleagues to support our women in \nuniform by restoring their right to choose.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Personnel \nSubcommittee on Armed Services, I rise in strong opposition to the \nMurray amendment which allows abortion on demand in military facilities \noverseas.\n  I oppose the pending amendment because, No. 1, it is unnecessary. It \nis a solution in search of a problem. No. 2, it violates the letter and \nspirit of existing Federal law; that is, the Hyde amendment which \nprohibits Federal funding of abortion. In fact, that is the issue \ninvolved in this amendment. It is a subsidizing of the abortion \nprocedure. Third, if it were adopted, it would likely accomplish very \nlittle while providing a Federal endorsement of the practice that is \nopposed by tens of millions of Americans.\n  My colleagues contend that the Murray amendment is a banner of \nconstitutional rights. I think that argument is disingenuous. The \ncurrent statute does not preclude servicewomen, serving overseas, from \nobtaining abortions. Women serving overseas already have the \nopportunity to terminate their pregnancy because the Department of \nDefense will provide them transportation either to the United States or \nto another country where abortion is legal for only $10. That is the \ncost of the food on the flight.\n  To say there is a constitutional right that is abrogated is \nincorrect. In 1979, the Congress adopted what has come to be known as \nthe Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment has been upheld by the U.S. \nSupreme Court as constitutional. It prohibits the use of Federal funds \nfor performing abortions. The Hyde amendment has broad support in the \nCongress, and in fact it has broad support by Americans in general.\n  I know my colleagues claim that Federal funds would not be used in \nthese abortions, that women would pay for their own abortions, \nostensibly by reimbursing the hospital, although that raises a host of \nquestions that I hope we have time to pose for Senator Murray. But they \ncan't possibly reimburse the hospital for the total cost of the \nabortion because the military hospital is 100-percent taxpayer funded. \nThe building itself is built with taxpayer funds.\n  Do we intend, under the Murray amendment, to allocate a portion of \nthe cost of the building of that hospital's facilities to the \nservicewoman seeking an abortion? The beds, the utilities, the salaries \nof those performing the procedure, these costs come out of the pockets \nof taxpayers, millions of whom believe abortion is a reprehensible \npractice.\n  Abortion should not be a fringe benefit to military service. We can't \navoid the fact that adoption of the Murray amendment would be clearly \ninconsistent with the current U.S. statute\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nprohibiting the current funding of abortion. It not only departs from \nthe letter of the Hyde amendment; it departs from the spirit of the \nHyde amendment intended to protect the American taxpayer who has a \nconviction against the practice of abortion from being forced to \nsubsidize and pay for the abortion procedure.\n  My colleagues contend that this is simply a matter of choice. Let's \ntalk about choice for a moment. What about the choice of people who \nbelieve that abortion is inimical to their dearest values? What about \nthe choice of taxpayers who don't want to subsidize the termination of \nlife?\n  I find it significant that during 1993, when President Clinton \nliberalized the practice of abortion in military hospitals, killing of \nthe unborn in military hospitals, every single military physician and \nnearly every military nurse refused to volunteer to perform such \nprocedures. The President issued his executive memorandum permitting \nabortion on demand at military hospitals on January 22, 1993--\nironically, the 20th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. The fact that no \ndoctors and almost no nurses volunteered to perform this procedure I \nthink indicates that such a scenario would likely repeat itself if the \nMurray amendment were adopted.\n\n  Since military health care professionals cannot be forced to perform \nsuch a procedure against their conscience, as Senator Murray has said, \nthe military will then be forced into a position of having to contract \nout the performance of such procedures to a civilian physician, which \nwould in itself violate the Hyde amendment by requiring the expenditure \nof taxpayers' funds to pay for that contracted physician.\n  Having to hire abortionists at U.S. military hospitals puts the U.S. \nmilitary in the abortion business. I find that appalling, something \nthat is not supported by the American people. It is not supported by \npeople on either side of the choice issue, whether pro-choice or pro-\nlife. They do not believe we ought to be expending American taxpayers' \ndollars in subsidizing abortion.\n  This amendment, whether it is intended or not, would have that \nresult--from the fact that we cannot totally allocate those costs, we \nare using a military hospital building built by taxpayers' dollars, \nusing doctors whose salaries are paid by taxpayers, using equipment, \nusing support staff--of all being paid for by the taxpayer. There is no \nconceivable way to calculate what that person should pay to reimburse \nthe Government. The result is that the taxpayers are going to be \nsubsidizing the practice. If in fact doctors in the military react the \nway they did in 1993, when the President, by executive memorandum, \nissued the order that we were going to provide abortion on demand in \nmilitary hospitals, if they react the same way, we would then be in the \nposition of having to go into the civilian sector, contract with \ndoctors who are willing to perform abortions, and pay them with \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars--clearly, and explicitly, in violation of \nthe Hyde amendment.\n\n  I find this whole debate to be an exercise in irony. The purpose of \nour Armed Forces is to defend and protect American lives. We should not \nthen subvert this noble goal by using the military to terminate the \nlives of the innocent among us.\n  What the Murray amendment would do, in the opinion of this Senator, \nis to create a kind of legal myth: We are not subsidizing abortions, \nbut we really are. We are saying we are not but in fact we know we are. \nLet's pretend we are not subsidizing abortions. We know they are in \nmilitary hospitals performed by military doctors paid by American \ntaxpayers. We know it is supported by taxes paid by American taxpayers. \nWe know the equipment used is bought and paid for by American \ntaxpayers. But we are not really subsidizing it. That is a legal myth \nand it simply does not measure up.\n  There is a concept called the slippery slope. I suggest allowing \nabortions to be performed in U.S. military hospitals overseas is just \none little more slide down that slippery slope.\n  I ask a letter from Edwin F. O'Brien, the Archbishop for the Military \nServices, dated June 19, 2000, in opposition to the Murray amendment, \nbe printed in the Record, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Archdiocese for the\n\n\n                                       Military Services, USA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: As one concerned with the moral well being of \n     our Armed Services I write in regards to the FY 2001 National \n     Defense Authorization Act, S. 2549.\n       Please oppose an amendment by Sen. Patty Murray that would \n     pressure military physicians, nurses and associated medical \n     personnel to perform all elective abortions. This amendment \n     would compel taxpayer funded military hospitals and personnel \n     to provide elective abortions and seeks to equate abortion \n     with ordinary health care.\n       The life-destroying act of abortion is radically different \n     from other medical procedures. Military medical personnel \n     themselves have refused to take part of this procedure or \n     even to work where it takes place. Military hospitals have an \n     outstanding record of saving life, even in the most \n     challenging times and conditions.\n       Please do not place this very heavy burden upon our \n     wonderful men and women of America's Armed Services and \n     please oppose any other amendments that would weaken the \n     current law regarding funding of abortion for military \n     personnel.\n       Thank you for your kind consideration of this message.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Edwin F. O'Brien,      \n                             Archbishop for the Military Services.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the \nMurray amendment. Under current law, performing abortions at military \nmedical facilities is banned, except for cases where the mother's life \nis in jeopardy or in the case of rape or incest. So what this amendment \nwould do is strike this provision from the law, thereby, in my view, \nturning military medical treatment centers into abortion clinics. I \nthink we have to think hard about that, whether or not that is really \nthe purpose of military medical treatment centers because that is the \nbottom line. That is what this would do.\n  The House recently rejected a similar amendment by a vote of 221-195. \nIt was offered by Representative Loretta Sanchez of California. A \nnumber of pro-life Democrats joined with Republican colleagues to \ndefeat this amendment.\n  In 1995, the House voted three times to keep abortion on demand out \nof military medical facilities before the pro-life provision was \nfinally enacted into law. Over and over again in Congress, we had \nvotes. Last year, I think it was 51-49. It was very close. I will not \nbe surprised to see the Vice President step into the Chamber, \nanticipating a possible tie vote, because this administration is the \nmost abortion-oriented administration in American history. I think we \ncan be treated, probably, to that little scenario as well. I think that \nshows a stark difference between the two candidates for President of \nthe United States, I might add.\n  When the 1993 policy permitting abortions in military facilities was \npromulgated, many military physicians as well as many nurses and \nsupporting personnel refused to perform or assist in these abortions. \nIn response, the administration sought to supplement staff with \ncontract personnel to provide alternative means to provide abortion \naccess.\n  This is a very sensitive situation. You may have a military nurse or \nperson who is a member of the military who works at that hospital who \nmay be opposed to abortions, does not want to perform them. So when \nthat happens, the President now has asked that we get contract \npersonnel to come in because people opposed to this on a moral basis, \nbecause of conscience, refuse to perform them. That is basically the \nway it is in American society today.\n  The dirty little secret about the abortion industry is the doctors \nwho perform them are not really considered to be the top of their \nprofession. In fact, it is usually the dregs who are performing the \nabortions, not the good doctors. So if this amendment were to be \nadopted, not only would taxpayer-funded facilities be used to support \nabortion on demand, but resources, Government resources, would be used \nto search for, hire, and transport new personnel simply so abortions \ncould be performed on demand.\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\n  It would be nice if we could spend a little time debating the defense \nbudget on the Defense bill. I sat through 2 hours of one nongermane \namendment a while ago on Cuba sanctions, now abortions on demand, where \nwe are talking about bringing all kinds of new people, a new \nbureaucracy, if you will, who are to hire, transport, search for \npersonnel to perform abortions because people of conscience in the \nmilitary do not want to perform them, so we, therefore, have to replace \nthem.\n  As the Congressional Research Service confirms, a 1994 memorandum \nfrom the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs directed the \nMilitary Health Services System:\n\n       . . . to provide other means of access if providing prepaid \n     abortion services at a facility was not feasible.\n\n  This is absolutely wrong. It is wrong morally, No. 1. But it is also \na waste of precious military resources, which are so much needed today. \nBy the way, because of this amendment and other nongermane amendments, \nwe are holding up the passage of this bill, which includes a pay raise \nfor our military that this President has sent all over the world time \nand time again. So this is an unnecessary amendment. The DOD has not \nbeen made aware of a single problem arising as a result of this policy.\n  American taxpayers should not be required to pay for abortions. In \n1979, the Hyde amendment was passed to prohibit the use of taxpayer \nmoneys to fund abortions. In Harris v. McCray, the U.S. Supreme Court \nheld the right to an abortion does not include the right to have the \ntaxpayer moneys pay for it. It is DOD policy to obey the laws of the \nnations in which bases are located. Thus, even if the Murray amendment \nis adopted, abortions will still not be available on all military \nbases. Spain and Korea prohibit abortion, for example.\n  The ban is not intended to and does not block female military \npersonnel from receiving an abortion. As the Senator from Arkansas has \npointed out, DOD has a number of elective procedures for which it \ncurrently does not pay. As the Senator said, any woman can fly on a \nmilitary aircraft for $10 on a space-available basis to have an \nabortion somewhere else, unfortunately.\n  In other words, the woman could still get an abortion if she wanted \none, again, unfortunately. In fact, many women often travel back to the \nU.S. to receive their abortions. The question is, Should we pay for it \nat the hospital? That is the question. Should we hire more people, more \nsupport people just for the purpose of performing abortions in these \nmilitary hospitals? I say the answer to that is no.\n  Some would argue the woman would be inconvenienced, that she would \nhave to have her leave approved, she would have to get her \ntransportation. But she could still get her abortion. I am not sorry, \nfrankly, that someone has to be inconvenienced for having an abortion. \nFrankly, I wish somebody would give them the time and counsel to \ndiscuss this issue so they could fully realize what they are doing, \ntaking the life of an unborn child who has no voice, who has no \nopportunity to say anything. I wish we would have that opportunity to \nprovide that woman that kind of counseling so she would not do it and \nregret that decision for the rest of her life. Abortion should never be \nconvenient because when a woman chooses an abortion, she is choosing to \nkill her baby. It is not a fetus, it is a baby. It is an unborn child. \nHer baby never had a choice.\n  Military treatment centers, which are dedicated to healing and \nnurturing life--healing and nurturing life--should not be taking the \nlives of unborn children. Also, these hospitals treat the combat \nwounded in war. Those who are hurt are treated. There have been so many \nhospitals throughout the years that have been so outstanding in their \ntreatment, saving so many lives. The great attributes they have \nreceived for doing that should not now become a part of this abortion \ndebate and be involved in killing innocent children, that some of the \npeople who were treated in those hospitals, if not all, fought so they \ncould be free, so those children could be born in freedom. Those people \nwho were wounded and treated in those hospitals did not do it to take \ninnocent lives. They did it to allow those innocent lives to be born \ninto freedom.\n\n  That is the bitter irony of all this: the taking of the most innocent \nhuman life, a child in the womb, taking place in a hospital that \ntreated those who fought to allow that child to be born into freedom.\n  What a dramatic irony that is. The bottom line is it is immoral to \nmake hard-working taxpayers in America pay for abortions at military \nhospitals, and it is immoral to perform those abortions. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on the Murray amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my colleague and cosponsor, Senator \nSnowe, is present in the Chamber. I will yield her time in just a \nmoment.\n  I point out a woman's health care decision to have or not have an \nabortion should be with herself, her family, her doctor, and her \nreligion. That is not the case in the military today. When a woman has \nto go to her commanding officer and request permission to fly home on a \nmilitary transport, she no longer has the ability to make that decision \non her own. It becomes a very public decision.\n  This amendment simply gives back her privacy and allows her to pay \nfor at her own expense a health care procedure in a military hospital \nwhere she is safe and taken care of.\n  I am delighted my cosponsor, Senator Snowe, is here, and I yield her \nas much time as she needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for, \nonce again, assuming the leadership on this most important issue.\n  I rise today as a cosponsor of the Murray amendment to repeal the ban \non privately-funded abortions at overseas military hospitals.\n  Last year, when I spoke on this amendment, I said that ``standing \nhere I have the feeling of `Deja vu all over again.' '' I have that \nsame sentiment today--and this year I can add that ``the more things \nchange, the more they remain the same.'' For in the last year we have \ndeployed more women overseas--6,000 more women than there were just a \nyear ago.\n  And yet here we are, once again, having to argue a case that \nbasically boils down to providing women who are serving their country \noverseas with the full range of constitutional rights, options, and \nchoices that would be afforded them as American citizens on American \nsoil.\n  In 1973, 27 years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed for the first time \nwomen's right to choose. This landmark decision was carefully crafted \nto be both balanced and responsible while holding the rights of women \nin America paramount in reproductive decisions. But this same right is \nnot afforded to female members of our armed services or to female \ndependents who happen to be stationed overseas.\n  Current law prohibits abortions to be performed in domestic or \ninternational military treatment facilities except in cases of rape, \nincest, or if the life of the pregnant woman is endangered. The \nDepartment of Defense will only pay for the abortion when the life of \nthe pregnant woman is endangered--in cases of rape or incest, the woman \nmust pay for her own abortion. In no other instance is a woman \npermitted to have an abortion in a military facility.\n  The Murray-Snowe amendment would overturn the ban on privately funded \nabortions in overseas military treatment facilities and ensure that \nwomen and military dependents stationed overseas would have access to \nsafe health care. Overturning this ban on privately-funded abortions \nwill not result in federal funds being used to perform abortion at \nmilitary hospitals.\n  The fact is that Federal law already states that Federal funding \ncannot be used to perform abortions. Federal law has banned the use of \nFederal funds for this purpose since 1979. But to say that our service \nwomen and the wives and daughters of our servicemen cannot use their \nown money to obtain an abortion at a military hospital overseas defies \nlogic.\n  Every year opponents of the Murray-Snowe amendment argue that \nchanging current law means that military personnel and military \nfacilities will be\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\ncharged with performing abortions--and that this, in turn, means that \nAmerican taxpayer funds will be used to subsidize abortion. This \nseemingly logical segue is absolutely and fundamentally incorrect.\n  Every hospital that performs a surgery--every physician that performs \na procedure upon a patient--must figure out the cost of that procedure. \nThis includes not only the time involved, but the materials, the \noverhead, the liability insurance. This is the fundamental and basic \nprinciple of covering one's costs.\n  I have faith that the Department of Defense will not do otherwise. \nThis is the idea behind a privately-funded abortion--a woman's private \nfunds, her own money pays for the procedure. But she has the \nopportunity to have this medical procedure--a medical procedure that is \nconstitutionally guaranteed--in an American facility, performed by an \nAmerican physician, and tended to by American nurses.\n  During last year's debate, opponents of repealing the current ban \nclaimed that American taxpayers would be subsidizing the purchase of \nequipment for abortions, and would be training doctors to perform \nprivately-funded abortions. This false argument effectively overlooks \nthe fact that the Department of Defense has already invested in the \nequipment and training necessary because current law already provides \naccess in cases of life of the mother, rape, or incest.\n  But the economic cost of this ban is not the only cost at issue here. \nWhat about the impact on a woman's health? A woman who is stationed \noverseas can be forced to delay the procedure for several weeks until \nshe can travel to the United States or another overseas location in \norder to obtain the abortion. Every week that a woman delays an \nabortion increases the risk of the procedure.\n  The current law banning privately-funded abortions puts the health of \nthese women at risk. They will be forced to seek out unsafe medical \ncare in countries where the blood supply is not safe, where their \nprocedures are antiquated, where their equipment may not be sterile. I \ndo not believe it is right, on top of all the other sacrifices our \nmilitary personnel are asked to make, to add unsafe medical care to the \nlist.\n  I believe that a decision as fundamentally personal as whether or not \nto continue one's pregnancy only needs to be discussed between a woman, \nher family, and her physician. But yet, as current law stands, a woman \nwho is facing the tragic decision of whether or not to have an abortion \nfaces involving not just her family and her physician, but her--or her \nhusband's--commanding officer, duty officer, miscellaneous \ntransportation personnel, and any number of other persons who are \ntotally and completely unrelated to her or her decision. Now she faces \nboth the stress and grief of her decision--but she faces the judgment \nand willingness of many others who are totally and wholly unconnected \nto her personal and private situation.\n  Imagine having made the difficult decision to have an abortion and \nthen being told that you have to return to the United States or go to a \nhospital that may or may not be clean and sanitary. That is the effect \nof current policy--if you have the money, if you leave your family, if \nyou leave your support system, and come back here. Otherwise, your full \nrange of choices consists of paying from your own money and taking your \nchances at some questionable hospital that may or may not be okay.\n  This of course, is only if the country you are stationed in has legal \nabortion. Otherwise you have no option. You have no access to your \nconstitutionally protected right of abortion.\n  What is the freedom to choose? It is the freedom to make a decision \nwithout unnecessary government interference. Denying a woman the best \navailable resources for her health care simply is not right. Current \nlaw does not provide a woman and her family the ability to make a \nchoice. It gives the woman and her family no freedom of choice. It \nmakes the choice for her.\n  In the year 2000, in the United States of America it is a fact that a \nwoman's right to an abortion is the law of the land. The Supreme Court \nhas spoken on that issue, and you can look it up. Denying women the \nright to a safe abortion because you disagree with the Supreme Court is \nwrong, but that is what current law does.\n  Military personnel stationed overseas still vote, still pay taxes, \nand are protected and punished under U.S. law. They protect the rights \nand ideals that this country stands for. Whether we agree with abortion \nor not, we all understand that safe and legal access to abortion is the \nlaw of the land. But the current ban on privately-funded abortions \ntakes away the fundamental right of personal choice from American women \nstationed overseas. And I don't believe these women should be treated \nas second class citizens.\n  It never occurred to me that women's constitutional rights were \nterritorial. It never occurred to me that when American women in our \narmed forces get their visas and passports stamped when they go \nabroad--that they are required to leave their fundamental, \nconstitutional rights at the proverbial door. It never occurred to me \nthat in order to find out what freedoms you have as an American, you \nhad to check the time-zone you were in.\n  The United States willingly sends our service men and women into \nharms way--yet Congress takes it upon itself to deny 14 percent of our \nArmed Forces personnel--33,000 of whom are stationed overseas--the \nbasic right to safe medical care. And we deny the basic right to safe \nmedical care to more than 200,000 military dependents who are stationed \noverseas as well.\n  How can we do this to our service men and women and their families? \nIt seems to me that they already sacrifice a great deal to serve their \ncountry without asking them to take unnecessary risks with their health \nas well. We should not ask our military personnel to leave their basic \nrights at the shoreline when we send them overseas.\n  I believe we owe our men and women in uniform and their families the \noption to receive the medical care they need in a safe environment. \nThey do not deserve anything less. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Murray-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5410-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are now under controlled time. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 43 minutes \nremaining, and the opposition has 42 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the issue we will be \ndebating for the next 90 minutes. Basically, today a woman who serves \nin the military overseas at a facility, if she so desires to have an \nabortion--and it is her choice; it is her personal choice between \nherself and her family and her doctor and her religion--has to go to \nher commanding officer to ask for permission to come home to the United \nStates to have a safe and legal abortion. Then she has to wait for \nmilitary transport. She has to pay $10, as the opponents told us this \nmorning, for food on that military transport, and come home in order to \nhave a safe and legal abortion.\n  The pending amendment simply allows women who serve in our military \noverseas today to pay for their own medical choice decisions in a \nmilitary hospital where it is safe and is a place where they can be \nassured they will be taken care of, as we should expect we would take \ncare of all people who serve us in the military.\n  I have heard our opponents speak this morning on this amendment and \nsay it is unnecessary. I have a letter\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\nfrom a woman who served in our military services. I would like to share \nit with my colleagues who think it is unnecessary:\n\n       Dear Senator: My name is Jessica, and I am a college \n     student in Arizona. I am writing you regarding an experience \n     I had as a member of the Air Force while stationed in Yokota \n     Air Base, Japan.\n       Two years ago, as a young single woman, I found out I was \n     pregnant. I knew I couldn't talk to my immediate supervisor \n     because he was a Catholic priest. You see, my job in the \n     armed services was ``Chaplain's Assistant.'' So instead, I \n     went to the next level in my chain of command. In return for \n     requesting time off, I was verbally reprimanded and told that \n     I had sinned in the eyes of God and was going to hell if I \n     didn't repent immediately.\n       The next day, I made an appointment with a doctor on base \n     and told him I was pregnant and wanted an abortion. The \n     doctor whispered that I was to walk very quietly to the front \n     desk where the information would be waiting for me. The \n     information was scribbled on a single sheet of paper with \n     hand-drawn maps on it to three hospitals that would perform \n     abortions.\n       When I arrived at the hospital, I was sent into a cubicle. \n     None of the nurses spoke English, so I had no way of giving \n     them my medical history. I had no Japanese friends to \n     translate, and the Air Force would not provide any \n     assistance. My first doctor did not speak English either, so \n     I had no idea what the doctor did, or what medication he gave \n     me. I was completely alone.\n       I will never forget the humiliation I felt. I couldn't \n     speak the language, I was turned away by my American doctors \n     on base whose hands were tied. The doctors on base weren't \n     even allowed to give me information regarding this medical \n     procedure. Although I served in the military, I was given no \n     translators, no explanations, no transportation, and no help \n     for a legal medical procedure.\n       I have never heard of any male soldiers being treated like \n     this. In fact, I don't know of any medical treatments that \n     male soldiers are denied. Perhaps the military recruiters \n     should warn females before they enlist that the United States \n     will discriminate against them due to their gender.\n\n  This letter is compelling. It says that a woman who is serving her \ncountry overseas, who is fighting for our rights, is basically denied \nhealth care services of her choice that she would be given in this \ncountry if she opted not to serve in the military.\n  I appeal to my colleagues to please make sure that the women who \nserve us overseas are given the same rights as the women who live in \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will respond to a number of things \nmy colleague from Washington said.\n  While I do not know the specifics or the circumstances of the \nsituation to which she made reference, I know it is a bad practice when \nwe try to legislate by anecdote. I do know this as well, that much of \nthe debate is centered around whether or not a woman's rights can be \nprotected under current DOD policy. The insinuation has been that \nservicewomen experience a lack of support from their chain of command \nwhen requesting leave in order to obtain an abortion. That was the \ncircumstance in the situation to which Senator Murray just made \nreference.\n  Such an argument impugns the professionalism of the officer corps. \nThere are procedures in place and there are rights by which men and \nwomen in uniform can be protected. If, in fact, their rights are being \ndisregarded by a commanding officer, there are means under current law \nby which those rights can be vindicated and the wrong righted.\n  I have great confidence in the professionalism of our officer corps. \nI fully expect any commanding officer to approve a service member's \nleave when properly requested, whatever the motivation for that \nrequest. If that is not done, then there should be a grievance filed, \nand I would stand in support of such an individual's right to make that \nrequest on a space-available basis. I believe the professional officer \ncorps that we have is going to respond and treat that servicewoman \nproperly and give her the rights she has under the law.\n  The other point I would make to those who would impugn the \nprofessionalism of our officer corps is that the commanding officer \ntoday may just likely be a woman. That woman seeking permission to \nreceive approved leave for an abortion under current policy may just as \nwell find they are dealing with a commanding officer who is in fact \nfemale.\n  At this time, I would like to yield 5 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague from the State of Kansas, Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Arkansas \nfor leading this debate against this amendment. I rise in opposition to \nthe Murray amendment.\n  On February 10, 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1996 was signed into law by President Clinton with a \nprovision to prevent DOD medical treatment facilities from being used \nto perform abortions except where the life of the mother is endangered \nor in cases of rape or incest. That is the public law.\n  This provision reversed a Clinton administration policy instituted on \nJanuary 22, 1993, permitting abortions to be performed at military \nfacilities. Previously, from 1988 to 1993, the performance of abortions \nwas not permitted at military hospitals except when the life of the \nmother was in danger.\n  That is a bit of the history around this issue.\n  The Murray amendment which would repeal the pro-life provision \nattempts to turn taxpayer-funded DOD medical treatment facilities into \nabortion clinics. Fortunately, the Senate refused to let the issue of \nabortion adversely affect our armed services and rejected this \namendment last year by a vote of 51-49, and we should reject it again \nthis year.\n  It is shameful that we would hold America's armed services hostage to \nabortion policies. Using the coercive power of government to force \nAmerican taxpayers--American taxpayers, that is who we are talking \nabout here--to fund health care facilities where abortions are \nperformed would be a horrible precedent and would put many Americans in \na difficult position--using my taxpayer money to fund abortions.\n  When the 1993 policy permitting abortions in military facilities was \nfirst promulgated, military physicians as well as nurses and support \npersonnel refused to perform or assist in elective abortions. In \nresponse, the administration sought to hire civilians to do abortions.\n  Therefore, if the Murray amendment were adopted, not only would \ntaxpayer-funded facilities be used to support abortion on demand but \nresources would be used to search for, hire, and transport new \npersonnel simply so abortions could be performed.\n  In fact, according to CRS, a 1994 memorandum from the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Health Affairs says this:\n\n       Direct[ed] the Military Health Services System provide \n     other means of access if providing prepaid abortion services \n     at a facility was not feasible.\n\n  One argument used by supporters of abortion in military hospitals is \nthat women in countries where abortion is not permitted will have \nnowhere else to turn to obtain an abortion. However, DOD policy \nrequires military doctors to obey the abortion laws of the countries \nwhere they are providing services, so they still could not perform \nabortions in those locations. Military treatment centers which are \ndedicated to healing and nurturing life--healing and nurturing life, \nthat is what this is about; in other words, what we should be about--\nshould not be forced to facilitate the taking of the most innocent of \nall human life, that of the unborn.\n  As I speak of this, I ask forgiveness for our country, for the \nNation, for the killing of this most innocent of life, the unborn.\n  I urge my colleagues to table the Murray amendment and free America's \nmilitary from abortion politics and from performing these abortions at \ntaxpayer-funded facilities. If passed, this amendment will effectively \nkill the DOD authorization bill, and on that ground as well, I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment.\n  I think we must get down to the very basics on this, as happens so \noften when it comes to these sorts of issues, and that is: Should we \nuse taxpayer-funded facilities to perform abortions, making them \nabortion clinics? Is that something our citizens would want us to do, \nwhether they were pro-life or pro-choice? I think the vast majority \nwould say, no, we don't want it to take place in our facilities and \nthis is a bad precedent for us to set.\n  I thank my colleague from Arkansas for leading this difficult and \nvery important debate.\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\n  I yield back the time reserved for our side on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I start by asking the sponsor of this amendment, Senator Murray, of \nWashington, just a few questions so we can clarify what we are talking \nabout.\n  Is it my understanding that the Senator's amendment is offering to \nwomen who are serving in the military the same constitutional right \navailable to every woman in America?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Secondly, is it my understanding that if a woman in the \nmilitary wants to seek an abortion, the Senator's amendment says it \nwould have to be at her cost completely, not at any cost to the Federal \nGovernment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is right. Under this amendment, the woman would \nhave to pay for the services in the military hospital on her own.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Third, does the Senator's amendment require every \nmilitary hospital and every doctor in those hospitals to involve \nthemselves in abortion procedures if it violates their own personal \nconscience or religious belief?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I say to the Senator from Illinois, there is a \nconscience clause that allows any doctor to be excused from the \nprocedure based on religion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  I wanted to make those points clear. We are talking about a \nconstitutional right which every woman in America enjoys, her right to \ncontrol her reproductive health.\n  Make no mistake; it is a controversial right. There are people on \nthis floor who do not believe the Supreme Court was right in \nestablishing that, within the right of privacy, every woman should make \nthat decision with her doctor and her conscience. These are people who \noppose abortion either completely or want to limit it to certain \ncircumstances.\n  What we are talking about here is whether or not a young woman who \ntakes an oath to defend the United States of America and becomes part \nof our military service is going to give up her constitutional right to \ncontrol her own reproductive health. That is the bottom line.\n  What Senator Murray is trying to say is, why would we treat women who \nvolunteer to serve in the military as second class citizens? Why would \nwe deny to daughters and sisters and mothers and wives who serve in the \nmilitary the same constitutional right which every woman in America \nenjoys?\n  Those who oppose this amendment say women in the military should be \ntreated as second class citizens; they should not have the same \nconstitutional rights as any other woman in America.\n  Second, the question about whether the Government is paying for the \nabortion is always a controversial question. Some people who in \nconscience oppose abortion say: I don't want a penny of my taxes to be \nspent on abortion services. Senator Murray addresses this directly and \nsays that any abortion procedure has to be paid for by the woman in \nuniform. She is paying for it out of her pocket. It isn't a matter of \nthe Government paying for it. Should a woman choose an abortion \nprocedure, they have to pay for it. In this case, Senator Murray makes \nthat clear.\n  Finally, to argue we are going to turn military hospitals into \nabortion clinics and force doctors to perform abortions defiles the \nvery language of the amendment. Senator Murray carefully included a \nconscience clause. If a doctor in a military hospital overseas should \nsay: because of my personal religious beliefs or my conscience, I \ncannot perform an abortion procedure, there is absolutely no \nrequirement in the Murray amendment that person be involved. The same \nconscience clause that applies in most hospitals in the United States \napplies in this amendment.\n  This is the bottom line: Men and women in uniform are asked to risk \ntheir lives in defense of our country. God bless them that they are \nwilling to do that. But should women in the military also be asked to \nrisk their health and their lives because they want to exercise their \nown constitutional right to decide about their own reproductive health \ncare? That is the bottom line.\n  It really gets down to a very simple question: Why would we treat \nwomen in the military who have volunteered to serve this country as \nsecond-class citizens?\n  Sue Bailey, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, \nrecently wrote:\n\n       The Department of Defense believes it is unfair for female \n     service members, particularly those members assigned to \n     overseas locations, to be denied their constitutional right \n     to a full range of reproductive health care, to include \n     abortion. The availability of quality reproductive health \n     care ought to be available to all female members of the \n     military.\n\n  So we know where the military stands. The Department of Defense \nsupports this amendment by Senator Murray.\n  There is a current provision in the law for servicewomen overseas, \nwhen they have their life at stake or they have been victims of rape or \nincest, to have an abortion service at a military hospital. This has \nbeen stated by those on the floor. But there is no provision, no \nprotection whatever, for that same servicewoman who discovers during \nthe course of her pregnancy that because of her own medical condition \ncontinuing the pregnancy may be a threat to her health. A doctor can \ndiagnose during the course of a pregnancy the continuing that pregnancy \nmight result in a young woman never being able to bear another child. \nPerhaps that baby she is carrying is so fatally deformed it will not \nsurvive. And according to those who oppose the Murray amendment, that \nservicewoman is on her own.\n  What is her recourse? Well, maybe she will turn to a doctor in that \nforeign country, hoping that she will get someone who is professional \nand can perform a service that won't harm her more than a continued \npregnancy might. Frankly, the alternative is to get on a plane and fly \nto another location, another country, or back to the United States, \nwait for space available, or pay for it on commercial fare. Is that the \nkind of burden we want to impose on young women who volunteer to defend \nthe United States, take away the constitutional right available to \nevery American woman, to say to them, if you find yourself in a \ndelicate or difficult medical situation, it is up to you, at your cost, \nto get out of that country and find a doctor, a hospital, a clinic, \nthat can serve you? That is the bottom line, as far as I am concerned.\n\n  This is a question of simple fairness. It is a question of restoring \na policy which was in the law between 1973 and 1988 and again from 1993 \nto 1996.\n  Senator Murray has said to those who oppose abortion--and many in \nthis Chamber do--to those who oppose the Supreme Court's decision in \nRoe v. Wade, you are entitled to your point of view; You are entitled \nto make the speeches you want to make; But you are not entitled to deny \nto servicewomen overseas the same constitutional rights we give to \nevery woman in America. We will debate abortion for many years to come, \nwhether or not the Supreme Court sustains Roe v. Wade.\n  So long as it is the constitutional right in our country for women to \nconsider their own privacy and their own reproductive health and make \nthose personal decisions with their doctor, with their family, with \ntheir conscience, we should not deny that same right to women who are \nserving in the military.\n  The women in our Armed Forces already give up many freedoms and risk \ntheir lives to defend our country. They should not have to sacrifice \ntheir privacy, their health, and their basic constitutional rights for \na policy with no valid military purpose.\n  I rise in strong support of this amendment, a bipartisan amendment, \nby Senator Murray and Senator Snowe of Maine. I hope my colleagues will \nshow respect for the women who serve in our military by voting in favor \nof this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, one of the issues that has arisen \nduring this debate is whether or not the Murray amendment violates the \nHyde provision which prohibits Federal funding\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\nfor abortion. Proponents of the amendment argue, no, this doesn't \nviolate Hyde because we are requiring a woman to pay for the abortion \nprocedure.\n  I have raised the issue as to how exactly to calculate the cost of \nreimbursing the DOD for the expense of an abortion procedure, in a \nmilitary hospital, when the facilities were built at taxpayers' \nexpense, and the support staff were paid salaries out of public funds, \nin which the equipment has been paid for. How in the world would this \nbe calculated?\n  Now, earlier it was suggested that is not really a problem. During \nthe lunch break, we checked with the Department of Defense. I will \nshare for the record what we found. It is currently not feasible with \nexisting information systems and support capabilities to collect \nbilling information relative to a specific encounter within the \nmilitary health care system.\n  Procedures performed in military hospitals are assigned a diagnostic \nrelated group code, but these are ``assigned'' or ``allocated'' costs \nthat don't necessarily reflect resources devoted to a specific case. \nMilitary infrastructure and overhead costs cannot, at the present time, \nbe allocated on a case-by-case basis.\n  It is very clear that the Hyde amendment would be violated, that we \nwould--whether we admit it or not, whether we promulgate this legal \nmyth--be subsidizing abortion with taxpayers' money, in violation of \nthe law of the land.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his \ndedication to this issue and I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \nvery careful presentation of a number of important issues that deal \nwith this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray amendment and I \nurge my colleagues to follow the course we have set over the last \nseveral years and reject this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the underlying legislation before us, the Department \nof Defense Authorization Act, is an extremely important piece of \nlegislation. In conjunction with the accompanying appropriations bill, \nit provides for the essential funding needed by our brave men and women \non whom we rely to dedicate their time and service, and sometimes even \ntheir very lives, to protect our great nation from aggressors who \nthreaten our freedom, and security, and our very way of life. Our \nmilitary personnel are tasked with protecting our lives and our manner \nof life, which according to our hallowed Declaration of Independence, \nguarantees to each American those fundamental rights of life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness.\n  Rather than supporting our brave military men and women in their \ndifficult task of protecting life and liberty, the Murray amendment \nwould call on military personnel to use military facilities to take \ninnocent human life through elective abortions. This proposal runs \ncontrary to the mission of our armed services and should be rejected.\n  Mr. President, it is noteworthy that when President Clinton first \npromulgated his policy in 1993 directing that abortions be performed in \nmilitary facilities, all military physicians and many nurses and \nsupport personnel refused to perform or assist in elective abortions. \nThis is compelling evidence that military physicians want to be in the \nbusiness of saving life, not performing elective abortions. We should \nhonor the wishes of these military medical personnel and reject the \nMurray amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment even goes beyond the debate on abortion \nbecause it would essentially require tax funds to be used to aid in \nelective abortions. Military hospitals and medical clinics are built \nwith American tax dollars. Military physicians, nurses, and other \nsupport personnel are paid by federal tax dollars. We have just heard \nhow that billing is done. From an accounting standpoint the person does \nnot pay for the costs involved with the medical hospitals and clinics. \nMilitary physicians, nurses and other support personnel are paid by \nFederal tax dollars. Even if the abortion procedure itself was not \ndirectly paid for by federal funds, federal tax dollars would have to \nbe used to train military physicians to perform abortions.\n  Moreover, if military physicians refused to perform these elective \nabortions, and they were not required to violate their consciences, \nthen civilian doctors and medical personnel would have to be hired to \nperform these elective abortions on military facilities. How does the \naccounting work for direct costs? Would these civilian medical \npersonnel also have to be reimbursed with federal tax dollars?\n  In essence, the Murray amendment would require that American \ntaxpayers help pay for elective abortions for military personnel. \nRegardless of one's position on the legality of abortion, it is not \nproper for Congress to use Americans' tax dollars to fund something \nthat is as deeply controversial as abortion on demand.\n  I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for life and maintain the status \nquo by rejecting the Murray amendment. Abortions are available if the \nlife of the mother is at stake, or if there has been rape or incest. \nBut the elective abortion is another area that is controversial because \nof the funding that is available. So I do ask you to cast a vote for \nlife and maintain the status quo, reject the Murray amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey and 10 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nand the Senator from Maine. I congratulate each of them on this \namendment.\n  There are good and sound arguments that people who serve in the Armed \nForces of the United States deserve some special privilege. Their lives \nare at risk. They give months and years of their time in service to our \nNation. Certainly, they deserve some special recognition and \naccommodation to their needs.\n  I know of no argument that people in service to our country, because \nthey are in the Armed Forces, deserve less. Access to safe abortions is \nnot a national privilege. It is not a benefit we extend to the few. It \nis, by order of the Supreme Court of the United States, a \nconstitutionally mandated right. Yet people would come to the floor of \nthe Senate and say those who take an oath to defend our Nation and our \nConstitution by putting their lives in harm's way deserve not those \nconstitutional rights of other Americans but less.\n  To the extent my colleagues want to debate the law, fight on the \nconstitutional issue, I respect them. To the extent they simply want to \nprovide barriers when a woman wants to exercise her constitutional \nright while in service to our country, it does not speak well of the \nanti-abortion movement. Women in the Armed Forces serving abroad must \narrange transportation, incur delays. Ironically, to those in the anti-\nabortion movement, these are women whose abortions get postponed to \nlater stages of pregnancy and must have the personal dangers of travel \nwhile pregnant because of this prohibition.\n\n  In spite of words I heard said on this floor, there are no public \nfunds involved. Women would pay for these procedures themselves. No \nproviders of health care in a military hospital or other facility would \nbe forced to do this against their will. This would be done only on a \nvoluntary basis by regulation of the Armed Forces. It is voluntary; it \nis privately paid for; it is constitutional; and it is right.\n  How would we account for the expense, the Senator from Arkansas has \nraised. This was done in 1994 and 1996; it was done before 1993. In all \nthose years, in hundreds and thousands of cases, we had no accounting \ndifficulty. A woman is presented with a bill: Here is what it costs. Is \nit a private matter? You pay for it.\n  The Armed Forces themselves may be in the best position to speak for \ntheir own members. On May 7, 1999, Assistant Secretary of Defense Sue \nBailey stated:\n\n       The Department of Defense believes it is unfair for female \n     service members, particularly those members assigned to \n     overseas locations, to be denied their constitutional right \n     to the full range of reproductive healthcare. * * *\n\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\n\n  Exactly. Members of our Armed Forces ask for no special privileges. \nThey ask for no special rights. They want to have the constitutional \nrights of all other Americans. It is not right. It is not fair. It is \nnot even safe to ask a woman at this dangerous, important, critical \nmoment of her own life to seek transportation to travel across \ncontinents to exercise the abortion rights that every other American \ncan get from their own doctor at their own hospital.\n  No matter what side you are on in the abortion debate, this is just \nthe right thing to do. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \non all sides of this debate, if ever there was a moment for unity on \nreproductive rights, I urge support for the Snowe-Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time to the Senator from California?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe, under the unanimous consent agreement, I am \nsupposed to get 10 minutes at this time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray for giving me these \n10 minutes. I compliment her and Senator Snowe for once again bringing \nthis matter to the Senate. We have had very close votes. I believe, if \npeople listened to the arguments on both sides, they would come down in \nfavor of the Murray-Snowe amendment. I want to say why.\n  The Murray-Snowe amendment will repeal the law which says to \nservicewomen and military dependents who are stationed overseas that \nthey are less than full American citizens; that they, in fact, no \nlonger have the protections of the Constitution; and that, in fact, \nthey do not deserve the full measure of that protection.\n  I don't want to overstate this, but I think it is almost unpatriotic \nto take the view that a woman who gives her life to her country every \nsingle day would be denied a right that every other woman has. No other \nwoman in America is told: Talk to your boss about the problem you've \ngot yourself into. Get his permission.\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas, who says some of the commanding \nofficers are women, I suppose about 2 percent are women. But that is \nnot the point. Whether it is a man or a woman, no one else in America \nhas to go get permission from their employer to get a safe abortion.\n  With all due respect to Senator Brownback, who says this is about \nprotecting the unborn, this is not about protecting the unborn. This is \nabout protecting the rights of American women, who happen to be in the \nmilitary, to have the same constitutional protections as any other \nwoman. If we want to discuss the issue of whether a woman should have \nthe right to choose, that is another conversation for another day or \nperhaps for another Supreme Court, which has upheld a woman's right to \nchoose time and time and time again since 1973. Even Justices who were \nappointed by Republican Presidents have done so. So although my friends \nwant to make this issue about the rights of the unborn, that is not \nwhat this is about. This is about making it difficult and really, in \nmany ways, dangerous for women in the military to exercise their right \nto choose. I think that is a rather sick thing to do, if you want to \nknow the truth.\n  How would you like to be a woman who finds herself with this unwanted \npregnancy? She may decide to go to full term. That is her choice. She \nmay choose that. But what if she doesn't? Now she is faced with a \nsituation where she has to go to her boss and beg to get on a cargo \nplane--when there is a seat available, I might say.\n  So Senator Torricelli is right in his point; such could delay this \nprocedure until it was more dangerous to her health, or she could \nchoose not to be humiliated, embarrassed, and the rest, and go to an \nunsafe place in a country that may well be hostile to her, try to \nunderstand what the doctors and the nurses are saying, and subject \nherself to a dangerous situation. Why? Why would my colleagues want to \ndo that to women in the military?\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, I do not doubt their \nsincerity. But for them to stand up and say that the DOD really doesn't \nknow how to allocate these costs so Senator Murray is wrong on this \npoint, Senator Snowe is wrong on this point; we can't figure out really \nwhat this costs, that simply flies in the face of experience.\n  For many years, this is what had been done. It was no problem getting \nthe women to pay their fair share of the costs associated with an \nabortion, a safe and legal abortion in a safe military hospital.\n  In the Murray amendment, no one is forced to be involved in this \nprocedure if they have an objection based on conscience.\n  We have covered all the bases, if you will. I don't care who stands \nup here and waves a piece of paper and says they can't figure out what \nit costs. The military supports the Murray-Snowe amendment.\n  I will repeat that. The U.S. Department of Defense supports the \nMurray-Snowe amendment. Why? Because they care about the people in the \nmilitary. They are advocates for people in the military. They do not \nthink you should give up your rights because you put your life on the \nline for your country. On the contrary. They want to thank the women in \nthe military for putting their lives on the line, and one way to do it \nis to ensure they will share in the benefits of this Nation, which \ninclude being protected by the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The Supreme Court decision that occurred in 1973, which many of my \ncolleagues do not like--Senator Harkin and I had a very clear-cut \namendment upholding the Supreme Court decision of 1973. We got 51 \nvotes. Roe v. Wade got a 51-vote majority in the Senate, but it is \nhanging by a thread. And this attempt in this bill, which the majority \nside of the aisle supports, to stop women, who happen to be in the \nmilitary, from their constitutional right to choose flies in the face \nof what the military says it wants to do for our people, which is to \nprotect them when they are abroad.\n  This is simply about the rights of women, one particular group of \nwomen, the women I thought my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwould particularly respect because of their respect for the military. \nThis is telling those women in the military: You cannot have the same \nrights as anybody else.\n  I recall when we had a debate on the Washington, DC, appropriations \nbill. I happened to be the minority member who was bringing that bill \nforward. There were many restrictions on the poor women of Washington, \nDC, that were not put into any other bill. In other words, the people \nin my cities did not get stuck with particular rules that told them \nthey could not use city money if they, in fact, wanted to exercise \ntheir right to choose.\n  I said to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Why are you \npicking on these poor women in Washington, DC? Do my colleagues know \nwhat the answer was? Because we can.\n  I rhetorically ask the same question: Why are we picking on women in \nthe military and saying they are less than full citizens of this \ncountry, that they do not have the constitutional rights that other \nwomen have?\n  I suspect an honest answer coming back would be: Because we can take \nthis right away; because we in the Senate have the power of the purse, \nand we are going to exercise that power because we can. And they will \ndo it.\n  I am hoping one or two people on the other side will change their \nminds on this amendment if they are listening to this debate; given the \nfact that the military supports the Murray-Snowe amendment. I hope a \ncouple of people will change their minds on this. Just because we can \nexercise our personal religious and moral beliefs on someone else does \nnot mean we should do that.\n  We should respect people and know we have freedom of religion in this \ncountry. That does not mean we have a right to put our moral values and \nour decisions on someone else. We should respect them. They are going \nto decide this issue.\n  I can tell my colleagues that a decision to have an abortion is one \nthat is very serious for our people. Women do not do it in a cavalier \nway. They think about it, and they talk about it with the people who \nlove them, not their boss. That is what my colleagues make people do: \nGo to their boss and beg to get on a plane to get a safe abortion. It \nis shameful. It is just shameful. They\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\nwould not want that done to their children. I do not think so. They \nwould want them to have the chance to do what they thought was right \nand have the opportunity of a safe, legal procedure.\n\n  Again, I say to Senators Murray and Snowe that they are courageous to \ndo this; they are right to do this. They lost a couple of votes on \nclose vote counts, and they are not giving up.\n  I hope everyone who is watching this debate, be they a man or a \nwoman, be they old or young, be they for a woman's right to choose or \nagainst it, understands what this debate is about. Nothing we do today, \nregardless of how this vote goes, will change the law governing a \nwoman's right to choose. That was decided in 1973, and it has been \nupheld. It is a right.\n  This is not about the rights of the unborn. It is about the rights of \nwomen in the military to have the same constitutional protections as \nall the other women in our Nation.\n  I thank the Chair for his courtesy, and I thank Senator Murray for \nher courage. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the statement was made that the \nmilitary supports the Murray amendment. Thus far during our debate, \ntwice, a Dr. Sue Bailey, who is a former Under Secretary of Defense for \nHealth, has been quoted. Notwithstanding whatever the Department of \nDefense might say today, I suspect were there to be a survey of U.S. \nmen and women in uniform across the world, the vast majority would not \nfavor turning U.S. military installations overseas into abortion \nproviders.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, such \ntime as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Hutchinson, for his contribution to this debate. I want to make \na couple of comments.\n  If we adopt the Murray-Snowe amendment, we will be turning military \nhospitals worldwide into abortion clinics. That is what it is about.\n  I heard somebody else say: We have to protect the constitutional \nright to choose. It is not the right to choose. The question is, are we \ngoing to turn military hospitals into abortion clinics?\n  I also heard the comment: The military supports this amendment. I \nwould like to ask General Shelton that. I would like to ask Secretary \nCohen that. I would like to ask former Secretary Dick Cheney that. I \nwould like to ask Colin Powell that. I doubt that would be the case.\n  What about this constitutional right? I heard ``safe legal \nabortions.'' When did Congress pass a law? I do not believe Congress \never passed a law saying women have a right to an abortion. The Supreme \nCourt came up with a decision in Roe v. Wade that ``legalized'' \nabortion, and by legalizing abortion they overturned State laws.\n  The majority of States--almost all States--had restrictions on \nabortions. The Supreme Court, in its infinite wisdom, said: States, you \ndo not know enough, so we are going to legalize abortion.\n  I personally find it offensive anytime the Supreme Court goes into \nthe lawmaking business. I read the Constitution to say Congress shall \npass all laws--article I of the Constitution. It does not say, laws \nthat are kind of complicated, Supreme Court, you go ahead and pass.\n  Now people are trying to take, in my opinion, a flawed Supreme Court \ndecision and say we are going to turn that into a fringe benefit. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not say that, but my colleagues are \nsaying: We want to have the right to have an abortion in government \nhospitals; this is a fringe benefit; let's pick it up, it is going to \nbe paid for by the taxpayers.\n  These doctors, who are Federal doctors, are going to be trained to do \nwhat? Provide abortions. What is an abortion? It is the destruction of \na human life. We are now going to turn this Supreme Court decision into \na fringe benefit? The Supreme Court never said this was a fringe \nbenefit. The Supreme Court never said the Government had to pay for it, \nor the taxpayers had to pay for it.\n  Who pays that doctor's salary? Who is going to train that doctor? Who \nis going to train the nurse? Who is going to make sure the facilities \nare there? The taxpayers are. The Supreme Court never said you have to \nturn this into a Federal paid fringe benefit at Federal expense.\n  I heard somebody else say this is not a debate about paying for it; \nthey are willing to pay for it themselves. They do not pay for the \ntraining of the doctors. They do not pay for the building of the \nfacilities or having the facilities there, and all the expenses \nassociated with it.\n  Basically, they are asking that the Federal policy be to turn our \nmilitary hospitals into abortion clinics with the acceptance, with the \nacknowledgment, with the prestige of the U.S. Government, that this is \na procedure we will supply, as if it is just an ordinary fringe \nbenefit.\n  It is dehumanizing life. It is devaluing life. It is just a fringe \nbenefit? It is a destruction of life. We are going to have the \ntaxpayers do that? We are going to mandate all military hospitals \nworldwide become abortion clinics?\n  We are going to mandate basically that these doctors, when they are \nrecruited to go into military training, have to also be trained to \nperform abortions? I think that would be a serious mistake. I urge my \ncolleagues, at the appropriate time, to vote in favor of the motion to \ntable the Murray amendment.\n  Again, my compliments to my friend and colleague from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I simply need to respond. The Murray-\nSnowe amendment is not asking for a fringe benefit. Let me make it very \nclear to everyone who is listening, what this amendment does is simply \nallow a woman who serves in the military overseas to pay for her own \nabortion services in a military hospital where it is safe and it is \nlegal. It is not a fringe benefit. Health care choices for women who \nserve us overseas are not fringe benefits. They simply are the same \nright that is afforded to every woman who lives in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today just to add a \ncouple of other points to this very important debate.\n  I thank my colleagues from Washington and Maine for sponsoring this \namendment. I will join with them in voting for this amendment.\n  I simply point out to our colleagues that while emotions and passions \nmay run quite high on this issue, as has been expressed by various \nMembers, I do not necessarily consider this an abortion vote one way or \nthe other. This is about our military. This is about equal rights and \nequal protection for men and women who serve in the military. It is a \npro-military vote. It is a health care vote.\n  We can debate, as we do regularly, and as the Senator from Oklahoma \njust pointed out, our differences of opinion on abortion. We have \ndifferences of opinion about whether we should be pro-choice, anti-\nchoice, or pro-abortion. But this is an amendment concerning women who \nhave signed up in the military, at some sacrifice to themselves and to \ntheir families, to serve our country in uniform.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, it is so hard for me to \nunderstand how this Congress could take a constitutional right away \nfrom a woman in uniform by denying her health care she may need, and in \nsome instances may be in desperate need of, while serving our country \noverseas. It is for no good reason that I can understand, nor can many \nof us understand.\n  We can debate the abortion issue on other bills, in other venues. We \nhave resolutions. This is on our military bill. This is a readiness \nissue. We have reached out to women to serve in our Armed Forces. We \nhave asked them to serve. Ten or fifteen percent of our Armed Forces \nare female.\n\n  Just recently I read, with great pride--and I hope many of our \nMembers here have read this--that in our academies, the Army, the Air \nForce, and the Navy academies, 5 out of the top 10 graduates this year \nare women.\n  We are opening the doors of our military academies. Some of our best\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\ntrained people are female, getting ready to defend our Nation's \nprinciples for which so many died.\n  If, in fact, they are overseas and injured in the line of duty, and \nthe woman happens to be pregnant and needs to terminate that pregnancy, \nthey will have to go to their commanding officer, ask for permission, \nand be transported back on a cargo plane, if and when one is available, \nputting their health in jeopardy. It is not right. It is not fair.\n  I would like to correct the record. Secretary Cohen does support \ngiving this health benefit to women who are in our military.\n  I would like to correct something else for the record. The Murray-\nSnowe amendment requires that women in uniform pay out of their own \npockets for the procedure that they believe they need because of their \nhealth or that their doctor might recommend they need. In addition to \npaying out of their pocket, let me remind my colleagues, they are \ntaxpayers. Their money does in fact build the hospitals and pay for the \ndoctors. The last time I checked the Tax Code, both men and women pay \ntaxes, not just the men of this Nation.\n  So for the readiness issue, for the military issue, I ask my \ncolleagues, even those who are opposed to abortion on constitutional \ngrounds, since it is a constitutional right, let us please have \nconsideration for the women who are in uniform, who serve our country \nvaliantly, and who may indeed find themselves in a foreign and strange \nland, in some instances, fighting for the principles we represent here. \nFor them to not be able to get the health care they need because some \nMembers of this body voted to take that right away from them, I do not \nwant to be in that number.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to support this amendment. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join with us in supporting this important amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, a constitutional right has not been \nabridged. They in fact can seek an abortion, but it simply cannot be on \nmilitary grounds, in military hospitals, or subsidized by the American \ntaxpayer.\n  At this time, I yield such time as he might consume to my \ndistinguished colleague on the Armed Services Committee, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is indeed an important Defense \nauthorization bill. We have worked on it for a long time. \nUnfortunately, it is now being jeopardized by an attempt to shove \nfurther and further abortion rights, abortion entitlements forward, to \nbe paid for by the American taxpayers. That is a principle we ought not \nto confront, in my view.\n  As I see it, there has sort of been a quasi, uneasy truce among those \nwho disagree about abortion. We have said the right exists and people \ncan choose it, but we are not requiring that the American taxpayers pay \nfor it. People on both sides may like to see that changed in various \ndirections, but fundamentally that is where we are.\n  We have an important defense bill being jeopardized by this approach \nthat says that taxpayers have to have the Army, Navy, and Marine \nhospitals converted into abortion clinics. I do not believe that is \npopular with the service. I know it is not popular with the physicians \nin the service. In fact, I am disappointed to hear that the Secretary \nof Defense--I now hear from this floor--favors this amendment.\n  Once again, we have politicians and bureaucrats in the Department of \nDefense playing political and ideological games with the morale and \nesprit de corps of the men and women in the military. I do not \nappreciate that.\n  Every physician who was called upon previously, when there was a \nperiod in which these abortions were to be performed in military \nhospitals, rejected that. Not one military physician, who swore an oath \nto preserve life and who had character and integrity that led them to \nconclude they ought not to do these abortions, would do so.\n  So there is unanimous support. I do not know why the Secretary of \nDefense ought to be doing this. I did not know that it happened. I knew \nthat a bureaucrat, an Under Secretary of Defense, had said it was a \nconstitutional right.\n  It is not a constitutional right to have the taxpayers provide a \nplace for someone to conduct an elective surgery. That is not a \nconstitutional right. It is a constitutional right, according to the \nSupreme Court, that no State can pass laws to stop someone from going \nout and seeking an abortion and having it. Basically, that is the \ncurrent state of the law by the U.S. Supreme Court. That is the right.\n  It is not a right to have it paid for by the American citizens, many \nof whom deeply believe it is wrong. Overwhelmingly, a majority--\napparently all physicians in the military--do not want to do this. Why \nare we forcing it? It is not good for military morale. It is not going \nto improve the self-image of the patriots who defend us every day. I \nfeel strongly about that. I wish the Secretary of Defense had not come \nforward in that way.\n\n  What is the policy? What are we saying to our women in uniform today? \nThe policy says: Join the service and you may be deployed. Most people \nmay serve their whole career and never be deployed outside the United \nStates but some are. So you may be deployed. We say to them: You have a \nfull right to have an abortion, as any other American citizen. You have \nthat right. We have regulations, implemented by the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, to guarantee those rights. We say: But you must pay for \nthat procedure. The taxpayers are not going to pay for it. If you are \non foreign soil and there is not an American hospital nearby or an \nabortion clinic nearby, you will be given leave. You will be given free \ntravel on military aircraft to come back to a place you think is \nappropriate to have your abortion. We are just not going to pay for it. \nWe are not going to convert our hospitals, and we are not going to have \nour physicians who don't approve of this procedure be required to take \ntraining in and undertake that procedure.\n  That is the way it is. That is not a denial of constitutional rights. \nIf it were, why don't we have a lawsuit and have the U.S. Supreme Court \ndeclare that is an unconstitutional policy? There is zero chance of \nhaving the Supreme Court declare the policy, as I have just stated it, \nunconstitutional. It is an absolutely bogus argument to say the current \nstate of the law concerning abortions in military hospitals is \nunconstitutional. It is not so. It is inaccurate and wrong. It ought \nnot to be said. If it is so, it will be reversed by the Supreme Court. \nBut it will not be because it is not unconstitutional.\n  Someone suggested that this is oppressive to women. That is a very \npatronizing approach to women in the military. The women I know in the \nmilitary are quite capable. They know how to make decisions. They are \ntrained to make decisions. They are strong and capable. They are not \ngoing to be intimidated from taking a medical course they choose to \ntake. It is not a question of asking permission of their commanding \nofficer. They can have the abortion as they choose. If they want to be \ntransported back to the United States on free travel, they have to ask \nfor the free travel. They have to ask their commander, someone to give \nthem the travel back on the aircraft. It is not begging the commanding \nofficer for permission to have the abortion, which is a right protected \nby the Constitution.\n  It has been argued that we are here to place barriers in the way. No. \nThe regulations guarantee the right of a woman in the military to have \nan abortion and guarantee the right to be transported back to a place \nwhere the abortion can be provided. It does not bar an abortion. How \ncan daylight be turned to darkness in that way?\n  There are many deep beliefs on both sides of this issue. We need to \nbe clear in how we think about it. If we think about it fairly, we will \nunderstand that the U.S. military guarantees and protects and will \nassist a woman to achieve an abortion. What we are saying is, we shall \nnot be required to provide a hospital, doctors, and nurses to do so. I \nthink that is a reasonable policy in this diverse world in which we \nlive. We do not need to jeopardize the entire Defense bill by \nchallenging the deeply held and honorable position of many Americans.\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\n  We need to reject this amendment. I think it is basically an attempt \nto shove, once again, the abortion barriers even further, to attempt to \nget around the Hyde amendment which flatly prohibits expenditure of \nFederal dollars to carry out abortions. The Hyde amendment is quite \nsane, quite reasonable, quite fair in light of the deeply held opinions \nof Americans.\n  Let us not go further. Let us reject the Murray amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senators Murray and Snowe. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  This amendment would repeal the current ban on privately funded \nabortions at U.S. military facilities overseas.\n  I strongly support this amendment for three reasons. First of all, \nsafe and legal access to abortion is the law. Second, women serving \noverseas should have access to the same range of medical services they \nwould have if they were stationed here at home. Third, this amendment \nwould protect the health and well-being of military women. It would \nensure that they are not forced to seek alternative medical care in \nforeign countries without regard to the quality and safety of those \nhealth care services. We should not treat U.S. servicewomen as second-\nclass citizens when it comes to receiving safe and legal medical care.\n  It is a matter of simple fairness that our servicewomen, as well as \nthe spouses and dependents of servicemen, be able to exercise their \nright to make health care decisions when they are stationed abroad. \nWomen who are stationed overseas are often totally dependent on their \nbase hospitals for medical care. Most of the time, the only access to \nsafe, quality medical care is in a military facility. We should not \ndiscriminate against female military personnel by denying safe abortion \nservices just because they are stationed overseas. They should be able \nexercise the same freedoms they would enjoy at home. It is \nreprehensible to suggest that a woman should not be able use her own \nfunds to pay for access to safe and quality medical care. Without this \namendment, military women will continue to be treated like second-class \ncitizens.\n  The current ban on access to reproductive services is yet another \nattempt to cut away at the constitutionally protected right of women to \nchoose. It strips military women of the very rights they were recruited \nto protect. Abortion is a fundamental right for women in this country. \nIt has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court.\n  Let's be very clear. What we're talking about here today is the right \nof women to obtain a safe and legal abortion paid for with their own \nfunds. We are not talking about using any taxpayer or federal money--we \nare talking about privately funded medical care. We are not talking \nabout reversing the conscience clause--no military medical personnel \nwould be compelled to perform an abortion against their wishes.\n  This is an issue of fairness and equality for the women who sacrifice \nevery day to serve our nation. They deserve access to the same quality \ncare that servicewomen stationed here at home--and every woman in \nAmerica--has each day. I urge my colleagues to support this important \namendment to the Fiscal Year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization \nBill.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senator Murray and \nSenator Snowe renews our debate, once again about women's reproductive \nchoice and access to safe, affordable, and legal reproductive health \ncare services. I commend the sponsors of this amendment for their \neloquent advocacy on behalf of women in uniform.\n  Mr. President, the Murray-Snowe amendment repeals the ban on \nprivately funded abortions at overseas military medical facilities. \nSimply stated, this legislation would ensure that women service members \nand military dependents stationed overseas have access to the \nreproductive health care services guaranteed to all American women. \nUnder the current policy, women who volunteer to serve their country \nand are stationed outside the United States have to surrender the \nprotection of these rights. They can't use their own funds to obtain \nabortion services in our safe military medical facilities. It is ironic \nthat active-duty service members who are sent abroad to protect and \ndefend our rights are unnecessarily denied their own in the process.\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court has, time and time again, affirmed \nthat reproductive rights are constitutionally protected rights. Roe v. \nWade is still the law of our land. Congress has even passed legislation \nmaking it illegal to prevent or hinder a woman's access to clinics that \nprovide abortion services. And yet we are here again trying to protect \nthe constitutional rights of a group of women who are willing to die to \nprotect the constitutional rights of all Americans. This is a fight we \nshouldn't have to wage in this chamber, Mr. President.\n  I'd like to respond to some of the arguments that have been made \nagainst this amendment. This amendment does not advocate Federal \nfunding of abortions. Women service members, not the American taxpayer, \nare entirely responsible for the cost of these services. Furthermore, \nas per current policy, this amendment would not force any individual \nservice member to perform a procedure to which he or she objects.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and give military \nservice members and their dependents the same protections whether \nstationed in this country or abroad. The women of our Armed Forces \nshould not be forced to risk their health, safety, and well-being via \nback-alley abortions or substandard foreign health care services. The \nMurray-Snowe amendment provides the women who have volunteered to serve \nthis Nation and are assigned to duty outside the United States with the \nrange of constitutional rights that they have when they are on American \nsoil. We owe this to our American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, and I \ncommend my colleagues, Senator Murray and Senator Snowe, for \nintroducing it again this year. This is an issue of basic fairness for \nall of the women who have voluntarily dedicated their lives to \nprotecting our country or who are dependents of military service \nmembers.\n  The current ban on abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas \ndiscriminates against women who are serving abroad in our armed forces. \nThis ban is not fair to our servicewomen, and it is unacceptable. They \nare willing to risk their lives for our country, and it is wrong for \nour country to ask them to risk their lives to obtain the health care \nthat is their constitutional right as American citizens.\n  Abortion is illegal in many of the countries where our servicewomen \nare based. The current ban on abortions endangers their health by \nlimiting their access to reproductive care. Without proper care, \nabortion can be a life-threatening or permanently disabling procedure. \nIt is unacceptable to expose our dedicated servicewomen to risks of \ninfection, illness, infertility, and even death, when appropriate care \ncan easily be made available to them.\n  Over 100,000 American women live on military bases overseas and rely \non military hospitals for their health care. They should be able to \ndepend on military base hospitals for all of their medical needs. They \nshould not be forced to choose between lower quality medical care in a \nforeign country, or travelling back to the United States for the care \nthey need. Forcing women to travel to another country or return to the \nUnited States to obtain an abortion imposes an unfair burden on them \nand can lead to excessive delays and increased risk.\n  Servicewomen in the United States do not face these burdens, since \nquality health care in non-military hospital facilities is readily \navailable. It is unfair to ask those serving abroad to suffer a \nfinancial penalty and expose themselves to health risks that could be \nlife-threatening.\n  Congress has an obligation to provide safe medical care for those \nserving our country both at home and abroad. This amendment does not \nask that these procedures be paid for with federal funds. It simply \nasks that servicewomen overseas have the same access to all medical \nservices as their counterparts at home.\n  Every woman in the United States has a constitutionally-guaranteed\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\nright to choose whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. A woman's \ndecision to have an abortion is a very difficult and extremely personal \none, and it is wrong to impose an even heavier burden on women who \nserve our country overseas. It is time for Congress to end this double-\nstandard for women serving abroad. I urge the Senate to support the \nMurray-Snowe amendment and correct this grave injustice.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the FY 2001 \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill, I want to add my support for \nthe amendment offered by Senators Murray and Snowe to repeal the \nprovision of current law that prohibits the use of DOD facilities for \nabortion services. This prohibition is particularly harsh for women who \nserve their country overseas.\n  Current law has two bans: (1) a ban on the use of any DOD funds to \nperform abortions, except if the life of the mother is endangered; and \n(2) a ban on using DOD facilities to perform an abortion except if the \nlife of the mother were endangered or in the case of rape or incest. \nThe Murray-Snowe amendment would repeal the second ban, on using a DOD \nfacility to perform an abortion except where the life of the mother \nwould be endangered or in the case of rape or incest.\n  This amendment does not force DOD to pay for abortions. It simply \nrepeals the current ban on using DOD medical facilities. This ban works \na particular hardship on military women stationed overseas because if \nthey cannot use DOD facilities, they are forced to find private \nfacilities, which may be unfamiliar, substandard, or far away.\n  I support this amendment for several reasons.\n  First, under several Supreme Court decisions, a woman clearly has a \nright to choose. A woman does not give up that right because she serves \nin the U.S. military or is married to someone serving in the military. \nBarring the use of U.S. military facilities creates a particular \ndifficult barrier to exercising that constitutionally protected right \nwhen serving in another country.\n  Second, this prohibition in current law can endanger a woman's \nhealth, if she has to travel a long distance or wait to find an \nappropriate facility or physician. Women may not have ready access to \nprivate facilities in other countries. A woman stationed in that \ncountry or the wife of a service member might need to fly to the U.S. \nor to another country--at her own expense--to obtain an abortion \nbecause some countries have very restrictive laws on abortion. Most \nservice members cannot easily bear the expense of jetting off across \nthe globe for medical treatment.\n\n  If women do not have access to military facilities or to private \nfacilities in the country where they are stationed, they could endanger \ntheir own health because of delay and the time it takes to get to a \nfacility in another country or by being forced to get treatment by \nsomeone other than a licensed physician.\n  We know from personal experience in this country that when abortion \nis illegal, some women--especially desperate young women--resort to \nunsafe and life-threatening methods. If it were your wife, or your \ndaughter, would you want her in the hands of an untrained, unknown \nperson on the back streets of Seoul, South Korea? Or would you prefer \nthat she be treated by a trained physician in a U.S. military facility? \nUnder the current prohibition, women could put themselves at great risk \nby the hurdles required, by the possibility of using an untrained, \nunlicensed person and sometimes by a lack of knowledge of the \nseriousness of their condition.\n  People who serve our country agree to put their lives at risk to \ndefend their country. They do not agree to put their health at risk \nwith unknown medical facilities that may not meet U.S. standards. With \nthis ban, we are asking these women to risk their lives doublefold.\n  Current law does not force any military physician to perform an \nabortion against his or her will. All branches have a ``conscience \nclause'' that permits medical personnel to choose not to perform the \nprocedure. What we are talking about today is providing equal access to \nU.S. military medical facilities, wherever they are located, for a \nlegal procedure paid for with one's own money.\n  The Department of Defense supports this amendment. A May 7 letter \nfrom Dr. Sue Bailey, the Assistant Secretary of Defense says the \nfollowing:\n\n       The Department believes it is unfair for female service \n     members, particularly those members assigned to overseas \n     locations, to be denied their Constitutional right to the \n     full range of reproductive health care, to include abortions. \n     The availability of quality reproductive health care ought to \n     be available to all female members of the military.\n\n  Abortion is legal for American women. To deny American military women \naccess to medical treatment they can trust is wrong. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote the Murray-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much remains \non each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the amendment has 10 minutes \nremaining; the opposition has 15 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will address a few of the issues that \nhave been raised.\n  First, the Department of Defense stand on this: We have it confirmed \nthat Secretary Cohen, the Secretary of Defense, does support this \namendment. Several people have questioned Dr. Sue Bailey, who is \nAssistant Secretary of Defense, and wrote a very eloquent letter in \nsupport of this position. She did recently leave the Department. \nHowever, the Department's policy still is intact. Despite her being \ngone, the Department policy remains strongly the same.\n  Second, I keep hearing the question of taxpayer funds. Let me lay \nthis out for everyone one more time. Current policy requires a woman \nwho serves in the military overseas to go to her commanding officer and \nrequest permission for leave of absence. She cannot get free transport \nwithout giving them a reason why. She has to go to her commanding \nofficer, most likely a male, explain to him that she needs abortion \nservices, and then we provide her transportation back to the United \nStates. Her transportation is usually on a C-17 or a military transport \njet that I assume costs a lot more than an abortion procedure would in \na military hospital.\n  What we are saying with this amendment is not to use taxpayer \ndollars, despite what the opponents keep asserting. We are simply \nasking that a woman who serves in the military overseas be allowed to \npay for her own health care services in a military hospital so she can \nhave access to a safe and legal abortion, just as women in this country \ndo every day.\n  This is an issue of fairness. We are asking the women who serve in \nour military be allowed the services that every woman has a right to in \nthis country. They are overseas fighting to protect our rights. \nCertainly, the least we can do is provide them rights as well.\n  I yield what time he needs to the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Washington and Senator Snowe. \nThey have been doing an important job for the Nation.\n  We require an awful lot from the service men and women who serve us \nhere and abroad. We ask them to volunteer to serve in the military. \nThen we send them all over the world to serve our Nation's interests. \nWhen we ask them to serve in foreign countries, the least we can do is \nto ensure they receive medical care equal to what they would receive in \nthe United States. Servicewomen and their dependents who are fortunate \nenough to be stationed in the United States and who make the difficult \ndecision to have an abortion can, at their own expense, get a legal \nabortion performed by a doctor in a modern, safe, American medical \nfacility with people who speak English. Military women stationed \noverseas do not have that opportunity under current law.\n  That is what the Snowe-Murray amendment would change. The alternative \nof seeking an abortion from a host nation doctor who may or may not be \ntrained to U.S. standards in a foreign facility where the staff may not \neven speak English is an unacceptable alternative. Our servicewomen \ndeserve better.\n\n  This amendment is not about conferring a fringe benefit on military\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\nwomen. It is, rather, a vote to remove a barrier to fair treatment of \nwomen in the military. This amendment does not require the Department \nof Defense to pay for abortions. As the Senator from Washington very \nclearly explained again, all the expenses would be paid for by those \nwho seek the abortion.\n  The Defense Department calculates the cost of medical procedures in \nmilitary health care facilities all the time. They routinely compute \nthe cost of health care provided to military members and their families \nwhen seeking reimbursement, for instance, from insurance companies. \nMedical care, for instance, provided to a beneficiary who is injured in \nan automobile accident is routinely reimbursed by the insurance company \nof the driver at fault.\n  To say that we cannot calculate the indirect costs of medical care to \nthe Government is simply not an accurate statement of what takes place \nalready. The Defense Department calculates costs--direct and indirect--\nto the Government right now when it charges a third party for \nreimbursement.\n  There is no requirement in this bill--quite the opposite--that the \nGovernment pay for the abortion. It makes it very clear that the person \nwho seeks the abortion must pay for the abortion.\n  Finally, we have heard about military doctors who have said in the \npast that they did not want to perform abortions. We heard one of our \ncolleagues say that doctor after doctor said they did not want to \nperform an abortion.\n  That is why this amendment provides that abortions could only be \nperformed by American military doctors who volunteer to perform \nabortions.\n  This amendment is about whether or not women who serve in the \nmilitary are going to be treated as second-class citizens. That is what \nthis amendment is about--whether it is going to be made more difficult \nfor them when serving us abroad to exercise a constitutional right \nwhich the Supreme Court has conferred.\n  It is very intriguing to me that the opponents of this amendment \nspeak about a woman being able to receive transportation back to this \ncountry. They don't seem to object to that; quite the opposite. They \nsay: Look, we are making Government-provided transportation available \nto the woman. Why isn't the same objection being made to that?\n  The answer is because denial of access to a military hospital abroad \nfor an American woman who chooses to have an abortion does not \nfacilitate that procedure. And the opponents of this amendment, as a \nmatter of fact, oppose this procedure. They want to make it more \ndifficult. And forcing a woman to ask a commander to have leave and \nthen, if transportation is going to be made available, provide \ntransportation back to the United States to have an abortion, and then \nback across the ocean overseas, clearly makes it more difficult and in \nmany cases more dangerous for that woman to have the procedure.\n  That is what this debate is all about. It is not about whether the \nGovernment is going to pay for the abortion or whether this is a fringe \nbenefit. It is not. The woman must pay for it in that hospital by a \ndoctor who voluntarily agrees to perform it.\n  This amendment is about whether or not we wish to remove a barrier \nwhich has been placed in front of a woman who chooses to exercise, at \nher own expense, that constitutional right.\n\n  I hope the votes will be here this time to remove this badge of \nsecond-class citizenship which now exists in the law which unduly, \nunfairly, and sometimes dangerously restricts the right of a woman who \nis serving us in our military to exercise her constitutional right.\n  I again thank my friend from Washington for her leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself all but the remaining 2 \nminutes of the time allotted to my side.\n  Let me clarify a couple of things from my perspective.\n  It has been alleged that if you have a servicewoman who is seeking an \nabortion under current policy, you put her on an aircraft, fly her back \nto the U.S. at taxpayers' expense, and therefore what is the \ndifference? And the only reason we want to maintain the current policy \nis we want to put an impediment up to a woman having an abortion.\n  The current DOD policy for servicewomen seeking to obtain abortions \nis that they may fly on a space-available basis, if the aircraft are \nalready making the trip for operational reasons--not for the purpose of \nfacilitating abortions. Space-available transportation is available for \nany service member on leave regardless of what their motivation is.\n  These aircraft have been referred to repeatedly during the debate as \n``cargo aircraft.'' In fact, these aircraft have passenger seats just \nas on civilian airlines.\n  I wish to propound a series of questions to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington, Mrs. Murray, on my time.\n  I ask the Senator exactly how she would calculate the cost of \nreimbursing DOD for the expense of an abortion procedure. Does she \ncount only things consumed such as blood, bandages, and surgical tools, \nor would she compute the cost of using the facility, the salaries of \nthe support staff, and the other medical equipment used to perform such \na procedure?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, any hospital today has to calculate \ncosts. Certainly I give a lot of credence to our military hospitals and \nto the military officials who run them to be able to do the same thing \njust as they have done prior to the time when women could have access \nto these abortions.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask Senator Murray, if her proposal \nallows, as she argues, for a true calculation of the expenses, how much \ndoes she calculate the Government would be reimbursed for performing an \nabortion?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, that question goes directly to what the \nmilitary is able to do, which is to themselves figure out what the cost \nis and bill it. It is an easy thing to do. They have done it before. It \nis not up to me to calculate the cost. Our military officials who run \nour hospitals are highly qualified individuals who have the ability to \nfigure out what their costs are.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. After 1993, when the President, by Executive \nmemorandum, ordered that military hospitals provide abortions overseas, \nthere was, as the Senator from Washington knows, no physician who \nvolunteered to do that. Where there would be no current doctors \nvolunteering to perform abortions, does it envision the possibility of \ncontracting civilian doctors to perform abortions in military \nfacilities?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have the ability within our military \nhospitals right now to contract procurements of what our military \npersonnel need. It would frighten me a great deal as a woman serving in \nthe military if none of our military hospitals overseas knew how to \nperform an abortion in an emergency in case a woman's life is at risk, \nwhich we now need to know is available. If we are saying there are no \ndoctors available anywhere in the entire world where we have service \npeople available to perform that service, I would be frightened as a \nwoman in the military service today if my life was at stake and there \nwould not be a doctor available to help me.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I take it that the answer is, yes, that the Senator \nenvisions contracting doctors to perform.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Just as we do with any other requirement in the \nmilitary.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. In such an instance, would DOD then identify the \ncontract physician?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would assume so. But, again, I would like to point out \nthat we will bill the woman for the costs, whether it is contracted or \nnot. She will be liable to pay.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Is the Senator proposing that the Department of \nDefense perform elective abortion procedures in countries where \nabortions are prohibited by law?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Our military hospitals overseas are on military \nfacilities and go by American law. They would be performed in those \nfacilities overseas on our property.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator. I appreciate very much her \ncandor in answering the questions. I think it has been illuminating.\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\n  I would like to go back on some of these questions. Frankly, it has \nbeen made very clear by the Department of Defense, as I stated earlier, \nthat they do not currently have the ability to make these calculations \non a case-by-case basis.\n  I quote once again that ``procedures performed in military hospitals \nare assigned a diagnostic-related group code, but these are assigned or \nallocated costs that do not necessarily reflect resources devoted to a \nspecific case.''\n  That is very plain.\n  They further go on and say that military infrastructure and overhead \ncosts cannot at the present time be allocated on a case-by-case basis.\n  As much as we would like to say and as much as I believe the \nproponents of this amendment are sincere, it is not currently possible \nfor the Department of Defense to calculate what portion of the \ninfrastructure, the equipment and facilities, should be allocated to an \nindividual servicewoman seeking an abortion. That simply means we will, \nin fact, be subsidizing abortion procedures, and in doing so violate \nexisting law.\n  I raise another issue as we think about Senator Murray's response to \nmy questions. She said: Yes, in the case that you contract for a \nphysician, it would be assumed that the proper defense would indemnify \nthe contract physician. That means that the U.S. Department of Defense \nbecomes the malpractice insurer for that abortion provider, that \ncontract physician. It means that should there be a botched abortion, \nthat doctor doesn't have to worry about malpractice because it is the \nU.S. Government that will, in fact, indemnify those costs. The Senator \nis correct; it is a terrible liability we would be assuming.\n  Senator Murray, in her response to my questions, also said it was her \nunderstanding that her amendment would allow elective abortion \nprocedures to be performed in countries where abortion is prohibited by \nlaw. That is a very candid confession because that would dramatically \nchange current DOD policy. This amendment would, in fact, allow \nabortions to be performed in countries where it is against the law. \nThat includes South Korea, where we have 5,958 women serving. It \nincludes Germany, where there are 3,013 women serving. Over 9,000 women \nserve overseas.\n  We are not just changing one Department of Defense policy. We are \nchanging current policy that honors the laws of the countries in which \nthese men and women are serving, a dramatic change from current policy \nand one of which my colleagues certainly need to be aware.\n  Much of this debate has been about providing abortions to military \npersonnel overseas. The amendment would remove the restrictions on \nperforming abortions at all military hospitals, even in the United \nStates.\n  I urge my colleagues to look closely at the Murray amendment and \nexactly what it seeks to amend. I want my colleagues to be aware this \namendment permits abortions at any military facility overseas or in the \nUnited States. This is not a simple refinement of current policy. This \nis not something dealing with the quality and fairness.\n  It can be argued that if it does not overturn current DOD policy \nregarding countries where abortion is illegal, you are only going to \nexacerbate any disparity that exists by saying some women overseas \nwould be able to go to an American military facility and receive an \nabortion and others in countries where it was illegal would not. This \nis a dramatic change that would not only permit abortions in military \nfacilities overseas but would also make a dramatic change in military \nfacilities in the United States.\n  The arguments are clear and the arguments are persuasive. It is a \nmistake for this Congress to intervene and change current DOD policy, a \npolicy that has worked well, a policy that accommodates women in \nuniform who desire to have an abortion, but without turning the \nAmerican taxpayer into subsidizers of a practice that they find deeply, \ndeeply offensive.\n\n  In Senator Murray's response to my question regarding what this \namendment would do to our current policy regarding abortions in \ncountries where it is illegal, we could have a dramatic and detrimental \neffect on our diplomatic relationships with our allies. Would Saudi \nArabia continue to permit U.S. forces to remain if we permitted \nabortions at our facilities? How would the South Korean Government \nreact to having abortions, which are illegal in South Korea, performed \nat the U.S. military facilities? These are serious issues. This is not \nsomething to be trifled about in a 2-hour debate on the floor of the \nSenate, as if we are trying to provide equity and to be fair to our \nwomen and military overseas.\n  The evidence is clear. The Murray amendment violates the Hyde \nprovision in current law. The Hyde provision says we are not going to \nsubsidize abortions; we are not going to spend public funds for \nabortions. It is a provision that has wide, broad, bipartisan support \nacross this country. In fact, it is supported by both those who are \npro-choice and those who are pro-life, who believe, even if a woman has \nthis constitutional right, those who are offended by that, those who \nbelieve it is wrong, should not be required to subsidize it.\n  The Murray amendment chips away at that basic provision supported by \nthe American people. It says she may have to pay something, but we are \ngoing to use taxpayer-funded facilities, taxpayer supported and paid \nfor salaries, support staff, and equipment. If that is not subsidizing \nit, I am not sure what is. The Department of Defense has made it clear \nthat trying to calculate the infrastructure, support staff, salaries, \nand everything else that goes into a military health care facility \nsimply cannot currently, understandably, be computed on a case-by-case \nbasis.\n  The issue about indemnification of contracted doctors is a serious \nissue that bears very serious consideration by this Senate. It is an \nissue that has not been previously raised. Senator Murray said, yes, \nif, as in 1993 when not one physician in the military volunteered to \nperform abortions when the President said we were going to offer these \nservices in military facilities around the world, not one volunteered \nto do that, Senator Murray says in that circumstance, should that \nrecur, under her amendment we will go out and contract. If we go out \nand contract physicians, it is a very clear and explicit violation of \nthe Hyde amendment and, in addition, subjects the U.S. Government to \nuntold liability.\n  I believe men and women of good will differ and do sincerely differ \non the abortion issue. I do believe that men and women of good will, \nrespecting the sincere convictions of others, do not believe those who \nare offended by the practice of abortion should be required to \nsubsidize it. That is what is at issue. There can be no serious \nquestion. There can be no real debate that, in fact, by taking the step \nthe Murray amendment suggests, we are going to put the U.S. military in \nthe business of performing abortions. I don't believe that is supported \nby the American people. I don't believe that is in the spirit of the \nHyde law. I don't believe that meets the criteria of the letter of that \nlaw.\n  It would be a terrible mistake down the slippery slope of providing \nabortion in this country to pass the Murray amendment and, in so doing, \nmake millions and millions and millions of Americans who feel very \ndeeply about this issue involuntary contributors to the practice of \nabortion by having this procedure done in military facilities not only \noverseas but here in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I only have 33 seconds. I find it \nincredible that the argument has been made that if we allow women to \npay for their own abortions in military facilities overseas, it will \nundermine our relationships with our host countries. We have sovereign \nlaw that covers our military facilities. If we were to flip that \nargument, we could simply say that in a country that provides \nabortions, if we don't provide them in our hospitals, it may also \nseriously undermine our credibility.\n  This amendment is about allowing the women overseas who serve our \ncountry and fight for us every day the same rights as the women in this \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to send a \nmessage to the women who serve us overseas that we, too, will fight for \ntheir rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when all \ndebate time on the Murray amendment expires, there be an additional 20 \nminutes of debate relating to the hate crimes amendment, equally \ndivided between Senators Hatch and Kennedy. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that following that debate, there be 4 minutes equally divided \nfor closing remarks relative to the Murray amendment prior to the \nscheduled series of rollcall votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield any remaining time on our side.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3474\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the Murray amendment. \nWho yields time? The Senators from Massachusetts and Utah control time \non the debate on the Hatch amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, Senator Hatch will \ncontrol 10 minutes; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Senator Hatch controls \n10 minutes and Senator Kennedy controls 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment \nthat I have offered concerning the horrible crimes that are being \ncommitted in our country that have come to be known as hate crimes. \nThey are violent crimes that are committed against a victim because of \nthat victim's membership in a particular class or group. These crimes \nare abhorrent to me, and I believe to all Americans who think about it. \nThey should be stopped. That is why I have offered this amendment.\n  My amendment does two things. First, it requires that a comprehensive \nanalysis be conducted to determine whether State and local \njurisdictions are failing or refusing to prosecute hate-motivated \ncrimes to the fullest extent possible. Second, it provides assistance \nto State and local jurisdictions who lack the resources to carry out \ntheir duties of combating hate crimes.\n  Let me talk about the comprehensive study first. Under the Hate \nCrimes Statistics Act, data has been collected regarding the number of \nhate-motivated crimes that have been committed throughout the country. \nThis data, however, has never been properly analyzed to determine \nwhether States are abdicating their responsibility to investigate and \nprosecute hate crimes. My amendment calls for a comprehensive analysis \nof this raw data that would include a comparison of the records of \ndifferent jurisdictions--some with hate crimes laws, others without--to \ndetermine whether there, in fact, is a problem with the way certain \nStates are investigating and prosecuting these crimes.\n  Supporters of broad hate crimes legislation, like that proposed in \nthe Kennedy amendment, claim that there are States and localities that \nare unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It is unclear \nwhether this claim is true. There is precious little evidence showing \nthat there is a widespread problem with State and local police and \nprosecutors refusing to enforce the law when the victim is black, or a \nwoman, or gay, or disabled.\n  At the hearing on hate crimes legislation that we held in the \nJudiciary Committee, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder came to \ntestify and explain the reasons why the Justice Department supports the \nexpansive legislation proposed by Senator Kennedy. I asked Mr. Holder \nthe rather basic and straightforward question of whether he could \nidentify ``any specific instances in which State law enforcement \nauthorities have deliberately failed to enforce the law against the \nperpetrator of a crime.'' After he gave a somewhat non-responsive \nanswer, I asked him again: ``Can you give me specific instances where \nthe States have failed in their duty to investigate and prosecute hate \ncrimes?'' Mr. Holder could not. He then indicated that he would go back \nto the Justice Department, conduct some research, and then provide the \nJudiciary Committee with the specific instances for which I asked.\n  In a subsequent response to written questions, the Justice Department \nidentified three cases in which the Justice Department ``filed charges \nagainst defendants . . . after determining that the state response was \ninadequate to vindicate the federal interest.'' In addition, the \nDepartment identified two cases where the Justice Department determined \nthat the State could not ``respond as effectively as the Federal \nGovernment because, for example, State penalties are less severe.'' \nThese five cases hardly show wholesale abdication of prosecutorial \nresponsibilities by State and local prosecutors. To the contrary, these \ncases show that State and local authorities are vigorously combating \nhate crimes and, where necessary, cooperating with Federal officials \nwho may assist them in investigating, charging, and trying these \ndefendants.\n\n  During the debate yesterday, Senator Kennedy indicated that the \nJustice Department had produced additional examples of cases where \nState and local prosecutors have failed or refused to prosecute hate \ncrimes. There are three of these additional cases. I have to say, \nhowever, that the three additional cases produced by the Justice \nDepartment and cited by Senator Kennedy do not establish that State and \nlocal authorities are unwilling to combat hate crimes.\n  So where does that leave us? We are being asked to enact a broad \nfederalization of all hate-motivated crimes that historically have been \nhandled at the State and local level because, it is argued, States and \nlocal authorities are either unable or unwilling to prosecute them. My \namendment's grant program addresses the first concern--that States and \nlocalities, because of a lack of resources, are unable to prosecute \nthese crimes. If there is not enough money there, let's put enough \nmoney into the bill. I am not against increasing the sums. As for the \nsecond concern, we are being asked to conclude that States and \nlocalities are unwilling to prosecute hate-motivated crimes on the \nbasis of eight cases--eight cases out of the thousands and thousands of \ncriminal cases that are brought each year. Eight cases, I might add, \nthat at the very least are equivocal on the issue of whether States and \nlocalities are failing or refusing to prosecute hate crimes.\n  Supporters of the Kennedy amendment also cite to the horrible beating \ndeath of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, WY, and the dragging death of \nJames Byrd, Jr. in Jasper, TX, as evidence that there is a problem that \nCongress should address. But the Shepard and Byrd cases prove my point. \nBoth were fully prosecuted by local authorities who sought and obtained \nconvictions. In the Byrd case, the defendants were given the death \npenalty--something that would not be permitted under the Kennedy \namendment.\n  This is not a case where my mind is made up; where no matter what \nevidence I am shown of dereliction by State and local authorities in \nthe area of hate crimes, I would say that it is not enough, or is not \nsufficient for me to believe that there is a problem. I am open to the \npossibility that State and local authorities are not doing their part. \nI hope that is not true, but my mind is not made up. That is why my \namendment calls for a comprehensive study that would carefully and \nthoroughly and objectively study the data we have collected to see if \nthere is a disparity in the investigation and prosecution of hate \ncrimes. If there is a problem with prosecution at the State level, then \nI am on record calling for an effective and responsible Federal \nresponse.\n  To summarize: My amendment calls for a comprehensive analysis of hate \ncrimes statistics to determine whether, in fact, any State and local \nlaw enforcement authorities are unwilling, for whatever reason, to \ncombat these horrific crimes. Even if the eight cases identified by the \nJustice Department did show that State and local authorities were \nunwilling to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes, they \nstill would only be eight cases out of the thousands and thousands of \ncases that are brought each year. They simply do not show a widespread \nproblem regarding State and local prosecution of hate-motivated crime.\n\n  In fact, if you look at them it show that the system is working and \nthe two bodies, the State and local prosecutors and the Federal \nprosecutors generally work together and they simply do not show a \nwidespread problem regarding State and local prosecutions of hate-\nmotivated crime.\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n  Reasonable people should agree that an analysis of the hate crimes \nstatistics that have been collected ought to be conducted to determine \nwhether there is anything to the argument that State and local \nauthorities are failing to combat hate crimes. If the study shows that \nState and local authorities are derelict in their duties when it comes \nto hate crimes, I will be the first to support legislation targeted at \nsuch government conduct.\n  The second main thing that my amendment does is create a grant \nprogram to help provide resources to States and local jurisdictions to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. Supporters of the \nKennedy amendment claim that some State and local jurisdictions do not \nhave adequate resources to combat hate crimes. They say that these \njurisdictions, while willing to combat hate crimes, are unable to do so \nbecause they lack the resources. My amendment answers this very real \nconcern. My amendment would equip States and localities with the \nresources necessary so that they can combat such crimes. And my \nAmendment would do so without federalizing every hate-motivated crime.\n  Now, I should make clear what my amendment does not do. It does not \ncreate a new federal crime. It does not federalize crimes motivated \nbecause of a person's membership in a particular class or group. Such \nfederalization would, in my estimation, be unconstitutional and would \nunduly burden federal law enforcement, federal prosecutors and federal \ncourts.\n  I must say that the serious constitutional questions that are raised \nby the Kennedy amendment's broad federalization of what are now State \ncrimes is its greatest drawback. The intention of Senator Kennedy's \namendment--to combat hate-motivated crimes--is certainly praiseworthy. \nBut the Kennedy amendment's method for achieving this laudable aim--by \nmaking a federal case out of every hate-motivated crime--is not. If \nenacted, the Kennedy amendment likely will be struck down as \nunconstitutional. As I discussed at length yesterday, Congress simply \ndoes not have the authority to enact such broad legislation under \neither Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Commerce Clause. \nThis is clear in light of the Supreme Court's decision last month in \nUnited States v. Morrison.\n\n  During the debate yesterday it was argued that the Thirteenth \nAmendment provides Congress with the authority to enact the Kennedy \namendment. I respectfully disagree. The Thirteenth Amendment provides:\n\n       Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a \n     punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly \n     convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place \n     subject to their jurisdiction. Congress shall have the power \n     to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\n  Under this amendment, Congress is authorized to prohibit private \naction that constitutes a badge, incident or relic of slavery. An \nargument could perhaps be made that the failure or refusal by State \nauthorities to investigate and prosecute crimes committed because the \nvictim is an African-American constitutes a badge or incident or relic \nof slavery. But while this creative, Thirteenth Amendment argument \npossibly may work for federal regulation of hate crimes committed \nagainst African-Americans, it simply does not work for federal \nregulation of hate crimes against women, or gays, or the disabled, as \nthe Thirteenth Amendment applies only to the badges or incidents or \nrelics of slavery. At no time in our nation's history, thank goodness, \nhave our laws sanctioned the enslavement of women, homosexuals or the \ndisabled.\n  Supporters of the Kennedy amendment argued yesterday that the Justice \nDepartment has placed its stamp of approval on this creative, \nThirteenth Amendment argument. I am fairly confident, however, \nnotwithstanding the Justice Department's opinion, that the Supreme \nCourt will not interpret the Thirteenth Amendment so expansively.\n  In conclusion, it is my hope that my colleagues who intend to vote \nfor the Kennedy amendment will also support my amendment. While I \nstrongly disagree with the approach taken by the Kennedy amendment, the \ntwo amendments are not inconsistent. My amendment provides for a strong \nand workable assistance program for State and local law enforcement. \nIndeed, it has the support of the National District Attorneys \nAssociation. Further, my amendment requires a comprehensive study so \nthat we can really learn what, if any, problems and difficulties exist \nat the State and local level.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to support the Smith-Kennedy \nlegislation. This legislation will simply strengthen existing hate \ncrime laws by enhancing the Federal Government's ability to assist \nState and local prosecutions. It is a little bit like Project Exile, \nwhich is so much in vogue and which has been practiced so successfully \nin Richmond, VA. This will allow the resources of the Department of \nJustice to be made available where appropriate to investigate and \nprosecute those in our society who commit acts of brutality based on \nhate. The dragging death of James Byrd, Jr., an African American man in \nJasper, TX, the torture and death of Matthew Shepard, a homosexual male \nin Laramie, WY, shocked the national conscience. Hate crimes have \noccurred in the Commonwealth of Virginia as well.\n  In 1999, a man was sentenced to life in prison and fined $100,000 for \nhis role in the death of an African American man who was beheaded and \nburned in Independence, VA. And a homosexual man was murdered and his \nsevered head was left atop a footbridge near the James River in \nRichmond, VA. It is hard to imagine the pain and suffering of the \nvictims and their families.\n  This legislation does not allow individuals to be prosecuted for \ntheir hateful thoughts; rather it allows them to be punished for their \nhateful acts. Willfully inflicting harm on another human being based on \nhate is not protected free speech. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and demonstrate our commitment to eradicate the hate.\n  I reserve any time remaining to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of \nthe Kennedy-Smith amendment. I also rise to announce my support for the \namendment offered by Senator Hatch. I ask my colleagues, in voting for \nSenator Hatch's amendment, to vote for Senator Kennedy's as well. It is \nfine to study, but I think we know enough. We know that hate crimes are \nalready committed in our society.\n  When I, as a human being, wake up to read headlines of a black man \ndragged to death and a gay man beaten to death, I want to do something. \nI believe in the separation of State governments and the Federal \nGovernment. I understand all of that. But doggone it, it is OK for the \nFederal Government to show up to work. It is time for us to say as \nRepublicans and Democrats that we want to make a difference. We want \nour police officers to help not primarily but secondarily and to be \nthere to teach, to prosecute, and to pursue those who commit the most \nmalignant of crimes.\n  I say to my colleagues, there are two critical words, in my view, \nmissing in Senator Hatch's amendment. The words are ``sexual \norientation,'' as it applies to making it a Federal crime. I never \nthought I would be on the Senate floor saying this until I saw the \nreport of Matthew Shepard's death. I began to ask myself what I could \ndo.\n  Many in the Senate are reflexively inclined to vote no on the Kennedy \namendment because of feelings of religious reluctance. I understand \nthat because I shared those feelings for a long time. Then I happened \nupon a story in a book that I regard as Scripture. It is in the eighth \nchapter of John when the Founder of the Christian faith was confronted \nby the Pharisees and the Sadducees of His day with a hate crime. A \nwoman who was caught in the very act was to be stoned to death. What \ndid He do? His response was to speak in such a way to shame the self-\nrighteous and\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\nthe sanctimonious to drop their stones, and He saved her life. We \nshould do the same.\n\n  I do not believe on that day He endorsed her lifestyle anymore than I \nbelieve anyone here will be endorsing any lifestyle if they vote for \nthe Kennedy-Smith amendment. I believe what my colleagues will be doing \nis following an example that says when it comes to violence and hatred, \nwe can stand up for one another. No matter our distinctions, no matter \nour uniqueness, no matter our peculiarities, no matter how we pray or \nhow we sin, we can stand up for each other, and we can stand up against \nhate.\n  I say to my colleagues: Vote for Senator Hatch's amendment. It is \nfine, but it does not go far enough, in my view, and it is time to go \nfar enough to include this group of Americans who are not now included \nin a current Federal law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I conclude with this plea: Put \ndown the stone and cast a vote based on love, cast a vote against \nhatred and vote for the Kennedy-Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Utah \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 52 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Oregon made \nmy case. I decry what happened in the Matthew Shepard case. I decry \nwhat happened in the James Byrd case. Those horrific crimes, however, \nwere investigated by local authorities and prosecuted by local \nprosecutors. In both instances, the local prosecutors obtained \nappropriate sentences--life terms in the case of the Shepard defendants \nand death sentences in the case of the Byrd defendants. Local law \nenforcement and local prosecutors did their jobs and investigated and \nprosecuted truly awful hate crimes.\n  All of these horrible examples of hate crimes were handled properly \nby State and local authorities. That is why my amendment is strongly \nsupported by the National District Attorneys Association, the major \norganization that represents State and local prosecutors throughout the \ncountry.\n  The National District Attorneys Association has endorsed my amendment \nbecause State and local prosecutors believe that the assistance offered \nin my amendment would be very helpful to them as they seek to fight \nhate-motivated crime.\n  In a letter of support, the National District Attorneys Association \nalso states that it strongly endorses my amendment because my amendment \n``appropriately recognizes that local law enforcement has the primary \nresponsibility to safeguard their citizens while working as a team with \nthe Federal Government.''\n  I have at least a couple of problems with the Kennedy amendment. \nFirst, it is unconstitutional. The Morrison case, decided only a month \nago, is directly on point and leads to the inexorable conclusion that \nthe Kennedy amendment, if adopted, will be struck down as \nunconstitutional. Second, the Kennedy amendment is overbroad. It would \nmake a federal case out of every single hate-motivated crime that \noccurs in this country--including all rapes and sexual assaults, which \ncurrently are prosecuted under State law. Can you imagine what will \nhappen if our Federal courts are clogged with all the rape cases in \nthis country that are currently being handled very well by State and \nlocal prosecutors? That is why the National District Attorneys \nAssociation is strongly supportive of what I am trying to do here \ntoday.\n  My amendment takes action with regard to the horrible crimes that are \nbeing committed in our country that have come to be known as hate \ncrimes. They are violent crimes that are committed against a victim \nbecause of that victim's membership in a particular class or group. \nThese crimes are abhorrent to me, and to all Americans. They should be \nstopped. That is why I have offered this amendment.\n  My amendment does two things. First, it requires that a comprehensive \nanalysis be conducted to determine whether State and local \njurisdictions are failing or refusing to prosecute hate-motivated \ncrimes to the fullest extent possible. Second, it provides assistance \nto State and local jurisdictions who lack the resources to carry out \ntheir duties of combating hate crimes.\n  Let me talk about the comprehensive study first. Under the Hate \nCrimes Statistics Act, which I worked to get enacted in 1990, data has \nbeen collected regarding the number of hate-motivated crimes that have \nbeen committed throughout the country. This data, however, has never \nbeen properly analyzed to determine whether States are abdicating their \nresponsibility to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. My amendment \ncalls for a comprehensive analysis of this raw data that would include \na comparison of the records of different jurisdictions--some with hate \ncrimes laws, others without--to determine whether there, in fact, is a \nproblem with the way certain States are investigating and prosecuting \nthese crimes.\n  Supporters of broad hate crimes legislation, like that proposed in \nthe Kennedy amendment, claim that there are States and localities that \nare unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It is unclear \nwhether this claim is true. There is little or no evidence showing that \nthere is a widespread problem with State and local police and \nprosecutors refusing to enforce the law when the victim is black, or a \nwoman, or gay, or disabled. Of the thousands--perhaps hundreds of \nthousands--of criminal cases that are brought every year, the Justice \nDepartment could identify only five cases where it believed that it \ncould have done a better job than the States in prosecuting a \nparticular hate crime. In each of these five cases, however, the States \neither investigated and prosecuted the hate crime themselves, or worked \nwith the federal government to investigate and prosecute the hate \ncrime. In none of these cases did the perpetrator of the hate crime \nescape the heavy hand of the law.\n  In United States v. Lee and Jarrad, a 1994 case from Georgia, the \nState obtained a guilty plea from one of the defendants and, after \ninvestigating the matter for several months, determined that there was \ninsufficient evidence to prosecute the other defendant.\n  In United States v. Black and Clark, a 1991 case from California, the \ncounty sheriff--who lacked resources--ceded investigatory authority to \nthe FBI after the federal government indicated its desire to \ninvestigate and prosecute the case. Because the defendants were charged \nfederally, State prosecutors declined to bring State charges. My \namendment would provide grants for similarly situated Sheriffs who \noperate on a tight budget.\n  In United States v. Bledsoe, a 1983 case from Kansas, the State \nprosecuted the defendant for homicide and, after a trial, the defendant \nwas acquitted. The Justice Department then brought federal charges and \nobtained a life sentence.\n  In United States v. Mungia, Mungia and Martin, a Texas case, state \nprosecutors worked with federal prosecutors and agreed that federal \ncharges were preferable because (1) the defendants could be tried \njointly in federal court and (2) overcrowding in State prisons might \nhave led to the defendants serving less than their full sentences.\n  And, in United States v. Lane and Pierce, a 1987 case from Colorado, \nState prosecutors worked with federal prosecutors and agreed that \nfederal charges were preferable because most of the witnesses were in \nfederal custody in several different States.\n  These five cases hardly show wholesale abdication of prosecutorial \nresponsibility by State and local prosecutors. To the contrary, these \ncases show that State and local authorities are vigorously combating \nhate crimes and, where necessary, cooperating with federal officials \nwho may assist them in investigating, charging, and trying these \ndefendants.\n  During the debate yesterday, Senator Kennedy indicated that the \nJustice Department had produced to the Judiciary Committee additional \nexamples of cases where State and local prosecutors have failed or \nrefused to prosecute hate crimes.\n  In fact, the Justice Department did identify three additional cases \nto Senator Kennedy. However of these three additional cases produced by \nthe Justice Department and cited by Senator\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\nKennedy, none establishes that State and local authorities are \nunwilling to combat hate crimes.\n  In the 1984 case of United States v. Kila, the State authorities who \nwere investigating the case requested that the Justice Department \nbecome involved in the case and bring federal charges. A federal jury \nthen acquitted the defendants of the federal charges.\n  In a 1982 case that the Justice Department does not name, the \ndefendant was acquitted of federal charges; the Justice Department does \nnot state whether State charges were brought or whether the local \nprosecutors simply deferred to the federal prosecutors.\n  And, in United States v. Franklin, a 1980 case from Indiana, the \ndefendant was acquitted of federal charges; again, the Justice \nDepartment does not state whether State charges were brought or whether \nlocal prosecutors deferred to federal prosecutors.\n  In summary, my amendment calls for a comprehensive analysis of hate \ncrimes statistics to determine whether, in fact, any State and local \nlaw enforcement authorities are unwilling, for whatever reason, to \ncombat these horrific crimes.\n  Even if the eight cases I have just discussed did show that State and \nlocal authorities were unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate-\nmotivated crimes, they still would only be eight cases out of the \nthousands and thousands of cases that are brought each year. In no way \ndo they show a widespread problem regarding State and local prosecution \nof hate-motivated crime. Reasonable people should agree that an \nanalysis of the hate crimes statistics that have been collected ought \nto be conducted to determine whether there is anything to the argument \nthat State and local authorities are failing to combat hate rimes. If \nthe study shows that State and local authorities are derelict in their \nduties when it comes to hate crimes, I will be the first to support \nlegislation targeted at such government conduct.\n\n  The second main thing that my amendment does is create a grant \nprogram to help provide resources to States and local jurisdictions to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. Supporters of the \nKennedy amendment claim that some State and local jurisdictions do not \nhave adequate resources to combat hate crimes. They say that these \njurisdictions, while willing to combat hate crimes, are unable to do so \nbecause they lack the resources. My amendment seeks to answer this very \nreal concern. My amendment would equip States and localities with the \nresources necessary so that they can combat such crimes. And my \namendment would do so without federalizing every hate-motivated crime.\n  Now, I should make clear what my amendment does not do. It does not \ncreate a new federal crime. It does not federalize crimes motivated \nbecause of a persons's membership in a particular class or group. Such \nfederalization would, in my estimation, be unconstitutional and would \nunduly burden federal law enforcement, federal prosecutors and federal \ncourts.\n  I must say that the serious constitutional questions that are raised \nby the Kennedy amendment's broad federalization of what now are State \ncrimes is its greatest drawback. The intention of Senator Kenndy's \namendment--to combat hate-motivated crimes--is certainly praiseworthy. \nBut the Kennedy amendment's method for achieving this laudable aim--by \nmaking a federal case out of every hate-motivated crime--is not. If \nenacted, the Kennedy amendment likely will be struck down as \nunconstitutional. As I discussed at length yesterday, Congress simply \ndoes not have the authority to enact such broad legislation under \neither Section 5 of the 14th amendment or the commerce clause. This is \nclear in light of the Supreme Court's decision last month in United \nStates v. Morrison.\n  During the debate yesterday it was argued that the 13th amendment \nprovides Congress with the authority to enact the legislation proposed \nin the Kennedy amendment. I respectfully disagree. The 13th amendment \nprovides: ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a \npunishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, \nshall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their \njurisdiction. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by \nappropriate legislation.'' An argument could perhaps be made that the \nfailure or refusal by State authorities to investigate and prosecute \ncrimes committed because the victim is an African-American constitutes \nat badge or incident of slavery. But while this creative 13th amendment \nargument possibly may work for federal regulation of hate crimes \ncommitted against African-Americans, it simply does not work for \nfederal regulation of hate crimes against women, or gays, or the \ndisabled, as the 13th amendment applies only to the badges or incidents \nor relics of slavery. At no time in our nation's history, thank \ngoodness, have our laws sanctioned the enslavement of women, \nhomosexuals, or the disabled.\n  Supporters of the Kennedy amendment argued yesterday that the Justice \nDepartment has placed its stamp of approval on this creative 13th \namendment argument. I am fairly confident, however, notwithstanding the \nJustice Department's opinion, that the Supreme Court will not interpret \nthe 13th amendment so expansively.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy \namendment. It almost certainly is unconstitutional, given the current \nstate of constitutional law. In addition, it is bad policy to enact a \nbroad federalization of what traditionally have been State crimes--\ncrimes that are, by all accounts, being vigorously investigated and \nprosecuted at the State and local level.\n  I also would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment \nthat I have offered. It calls for a study of the way States are dealing \nwith the problem of hate crimes and provides grants to States so they \nwill have the resources to continue their efforts. And, my amendment \nhas the added benefit of being constitutional. For the reasons that I \nhave stated, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy and those who are supporting his amendment \nin the sense that all of us should be against this type of tyranny, \nthis type of criminal activity that is motivated by hate, this type of \nmean, venal, vile conduct that lessens our society. But nobody should \nmake the mistake of not understanding that I do not think the case has \nbeen made that States and localities are unwilling to combat hate \ncrimes. In the cases I have seen, the evidence is to the contrary: \nStates and localities are leading the fight against hate-motivated \ncrimes. The only way to resolve this issue regarding the willingness of \nthe States to engage in the fight against hate crimes is to do what I \nsuggest: conduct a thoroughgoing study of the hate crimes statistics \nthat we do have to see if, in fact, States and local jurisdictions are \nnot doing their jobs. I, for one, do not believe that the case has been \nmade against local prosecutors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator's time has expired. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor yielding, and I thank the Senator from Oregon for his leadership.\n  Right above the Presiding Officer's chair it says: E Pluribus Unum, \nthe motto of the United States, Out of Many One. Every hate crime puts \na dagger into the heart of America, puts a dagger into our national \nmotto, Out of Many One.\n  We have federalized so many crimes--gun crimes, drug crimes, car \njacking, capital crimes. Why, we might ask, is the only crime we do not \nwant to federalize that of hate?\n  Ask yourself that question, my colleagues. Why? They are every bit as \ntroubling to America as other crimes, perhaps more so because they \nstrike at the very fabric of what this country is about: E Pluribus \nUnum.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy-Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  Mr. President, hate crimes are a national disgrace, and they attack \neverything for which this country stands. We, as a Congress, must take \na clear and unequivocal stand. We have the opportunity to do so this \nafternoon. It ought to be bipartisan, and it ought to be an \noverwhelming statement of law.\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\n  As a country and as a people, we are committed to equal protection \nunder the law. We all take pride in that. We do not say we have equal \nprotection under the law only if you are a white male. We do not say we \nhave equal protection under the law if you have no disability. We are \nnot going to say we have equal protection under the law only if you are \n``straight.''\n  We say equal protection under the law must apply to all Americans. \nThat is what this is about. The Hatch amendment is a study. We are \nbeyond studying. The American people want action on hate crimes. That \nis what our amendment does, very simply.\n  We ought to have the support of the overwhelming majority of the \nMembers of this body. Hate crimes are rooted in hatred and bigotry. If \nAmerica is ever going to be America, we should root out hatred and \nbigotry. We do not have all of the answers, but we ought to be able to \nuse the full force of our power to make sure we are going to do \neverything we can--that we are not going to stand alongside but are \ngoing to be involved in freeing this country from hate crimes. Our \namendment will do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the amendment has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3252\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we will revert to \nthe Murray amendment, on which there are 4 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on an amendment that \nwill simply allow a woman who serves us overseas in the military to go \nto a military facility, if she so chooses, to have an abortion that is \nsafe and legal.\n  Current law requires that a woman who serves us overseas go to her \ncommanding officer and ask for permission to fly home on a military \ntransport, at taxpayer expense--as I say, at taxpayer expense--to fly \nhome on a military jet to have access to what is legally given to every \nwoman in this country today.\n  I heard our opponents say that this is an issue of taxpayer-funded \nabortions. I disagree. The amendment disagrees. This will say that \nwomen will pay for their own abortions in the military facilities.\n  We ask women to serve us, to fight for our rights, to go overseas in \nconditions that are often intolerable, to fight for this country. In \nreturn, we tell them that a decision that should be theirs, and their \nfamilies, along with their physician and their own religion, is no \nlonger a private issue for them.\n  From women who serve us, we take away a right that has been \nestablished in this country for many years, and we tell them, if you \nserve in the military, that right is taken away from you. We are asking \nthem to fight for our rights, but we are essentially taking away their \nrights.\n  This restores that right to women who serve us overseas, to have an \nabortion, if they so choose. This applies to military families--to \nwives and daughters, as well.\n  I ask my colleagues to simply say to the women who serve us overseas \nthat we support you as much as we ask you to support us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I hope everybody will read the Murray \namendment. In fact, there is nowhere in this amendment that it says a \nwoman who is seeking an abortion overseas has to pay for it. There is \nnowhere that it says that. But the current policy in fact is that \nservicewomen serving overseas do not forfeit their right to obtain an \nabortion. They may request leave. They fly to the United States, or \nanother country, on a military aircraft, on a space-available basis. \nThe flights are for $10.\n  This amendment should be tabled for a number of reasons. It violates \nthe Hyde amendment. The Department of Defense has said you cannot \ncalculate reimbursement on a case-by-case basis, even if it did say a \nwoman was going to pay.\n  As Senator Murray said, you would have to contract with physicians. \nThat puts us in the position of violating the Hyde amendment by paying \nthese physicians to come into military hospitals to perform abortions.\n  It is going to create untold diplomatic dilemmas because, as Senator \nMurray said, her amendment will require abortions to be performed in \ncountries that prohibit abortions, such as Saudi Arabia and South \nKorea. It is going to be a thumb in the eye of our allies. It is going \nto create untold diplomatic problems.\n  Finally, it turns military hospitals into abortion providers. That is \nnot what we want. That is not what the American people want. It is \ngoing to make millions and millions of Americans, pro-life Americans, \nwho have deeply held beliefs about this issue, subsidizers of a \npractice they find offensive and morally wrong.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in tabling the Murray amendment. I \nmove to table the amendment, Mr. President, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to table Murray amendment No. 3252. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3474\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 4 minutes \nof debate equally divided before a vote on an amendment by the Senator \nfrom Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what happened to James Byrd and Matthew \nShepard should not happen in a great nation such as ours. Hate crimes \nare abysmal. They are horrible. We should all be against them.\n  My amendment does two things. First, it requires that a comprehensive \nanalysis be conducted to determine whether or not State and local \njurisdictions are failing or refusing to prosecute hate-motivated \ncrimes to the fullest extent of the law. Second, it provides monetary \nassistance to State and local jurisdictions who lack the resources to \ncombat hate crimes.\n  My amendment is strongly supported by the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the major organization that represents State and local \nprosecutors throughout the country. The National District Attorneys \nAssociation endorsed my amendment because State and local prosecutors \nbelieve that the assistance offered in my amendment would be helpful to \nthem as they seek to fight hate-motivated crime.\n  In a letter, the National District Attorneys Association also states \nthat it strongly endorses my amendment because my amendment \n``appropriately recognizes that local law enforcement has the primary \nresponsibility to safeguard their citizens while working as a team with \nthe Federal Government.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       National District Attorneys\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: As President of the National District \n     Attorneys Association I want to offer our strong support for \n     your Hate Crimes amendment to the Department of Defense \n     Authorization bill.\n       I am aware that several hate crimes proposals are under \n     consideration by the Senate and want to take this opportunity \n     to particularly emphasize the necessity for your concept to \n     be adopted. What you would provide to local law enforcement \n     is the ability to respond more effectively, and more \n     efficiently, in the face of a crime, that in addition to the \n     physical wounds and injuries of the victims', could very well \n     pose a serious threat to the tranquility and safety of our \n     community as well.\n       As you well know the majority of hate crime cases, despite \n     any federal interest or efforts, have been, and will remain, \n     the providence of local law enforcement efforts. The \n     emergency grants provisions and access to federal technical \n     assistance that you are proposing would provide invaluable \n     assistance to us. When faced with tragedies such as those in \n     Texas or Wyoming the ability to call upon extra resources \n     could make all the difference, particularly in our smaller \n     jurisdictions.\n       Moreover, your recognition of the necessity to provide this \n     help under sometimes more expansive state hate crimes \n     statutes, appropriately recognizes that local law enforcement \n     has the primary responsibility to safeguard their citizens \n     while working as a team with the federal government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stuart VanMeveren,\n\n   District Attorney, 8th Judicial District, Fort Collins, Colorado, \n                               President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Supporters of the Kennedy amendment want to enact a broad \nfederalization of all hate-motivated crimes because, they argue, some \nState and local authorities are unable to investigate and prosecute \nhate crimes because of the lack of resources.\n  My amendment will solve this problem by establishing a grant program \nto provide financial assistance to State and local jurisdictions for \nthe investigation and prosecution of hate crimes.\n  Supporters of the Kennedy amendment also argue that we should make a \nFederal case out of every hate-motivated crime because some States and \nlocales are unwilling to engage in the fight against hate crimes. There \nis little or no evidence, however, that shows that States and \nlocalities are being derelict in their duties to enforce the law.\n  Supporters of the Kennedy amendment cite the horrible beating death \nof Matthew Shepard in Laramie, WY, and the dragging death of James \nByrd, Jr. in Jasper, TX, as evidence that there is a problem that \nCongress should address. The Shepard and Byrd cases, however, both were \nfully prosecuted by local authorities who sought and obtained \nconvictions. In the Byrd case, local prosecutors obtained the death \npenalty--something that would not be permitted under the Kennedy \namendment.\n  Moreover, the Justice Department has identified only eight cases in \nwhich, in the Justice Department's view, States or localities were \nunwilling to investigate and prosecute a hate-motivated crime. Of the \nthousands and thousands of criminal cases that are brought each year, \nthe Justice Department could identify only eight cases. These eight \ncases, I might add, are at the very least equivocal on the issue of \nwhether States and localities are failing or refusing to prosecute hate \ncrimes.\n  Because the evidence is so scarce on the issue of whether States and \nlocalities are unwilling to combat hate crimes, my amendment provides \nfor a comprehensive study to see if there really is a problem with \nState and local prosecution of hate crimes. Studying this issue to see \nif there really is a problem seems to me to be a reasonable course of \naction.\n  Even if it could be clearly shown that States and localities were \nfailing or refusing to investigate and prosecute hate crimes, the \napproach taken by the Kennedy amendment raises serious constitutional \nquestions, especially in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision \nlast month in United States v. Morrison. As written, the Kennedy \namendment likely would be held to be unconstitutional under the \ncommerce clause, the 13th amendment, the 14th amendment, and quite \npossibly, the 1st amendment.\n  In conclusion, it is my hope that those of my colleagues who intend \nto vote for the Kennedy amendment also will support my amendment. While \nI disagree with the approach taken by Senator Kennedy, our two \namendments are not inconsistent. My amendment provides for an effective \nand workable assistance program for State and local law enforcement, a \nprogram that enjoys the strong support of the National District \nAttorneys Association. And, it requires a comprehensive study so that \nwe can really learn what, if any, problems and difficulties exist at \nthe State and local level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the amendment which will give \njurisdiction to the Federal Government over hate crimes. Ordinarily, I \nsupport jurisdiction for the district attorney. Senator Hatch points \nout the National District Attorneys Association has taken on a \nposition. I was a long-term member of that association as district \nattorney of Philadelphia. The fact is, prosecutors are county officials \nof the State system. There are great pressures against prosecutions \nwhere there is a matter of sexual orientation, or where there may be a \nmatter of race, or where there may be a matter of religion or other \nhate-related crimes.\n  That is why I believe this is a unique field where the Federal \nGovernment ought to be involved. Ordinarily, it should be up to the \nlocal prosecutor. That is a principle to which I subscribe. But here it \nought to be a matter for the Federal Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hatch amendment \nand in support of the approach taken by Senator Kennedy. I do so \nbecause I believe that an 18-month study is no adequate substitute for \nthe prompt, vigorous, assurance of civil rights for every American.\n  The crimes described in Senator Kennedy's approach are not ordinary \noffenses. They strike at the heart of a pluralistic society. They \nstrike at all of us, not just the individual victims. We need to look \nno further, colleagues, than to the Balkans to see what happens when \nthe genie of intolerance and hate is unleashed upon an unhappy land.\n  We must not let that happen. We must not. We fought a civil war in \nour country to establish the basic principle that certain rights should \nbe guaranteed to every American, regardless of their State of \nresidency. We fight to reestablish that principle once again today.\n  Mr. President, if a study is in order, let it be in addition to \nestablishing these basic rights, not as a replacement therefore.\n  Now is the time for action. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Hatch \namendment and to support Senator Kennedy in his approach.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy to expand the definitions of federally protected hate crimes.\n  I am concerned that this amendment would be challenged on \nConstitutional grounds and would not stand up to the scrutiny. I \nbelieve that categorizing hate crimes based on race, religion, or \nethnicity as ``badges and incidents'' of slavery and relying on the \nThirteenth Amendment is a tenuous argument. Furthermore, recent Supreme \nCourt decisions finding that legislation federalizing what are \ntraditionally State crimes exceeded Congress' powers under the \nFourteenth Amendment, raise Constitutional concerns about the Kennedy \namendment. The Kennedy amendment seeks to criminalize private conduct \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. In United States v. Morrison, the \nUnited States Supreme Court reaffirmed that legislation enacted by \nCongress under the Fourteenth Amendment may only criminalize State \naction, not individual action. I fear the Kennedy amendment will not \nsurvive a court challenge.\n  I further oppose the Kennedy amendment because I feel it did not go \nfar enough in providing penalties for hate crimes. It did not include \nthe death penalty for the newly created federal hate crimes.\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\n  I support Senator Hatch's amendment that will allow for study and \nanalysis of this important issue and provide additional resources for \nstate and local entities in investigating and prosecuting existing hate \ncrime statutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two amendments to \nS. 2549, the Department of Defense Authorization bill. Specifically, I \nwish to discuss Senator Kennedy's amendment and Senator Hatch's \namendment, both of which deal with hate crimes.\n  Typically defined, a hate crime is a crime in which the perpetrator \nintentionally selects a victim because of the victim's actual or \nperceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, \ndisability, or sexual orientation.\n  Mr. President, I deplore all acts of violence. But, I must say, that \nI personally find hate crimes to be particularly horrific. Crimes \ncommitted against someone simply because of that person's race, color, \nreligion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual \norientation are, in fact, different types of crimes.\n  In 1998, James Byrd, Jr. was beaten, tied to the back of a pickup \ntruck, and dragged to death along a Texas road. Why? for one reason and \none reason only: Mr. Byrd was black.\n  Later in 1998, Matthew Shepard was beaten, tied to a fence in \nWyoming, and left to die. Why? For one reason and on reason only: Mr. \nShepard was homosexual.\n  These brutal murders shocked me and shocked our Nation. James Byrd \nand Matthew Shepard were killed not for what they did, but simply \nbecause who they were.\n  Our country's greatest strength is its diversity. While it is true \nthat certain people might not approve or might not agree with another \nperson's religion or sexual orientation, or might not like someone's \ncolor, we must not, I repeat, we must not tolerate acts of violence \nthat spur from one individual's intolerance of a particular group.\n  Hate crimes do tear at the fiber of who we are in this country. The \nUnited States is a country of inclusion, not exclusion. Hate crimes, \nunlike other acts of violence, are meant to not just torture and punish \nthe victim, such crimes are meant to send a resounding message to the \ncommunity that differences are not acceptable.\n  In 1990, I was pleased to vote in support of the Hate Crimes \nStatistic Act. This act required the Attorney General of the United \nStates to gather and publish data about crimes ``that manifest evidence \nof prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or \nethnicity.'' In addition, in 1994, I was pleased to support the \nViolence Against Women's Act. This important legislation provides \nfunding for many important programs, including funding to prosecute \noffenders, funding to help victims of violence, grants for training of \nvictim advocates and counselors and grants for battered women's \nshelters, to name but a few.\n  Presently before the United States Senate is an amendment offered by \nSenator Kennedy, entitled the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of \n2000. This legislation, essentially, would amend current law to make it \na federal crime to willfully cause bodily injury to any person because \nof the victim's actual or perceived race, color, national origin, \nreligion, gender, sexual orientation or disability. This is a great \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction. Current federal hate crimes law \ncovers race, religion, and national origin so long as the victim is \nengaged in one of six federally protected activities. The Kennedy \namendment would expand federal jurisdiction into certain murder, \nassault and battery cases and possibly all rape cases.\n  As a United States Senator, I believe that before the Congress passes \nlegislation that would vastly expand federal criminal jurisdiction, we \nmust take into consideration two important factors: the need for the \nlegislation and the constitutionality of the legislation.\n  The horrific murders of James Byrd and Matthew Shepard certainly \ncause strong emotional feelings that would lead me to believe that the \nexpansion of federal hate crimes law is necessary. However, once the \nemotional feelings somewhat subside, we are left with the facts. In \nthis case, the facts are not yet present to indicate a need for federal \nlegislation.\n  All states have laws that prohibit murder, battery, assault, and \nother willful injuries. Most states, 43 I believe, have hate crimes \nstatutes, although these states differ in what groups are covered. \nSince 1990, with the passage of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, we have \nlearned about the number of hate crimes that are occurring. These \nstatistics, however, do not show whether states are, in fact, not \nprosecuting crimes under their hate crimes statutes or are not \nprosecuting crimes being committed against certain groups of people. If \nstates are prosecuting such crimes, a vast expansion of federal \njurisdiction is unnecessary.\n  Moreover, it is also interesting to point out that in some \ncircumstances the Kennedy amendment, if it became law, would in fact \nresult in a weaker punishment for a hate crimes perpetrator than state \nlaw. For example, the Kennedy amendment states that where the crime is \nmurder, the convicted defendant shall be imprisoned for any term of \nyears or for life. It does not authorize the death penalty for the most \nheinous crimes. Two of the three murderers of James Byrd were \nprosecuted, convicted and sentenced to death in Texas. The third was \nsentenced to life in prison.\n  In addition to analyzing the need for the expansion of federal \ncriminal jurisdiction, I believe that members of Congress have a duty \nto evaluate the constitutionality of particular legislation before \npassing such legislation. I have some grave concerns about the \nconstitutionality of the Kennedy amendment.\n  Congress must have constitutional authority to enact legislation. \nArticle I, section 8 of the Constitution provides a laundry list of \nCongress' power to enact legislation. One such power in that list is \nthe power to regulate interstate commerce.\n  From the New Deal era to the mid 1990s, the United States Supreme \nCourt broadly interpreted Congress' authority for enacting legislation \npursuant to the commerce clause. In fact, for approximately 60 years \nfollowing the passage of New Deal legislation, the Supreme Court did \nnot overturn one piece of congressionally passed legislation on the \ngrounds that Congress exceeded its authority to enact legislation under \nthe commerce clause.\n  In the past few years, however, the Supreme Court, in the cases of \nUnited States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, issued opinions \nthat places some serious boundaries on Congress' authority to enact \nlegislation under the commerce clause. Just this year, in the Morrison \ncase, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Violence Against \nWomen's Act--a bill that I supported in 1994.\n  The plaintiff in the Morrison case was allegedly raped by three \nstudents at a major university in my home state. She brought a civil \nsuit in federal court under a provision in the Violence Against Women's \nAct that provides federal civil remedies for victims of gender \nmotivated violence. The Supreme Court stated that this provision of \nVAWA was unconstitutional, holding that the Congress exceeded its \nauthority under the commerce clause in enacting this legislation.\n\n  Now, I am not going to get intimately involved in a legal analysis of \nthe Morrison case and its application to the Kennedy amendment. It is \nimportant, however, to point out one particular quotation in the \nmajority opinion. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist \nstated ``if Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would \nbe able to regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-\nmotivated violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to \nhave lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a \npart.'' 20000 U.S. Lexis 3422, *31 (2000). Based on the Morrison case, \nI have serious concerns about the constitutionality of Senator \nKennedy's amendment.\n  I believe that a federal role in combating hate crimes is \nappropriate. I support Senator Hatch's amendment to study the success \nof States in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. I also support \nprovisions in Senator Hatch's amendment that will provide assistance \nand federal grants to States and localities to help assist them in \ntheir investigation and prosecution of hate crimes.\n  Let me be clear, if a federal study indicates that states and \nlocalities have\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nnot been successful in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes, I \nwill be the first person to join Senator Kennedy in trying to find a \nconstitutional federal hate crimes solution. At this time, however, I \nmust reluctantly vote against Senator Kennedy's amendment in light of \nmy concerns about the necessity and constitutionality of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I began my public career prosecuting \nindividuals who committed violent crimes against our fellow citizens. \nAnd, that's why I believe that people who commit violent crimes should \nbe punished.\n  The debate about hate crimes legislation is about fighting crime. It \nis about fighting violence. It is about taking a stand against crime \nand violence.\n  The amendments that we're debating here today would permit states to \ntake full advantage of the investigative resources of the federal \ngovernment in prosecuting these cases. And, should a state be unwilling \nor unable to prosecute a case itself, the federal government is there \nto make sure that these kinds of violent criminals are brought to the \nbar of justice.\n  A country that so righteously protects free speech, even when such \nspeech is abhorrent, must vigorously act as a nation, so that when \nvicious speech is turned into despicable acts--acts that lead to \nviolence and to death--such acts do not go unpunished.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 3474. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 135 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Inhofe\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3474) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD.

I hope they will be more alert.\n  Second, I hope the Chair will clear the well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. I urge there be order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will suspend until the well is cleared. The \nwell has not been cleared.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senators should show respect to the Chair. \nWhen the Chair asks that the well be cleared, Senators should listen \nand clear the well.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3473\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 minutes equally divided on the \nKennedy amendment. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe we have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Oregon and 1 minute \nto the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, we have a chance to make a \ndifference today, to vote for an amendment that will actually help a \ncategory of Americans who need our help. I believe we have a duty to \nstand up against hate. I believe the law is a teacher. I believe we can \nteach all Americans that we will protect all Americans.\n  I also believe those who feel reluctant to support this amendment for \nreligious reasons, remember the example of the Founder of the Christian \nfaith who when a woman caught in adultery was brought to Him spoke in a \nway that the sanctimonious dropped their stones. He spoke in a way that \nsaved her life. He did not endorse her lifestyle, but He saved her \nlife.\n  I believe the Federal Government ought to show up to work when it \ncomes to hate crimes, even if it includes the language of ``sexual \norientation.'' It is about time we include them. Even if one does not \nagree with all that they ask for, help them with this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oregon has \nexpired. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to say I believe the time has \ncome to adopt the Kennedy legislation. In effect, the study has been \ndone. We know that since the early 1990s, there have been 60,000 hate \ncrimes in this country. We know that young men such as Matthew Shepard, \njust because they are gay, can be beaten until they are killed. We know \nthat a U.S. postal worker can be shot and killed simply because he \nhappens to be a Filipino American. We see people targeted for specific \ncrimes.\n  I authored the original hate crimes legislation in 1993. It had two \nloopholes: It excluded sex and sexual orientation. This legislation \ncorrects it, and it only applies in pursuance of a Federal right. This \nlegislation extends that. I urge its adoption. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Kennedy/Smith Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment.\n  Recent events in the news have unfortunately offered a number of \ndisturbing examples of why this legislation is so badly needed.\n  All of my colleagues remember that terrible day in August of last \nyear, when a hate-filled gunman, Buford Furrow, opened fire with a \nsemiautomatic rifle at a Jewish Community Center near Los Angeles. We \nall remember that line of frightened children, holding hands as \npolicemen led them to safety. Furrow's rampage wounded three children, \na teenager and a 68-year-old receptionist.\n  And he later used a handgun to kill a Filipino postal worker. There \nis every indication that Mr. Furrow, a white supremacist, was motivated \nby racial hatred.\n  Then there was the brutal attack in August 1998 on Matthew Shepard, a \ngay student at the University of Wyoming. Matthew was savagely beaten \nto death by two homophobic thugs who tied him to a fence and tortured \nhim.\n  That assault came just a few months after the horrific attack on \nJames Byrd Jr., who was chained to a pickup truck, dragged along a \nTexas road and killed by avowed racists motivated by prejudice.\n  Earlier this year, I had the privilege of meeting Matthew Shepard's \nparents, and the family of James Byrd Jr. at a ceremony honoring \nvictims of crime. They are truly remarkable people, because they've \nturned their loss into a source of strength for others. They have \ndevoted themselves to helping others--victims of crime everywhere--even \nwhile coping with their own personal tragedies.\n  That's an example that this Congress should follow. Crimes that \ntarget race, or sexual orientation, or gender, or religion are the \nugliest expressions of ignorance and hate. We need stronger\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nfederal laws to deal with these crimes and the people who commit them.\n  Mr. President, current federal law is just too restrictive to allow \nfederal prosecutors to try hate-crimes cases effectively. In 1994, a \njury acquitted three white supremacists who had assaulted African-\nAmericans. After the trial, jurors said it was clear the defendants had \nacted out of racial hatred.\n  But prosecutors had to prove more than that. They had to prove that \nthe defendants intended to prevent the African-American victims from \nparticipating in a federally protected activity--a major roadblock for \nthe prosecution's case.\n  The Kennedy/Smith amendment would remove that element from federal \nhate-crimes law. It would also allow federal prosecutors to prosecute \nviolent crimes based on a victim's sexual orientation, gender or \ndisability.\n  Mr. President, as all of us here know, no area of the country is free \nfrom hate crimes. In my home state of New Jersey, there were at least \nfour incidents of hate-related violence between January 12 last year \nand January 15 this year. One of the victims was a 16-year-old gay high \nschool student who was badly beaten.\n  The Kennedy/Smith amendment would bring the full force of this \ncountry's legal system to bear on incidents like this. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this legislation to protect \nAmerican citizens from crime motivated by bigotry and intolerance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in October 1998, I stood on the steps of \nthe U.S. Capitol Building at a candlelight vigil for Matthew Shepard, \nthe young gay man who was beaten and left for dead on a lonely Wyoming \nroadway. Two thugs were arrested, charged and convicted of murdering \nMatthew Shepard because of his sexual orientation. Tens of thousands of \npeople--gay and straight, black and white, young and old, Americans \nall--came to the Capitol with only a few hours notice to encourage the \npassage of a Federal hate crimes law.\n  The evening was memorable. We expressed our passionate conviction and \nknowledge that there is no room in our country for the kind of vicious, \nterrible, pathetic, ignorant hatred that took the life of Matthew \nShepard, or of James Byrd, or of Barry Winchell, or of Brandon Teena. \nAnd the Congress responded. We came close to extending the federal hate \ncrimes law that year, but the provision was dropped in conference.\n  So, we came back again to guarantee that crimes will not be tolerated \nwhen they are motivated by other people's limitations. We are here to \nreaffirm that hate crimes are indeed an insult to our civilization. We \nare here for once and for all to make certain that there will be no \nperiod of indifference, as there was initially when the country ignored \nthe burning of black churches or overlooked the spray-painted swastikas \nin synagogues; or suggested that the undiluted lethal hatred is someone \nelse's problem, some other community's responsibility.\n  We must accept the national responsibility for fighting hate crimes \nand commit--each of us in our words, in our hearts and in our actions--\nto insure that the lesson of Matthew Shepard and scores of others is \nnot forgotten. Mr. President, I understand that we cannot legislate \nracism and hatred out of existence, but we can empower our local law \nenforcement officials to prosecute hate crimes. And we can empower our \nlocal communities to be free of violence and fear brought about by hate \ncrimes.\n  Look to the 58 high schools in my own beautiful, progressive state of \nMassachusetts where 22 percent of gay students say they skip school \nbecause they feel unsafe there and fully 31 percent of gay students had \nbeen threatened or actually physically attacked for being gay. Matthew \nShepard is not the exception to the rule--his tragic death is rather \nthe extreme example of what happens on a daily basis in our schools, on \nour streets and in our communities. That is why we have an obligation \nto pass laws that make clear our determination to root out this hatred.\n  And today we will have carried the day in passing the Kennedy-Smith \namendment.\n  It is my belief that Americans always act when confronted by an \ninherently unethical wrong. They stare down those who want us to live \nin fear and declare boldly that we will not live in a country where \nprivate prejudice undermines public law.\n  American heroes such as Martin Luther King did this when he preached \nin Birmingham and Memphis, when he thundered his protest and assuaged \nthose who feared his dreams. He taught us to look hatred in the face \nand overcome it. Harvey Milk did this in San Francisco, when he brushed \naside hatred, suspicion, fear and death threats to serve his city. Even \nas he foretold his own assassination, Harvey Milk prayed that ``if a \nbullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet \ndoor.'' He knew that true citizenship belongs only to an enlightened \npeople, unwavered by passion or prejudice--and it exists in a country \nwhich recognizes no one particular aspect of humanity before another.\n  Mr. President, we must root out hatred wherever we find it, whether \non Laramie Road in Wyoming, or on a back road in Jasper, Texas, or in \nthe Shenandoah National Park. That kind of hatred is the real enemy of \nour civilization. The day is here, Mr. President, when we can rightly \ncelebrate our passage of this amendment to the hate crime prevention \nact to treat all Americans equally and with dignity, to allow all \nAmericans to enjoy the inalienable rights framed in the Declaration of \nIndependence--the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  This indeed will be a happy day.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today's vote on hate crimes legislation \nmarks a monumental day in our history. The U.S. Senate definitively \nvoted in support of expanded hate crimes legislation because standing \nlaw has proven inadequate in the protection of many victimized groups. \nThe 30-year-old Federal statute currently used to prosecute hate \nviolence does not cover hate violence based on sexual orientation, \ngender or disability and requires that the victim be participating in a \nfederally protected activity. The Kennedy-Smith amendment addresses and \ncorrects these gaps in the law. Not only is this bill the right thing \nto do, but Americans overwhelmingly support it. Law enforcement groups, \nas well as 80 civil rights and religious organizations support this \nbill, in addition to a 1998 poll showing that this Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act is favored 2 to 1 by a majority of voters. This bill \nprotects all Americans and ensures equal justice for all victims of \nhate violence, regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, \nnational origin, gender, or disability--and regardless of where they \nlive.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was back in Connecticut yesterday and was \nunable to participate in the debate on the Kennedy-Smith amendment \npertaining to hate crimes prevention. I want to take this opportunity \nto share my views on this most crucial issue.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently released its latest \nstatistics documenting hate crimes in our country. This report \nestablishes that over 7,500 hate crimes occurred during 1998. The FBI \nfound that 4,321 crimes were motivated by racial bias, 1,390 because of \nreligion, 1,260 because of sexual orientation, and 754 by ethnicity or \nnational origin. But hate crime statistics do not tell the whole story. \nBehind each and every one of these numbers is a person, a family and a \ncommunity targeted and forever changed by these willful acts of \nviolence.\n  We as a nation know of some of these hate crimes. We know of the \nbrutal dragging death in 1998 of James Byrd Jr., in Jasper, Texas. We \nknow about the senseless beating of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming \nin 1998. And we cannot forget the vicious acts of an armed assailant \nwho fatally shot five people in a Jewish Community Center in Los \nAngeles earlier this year.\n  Joseph Healy, a 71-year-old Roman Catholic priest who was in \nPittsburgh counseling victims of crime was gunned down in March at a \nfast food restaurant. Father Healy was a native of Bridgeport, \nConnecticut. He was killed in a racially motivated shooting. Father \nHealy and four other white men were shot; three of the five men died. \nCourt documents revealed that the gunman shot the victims with \n``malicious intent towards white males.''\n  Then there's the case of Heather Washington, a young, well respected \nAfrican-American kindergarten teacher from Hartford, who along with her\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\nboyfriend was chased at high speeds on a Connecticut highway last \nmonth. The couple was pursued by a white male who yelled epithets such \nas ``white power,'' shot at the vehicle's tires, and rear-ended the \ncouple's car with his own vehicle. The couple was able to escape the \nassailant. However, they were not able to escape the constant fear that \na similar incident could happen at any time.\n  These are examples of the bias crimes that are committed every day in \nAmerica. Every day people across the nation continue to be victims of \ncrimes motivated by bigotry. We owe it to these victims to ensure that \nthe perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice.\n  We should not wait until these brutal and shocking crimes make \nnational headlines. Congress has the ability, the opportunity, and the \nduty to do something about this epidemic now. This problem cannot and \nshould not be ignored.\n  In response to these disturbing acts, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of S. 622, the Federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, \nintroduced by my longtime friend and colleague Senator Kennedy.\n  I believe that all people, regardless of background or belief, \ndeserve to be protected from discrimination. We must unite now to send \nan unequivocal message that hate will not be tolerated in our \ncommunities. Hate crimes deserve separate and strong penalties because \nthey injure all of us. The perpetrator of a hate crime may wield a bat \nagainst a single person, but that perpetrator strikes at the morals \nthat hold our society together. Hate destroys what's good, what's great \nabout America. It is just and fitting for Congress to impose sanctions \nagainst criminals who are motivated by blind bigotry. These incidences \ntear the very fabric of our society and they cannot be tolerated. I \nadmit that laws have little power to change the hearts and minds of \npeople, but Congress can ensure that those who harbor hateful thoughts \nare punished when they act on those thoughts. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the Kennedy-Smith amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, violent crime motivated by prejudice is a \ntragedy that demands attention from all of us. It is not a new problem, \nbut recent incidents of violent crimes motivated by hate and bigotry \nhave shocked the American conscience and made it painfully clear that \nwe as a nation still have serious work to do in protecting all \nAmericans from these crimes and in ensuring equal rights for all our \ncitizens. The answer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be found in \nincreased respect and tolerance. But strengthening our federal hate \ncrimes legislation is a step in the right direction.\n  Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any society, but \nespecially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We need to make \nclear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, \nand it diminishes our nation. As a nation, we must say loudly and \nclearly that we will defend ourselves against such violence. All \nAmericans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. \nIn the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish \nviolent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 \nyears. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000 continues that \ngreat and honorable tradition.\n  This legislation strengthens current law by making it easier for \nfederal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes based on race, \ncolor, religion, and national origin. It also focuses the attention and \nresources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes \ncommitted against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, \nor disability. This bill will strengthen Federal jurisdiction over hate \ncrimes as a backup, but not a substitute, for state and local law \nenforcement. In a sign that this legislation respects the proper \nbalance between Federal and local authority, the bill has received \nstrong bipartisan support from state and local law enforcement \norganizations across the country. This support from law enforcement is \nparticularly significant to me as a former prosecutor. Indeed, it has \nconvinced me that we should pass this powerful law enforcement tool \nwithout further delay.\n  This bill accomplishes a critically important goal--protecting all of \nour citizens--without compromising our constitutional responsibilities. \nIt is a tool for combating acts of violence and threats of violence \nmotivated by hatred and bigotry. But it does not target pure speech, \nhowever offensive or disagreeable. The Constitution does not permit us \nin Congress to prohibit the expression of an idea simply because we \ndisagree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution protects \nnot just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with, but \nfreedom for the thought that we hate. I am devoted to that principle, \nand I am confident that this bill does not contradict it.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Smith for their leadership on \nthis bill, and I am proud to have been an original cosponsor. Senator \nKennedy has been a leader on civil rights for the better part of four \ndecades and has worked hard to tailor this needed remedy to the \nnarrowing restrictions of the current activist Supreme Court. Senator \nSmith is someone I am getting to know better through our work on the \nInnocence Protection Act. He is becoming a worthy successor in the \ngreat tradition of Senators of conscience like Senator Mark Hatfield.\n  Now is the time to pass this important legislation. I had hoped that \nthis legislation would become law last year, when it passed the Senate \nas part of the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. But despite \nthe best efforts of the President, and us all, the majority declined to \nallow it to become law.\n\n  Since that failure, the need for this bill has become even more \nclear. Just two months ago, a white man named Richard Scott Baumhammers \napparently went on a racially and ethnically motivated rampage that \nleft his suburban Pittsburgh community in shock. First, he allegedly \nshot his next-door neighbor, a Jewish woman, six times and then set her \nhouse on fire. He then traveled throughout the Pittsburgh suburbs, \nshooting and killing two Asian-Americans in a Chinese restaurant, an \nAfrican-American at a karate school, and an Indian man at an Indian-\nowned grocery. He also shot at two synagogues during his awful journey. \nThis incident followed only a month after Ronald Taylor, an African-\nAmerican man in the Pittsburgh area, apparently shot and killed three \nwhite people during a shooting spree in which he appears to have \ntargeted whites. Policy investigators who searched Taylor's apartment \nafter the shooting found writings showing anti-Semitic and anti-white \nbias.\n  These ugly incidents join the numerous other recent examples of \nviolent crimes motivated by hate and bigotry that have motivated us to \nstrengthen our hate crimes laws. None of us can forget the story of \nJames Byrd, Jr., who was so brutally murdered in Texas for no reason \nother than his race. Nor can we erase last summer's images of small \nchildren at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles fleeing a gunman \nwho sprayed the building with 70 bullets from a submachine gun. When he \nsurrendered, the gunman said that his rampage had been motivated by his \nhatred of Jews.\n  And of course, we are still deeply affected and saddened by the \nterrible fate of Matthew Shepard, killed two years ago in Wyoming as a \nresult of his sexual orientation. Last year, Judy Shepard, Matthew \nShepard's mother, called upon Congress to pass this legislation without \ndelay. Let me close by quoting her eloquent words:\n\n       Today, we have it within our power to send a very different \n     message than the one received by the people who killed my \n     son. It is time to stop living in denial and to address a \n     real problem that is destroying families like mine, James \n     Byrd, Jr.'s . . . and many others across America. . . . We \n     need to decide what kind of nation we want to be. One that \n     treats all people with dignity and respect, or one that \n     allows some people and their family members to be \n     marginalized.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthis amendment. I am a cosponsor because I believe that our society \nmust enforce a message of tolerance--not hate. State and local law \nenforcement should not have to shoulder the burden of investigating and \nprosecuting hate crimes alone. This amendment allows the Federal \nGovernment to stand behind them in their effort to put a stop to hate-\nmotivated violence.\n  This amendment would authorize the Department of Justice to assist \nlaw enforcement officers across the country in addressing acts of hate \nviolence by\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\nremoving unnecessary obstacles to federal involvement and, where \nappropriate, by providing authority for federal involvement in crimes \ndirected at individuals because of their race, color religion, national \norigin, gender, sexual orientation or disability.\n  Because of my long involvement in the area of disability rights and \nthe fact that this year marks the Tenth Anniversary of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, I want to focus my remarks on hate crimes' \nimpact on Americans with disabilities. Prejudice against people with \ndisabilities takes many forms. Such bias often results in \ndiscriminatory actions in employment, housing, and public \naccommodations. Laws like the Fair Housing Amendments Act, the ADA, and \nthe Rehabilitation Act are designed to protect people with disabilities \nfrom such prejudice\n  Sadly, disability bias can also manifest itself in the form of \nviolence. It is imperative that the Federal Government send a message \nthat these expressions of hatred are not acceptable in our society.\n  For example, a man with mental disabilities from New Jersey was \nkidnaped by a group of nine men and women and was tortured for three \nhours, then dumped somewhere with a pillowcase over his head. While \ncaptive, he was taped to a chair, his head was shaved, his clothing was \ncut to shreds, and he was punched, whipped with a string of beads, \nbeaten with a toilet brush, and, possibly, sexually assaulted. \nProsecutors believe the attack was motivated by disability bias.\n  In the state of Maine, a husband and wife were both living openly \nwith AIDS, struggling to raise their children. Their youngest daughter \nwas also infected with HIV. The family had broken their silence to \nparticipate in HIV/AIDS education programs that would inform their \ncommunity about the tragic reality of HIV infection in their lives. As \na result of the publicity, the windows of their home were shot out and \nthe husband was forcibly removed from his car at a traffic light and \nseverely beaten.\n  Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have included people \nwith disabilities as a protected class under their hate crimes \nstatutes. However, state protection is neither uniform nor \ncomprehensive. The Federal Government must send the message that hate \ncrimes committed on the basis of disability are as intolerable as those \ncommitted because of a person's race, national origin, or religion. \nAnd, federal resources and comprehensive coverage would give this \nmessage meaning and substance. Thus, it is critical that people with \ndisabilities share in the protection of the federal hate crimes \nstatute.\n  This legislation will also provide local and state law enforcement \nofficials with the resources necessary to investigate and prosecute \nhate crimes. In consultation with victim services organizations, \nincluding nonprofit organizations that provide services to victims with \ndisabilities, local law enforcement officials can apply for grants when \nthey lack the necessary resources to investigate and prosecute hate \ncrimes. The amendment also includes grants for the training of law \nenforcement officials in identifying and preventing hate crimes \ncommitted by juveniles. Again, so often hate crimes on the basis of \ndisability go unrecognized. These grants will help police identify \ncrimes committed because of disability bias in the first place.\n  Mr. President, for this reason and others, this amendment is vitally \nimportant. Millions of Americans would benefit from its passage. And \nthe public clearly recognizes this.\n  This amendment is a constructive and sensible response to a serious \nproblem that continues to plague our Nation--violence motivated by \nprejudice. It deserves full support, and I am hopeful that the \nPresident will have an opportunity to sign this legislation into law \nthis year.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Kennedy's \namendment to the fiscal year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization \nAct. This amendment, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, is a \nnew version of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, of which I am a \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing so ugly as hate. It saddens me that \nat the brink of a new century, when our country is in a time of almost \nunprecedented prosperity--when more people than ever before are \neducated, when major medical breakthroughs seem to occur almost on a \ndaily basis--that we are still faced with racism and prejudice in our \nsociety.\n  Current law permits Federal prosecution of a hate crime only if the \ncrime was motivated by bias based on religion, national origin, or \ncolor, and the assailant intended to prevent the victim from exercising \na ``federally protected right'' such as voting, jury duty, attending \nschool, or conducting interstate commerce. These tandem requirements \nsubstantially limit the potential for federal prosecution of hate \ncrimes.\n  Most crimes against victims based on their gender, disability, or \nsexual orientation are now only covered under State law, unless such \ncrimes are committed within a Federal jurisdiction such as an assault \non a Federal official, on an Indian reservation, or in a national park. \nWhile more than 40 States have hate crimes statutes in effect, only 22 \nStates have hate crimes legislation that addresses gender, and only 21 \nStates have hate crimes legislation that address sexual orientation or \ndisability.\n  The amendment before us today would expand Federal jurisdiction and \nincrease the Federal role in the investigation and prosecution of hate \ncrimes.\n  Under this legislation, hate crimes that cause death or bodily injury \nbecause of prejudice can be investigated and prosecuted by the Federal \nGovernment, regardless of whether the victim was exercising a federally \nprotected right. The bill defines a hate crime as a violent act causing \ndeath or bodily injury ``because of the actual or perceived race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or \nsexual orientation of any person.''\n  I believe that one of our country's greatest strengths is Congress's \nability to balance strong State's rights against a Federal Government \nthat unites these separate States. I also believe that the Federal \nGovernment has a duty to provide leadership on issues of great moral \nimperative, especially in the area of civil rights.\n  Hate crimes go beyond the standard criminal motivation. We are all \nfamiliar with the horrible stories of James Byrd, Jr., who was chained \nto a truck and dragged to his death because of his race, of Matthew \nShepard, who was beaten and tied to a wooden fence and died in freezing \ntemperatures because of his sexual orientation, and of the attack last \nAugust at a Jewish community center because of religion.\n  There is no doubt that crime is morally and legally wrong and there \nis no one in this chamber who could possible argue otherwise. And I \nunderstand the argument that opponents of the amendment have: How can \nthe law punish a crime for more than what it actually and literally is?\n  But hate crimes are not just about the crime itself, they are about \nthe motivation. And there is something especially pernicious about a \ncrime that occurs because of who somebody is. There is something all \nthe more horrific when a crime happens because of the victim's race, or \ncolor, or religion. Hate crimes are meant to send a message to a group: \n``you had better be careful because you are not accepted here.''\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that in 1998--the latest \ndata available--almost 8,000 crimes were motivated by hate or \nprejudice. Over half of these crimes were motivated by racial bias; \nnearly 20 percent of these crimes were because of religious bias; and \n16 percent of these crimes were a result of sexual-orientation bias. \nTwenty-five of these crimes happened simply because the victim was \ndisabled, and 754 because of the ethnicity or national origin of the \nvictim.\n  The amendment before us today is not about creating a special class \nof crime. It is not about policing our ideas or beliefs; it is about \nthe criminal action that some people take on the basis of these \nbeliefs. We cannot make it a crime to hate someone. But we can make it \na crime to attack because a person specifically hates who the victim is \nor what the victim represents.\n  One of my favorite sayings is ``As Maine goes . . . so goes the \nNation.'' This adage proves true again with the Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct and with Senator Kennedy's amendment. I am proud that the Hate \nCrimes Prevention\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nAct, and today's amendment, are largely based on Maine's 1992 Civil \nRights Law, which was enacted while my husband, John R. McKernan, was \nGovernor of the State. And I am proud that the Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct is supported by our current Attorney General, Andrew Ketterer.\n  Mr. President, our laws are a direct reflection of our priorities as \na nation. And I, along with the vast majority of Americans I would \nventure to say, fundamentally believe that crimes of hate and prejudice \nshould not be tolerated in our society.\n  That is why I support prosecuting hate crimes to the fullest possible \nextent. The amendment before us today will expand the ability of the \nFederal Government to prosecute these immoral and pernicious crimes. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, no one should be victimized because of \nhis or her skin color, national origin, religious beliefs, gender, \nsexual orientation, or disability.\n  In furtherance of this belief, I sponsored in 1993 the Hate Crimes \nSentencing Enhancement Act, which required the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission to provide sentencing enhancements of no less than three \noffense levels for crimes determined beyond a reasonable doubt to be \nhate crimes. The Act increased the penalties for hate crimes directed \nat individuals not only because of their perceived race, color, \nreligion, and national origin, but also on account of their gender, \ndisability or sexual orientation.\n  Today, I am proud to be the cosponsor of the Kennedy hate crimes \namendment, which would build on this effort by expanding the Justice \nDepartment's authority to prosecute defendants for violent crimes based \non the victim's race, color, religion or national origin.\n  This important amendment would also allow the Federal government to \nprovide assistance in state investigations of crimes against another \nbased on the victim's gender, disability, or sexual orientation.\n  Sadly, hate crimes occur more often than we might think. According to \nthe U.S. Department of Justice, there have been nearly 60,000 hate \ncrime incidents reported since 1991. In 1998 alone, the last year for \nwhich we have statistics, nearly 8,000 hate crime incidents were \nreported in the United States. That is almost one such crime per hour.\n  In the same year, more than 2,100 Californians fell victim to a hate \ncrime. That's a shocking number when one considers the motivation \nbehind a hate crime. These are truly among the ugliest of crimes, in \nwhich the perpetrator thinks the victim is less of a human being \nbecause of his or her gender, skin color, religion, sexual orientation \nor disability.\n  Even more disturbing is that nearly two-thirds of these crimes are \ncommitted by our nation's youth and young adults. The need to send a \nstrong message of mutual tolerance and respect to our youngsters has \nbecome all too clear in recent years.\n  One of the most high profile hate crime cases in California involved \ntwo young Northern California men, Benjamin Matthew Williams, age 31, \nand his younger brother James Tyler Williams, age 29. The two brothers \nbecame poster boys for our Nation's summer of hate last year. Both men \nwere charged with the double slaying of a prominent gay couple who \nlived about 180 miles north of Sacramento.\n  The men are also prime suspects in the wave of arson that hit three \nSacramento-area synagogues two weeks before the killings, causing more \nthan $1 million in damage. When investigators searched the Williams \nbrothers' home, they found a treasure trove of white-supremacist, anti-\ngay, anti-Semitic literature. They also found a ``hit list'' of 32 \nprominent Jewish and civic leaders in the Sacramento area, apparently \ncompiled after the synagogue fires.\n  Hate crimes not only affect the victim who is targeted, but also \nshakes the foundation of an entire community that identifies with the \nvictim. I grow increasingly concerned when I hear reports about the \nproliferation of hate in our nation, because California, the state I \nrepresent, has one of the most diverse communities in the world.\n  Our state has greatly benefitted from the contributions of persons \nfrom countries as nearby as Mexico and El Salvador, and as far away as \nIndia and Ethiopia. It is only through our willingness to live among \neach other and to respect our individual differences and gifts, that we \ncan continue to build from the strength of our diversity.\n  That is why Senator Kennedy's amendment is so important. Not only \nwould it broaden the protection offered by Federal law to people not \ncovered by hate crime legislation, but it will provide vital Federal \nassistance and training grants to states investigating these crimes.\n  Specifically, this legislation would compensate for two limitations \nin the current law: First, even in the most blatant cases of racial, \nethnic, or religious violence, no Federal jurisdiction exists unless \nthe victim was targeted while exercising one of a limited number of \nfederally protected activities. Second, current law provides no \ncoverage for violent hate crimes based on the victim's sexual \norientation, gender or disability.\n  Unfortunately, there are those who would stop short of supporting \nthis legislation because it extends protections to those targeted on \naccount of their sexual orientation. This is especially disturbing \ngiven the fact that crimes against gays, lesbians and bisexuals ranked \nthird in reported hate crimes in 1998, registering 1,260 or 15.6 \npercent of all reported incidents. Even in light of the growing number \nand severity of these horrific events, Congress has not seen fit to \nenact important Federal hate crime measures to ensure that justice is \nserved.\n  I wonder, how many cases go unsolved because of the Federal \ngovernment's inability to participate in the investigation and \nprosecution of a hate crime?\n  How many people have chosen not to report a serious hate crime out of \nfear of retribution because there is no state or federal protection?\n  How many more people, and families, and communities, need to be \nvictimized by these most horrendous acts before our colleagues realize \nthat now is time to act?\n  Since those who commit hate crimes seek out a category of people, \nrather than a particular individual, anyone of us at anytime can become \na victim of a hate crime. I believe the Kennedy hate crimes amendment \nwould send the right message: that those who commit violent acts \nbecause the victim is of a certain gender, religion, race, sexual \norientation, or disability will be prosecuted because everyone--I \nrepeat--everyone has a right to be free from violence and fear when \nthey are going to school, work, travel, or doing something as simple as \ngoing to a movie.\n  While I rise in strong support for the Kennedy amendment, I must also \nexpress my opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Utah, \nMr. Hatch. While well-intentioned, the Hatch amendment would not extend \nprotection to people targeted because of their sexual orientation, \ngender or disability in states that have not enacted hate crime laws or \nhave limited their laws to crimes motivated by race, national origin or \nreligion.\n  Moreover, the Hatch amendment would permit the Federal government to \naddress hate crimes only in those very limited circumstances in which \nthe offender crosses a state line to commit an act of hate violence. \nThis amendment would, therefore, fail to address the majority of cases \nwe confront today in which a hate crime results in death or serious \nbodily harm.\n  As elected leaders, it is incumbent upon us to set an example--not \njust by expressing outrage about these crimes--but by strengthening \nlegislation and bolstering the ability of law enforcement--whether \nstate or Federal--to combat hate crimes.\n  How many more people will become victims of hate before we act? I \nbelieve the time has come to affirm our support for the diversity that \nmakes our nation so great. The time has come to enact a sensible hate \ncrime measure to address this problem of violent bigotry and hate. The \ntime has come to enact the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of \n2000.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000, Senator \nKennedy's amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill. As \na cosponsor of Senator Kennedy's Hate Crimes Prevention Act, I believe \nthat it is past time for Congress to act to prevent future tragedies.\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\n  While as a Nation we have made significant progress in reducing \ndiscrimination and increasing opportunities for all Americans, \nregrettably the impact of past discrimination continues to be felt. Far \ntoo often, we hear reports of violent hate-related incidents in this \ncountry. It seems inconceivable that, in the year 2000, such crimes can \nstill be so pervasive. Statistics from my own State of Maryland \nunfortunately indicate that the incidence of bias-motivated violence \nmay be on the rise. The number of reported incidents of hate or bias-\nmotivated violence in Maryland rose by 11.6 percent in 1999. Of the 457 \nverified incidents of bias-motivated violence that year, 335 were \ncommitted against individuals on the basis of their race (approximately \n73%), 63 on the basis of religion (14%), 38 on the basis of sexual \norientation (8%), 17 on the basis of ethnicity (4%), and 4 on the basis \nof the victim's disability (1%).\n  Data gathered under the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act is also \nsobering. Beginning in 1991, the Act requires the Justice Department to \ncollect information from law enforcement agencies across the country on \ncrimes motivated by a victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or \nethnicity. Congress expanded the Act in 1994 to also require the \ncollection of data for crimes based upon the victim's disability. The \nDepartment of Justice has reported that, for 1998, 7,755 bias-motivated \ncrimes were committed against 9,722 victims by 7,489 known offenders.\n  Beyond these stark statistics, stories of heinous crimes continue to \nmake headlines across the country. In 1998, James Byrd, Jr., an \nAfrican-American man, was walking home along a rural Texas road when he \nwas beaten and then dragged behind a pickup truck to his death. Later \nthan same year, Matthew Shephard, a gay University of Wyoming Student, \nwas beaten, tied to a fence, and left to die in a rural part of the \nstate. And just last year, a gunman entered a Jewish community center \nin California, opened fire on workers and children attending a day care \ncenter, and later killed a Filipino-American postal worker.\n  It is nearly impossible to imagine such crimes occurring in a country \nthat is said to lead the world in equal opportunity for its citizens. \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt once described America as a ``nation of many \nnationalities, many religions--bound together by a single unity, the \nunity of freedom and equality.'' But, as the stories of James Byrd, \nMatthew Shephard, and the California Jewish community center all too \nclearly show, we are not living up to President Roosevelt's vision of \nAmerica. The Federal government cannot ignore the thousands of hate \ncrimes that are committed in the United States each and every year as \nlong as people are afraid to walk down our streets because of their \nreligion, or the color of their skin, or their sexual orientation.\n  I had the great honor of serving, during my time in the House of \nRepresentatives, with Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American \nwoman elected to Congress, who said: ``Laws will not eliminate \nprejudice from the hearts of human beings. But that is no reason to \nallow prejudice to continue to be enshrined in our laws to perpetuate \ninjustice through inaction.''\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment includes crucial provisions designed to \nhelp the Federal government stop bias-motivated crimes. This amendment \nwould extend Federal law to prohibit crimes committed against victims \nbecause of their gender, sexual orientation, or disability. Moreover, \nthe amendment would also remove requirements of existing law that \nprohibit Federal government action unless the crime victim is engaged \nin certain ``federally protected activities.''\n  It is true that this legislation will not drastically increase the \nnumber of crimes subject to Federal prosecution. Criminal law is a \nmatter largely enforced by the states, and the sponsors of this \namendment have been careful to ensure that the Federal government will \nonly step in and prosecute a crime if a state cannot adequately do so \nitself. And certainly, as Congresswoman Chisholm eloquently stated, we \ncannot erase the hatred and bigotry in people's hearts by passing this \namendment today. But the balanced approach of Senator Kennedy's \namendment will allow the Federal government to intervene in the small \nnumber of hate crimes cases where a Federal prosecution is necessary to \ninsure that justice is served.\n  Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting \nthe Kennedy hate crimes amendment. We have an invaluable opportunity to \nmake a statement that the United States government will not tolerate \ncrimes motivated by bigotry and prejudice, and that the ``the unity of \nfreedom and equality'' binds together all Americans--regardless of \ntheir race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or \ndisability.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, one year ago, three synagogues in the \nSacramento, California area were attacked by arsonists. Two weeks \nlater, a gay couple was killed at their home in nearby Redding, \nCalifornia. Two nights after these brutal murders, a Sacramento women's \nhealth care clinic was firebombed.\n  These vicious crimes shocked the people of Sacramento. At the same \ntime, it moved many members of the community to speak out and take \naction. Led by the late mayor Joe Serna, thousands of residents joined \na Unity Rally at the Sacramento Convention Center and pledged to work \ntogether to prevent future hate crimes.\n  Out of this rally grew the ``United We Build'' project, which is \nbearing fruit this week. In the name of tolerance and unity, hundreds \nof volunteers are gathering and setting to work on community projects: \nplanting gardens, cleaning up schools and parks, and refurbishing \nchurches and senior centers. The week's events will culminate on Sunday \nwith a Jewish Food Faire at one of the targeted synagogues and an \nafternoon rally at the State Capitol.\n  Mr. President, every community in America should take inspiration \nfrom the people of Sacramento. They have turned their shock, anger, and \nfear into positive actions. From the ashes of hatred and intolerance, \nthey have emerged stronger and more unified than ever before.\n  Hate crimes seek to stigmatize persecuted groups and isolate them \nfrom the larger society. We must turn the tables to isolate those who \npreach hatred and commit hate crimes. This will not be easy: Today hate \ngroups flood the Internet with venom, and hateful individuals flood the \ntalk shows with vitriol.\n  To stop hate crimes, we must of course catch and prosecute the \nperpetrators. But we must do more than that. We must each act to root \nhatred and intolerance out of our daily lives. We must have zero \ntolerance for intolerance. If a friend or family member uses hateful \nspeech, we must have the courage to say that this is unacceptable. If a \nneighbor or co-worker takes an action designed to hurt another because \nof that person's race or religion or sexual orientation, we must stand \nwith the victim, not the aggressor.\n  Congress can pass laws to prevent and prosecute hate crimes. I voted \nto pass such legislation today, and I will do so again. But laws alone \ncannot wipe the stain of hatred off the American landscape. To do \nthis--to truly secure the blessings of liberty for all Americans--we \nmust each take every opportunity to teach tolerance and act against \nhatred.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe it is vital to make a clear \nstatement against all violent hate crimes against individuals because \nof race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, \nor disability. This is a basic point, and the number of hate crimes in \nour country is truly disturbing. When such a case claims headlines and \ndominates national news for a few days or a few weeks, people are \ntroubled and sad. But we can and we should do more to oppose hate \ncrimes.\n  My hope is that having leaders at all levels, including the U.S. \nSenate, speak against such hate crimes will send a powerful message \nthat such violent behavior should not be tolerated. No one in our \ncountry should be afraid of violence because of their race, religion, \ncolor, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. When \nsuch crimes occur, families are devastated and entire communities are \nstunned and hurt.\n  In addition to sending a strong message, the Kennedy amendment would \noffer federal help to combat violent hate crimes, including up to \n$100,000 in\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\nfederal grants to state and local law enforcement officials to cover \nthe expenses of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. Federal \ngrants would also encourage cooperation and coordination with the \ncommunity groups and schools that could be affected. The bipartisan \nKennedy amendment is a balanced attempt to combat hate crimes by \nhelping state and local officials.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nseries of votes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I admire my colleagues. I feel very much \nthe same as they do about these heinous crimes, but I have absolute \nconfidence that our State and local governments are taking care of \nthem.\n  The problem with the Kennedy amendment is that it is unconstitutional \nand it is bad policy.\n  First, the Kennedy amendment is unconstitutional because it seeks to \nmake a Federal crime of purely private conduct committed by an \nindividual against a person because of that person's race, color, \nreligion, national origin, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. \nThis broad federalization of what are now State crimes would be \nunconstitutional under the commerce clause, the 13th amendment, the \n14th amendment, and, possibly, the 1st amendment. This is clear in \nlight of the Supreme Court's recent decision just last month in United \nStates v. Morrison.\n  As Senators, we have a real duty to consider whether the legislation \nwe enact is constitutional, and not just try to get away with all we \ncan and hope the Supreme Court will fix it for us.\n  Secondly, the Kennedy amendment is bad policy. It would make a \nFederal crime out of every rape and sexual assault--crimes committed \nbecause of the victim's gender--and, as such, would seriously burden \nFederal law enforcement agencies, Federal prosecutors, and Federal \ncourts.\n  In addition, the Kennedy amendment would not permit the death penalty \nto be imposed, even in cases of the most heinous hate crimes, such as \nthe Byrd case, where State law permits prosecutors to seek the death \npenalty.\n  Finally, the Kennedy amendment, by broadly federalizing what now are \nState crimes, would allow the Justice Department to unnecessarily \nintrude in the work of State and local police and prosecutors without \nany real justification for doing so right now. That is why we need to \ndo this study while at the same time providing monies to help the State \nand local prosecutors to do a better job.\n  The Kennedy amendment is unconstitutional, and it is bad policy. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3475\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ndebate for 4 minutes evenly divided the Dodd amendment relating to \nCuba. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a 12-member \nbipartisan commission to review Cuba policy and make recommendations \nwith respect to how that policy might be altered to best serve the \ninterests of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I will not read the documents, but I will leave them \nfor my colleagues' consideration: A letter signed by Howard Baker, \nFrank Carlucci, Henry Kissinger, Malcolm Wallop, along with 26 \ncolleagues, 16 from the floor, a letter from George Shultz, and one \nfrom the leading dissident groups inside Cuba calling for the \ncommission to try to take a look at U.S.-Cuban policy.\n  It is time to stop, in my view, the absurd fixation we have on one \nindividual and to remove an important foreign policy issue from the \nsmall but powerful group that doesn't allow us to think what is in our \nbest interest as a nation. We ought to listen to foreign policy \nexperts. This commission is not predetermined; it is not shackled. It \nmay very well come back and recommend a continuation of the embargo. \nBut it seems to me we ought to at least listen.\n  We are watching the Koreans come together. We are watching advances \nin the Middle East. Today, we are watching efforts around the world to \nbring people together to resolve historic differences.\n  Today, Pete Peterson, former POW, represents U.S. interests as our \nAmbassador in Vietnam. Does that mean we agree with the policies of the \nVietnamese Government? No. We recognize, by trying to tear down the \nwalls that have historically divided us, we can try to build a better \nrelationship between the two countries. We will soon be voting on \nwhether or not to have a trading relationship with China. We are \nwatching improvements in the Middle East. Northern Ireland brings hope \nfor resolving differences.\n  All I am asking with this amendment--it has been recommended by \nSecretaries of Defense, Secretaries of State, 26 of our colleagues, in \na bipartisan letter to the President only a few months ago--is to \nestablish a commission to examine U.S.-Cuban policies to see if we \ncan't come up with some better answers than the historic debate which \nhas divided us on this issue.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  It is not our fault that Cuba is repressive. It is Castro who is to \nblame. Appeasing Castro by instituting the commission whose stealth \nobjective is to lift the embargo without Castro having undertaken any \nreforms is nothing more than a unilateral and unwarranted concession to \na regime which refuses to concede even the smallest effort to reform \nhuman rights.\n  This is not the appropriate vehicle for this bill, the Armed Services \nCommittee. There are other important things with which we need to deal. \nCuba should first change its policy toward its own people, and after \nthat, the United States can change its policy toward Cuba.\n  I yield to Senator Mack.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to vote to table this amendment. It is blatantly political in its \nnature. Of the 12 positions, 8 will be determined by the Democratic \nParty and 4 by the Republicans; 6 by the President, 2 by the majority \nin each of the Houses, 1 by the\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\nminority in each. That is 8 of 12--two-thirds.\n  We should not, today, be telling the next President of the United \nStates what his policy should be with respect to Cuba. This Congress \nand this President should not be doing that.\n  Third, I only had the opportunity to speak with Frank Carlucci and \nHoward Baker. While they accept the concept of a commission, they don't \nsupport one that is so blatantly political, and they don't support one \nbeing established at this time.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I move to \ntable the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the amendment No. \n3475.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 324, introduced \nearlier today by Senator Boxer and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 324) to commend and congratulate the \n     Los Angeles Lakers for their outstanding drive, discipline, \n     and mastery in winning the 2000 National Basketball \n     Association Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Barbara Boxer, in commending and congratulating the \nLos Angeles Lakers for their outstanding season which was culminated \nlast night in winning the 2000 National Basketball Association \nChampionship.\n  Without a doubt, the Los Angeles Lakers are one of the finest \nfranchises in the history of professional sports. In defeating a gritty \nand hard-nosed Indiana Pacers team last night, the Lakers captured \ntheir twelfth NBA Championship in the true spirit of their ``Showtime'' \nyears.\n  The Los Angeles Lakers are a true sporting dynasty. They are the \nsecond winningest team in NBA history. Their record of 67-15, the best \nregular season record in the NBA's Eastern and Western Conference.\n  Led by coach Phil Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant the \nLakers are a formidable opponent. Shaquille O'Neal was named league \nMost Valuable Player, led the league in scoring and field goal \npercentage, won the IBM Award for greatest overall contribution to a \nteam, and became just the sixth player in the game's history to be a \nunanimous selection to the All-NBA First team.\n  Shaquille O'Neal also was named Most Valuable Player of the 2000 All \nStar game scoring 22 points and collecting 9 rebounds. And he also \ndominated the 2000 playoffs scoring 38 points per game in the NBA \nFinals on his way to winning the Most Valuable Player award.\n  Another top player was the 21-year-old phenom, Kobe Bryant, who \novercame injuries to average more than 22 points a game in the regular \nseason and be named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. Kobe Bryant's \neight point performance in the overtime of game 4 led the Lakers to one \nof the most dramatic wins in playoff history.\n  Coach Phil Jackson, winner of seven NBA Championship rings and a \nplayoff winning percentage of .718, has proven to be one of the most \ninnovative and adaptable coaches in the NBA.\n  And when you add to this terrific trio and strong supporting cast--\nincluding Glenn Rice, A.C. Green, Ron Harper, Robert Horry, Rick Fox, \nDerrick Fisher, Brian Shaw, Devean George, Tyronn Lue, John Celestand, \nTravis Knight, and John Salley--the recipe for a championship was \nwritten.\n\n  I also congratulate team owner Dr. Jerry Buss, General Manager Jerry \nWest and all the others who worked so hard to return the championship \nmagic to the City of Angels. But most of all, I would like to \ncongratulate the myriad of Lakers fans who have pulled for this team \nthrough it all.\n  The 1999-2000 Los Angeles Lakers will go down in history with those \nlegendary teams of the past. And we can add the names of Shaquille \nO'Neal and Kobe Bryan to the tapestry of Laker greats: George Mikan, \nWilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and \nthe incomparable Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson.\n  These Lakers demonstrated immeasurable determination, heart, stamina, \nand an amazing comeback ability in their drive for the championship. \nThey have made the City of Los Angeles and the State of California \nproud.\n  The Los Angeles Lakers have started the 21st century meeting the high \nstandards they established in the 20th century. In the years ahead, I \nhave no doubt that this team will add numerous championship banners to \nthe rafters of the Staples Center.\n  Senator Boxer and I thought it would be fitting of offer this \nresolution today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble be agreed to \nen bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements related thereto be printed in the Record, with no \nintervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 324) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, on June 6th, Senator DeWine and I \nintroduced legislation to help the Department of Defense move ahead \ntowards addressing their future workforce needs. Our bill, the \nDepartment of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act of 2000, gives \nthe Department of Defense the necessary flexibility to adequately \nmanage its civilian workforce and align its human capital to meet the \ndemands of the post-cold war environment.\n  The amendment that Senator DeWine and I are offering today adds the \nmodified language of our bill to this DOD authorization bill so that \nthe U.S. military can more adequately prepare for tomorrow's \nchallenges.\n  Mr. President, before I speak on the amendment itself, I would like \nto discuss the human capital crisis that is confronting the Federal \nGovernment. Since July of last year, the Oversight of Government \nManagement Subcommittee, which I chair, has held six hearings on \nfederal workforce issues. Some of the issues we have examined include \nmanagement reform initiatives, Federal employee training needs and the \neffectiveness of employee incentive programs.\n  One point that I have emphasized at each of these hearings is that \nthe employees of the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nshould be treated as its most valued resource. In reality, Mr. \nPresident, Federal employees and human capital management have been \nlong overlooked.\n  In fact, this past March, Comptroller General David Walker testified \nbefore the Oversight Subcommittee that the government's human capital \nmanagement systems could earn the GAO's ``high-risk'' designation in \nJanuary 2001. While there are several reasons why the Federal \nGovernment's human capital management is in such disarray, there are \nsuggestions that an improper execution of government downsizing has \nplayed a larger role than has been previously recognized.\n  Walker stated that ``(GAO's) reviews have found, for example, that a \nlack of adequate strategic and workforce planning during the initial \nrounds of downsizing by some agencies may have affected their ability \nto achieve organizational missions. Some agencies reported that \ndownsizing in general led to such negative effects as a loss of \ninstitutional memory and an increase in work backlogs. Although [GAO] \nfound that an agency's planning for downsizing improved as their \ndownsizing efforts continued, it is by no means clear that the current \nworkforce is adequately balanced to properly execute agencies' missions \ntoday, nor that adequate plans are in place to ensure the appropriate \nbalance in the future.''\n  Furthermore, the Comptroller General testified that it appeared that \nmany Federal agencies had cut back on training as they were downsizing; \nthe very time they should have been expanding their training budgets \nand activities to better ensure that their remaining employees were \nable to effectively do their jobs.\n  While the problems associated with the downsizing of the last decade \nare becoming more apparent, the United States is faced with an even \ngreater potential threat to the Government's human capital situation in \nthis decade--massive numbers of retirements of Federal employees. By \n2004, 32 percent of the Federal workforce will be eligible for regular \nretirement, and an additional 21 percent will be eligible for early \nretirement. That's a potential loss of over 900,000 experienced \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, any other public- or private-sector manager who faced \nthe loss of more than half of his or her workforce would recognize that \nimmediate action was necessary to ensure the long-term viability of \ntheir business or organization. And over the next few years, the United \nStates must seriously address this growing human capital crisis in the \nFederal Government workforce. It will not be easy--years of downsizing \nand hiring freezes have taken their toll, as will a pending retirement-\nexodus for ``baby boomer'' Federal employees. Add to that the lure of a \nstrong private sector economy drawing more young workers away from \ngovernment service, and the Federal Government will only find it harder \nto attract and retain the technology-savvy workforce that will be \nnecessary to run the government in the 21st Century.\n  To meet this challenge, Senator DeWine and I are offering this \namendment that will help one critical department of our Federal \nGovernment--the Department of Defense--get a head start in addressing \ntheir future workforce needs. As I stated earlier, this amendment gives \nthe Department of Defense the latitude it needs to manage its civilian \nworkforce as well as re-shape its human capital for the 21st century. \nWhat the Defense Department is able to accomplish via this amendment \nmay serve as a model for use throughout the government.\n  During the last decade, the Defense Department underwent a massive \ncivilian workforce downsizing program that saw a cut of more than \n280,000 positions. In addition, the Defense Department--like other \nFederal departments--was subject to hiring restrictions. Taken \ntogether, these two factors have inhibited the development of mid-level \ncareer, civilian professionals within the DOD.\n  The extent of this problem is exhibited in the fact that right now, \nthe Department is seriously understaffed in certain key occupations, \nsuch as computer experts and foreign language specialists. The lack of \nsuch professionals has the potential to affect the Defense Department's \nability to respond effectively and rapidly to threats to our national \nsecurity.\n  Our amendment will assist the Department in shaping the ``skills \nmix'' of the current workforce in order to address shortfalls brought \nabout by years of downsizing, and to meet the need for new skills in \nemerging technological and professional areas. In testimony before the \nOversight Subcommittee, Comptroller General Walker recognized the need \nfor such actions, noting that, ``(I)n cutting back on the hiring of new \nstaff in order to reduce the number of their employees, agencies also \nreduced the influx of new people with the new competencies needed to \nsustain excellence.''\n\n  So what will workforce shaping mean to the Department of Defense? In \nthe United States Air Force, workforce shaping will allow the Air Force \nresearch labs to meet changing requirements in their mission. For \nexample, at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, they need fewer \npsychologists and more aerospace engineers; at Rome Air Force Base in \nRome, New York, they need computer scientists rather than operations \nresearch analysts; and at Wright-Patterson Air Force Based in Dayton, \nOhio, they need more materials engineers rather than physicists.\n  Also, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, there is a need to move \nfrom the mechanical/aeronautical engineering skills that their senior \nengineers possess to skills that are more focused on emerging \ntechnologies in electrical engineering, such as space operations, \nlasers, optics, advanced materials and directed energy fields. Changing \nthe skills requirements at Wright-Patterson will help the Base meet \ntheir needs for the next 10 to 15 years.\n  The U.S. Army Materiel Command determined that employees at two of \nits locations--St. Louis, Missouri and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania--\npossessed the wrong computer skills to meet the Army's new information \ntechnology requirements. Switching from COBAL to a more commercially-\noriented computer language, the Army found that their employee's skills \ndid not match the new requirements, nor were their skills readily \ntransferable. Subsequently, this mission was contracted to a private \ncompany. Almost 450 Federal jobs were eliminated with many of those \nscheduled for involuntary separation by reduction in force.\n  If Voluntary Separation Incentive Pay (VSIP) had been available for \nreshaping and realignment, the Army may have been able to save some of \nthese employees from involuntary separation by using VSIP to increase \nvoluntary separations. The use of VSIP also could have allowed for the \nretention of Federal jobs since the Army could have provided separation \nincentives to the COBAL-trained workers and hired new, commercially-\noriented technology workers in their place. Instead, the Army \ncontracted with a private company to meet the mission requirement in a \ntimely manner, and the existing workforce was involuntarily separated.\n  Even so, the most immediate problem facing the Defense Department is \nthe need to address its serious demographic challenges. The average \nDefense employee is 45 years old and more than a third of the \nDepartment's workforce is age 51 or older. In the Department of the Air \nForce, for example, 45 percent of the workforce will be eligible for \neither regular retirement or early retirement by 2005.\n  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is an excellent example of the \ndemographic challenge facing many military installations across the \ncountry. Wright-Patterson is the headquarters of the Air Force Material \nCommand, and employs 22,700 civilian federal workers. By 2005, 40 \npercent of the workforce will be age 55 or older. Another 19 percent \nwill be between 50 and 54 years of age. Thirty-three percent will be in \ntheir forties. Only six percent will be age 35 to 39, and less than two \npercent will be under the age of 34. According to these numbers, by \n2005, 60 percent of Wright-Patterson's civilian employees will be \neligible for either early or regular retirement.\n  Although a mass exodus of all retirement-eligible employees is not \nanticipated, there is a genuine concern that a significant portion of \nthe civilian workforce at Wright-Patterson and\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\nelsewhere in the Department of Defense, including hundreds of key \nleaders and employees with crucial expertise, could decide to retire, \nleaving the remaining workforce without experienced leadership and \nabsent essential institutional knowledge.\n  This combination of factors poses a serious challenge to the long-\nterm effectiveness of the civilian component of the Defense Department, \nand by implication, the national security of the United States. \nMilitary base leaders, and indeed the entire Defense establishment, \nneed to be given the flexibility to hire new employees so they can \ndevelop another generation of civilian leaders and employees who will \nbe able to provide critical support to our men and women in uniform.\n  That is the purpose of our amendment. It addresses the current skills \nand age imbalance in the federal workforce before the increase in \nretirements of senior public employees begins in the next five years. \nIf we wait for this ``retirement bubble'' to burst before we start to \nhire new employees, then we will have fewer seasoned individuals left \nin the federal workforce who can provide adequate training and \nmentoring.\n  Our amendment will allow the Defense Department to conduct a smoother \ntransition by not waiting for these retirements before bringing new \nemployees into the Department over the next five years with the skills \nthe U.S. needs for the future. As they are hired, the new employees \nwill have the opportunity to work with and learn from their more \nexperienced colleagues, and invaluable institutional knowledge will be \npassed along.\n  As I was drafting this proposal, I wanted to make sure that those who \nwould be most impacted by it--Department of Defense civilian \nemployees--would have an opportunity to comment on it. I contacted the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees and asked them to provide \ntheir opinion of this proposal. After thoroughly reviewing it, AFGE \ninformed me that they did have concerns that the Defense Department \nmight believe this bill authorized them to hire outside contractors to \nperform work that is currently being done by government employees.\n  I want to state--emphatically--that this is not the purpose or intent \nof this amendment. Let me repeat: it is not the intent of this \namendment, nor should any intent be construed, to allow the Defense \nDepartment to circumvent their obligations to our civilian workforce. \nThe purpose of this amendment is to help the Department ``rightsize and \nrevitalize'' its civilian workforce, not reduce the number of federal \nfull-time equivalent employees. I encourage management officials at the \nDepartment of Defense to work closely with the Department's union \nrepresentatives on the implementation of this measure.\n  In addition, this amendment allows the early retirement and \nseparation pay authorities to be exercised only for workforce \nrealignment, or for purposes specified in this amendment, or as they \nexist in current law.\n  We are not seeking to establish a program to address problems of \nindividual employees' performance. Employee performance problems will \ncontinue to be handled by managers, who must use the performance \nmanagement system under existing law--a system that gives affected \nemployees particular procedural and substantive rights.\n  Further, our amendment stipulates that the offer of early retirement \nor separation pay may only be used under a consistent and well-\ndocumented application of relevant, objective non-personal criteria. \nThus, under the amendment, as in existing law, an individual employee \nmay not be ``targeted'' for early retirement or separation pay for the \npurpose of providing benefits to or affecting the removal of that \nemployee.\n  Mr. President, our amendment would also require that, no later than \nsix months after this bill becomes law, the Secretary of Defense shall \ndevelop a strategic plan for the exercise of the authorities provided \nby this amendment, and that these authorities cannot be exercised until \nthat strategic plan has been submitted to Congress. This plan shall be \nconsistent with the strategic plan developed by the Department pursuant \nto the Government Performance and Results Act.\n  We further expect that the Department's annual Results Act \nperformance reports will include an assessment of the effectiveness and \nusefulness of these authorities and how the exercise of these \nauthorities in helping the Department achieve its mission, meet its \nperformance goals, and fulfill its strategic plan. Senator DeWine and I \nincluded this section because during the 1990s, many Federal agencies \ndownsized their workforces without first determining their human \nresources requirements. The purpose of this section is to make sure \nthat the authorities provided by this act are not exercised \nhaphazardly, but in the context of the Department's strategic plan and \nfuture requirements.\n  As a fiscal conservative, I believe that the monetary cost of this \namendment pales in comparison to the costs we will incur if we do not \nbegin to address our human capital issue immediately.\n  We cannot forget that within five years, hundreds of thousands of \nfederal employees will begin to retire. Most of these future retirees \nhave decades of expertise and vital institutional knowledge, and once \nthey are out of the workforce, so too is their ability to train a new \ngeneration of federal workers.\n  It would be incredibly short-sighted if, in an attempt to save money, \nwe simply wait for these hundreds of thousands of defense employees to \nretire before we even start to consider hiring their replacements. If \nwe do nothing, I believe we will be left in a position where the \ncivilian component of the Defense Department will be subject to an \n``experience gap'' that will take years to overcome and which would be \nmeasured not in dollars but in diminished national security.\n  We must give the Department of Defense the tools it needs to bring in \nnew federal employees, with the skills necessary to meet the challenges \nof tomorrow. While this amendment does not address all of the human \ncapital needs of the Defense Department, it is an important first step \nand will help ensure that the Department of Defense recruits and \nretains a quality civilian workforce so that our armed forces may \nremain the best in the world. It is extremely important to the future \nvitality of the Department's civilian workforce and the national \nsecurity of the United States that we address the human capital crisis \nwhile we have the opportunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss provisions (Section \n906) in the FY 2001 National Defense Authorization Act (S. 2549) aimed \nat supporting efforts within the Department of Defense to develop a set \nof operational concepts, sometimes referred to as ``Network Centric \nWarfare,'' that seek to exploit the power of information and US \nsuperiority in information technologies to maintain dominance and \nimprove interoperability on the battlefield. I am very pleased to have \nbeen joined in the development of these provisions by my able \ncolleagues, Senators Roberts and Bingaman. This concept of operations \ngenerates increased combat power by networking sensors, decision makers \nand shooters to achieve shared situational awareness, increased speed \nof command, higher tempo of synchronized operations, greater lethality, \nincreased survivability, and more efficient support operations. In the \nwords of Vice Admiral Arthur Cebrowski, the President of the Naval War \nCollege, ``Network Centric Warfare is an embodiment of the emerging \ntheory of warfare for the Information Age.''\n  As we strive to transform our military to meet the challenges and \nthreats of the new century, it is clear that we must make better use of \nour huge advantages in information technology, sensors, networks, and \ncomputing to achieve battlefield dominance. Network Centric Warfare \nexploits these advantages not only by identifying, developing, and \nutilizing the best new networking and sensing technologies, but also by \nadjusting our existing doctrine, tactics, training and even \nacquisition, planning, and programming to reflect the network centric \nconcepts of operations. A truly networked force can be lighter, faster, \nmore precise, more Joint and more able to respond to contingencies \nranging from peacekeeping to major regional conflicts.\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\n  In Joint Vision 2020, the Joint Chiefs of Staff highlight the \ncritical role that information and information systems will play in \nfuture operations, stating:\n\n       * * * the ongoing ``information revolution'' is creating \n     not only a quantitative, but a qualitative change in the \n     information environment that by 2020 will result in profound \n     changes in the conduct of military operations. In fact, \n     advances in information capabilities are proceeding so \n     rapidly that there is a risk of outstripping our ability to \n     capture ideas, formulate operational concepts, and develop \n     the capacity to assess results. While the goal of achieving \n     information superiority will not change, the nature, scope, \n     and ``rules'' of the quest are changing radically.\n       Information superiority provides the joint force a \n     competitive advantage only when it is effectively translated \n     into superior knowledge and decisions. The joint force must \n     be able to take advantage of superior information converted \n     to superior knowledge to achieve ``decision superiority''--\n     better decisions arrived at and implemented faster than an \n     opponent can react, or in a noncombat situation, at a tempo \n     that allows the force to shape the situation or react to \n     changes and accomplish its mission. Decision superiority does \n     not automatically result from information superiority. \n     Organizational and doctrinal adaptation, relevant training \n     and experience, and the proper command and control mechanisms \n     and tools are equally necessary.\n\n  The legislation in Section 906 of S. 2549 explores many of the facets \nof this Joint vision of a networked force and operations.\n  It is clear that there have been chronic difficulties and \ndeficiencies in our recent military operations, including Kosovo, \nassociated with Service-centric boundaries and segmentation of \noperational areas by Service, which have resulted in a number of \ninteroperability failures and inefficiencies. Reports have suggested \nthat we continue to have difficulty collecting, processing, and \ndisseminating critical information to our battlefields. These \nshortfalls, for example, severely limited our ability to make full use \nof the capabilities of our JSTARS aircraft or to effectively strike \nmobile targets. Earlier in this session, the Armed Services Committee \nreceived testimony concerning Kosovo operations from Lieutenant General \nMichael Short, the Commander of Allied Air Forces in Southern Europe, \nwhere he highlighted improvements made within the Air Force to move \ntargeting information from intelligence assets (for example, U-2s) to \nsome combat aircraft. But he also pointed out the need to expand these \nefforts,\n\n       * * * we need to be able to do that across the fleet, to \n     move information to A-10s and F-16s and F/A-18s and F-14s, \n     everything we have got, * * * to rapidly respond to the \n     emerging situation.\n\n  It is also clear that these problems do not all stem from \ntechnological deficiencies. In fact, many of the interoperability \ndifficulties that we see today result from force and organizational \nstructures, doctrine, and tactics that have not kept pace with \ntechnological change. Admiral James Ellis, the Commander-in-Chief of \nAllied Forces in Southern Europe, highlighted these problems for the \nCommittee, stating about the Kosovo operation,\n\n       There are clearly opportunities for us to, through \n     firewalls and the like, to pass data, * * * that we were not \n     able to during this effort that require attention as well, so \n     that at a staff level as well as at a planning and execution \n     level we have the ability to communicate as freely as we need \n     to in order to ensure that we've got the security and the \n     capability that the alliance is capable of delivering.\n\n  The networking of our military assets and the training of our \npersonnel and transformation of our forces to adapt to an information-\ncentric environment will be critical for future military operations. \nTheater Missile Defense is an excellent example of the need for this \ntype of network centric approach. Given the global proliferation of \nmissile technology and weapons of mass destruction, we are moving \ntoward a robust missile defense capability to protect our warfighters \ndeployed overseas. The Theater Missile Defense mission depends on the \nseamless linking of multiple Joint assets and on the timely passing of \ncritical information between sensors and shooters. Earlier this year, \nLieutenant General Ron Kadish testified that we have got ``some long \nwork ahead'' to make our various Theater Missile Defense efforts \ninteroperable. We must all work to ensure that we develop the space-\nbased and airborne sensing systems, interoperable networking and \ncommunications systems, and Joint operations and organizations needed \nto perform this vital mission.\n  After extensive discussions with a variety of Agency and Service \nofficials, I believe that although there are many innovative efforts \nunderway throughout the Department to develop network centric \ntechnologies and systems, as well as to establish mechanisms to \nintegrate information systems, sensors, weapon systems and decision \nmakers, these efforts are too often underfunded, low-priority, and not \ncoordinated across Services. In many cases, they will unfortunately \ncontinue the legacy of interoperability problems that we all know exist \ntoday. To paraphrase one senior Air Force officer, we are not making \nthe necessary fundamental changes--we are still nibbling at the edges.\n\n  The legislation incorporated into the Defense bill calls for DoD to \nprovide three reports to Congress detailing efforts in moving towards \nNetwork Centric forces and operations.\n  Section 906(b) calls for a report focusing on the broad development \nand implementation of Network Centric Warfare concepts in the \nDepartment of Defense. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff are asked to report on their current and planned \nefforts to coordinate all DoD activities in Network Centric Warfare to \nshow how they are moving toward a truly Joint, networked force. The \nreport calls for the development of a set of metrics as discussed in \nSection 906(b)(2)(C) to be used to monitor our progress towards a \nJoint, network centric force and the attainment of fully integrated \nJoint command and control capabilities, both in technology and \norganizational structure. These metrics will then be used in more \ndetailed case studies described in Section 906(b)(2)(E)--focusing on \nService interoperability and fratricide reduction.\n  The legislation also requires the Department to report on how it is \nmoving towards Joint Requirements and Acquisition policies and \nincreasing Joint authority in this area to ensure that future forces \nwill be truly seamless, interoperable, and network-centric, as \ndescribed in Sections 906(b)(2) (F) through (I). Many view these Joint \nactivities as being critically necessary to achieving networked systems \nand operations. Unless we move away from a system designed to protect \nindividual Service interests and procurement programs, we will always \nbe faced with solving interoperability problems between systems. For \nexample, strengthening the Joint oversight of the requirements for and \nacquisition of all systems directly involved in Joint Task Forces \ninteroperability would provide a sounder method for acquiring these \nsystems. We need to move away from a Cold War based, platform-centric \nacquisition system that is slow, cumbersome, and Service-centric. As \npart of this review, we ask DoD to examine the speed at which it can \nacquire new technologies and whether the personnel making key decisions \non information systems procurement are technically trained or at least \nsupported by the finest technical talent available. We also need to \nensure that Service acquisition systems are responsive to the \nestablishment of Joint interoperability standards in networking, \ncomputing, and communications, as well as best commercial practices.\n  In the operations support area, DoD can follow the example of the \nprivate sector--which has embraced network centric operations to \nimprove efficiency in an increasingly competitive environment. \nCompanies as different as IBM and WalMart are both moving to streamline \nand unify their networks and to make their distribution, inventory \ncontrol and personnel management systems more modern and information-\ncentric. Successful firms are not only buying the newest technology, \nthey are also changing their operations and business plans to deal with \nthe new networked environments. Section 906(b)(2)(J) calls for the \nDepartment to study private sector efforts in these areas and evaluate \ntheir past successes and failures as they can inform future DoD \nactivities.\n  Section 906(c) describes the second report, which examines the use of \nthe Joint Experimentation Program in developing Network Centric Warfare \nconcepts. Network Centric Warfare is inherently Joint, and the \nCommander in\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\nChief of Joint Forces Command is in the best position to develop new \noperational concepts and test the new technologies that support it. The \nreport calls for a description of how the Joint Experimentation Program \nand the results of its activities are to be used to develop new Joint \nRequirements, Doctrine, and Acquisition programs to support network \ncentric operations. It also requires the development and description of \na plan to use the Joint Experimentation program to identify impediments \nto the development of a joint information network, including the \nlinking of Service intranets, as well as redesigning force structures \nto leverage new network centric operational concepts.\n  The final report, described in Section 906(d), focuses on the \ncoordination of Service and Agency Science and Technology investments \nin the development of future Joint Network Centric Warfare \ncapabilities. In moving towards a more Joint, networked force we must \ncontinue to ensure that we provide our nation's warfighters with the \nbest technologies. We must increase our investments in areas such as \nsensors, networking protocols, human-machine interfaces, training, and \nother technologies outlined in Section 906(d)(2)(A), especially in the \nface of declining S budgets. The report requires the Undersecretary \nof Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to explain how \nS investments supporting network centric operations will be \ncoordinated across the Agencies and Services to eliminate redundancy \nand better address critical warfighter, technology, and R needs. This \nis more important than ever as we develop our next generation of weapon \nsystems--better coordination and establishment of common standards in \nthe technology development stages can only help to alleviate future \ninteroperability problems.\n  The Undersecretary's planning and evaluation of investments in S \nfor a network centric force must also address the role of the operator \nin a network centric system. We must pay more attention to the training \nof our combat and support personnel so that they can make the best use \nof information technologies, as well as investing more in research on \nlearning and cognitive processes so that our training systems and \nhuman-machine interfaces are optimized.\n  The investments recommended in the report should also accommodate the \nincredible pace of change in information technologies that is currently \ndriven by the commercial sector. To address this, Section 906(d)(2)(B) \ncalls for an analysis of how commercially driven revolutions in \ninformation technology are modifying the DoD's investment strategy and \nincorporation of dual-use technologies.\n  I believe this legislation will help focus the Pentagon and Congress' \nattention on the need to move our military into a more information \nsavvy and networked force. I hope that these three key reports set \nforth the needed organizational, policy, and legislative changes \nnecessary to achieve this transformation for decision makers in the \nmilitary, Administration, and in Congress. I believe that our future \nmilitary operations must be network centric to preserve our \ntechnological and operational superiority. I look forward to receiving \nplans and proposals to help get us there efficiently and effectively.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, earlier today, I voted to table Senator \nMurray's amendment to the FY2001 Department of Defense authorization \nbill. This amendment, which was successfully tabled, would have allowed \nfor the performance of abortion services on our military bases. It is \nclear to me, Mr. President, that this amendment would have violated the \nspirit of the Hyde law, which prohibits Government-funded abortions.\n  Proponents of the amendment attempted to get around this prohibition \nby requiring that women receiving abortions on military installations \npay for their own abortions. But, Mr. President, this simply does not \neliminate government involvement in the delivery of abortion services. \nMilitary doctors would have to perform the abortions voluntarily, or \nour Armed Forces would have to contract with private doctors to perform \nthe abortions.\n  Mr. President, we cannot turn our military bases into abortion \nclinics. Clearly, the federal government is prohibited from the \nprovision of abortions, and should not be in the business of \nfacilitating any abortion services on our military bases. Our federal \ngovernment has no role to play in providing abortion services. It is \nthat simple.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may inquire, as I understand it, \ntoday the Senate will not further consider the armed services bill; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5443-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5443-S5445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S. 2522 by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2522) making appropriations for foreign \n     operations, export financing, and related programs for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the pending bill provides $13.4 billion \nfor foreign assistance programs. By comparison, last year the Senate \nvoted 97-2 for a $12.6 billion bill and the President signed a $13.7 \nbillion bill. Given the budget constraints, the fact that we are just \nbelow last year's final level is a tribute to Senator Stevens' and \nSenator Byrd's adept management of allocations.\n  I think the bill strikes a good balance between meeting emerging \nrequirements yet requiring accountability for the funds we make \navailable.\n  In terms of meeting emerging global needs, we have invested $651 \nmillion in a new, global health initiative which will help ramp up \nimmunizations and combat malaria, tuberculosis, polio, and AIDS. \nSenator Leahy deserves special recognition for his efforts to establish \nthis initiative with adequate funding. The committee's interest in \nhealth began several years ago when we earmarked $25 million for polio \nprograms. The administration's initial howls of protest have been \nsilenced since we are on the verge of wiping out the disease thanks \nlargely to the public-private collaboration between the Rotary Club and \ninternational donors.\n  We have a unique opportunity, if not responsibility, to replicate the \nsuccess of this public-private partnership in other health areas, given \nrecent generous support for vaccination research and programs by \npharmaceutical companies and the Gates Foundation.\n  The bill also increases funding for key countries in the Balkans \nstruggling to accelerate economic and political reforms. The \nadministration requested $195 million in a supplemental and $610 \nmillion for 2001. Instead of adding to emergency spending, the \ncommittee has increased the overall amount made available for fiscal \nyear 2001 to $635 million rather than add to emergency spending. I do \nnot think the region needs more money so much as it requires better \nmanagement of American resources. With $635 million, I think we have \nmore than adequately responded to the needs of the region.\n  Within this increase we were able to provide $89 million for \nMontenegro and $60 million for Croatia, which in each case combined the \nSupplemental and 2001 request. Our assistance to the government in \nMontenegro is a lifeline as they struggle to address mounting political \nand economic pressure applied by the regime in Belgrade. Within the \nlast few weeks we have seen an escalation of political violence which \ncan be traced to Belgrade including the assassination of a presidential \nbodyguard and an attack on a member of the political opposition. We \nneed to be clear about U.S. support for the embattled Montenegrin \nGovernment.\n  Croatia's recent elections renew prospects for real reforms and real \ngrowth, which I expect our funding help encourage. I commend the new \ngovernment for making serious commitments to allow for the return of \nrefugees, suspend support for extremists in Bosnia, and press forward \nwith political and\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\neconomic reforms. To give the new government some leverage, the bill \nincludes those commitments as benchmarks for releasing our assistance.\n  As the Croatian provisions illustrate, this bill is not just about \nspending. It is fundamentally about accountability--we must have more \nconfidence that the resources we commit will, in fact, achieve results.\n  U.S. resources cannot singlehandedly rebuild, rehabilitate, reform, \nor develop a nation, but we can assure that aid is effectively \nadministered and we must guarantee our partners--including other \ndonors, recipients, and nongovernment organizations--all share the \nburden and share our commitment to free market economics and democracy.\n  I think it is pretty clear in Kosovo we are off track. Last year, we \nearmarked $150 million for Kosovo with the requirement that our pledge \nwould not exceed 15 percent of the total committed by European and \nother donors. We also made clear we would not assume any responsibility \nfor major infrastructure reconstruction. The initial affect of this \nconditionality was positive, and the Secretary of State was able to \ndetermine that other donors pledged enough to meet at least 85 percent \nof the resource requirements. Unfortunately, those pledges have been \nslow to materialize. Donor support for roads, clinics, schools, \nutilities, courts, and industry is imperceptible.\n\n  Instead of supporting an effort to build up Kosova, we are building \nup a U.N. bureaucracy--and a pretty incompetent one at that. UNMIK is \nlike a huge Macy's Thanksgiving Day float--bloated and detached--\ndrifting far above the crowd--fluttering in a confetti cloud of \nrulings, edicts, ordinances, and injunctions.\n  Few Kosovars I talk with can point to a single meaningful \naccomplishment. Instead, they suggest Serb rule has been supplanted by \nthe United Nations--a more benign influence, perhaps, but every bit as \nindifferent and irrelevant to real Kosovar needs.\n  And, we are expected to pay the lion's share for this waste. For \nmonths, the committee has been besieged by requests to release funds \nbecause of urgent shortfalls and gaps other donors have failed to fill.\n  We are making the same mistake we made in Bosnia. And it isn't just \nthe U.N.'s failure. Within weeks of setting up a mission, AID set off \non a course to fund large-scale contracts with groups that had no local \nexperience or no inclination to build up and to leave behind a \nstrengthened local civic society.\n  To address these problems, the bill structures new conditions on our \nsupport for Kosovo. This year, we have modified language so that U.S. \nactual expenditures do not exceed 15 percent of the total actual \nexpenditures by all donors. And, we require that 50 percent of all \nresources flow through local nongovernment organizations which know \nwhat they are doing and have the only, real prospect of making a \ndifference at the community level.\n  Turning to Russia, the new Putin government is untested in many \nrespects, but not in its ability to wage a ruthless war against \ncivilians in Chechnya. After creating 440,000 refugees, Moscow not only \nis limiting access by international relief workers, they have \nstonewalled international attempts to allow investigations of alleged \nwar crimes and atrocities.\n  The Clinton administration has made a bad situation worse. Not only \ndid they refuse to vote in support the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner's \ncall for an international investigation and tribunal, the Bureau of \nRefugees and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have rejected requests to \nsupport the courageous relief workers operating in the region. The \nDepartment argues they don't want to encourage groups to enter unsafe \nareas. This is both disingenuous and unjust--these groups are already \nin Chechnya and Ingushetia desperate for contributions. What the \nadministration refuses to admit is they simply don't want to challenge \nor upset the Russians. This is a dangerous, longstanding pattern which \ncompromises our values and our interests.\n  Russia's war against the Chechen people makes me wonder what kind of \ndemocracy the administration has helped fund with more than $5 billion \nin assistance.\n  Over the years, and including administration veto threats, we have \ntried--and often failed--to establish benchmarks and conditions on U.S. \naid to Russia. This year, we have conditioned further support to the \nRussian Government upon certification that the Putin government is \nallowing relief workers unimpeded access in Chechnya and Ingushetia. We \nalso require certification that the Russian Government is fully \ncooperating with international investigations of war crimes and \natrocities committed in Chechnya and relief efforts. Finally, of money \nmade available to Russia, we have earmarked $10 million for \nnongovernment organization relief operations in Chechnya and \nIngushetia.\n\n  Turning to our hemisphere, after spending more than $2 billion in \nHaiti, most of us are frustrated by the fact that it remains the \npoorest country in the hemisphere with political assassinations and \nviolence a staple of daily life. Only real political change holds out \nhope of producing stability and economic progress, so we have \nconditioned further assistance upon certification that the Preval \ngovernment has allowed free and fair elections to proceed and that a \nparliament is seated on schedule this month.\n  That may prove difficult given yesterday's news. Apparently, \naccording to the New York Times, Haiti's top election official fled the \ncountry, ``fearing for his life after he refused to approve results for \nlast month's contested legislative and local elections.''\n  Now, let me take a moment to describe the committee's treatment of \nthe Colombia supplemental request. Our disposition of Plan Colombia \ndiffers from the request in four ways.\n  First, within the Foreign Operations area, the overall funding is \nlower. The administration requested $1,073,500,000. The Committee has \nappropriated $934,100,000.\n  Second, that lower funding level is primarily a result of providing a \ndifferent helicopter package. The request was for 30 Blackhawks at a \ncost of $388 million. We have provided 60 Huey IIs at a cost of $118.5 \nmillion. These numbers include the first year's operating costs.\n  Third, with the savings in the helicopter package we were able to \ninvest in a regional strategy and substantially increase aid to \nBolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. I felt the administration's singular focus \non Colombia guaranteed that the production and trafficking problem \nwould simply be pushed across the border. The bill's regional emphasis \non interdiction and development keeps Colombian traffickers from \nbecoming a moving target. We more than doubled the regional request of \n$76 million and provided $205 million.\n  This level allowed us to fully fund Bolivia's request of $120 million \nfor both alternative development and interdiction programs. With an \nimpressive track record in eradication of coca and alternative \ndevelopment, Bolivia deserves our continued support as the government \ncompletes the task. The results in Bolivia are truly noteworthy, almost \nto the point of being astonishing.\n  Similarly, we nearly tripled the support for Ecuador while increasing \naid to the Peruvian Government as well.\n  Fourth and finally, we added $50 million to the $93 million request \nfor human rights monitoring. As the military pressure picks up, so will \nthe likelihood of abuses, so we have expanded witness, prosecutor, and \njudicial protection programs as well as support to monitoring groups. \nWe have also conditioned aid on the Secretary of State certifying that \nthe Colombian military is in full compliance with their own laws \nrequiring the prosecution of military officers in civilian courts for \nalleged human rights abuses. This should help end the pattern of \nallowing these cases to be dropped in military courts.\n  In addition to supplemental funds for Colombia, the administration \nalso submitted a $193 million supplemental request for Mozambique, only \n$10 million dedicated to meeting immediate disaster needs. While there \nis no question the flooding in Mozambique was a disaster, the question \nthe committee had to consider was whether the requested funds were for \nimmediate urgent needs or long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction \nwhich should be addressed in the fiscal year 2001 regular spending \nbill. What we chose to provide in emergency spending will offer \nimmediate relief on a one-time basis, rather than support the longer-\nterm reconstruction and rehabilitation needs which can be\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\ncovered by the increase we provided in the 2001 development assistance.\n  Finally, the committee was asked to support a $210 million \nsupplemental package for a contribution to the Heavily Indebted Poor \nCountries Initiative Trust Fund. The committee has provided an initial \ncommitment of $75 million pending authorization legislation currently \nbeing considered by the Banking Committee.\n  With that, let me pass the baton to my friend and colleague, Senator \nLeahy, with whom I have enjoyed working on this legislation each year \nduring our time together, as either chairman or the ranking member. I \nexpress my gratitude to him for his friendship and the cooperative way \nin which we have proceeded every year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky for his gracious comments.\n  I am very pleased to join my friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, \nwho as chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee has done a \nsuperb job getting this bill to the floor.\n  The Appropriations Committee reported this bill on May 9 after very \nlittle debate. The fact that it sailed through our committee was a \nreflection of the bipartisan way the bill was put together. We did \neverything possible to accommodate the wishes of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  This bill is $780 million above last year's Senate foreign operations \nbill. We increased funding for global health programs, which many \nSenators support.\n  We increased export assistance. We increased funding for a number of \nother important programs. That is the good news. But this bill is $350 \nmillion below last year's enacted level, and $1.7 billion below the \nPresident's 2001 budget request.\n  We were not able to fully fund several programs that have broad \nsupport, such as the Peace Corps, but I expect that more will be done \nin the conference committee.\n  The bill also does not respond adequately to the emergency disaster \nneeds in Mozambique, which was devastated by floods earlier this year. \nWe provided only $25 million out of a request of $193 million. I cannot \nhelp but compare the billions we have spent to relieve the suffering of \npeople in Bosnia and Kosovo, with our minuscule aid to Southern Africa.\n  The bill provides only $75 million of the $435 million in emergency \nsupplemental and fiscal year 2001 funding for debt relief for the \npoorest countries, which has bipartisan support in both the House and \nSenate. This is an international initiative led by the United States. \nWe need to do our share.\n  We also fell short on the International Development Association, the \nsoft-loan window of the World Bank. We are about $85 million short.\n  I have some real concerns about the way the World Bank is handling \nstaff complaints of misconduct, such as harassment and retaliation.\n  I am preparing some proposals for the World Bank to address these \nproblems.\n  Several Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, have written to me \nurging more funding for the Global Environment Facility, which supports \nprograms to protect the ozone, reduce ocean pollution, and protect \nbiodiversity. We were only able to provide $50 million, out of a \nrequest of $175 million.\n  Some have complained that the GEF is funding the Kyoto Protocol. \nThose critics owe it to the GEF to specify which activities they \noppose, rather than making vague objections that are not based on \nfacts. We need to find common ground on addressing these critical \nenvironmental problems.\n  Finally, I want to address the emergency funding for Colombia, which \nwas attached to this bill in the committee. I want to help Colombia, \nwhich is facing threats from left-wing guerrillas, right-wing \nparamilitaries, and drug traffickers allied with both.\n  I also have a lot of respect for Colombia's President Pastrana. We \nare already giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Colombia.\n  But I cannot endorse a proposal that would vastly increase our \nmilitary involvement in Colombia that is so poorly thought out and \nsuffers from so many unanswered questions.\n  Although the administration does not like to talk about it, this is \nonly the first billion-dollar installment of a multiyear, open-ended \ncommitment of many more billions of dollars.\n  Nobody can say what they expect this to cost, what we can expect to \nachieve, in what period of time, how intensifying a war that cannot be \nwon will lead to peace, or what the risks are to hundreds of American \nmilitary and civilian personnel in Colombia or to Colombian civilians. \nI have asked the Administration these questions, but their answers are \nvague at best.\n  Even the goal is vague. If it is to stop the flow of illegal drugs \ninto the United States, that is wishful thinking. If it is to defeat \nthe guerrillas, this is not the way to do it. I think the American \npeople deserve better answers before we spend billions of their tax \ndollars on another civil war in South America.\n  Having said that, I very much appreciate Chairman McConnell's \nwillingness to include a number of conditions on the aid, which have \nstrong bipartisan support. If this Colombia aid passes, these human \nrights conditions and reporting requirements are essential to ensure \nthat the aid is not misused and that human rights are protected.\n  As with many other appropriations bills, we are going to need to get \na higher allocation if the President is going to sign this bill. But as \nthe Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, has \nsaid, this is one step in the process. I believe it is a good start and \nthat we should pass this bill. There is no reason why we cannot wrap it \nup very quickly.\n  With the distinguished chairman on the floor, I tell him that on my \nside of the aisle, I urge anybody who has amendments to get them over \nhere and let us try to wrap it up in the morning so that by early \ntomorrow afternoon we can go on to a different bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say in response to the suggestion of \nthe Senator from Vermont, I believe we now do have a consent agreement \nthat will allow us to move ahead, not quite as rapidly as the Senator \nfrom Vermont and I had hoped.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I must say that the Senator from Kentucky \nwould probably like to do it at the same speed I would but we are both \nrealists in this regard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe this will move us toward a completion, \nhopefully by early evening tomorrow.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all first-\ndegree amendments to the pending bill must be filed at the desk by 3 \np.m. on Wednesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Senator from Alabama amend that to request that \nthis side have an equal amount of time on his amendment tomorrow, which \nwe may or may not use?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am troubled by our efforts, which I \nsupport, to help the nation of Colombia.\n  I serve on the Narcotics Committee. I serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee. Over quite a number of months, we have had testimony and \nhearings involving this issue. I have become quite concerned about the \nstability of the nation of Colombia. I believe it is a democracy, and \nit is one of the oldest in the Western Hemisphere. It is worthy of our \nsupport.\n  I believe Colombia is in a critical point in its history with over 50 \npercent of its territory--or at least over 40 or perhaps 50 percent of \nits territory--under the hands of insurgent forces. This great nation \nis in trouble.\n  I hope we can devise a way to effectively assist them in their \nefforts to preserve democracy and freedom, economic growth and \nprosperity, and safety and freedom for their people.\n  That is the intent of my amendment. It goes to an issue that I think \nis important.\n  This is the problem we are dealing with. The President, his State \nDepartment, and his representatives have testified and said repeatedly \nthat our goal here is to reduce drugs in America and to save lives in \nAmerica.\n  Our goal is to fight drug dealers in Colombia. Our goal is to help \ndefoliate and destroy coca production in Colombia. The administration \nhas steadfastly avoided and refused to say that this Nation, the United \nStates of America, stands with the democratically-elected Government of \nPanama against two major Marxist organizations that seek to overthrow \nthe Government of Colombia, and have actually occupied large portions \nof that nation.\n  It is baffling to me why this is so. I do not understand what it is. \nMaybe it is an effort to appease the hard left in this country. Maybe \nit is an effort to appease certain liberal Members of this Senate who \njust can't see giving money to fight a left-wing guerrilla group \nanywhere in the world. Indeed, I can't recall an instance in which this \nadministration has ever given any money to support democratically-\nelected governments, or other kinds of governments, for that matter, \nagainst left-wing Marxist guerrillas.\n  These guerrilla groups have been involved in Colombia for many years. \nThey have destabilized the country. They have undermined economic \nprogress. They have provided cover and protection for drug dealers. \nThey have in fact damaged Colombia substantially.\n  I believe it is time for us to encourage Colombia to stand up to \nthese organizations, to retake this country, and to preserve democracy \nin the country. It is a serious matter, in my view.\n  Colombia has been an ally. We have encouraged them to enter into \npeace negotiations, and President Pastrana has tried his best to \nnegotiate with these guerrilla groups. In fact, Colombia has given a \npiece of their territory, I am informed, the size of Senator Leahy's \nState of Vermont to the guerrillas as a cease-fire zone, a safe zone in \nwhich they can operate without fear, and that the duly constituted \nGovernment of Colombia would not enter there and do something about it \nwhile they attempt to establish peace. But this concession, this \nappeasement to the guerrilla groups, has not appeased them. It has not \ncaused them to be less violent or aggressive. But in fact it appears it \nhas encouraged them in some ways.\n  I believe Colombia is at the point where they can achieve stability. \nI believe they can drive home, through a combination of diplomacy and \nmilitary efforts to these insurgent forces, that war is not going to \npay off, that war is a dead-end street for everyone, that they are \nwilling to accept divergent views in their democracy, that they are \nwilling to hear from the underlying concerns of the guerrilla groups. \nIn fact, President Pastrana has said that over and over again. But \nfundamentally they have to send a message that they are willing to pay \nthe price, that they are going to produce an army capable of putting \nthese guerrillas on the defensive, and that they will take back their \nterritory and unify their country.\n  There are also right-wing para-military groups in the country, a \nright-wing militia, that is involved in terrorist-type acts and \nviolations of human rights. They also need to be defeated and disbanded \nbefore Colombia can be unified. There can be no higher goal than that, \nfrom my perspective, for our country at this critical point in time.\n  What are our goals? Why won't the President discuss them plainly? Our \ngoal in Colombia is to produce regional stability. The collapse of \nColombia can undermine nearby nations, whether Bolivia or Peru or other \ncountries that border it. It can have a tremendous adverse effect on \ntheir stability.\n  Instability in Columbia, should it occur, would knock down and damage \none of our strongest trading partners. Colombia has 40 million people. \nThose people trade with the United States to a heavy degree. It would \nbe a tragedy if they were to sink into chaos and could not maintain a \nviable economy. We have a self-interest in that, but we have a real \nhuman interest in trying to make sure we utilize our abilities, our \nresources, to help that nation to right itself and take back its \nterritory.\n  As I had occasion to say to President Pastrana recently: I want to \nsee that we help. I want to help you strengthen your country. But I \nwould like you to think about a great American. I would like you to \nthink about Abraham Lincoln, who was faced with division of his \ncountry. Nearly 50 percent of his country had fallen under the hands of \nthe Southern States. He had to make a big, tough decision. That \ndecision was whether he was going to accede to that, was he going to \nallow the United\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\nStates to be divided. He decided no, and he rallied the American \npeople.\n  In the course of it, as I told Senator Biden, at one point when we \ndiscussed it, he had the occasion to have my grandfather killed at \nAntietam, who fought for the South at that time. But that was a tough \nwar. It was a tough decision. But in the long run, this country is \nbetter because we are unified today.\n  I do not believe we can achieve any lasting ability to reduce drugs \nbeing imported into this country from Colombia if Colombia cannot \ncontrol its territory. How is it possible we can expect we will make \nany progress at all if Colombia cannot control nearly 50 percent of its \nterritory? It boggles the mind.\n  I have been a Federal prosecutor for 15 years. Prosecuting drug cases \nwas a big part of my work starting in the mid-1970s, through the 1980s \nand through the early 1990s. At one point, I chaired the committee in \nthe Department of Justice on narcotics. I had briefings from everybody. \nDuring the time I was working on this issue, we believed and worked \nextraordinarily hard to achieve the end of drugs in America by stopping \ndrug production in South America. Colombia, for well over 20 years, has \nbeen the primary source of cocaine for this country. They remain so. In \nfact, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded. It has more than \ndoubled in the last 3 years. It is a dramatic increase. That is a \nconcern of ours.\n  I believe we can, I believe Colombia can, make some progress in \nreducing that supply. My best judgment tells me that after years of \nexperience and observation, this Nation is not going to solve its drug \nproblem by getting other countries in South America to reduce their \nproduction. In fact, an ounce of cocaine sells in the United States for \nmaybe $150. The cost of the coca leaf utilized to make that $150 \nproduct is about 30 cents. Farmers in South America are making a lot of \nmoney producing coca at 30 cents for those leaves. They could pay them \n$2, $3, $4, 10 times what they are paying now for coca leaf, and these \nfarmers would yield to the temptation and produce coca.\n  I do not believe this market of illegal cocaine is going to be \neliminated from our country by efforts to shut off production in South \nAmerica. The reason countries need to shut off the production of \ncocaine--and Bolivia and Peru have made progress in that regard--is to \npreserve the integrity of their own country. They do not want to allow \nillegal Mafia-type drug cartels to gain wealth and power to destabilize \ntheir countries in democracy and turn it into chaos and violence as has \nso often occurred. They have a sincere interest in achieving that goal, \nbut that interest has to be understood to be primarily their own \ninterest.\n\n  This administration refuses to talk about the real situation in \nColombia. It refuses to be honest with the American people. Their \nforeign policy request was $1.6 billion. That has been approved in the \nHouse. This bill wisely reduces that, I believe, to a little less than \n$1 billion. They are requesting this much money to make a government \nthat our Nation, the President, and the Secretary of State will not \nassert to be a country we support in their efforts against these \nguerrilla groups. I believe that is wrong. I think we need to be more \nclear eyed, more honest about our foreign policy. I believe that would \nbe the healthy approach. It will help the American people to understand \nexactly what their money is being spent for. It will help them to \nunderstand what our goals are in the region. It will help them to \nunderstand whether or not we are achieving those goals.\n  If we do so correctly, we could utilize this money to inspire \nPresident Pastrana and the people of Colombia to rise up, take back \ntheir country, to preserve their democracy, take back their territory \nfrom those who don't believe in democratic elections, who kidnap, kill, \nprotect drug dealers, who rob and steal. That is what is going on.\n  We can do something about it. We have an opportunity to utilize the \nwealth of this country to encourage that kind of end result. If we do \nso, it would be a magnificent thing for the country. To say we will \nspend $1 or $2 billion in Colombia, give it to a country we don't even \nsupport in their efforts to take back their territory, is typical of \nthe kind of disingenuousness that has characterized this \nadministration's foreign policy. It is not healthy. It should not be \ndone.\n  Therefore, I have offered a simple amendment that will say one thing: \nMr. President, you can spend this money, but you have to publicly state \nand assert and certify to this Congress that you support the duly \nelected Government of Colombia in their efforts against the Marxist, \ndrug dealing insurgents who are bent on destroying the nation.\n  This is more important than many know. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky for allowing me to have this time, and more than \nthat, for his leadership on a foreign operations bill that protects the \ninterests of the United States. It is frugal, as frugal can be in this \nday and age. He has done his best to contain excessive spending and has \nimproved and reduced this spending bill. I appreciate his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Alabama. We look forward to \ndealing with his amendment tomorrow.\n  In that regard, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, has an \namendment related to cooperation with Cuba on drug interdiction that he \nwould like to have considered after the Sessions amendment is disposed \nof tomorrow. That has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Specter amendment be \ntaken up after the disposition of the Sessions amendment on tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \nSessions amendment be set aside so I can offer an amendment for \nconsideration at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3493\n\n              (Purpose: To make available funds for India)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3493.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR INDIA.\n\n       Funds appropriated by this Act (other than funds \n     appropriated under the heading ``Foreign Military Financing \n     Program'') may be made available for assistance for India \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law: Provided, That, \n     for the purpose of this section, the term ``assistance'' \n     includes any direct loan, credit, insurance, or guarantee of \n     the Export-Import Bank of the United States or its agents: \n     Provided further, That, during fiscal year 2001, section \n     102(b)(2)(E) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2799aa-1(b)(2)(E)) may not apply to India.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to spend some time discussing \nwhat this amendment is about. I think at the outset, the best way to \ncapture it is to compare it to what is taking place in the news today. \nThis is an amendment about lifting economic sanctions on India. The \nadministration has the authority--we provided it last year and the year \nbefore--for them to lift the economic sanctions this country has \nagainst India. Those sanctions were automatically put in place after \nIndia tested nuclear weapons. We have been providing them the authority \nand flexibility to be able to deal with India broadly. The \nadministration was provided that waiver authority last year and it has \nchosen not to use it. So currently this country, the United States of \nAmerica, has economic sanctions against India, another democracy in the \nworld.\n  In today's newspaper, the administration is stating they will lift \neconomic sanctions against North Korea. This is the country that has \nthe most\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\nweapons proliferation taking place anywhere in the world, proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. It is a country on the terrorist list. \nIt is on the big 7 terrorist list of state sponsors of terrorism. This \nis the country that has a number of different violations, a country \nwhere we have been at war.\n  There have been some different things taking place in North Korea. I \nam not saying I am opposed to the administration doing this. I am just \nsaying it is quite odd, and very striking, that at the time the \nadministration is proposing to lift economic sanctions, they continue \nto insist on economic sanctions against India, the second most populous \nnation in the world, soon to be the most populous nation in the world; \na nation we trade with, a nation that is a democracy, a nation that has \na free press, a nation that I think, in the future, stands to be a very \nstrong strategic critical ally of the United States. That is India. \nThey will be a partner of ours, working to hold stability in south \nAsia. Not that they don't have problems, not that we don't have issues \nassociated with that, but this is a democracy with a free press, with \ncapital markets, that has a number of similar aspirations to those of \nthe United States. At the same time we are lifting economic sanctions \nagainst North Korea, this administration is going to leave them on \nIndia.\n  My amendment is simple. It would suspend economic sanctions against \nIndia--suspend them. While we provided the administration with the \nwaiver authority so they could do it, they have chosen not to. By this \namendment, we, the Congress, would be lifting these economic sanctions \nagainst India.\n  I want to say as well what this amendment does not do. My amendment \ndoes not suspend any military or dual-use technology assistance to \nIndia. The President has national security waiver authority for \nmilitary-related sanctions, but we are not dealing with military-\nrelated sanctions. He has authority to waive the prohibition on sales \nof defense articles, but we are not doing that here. We are not dealing \nwith defense services, foreign military financing, or dual-use \ntechnologies.\n  If the administration really wants to get to the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty with India and say we want to force you to sign the CTBT, \nwouldn't it be better to use the military set of sanctions rather than \neconomic sanctions that the administration is currently using? Plus, if \nyou think about this for a moment, is it likely we are going to force \nIndia, by economic sanctions, to sign CTBT? They are a democracy. How \nwill their people react if their leaders are seen as capitulating to \nU.S. economic pressure to sign something their leaders are saying they \nneeded to do? Is that a way we are actually going to be able to force \nIndia to do this? I think not.\n\n  Plus, this is a much bigger country with much broader issues than \nsimply the U.S. issue of CTBT. We have a broad array of issues with \nIndia. We need to grow this relationship rapidly. To hold the entire \nrelationship hostage to one issue is bad foreign policy on our part. It \nis hurting us. I think it will hurt India and hurt our ability to shape \nthings in that part of the world.\n  I was hopeful that during the President's recent trip to India, he \nwould use that chance to remove the economic sanctions on India. He was \nthere for a number of days and had the opportunity to do that. It would \nhelp set up the atmosphere for a more aggressive, broad-based \nrelationship with India. This was a way to leapfrog this relationship \nforward. This trip did improve relations with India, but he could have \ndone so much more that he failed to do. A number of us were terribly \ndisappointed that he did not make more use of the broad waiver \nauthority he now has. He used it very sparingly. This was waiver \nauthority that I fought last year to give him.\n  There should be no more economic sanctions on India, period. The \nUnited States should not do that. Yet the Clinton-Gore administration \ncontinues to hold up international financial institution loans which \nare destined for infrastructure projects which would help sustain the \neconomic activities in rural areas where the bulk of India's poor \npopulation lives. More than a third of India's population lives in \npoverty today. U.S. opposition to development loans to India impedes \nthe growth of vital infrastructure, employment, and living standards in \nthe poorest parts of India. That is not the way to improve U.S.-India \nrelations. These loans are being held up by the administration until \nIndia signs the CTBT.\n  The President of the United States has more appropriate carrots, as I \nmentioned at the outset, particularly in the noneconomic area, and \nparticularly those associated with military functions, which could be \nused rather than these sanctions which hit the poorest people in India. \nNuclear proliferation is a vitally important issue, but it should not \nbe the only issue on which we deal with a country such as India, the \nlargest democracy in the world.\n  This is all the more outrageous in view of the news I mentioned about \nlifting the economic sanctions on North Korea, a country which is run \nby one of the world's most notorious dictators, a country on the state \nsponsorship of terrorism list, as I mentioned, a country developing \nnuclear weapons and which is a direct threat to the United States and \nour east Asian allies.\n  Think about this for a moment. We are considering right now putting \nup a missile defense system, putting it in Alaska, and part of the \nreason is because of what we are fearing from North Korea. Yet we are \ngoing to lift economic sanctions there, but we are not going to do it \nagainst India? The contrast here is outrageous.\n  There are even recent newspapers reports out that I want to submit \nfor the Record about the development of nuclear material. This was in a \nnewspaper in Japan, about North Korea's secret underground facility \nproducing uranium for use in its weapons programs. These are weapons \nprograms. They are the largest proliferator around the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this document printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Tokyo Sankei Shimbun, June 9, 2000]\n\n   Sankei Shimbun: DPRK Secret Underground Facility Producing Uranium\n\n                         (By Katsuhior Kuroda)\n\n       Seoul, 8 June.--North Korea has reportedly utilized natural \n     uranium produced in the country as raw material for its \n     nuclear weapons development program. Meanwhile, Sankei \n     Shimbun has obtained a detailed report on North Korea's \n     secret underground plant for refining natural uranium and its \n     material production procedures. The secret underground plant \n     is widely called ``Mt. Chonma Power Plant,'' located at Mt. \n     Chonma in North Phyongan Province. North Korea has operated \n     the plant in secret since the end of 1989 for uranium \n     production for the nuclear weapons program, the report said.\n\n\n   ex-military official who fled to china unveils existence of plant\n\n       The report was drawn up based on statements made by North \n     Korean military official Yi Chun-song [name as \n     transliterated], 66, during interrogation by Chinese \n     authorities. Yi is former vice director of the operation \n     bureau of North Korean Ministry of People's Armed Forces who \n     served as commander in chief at a missile station. He fled \n     from North Korea to China last year and was held in Chinese \n     authorities' custody.\n       The report said that the ``Mt. Chonma facility'' has a \n     uranium refining capacity of 1.3 grams a day. By simple \n     calculation, the production during the past 10 years of \n     operation would amount to approximately 5 kg. Concerning \n     North Korea's uranium production plants, there are some \n     unconfirmed information including plants in Pakchon and \n     Pyonsan, but this is the first time that an accurate location \n     and details of the inside of the facility were unveiled.\n       According to the report, the ``Mt. Chonma facility'' is \n     built in a large tunnel under the 1,116-meter mountain. \n     Soldiers of the 2d Division of the Engineering Bureau of the \n     Ministry of People's Armed Forces started constructing the \n     facility in 1984 and completed the work in 1986. The uranium-\n     producing operations started in 1989.\n       Approximately 400 people, including 35 engineers and 100 \n     managers, are working at the plant. The rest are physical \n     laborers who were all political prisoners sentenced to life \n     in prison. The uranium minerals are brought into the facility \n     from mines in Songchon, South Phyongan Province, and Sohung, \n     North Hwanghae Province, by the transportation unit of the \n     Ministry of People's Armed Forces.\n       The report said that the arched entrance of the tunnel is 7 \n     meters wide and 6 meters high. A pathway of about 2.5 km is \n     connected to the entrance, and there is a corner at the end \n     of the pathway. Making a 90-degree right turn and going along \n     the path about 1 km, you will find a 6-km-long main tunnel \n     with a width of 15 meters and height of 6 meters. The inside \n     surface of the tunnels is covered by aluminum plates, and \n     there are 3-meter-wide drains and ventilation openings there.\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\n       The underground plant is comprised of 10 areas--two \n     concentration grounds measuring 3,000 square meters each, a \n     drying room of 400 square meters, four 400 square-meter-wide \n     dissolution rooms for uranium extraction and refining, a room \n     for packing uranium into containers, storage for the finished \n     products, and a room where the workers change into anti-\n     radiation suit or take breaks.\n       The report said there is a waste disposal facility in the \n     plant in addition to the areas mentioned above. The packed \n     uranium products are carried out of the facility through a \n     passage at the end of the tunnel and transported to an \n     underground storage area in Anju by helicopter. The report \n     added that although forests in the Kumchangri area, 30 km \n     southeast of Chonma, were polluted by water discharged from \n     the Chonma facility, the United States could not detect the \n     Chonma plant despite the technical team's inspections in \n     Kumchangri.\n       According to Yi's career record attached to the report, Yi \n     graduated from P'yongyang University of Technology, and \n     studied at Frunze (now Bishkek) military university of the \n     former USSR from 1958 to 1962. A South Korean source said \n     that Yi attempted to defect to a third country after fleeing \n     to China, but it is highly likely that he was sent back to \n     North Korea by Chinese authorities.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The U.S. has real, legitimate political and economic \nsecurity interests with India. We need to engage India on all levels as \nsoon as possible. In fact, seizing the opportunity we have to build \ngreater ties should be one of our main foreign policy goals. That is \none that is not taking place. We are, after all, the two most populous \ndemocratic nations in the world. Our relationship should be based on \nshared values and institutions, economic collaboration including \nenhanced trade and investment, and the goal of regional stability \nacross Asia.\n  I ask the President and other Members to take into consideration how \nwe treat India versus China as well. In China, we are on a very \naggressive relationship economically. We will be considering later in \nthis body normalizing permanent trade relations with China. We are \nsaying we need to be engaged with them on a number of different issues. \nWith India we then say no, we are going to put economic sanctions \nagainst you, whereas with China we are trying to open up. And China is \nthe one that has missiles pointed this way, that threatens Taiwan, that \nhas weapons proliferation. Religious persecution itself takes place on \nthat continent. I myself have visited with Buddhists who have fled out \nof Tibet into Katmandu, a number of them walking over the Himalayas in \nthe wintertime to get to freedom. Yet look at how we treat China. We \nare going to do everything favorable for China, but for India we are \ngoing to put on economic sanctions. The contrast is stark.\n\n  Again, as a major foreign policy objective, we should be looking to \nIndia over the next several years to build up this strategic \nrelationship in some respects as an offset to China and what China is \ndoing in South Asia and what China is aspiring to around the world.\n  I do not think anybody is sanguine about where China is heading \ntoday. We are going to need partners, and India is a key one for us to \nlook at. It is tough for us to convince them of that if we are going to \nleave economic sanctions on them. One of the ways to reduce our \ndependency on China economically is to lift economic sanctions on India \nand try to build up that relationship even more.\n  These are the key reasons that I put forward this amendment. The \ndifferences are so stark as to how we treat China and North Korea \nversus India. Ask yourself why. I fail to see the reasons for this \npolicy of seeking to reward China, a country that has openly and \ncontinually challenged United States interests and values, while at the \nsame time ignoring and punishing India.\n  As the example of North Korea which I mentioned earlier, the inequity \nof this situation is striking. Why reward a country that is \naggressively working against everything for which we stand and, at the \nsame time, punish and blackmail a country with which we share basic \nvalues and interests?\n  We should be engaging India as the strategic partner it can become. \nTo do so, we should not be maintaining economic sanctions which serve \nonly to impede the development of this relationship. Maintaining \neconomic sanctions on India which affect the poorest parts of the \ncountry is not the way to go about this.\n  The Prime Minister of India, I understand, will be in Washington this \nfall. I believe it is incumbent upon us to lift these sanctions, and if \nthe administration will not do it, which they have shown to date they \nwill not, then we should.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3493 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I understand there is a rule XVI \nproblem with the amendment I have put forward. While I would dearly \nwant to have a vote on the amendment on this bill, I understand it will \nbe a problem.\n  Therefore, reluctantly and regrettably, because I do think this body \nshould take up this issue, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \nremarks, to which I listened carefully.

Mr. President, when I was in high school, there was a \ngreat deal of discussion in the Senate and across the country about our \ncountry's role in preserving and promoting world peace. With the end of \nthe cold war, the focus of that debate has changed dramatically. The \narms race with the Soviet Union and the threat of communism spreading \nin Europe are, thankfully, a part of our history. The challenge of \npromoting peace, however, is as relevant today as it was at the height \nof the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n  From Northern Ireland to the Middle East; from Africa to Asia, too \nmany innocent lives are destroyed by war and violence. We must be \ncreative in developing and adapting strategies for peace. Thankfully, \nthere are young people from across the country who have given \nthoughtful consideration to how to create and sustain peace in the \nworld. The National Peace Essay Contest recognizes high school students \nwho have articulated a commitment to peace, and I am pleased to have \nthe opportunity to recognize one of those young people.\n  Tomorrow, I will meet with David Redlinger of Watertown, South Dakota \nwho is this year's South Dakota winner of the National Peace Essay \nContest. David's essay on Tajikistan and Sudan is eloquent, and \ndemonstrates his commitment to the fight for peace in the world. I \nwould like to congratulate David, and I ask that his essay be inserted \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                Commitment to Peace for the 21st Century\n\n                        (By David J. Redlinger)\n\n       In 1991, statues crumbled along with the tyrannical \n     governments that erected these symbols of the Cold War. As \n     chaos manifested the potential for instability became a\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\n     reality. The United States then felt obligated to help to \n     mold new democracies and promote regional security for these \n     new nations. As globalization and the interdependency of \n     nation takes priority, cooperation must be used as the \n     guiding principle for the foreign policy of nations, in the \n     benefit of both security and democracy. Unfortunately, self-\n     interest is the dominating determinate in the formulation of \n     foreign policy which leads to hypocritical and paradoxical \n     policies toward other nations. In 1991, the United States was \n     faced with injustices in Tajikistan and Sudan stemming from \n     the polarization of the work and the lack of cooperation \n     amongst nations. The changing nature of conflicts toward \n     regionalism, coupled with the United States' domestic \n     pressures to create foreign policy for the sole benefit of \n     America, led to perpetuated inaction that has threatened both \n     regional security and the promotion of democracy, supposedly \n     the cornerstone to United States' foreign policy. More than \n     just symbols of communism's bygone era crumbled in 1991; the \n     foundation of foreign policy for the leader of the free world \n     was also denigrated.\n       Regional instability pervades attempts to form legitimate \n     governments. Tajikistan is juxtaposed with the extremely \n     unstable areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, and the other \n     former Soviet Republics. Daniel Pipes wrote, ``Peace and \n     stability in the region depend in large part on Afghanistan, \n     and its future will be determined by developments in \n     Tajikistan.'' The fragile balance of power that has existed \n     in the region could easily be upset. With new nuclear powers, \n     such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China, it is necessary \n     that the United States form policies that would help mitigate \n     proliferation and support regional security.\n       Barnett R. Rubin, Director of the Center for the Study \n     Central Asia at Columbia University, in testimony stated \n     that, ``. . . structural conditions virtually guaranteed that \n     inevitable disputes over the future of the country would \n     escalate into chaotic and bloody warfare, and that \n     neighboring states would act, sometimes brutally, to protect \n     their own security.'' The inability to solve these quandaries \n     between the national themselves can lead to the \n     destabilization of the region. The United States never took \n     an appropriate stance for the promotion of regional security. \n     Mr. Rubin calls for the integration of Tajikistan into a \n     coalition of Central Asian countries to render stabilization \n     of the region. The United States' policy must direct \n     attention towards this region if peace and stability are to \n     be established. Intervention, not inaction,will best reduce \n     the animosity amongst the countries.\n       Democratic ideas are also critical to peace. Unfortunately, \n     United States' policy did not help the struggling new \n     democracy of Tajikistan. Davlat Khudonazarov, a Presidential \n     candidate in Tajikistan of 1991 recalls in testimony to \n     congress, ``At political meetings I would talk about America \n     and about American values, about the values of American \n     democracy. It was my hope that these ideas would become a \n     symbol of truth for my people, truth and justice for my \n     people. Unfortunately, we received no help from the \n     outside.'' The leader of the free world did not fulfill its \n     duty in promoting democracy to a country that was asking for \n     it. United States' policy remained selfish and domestically \n     oriented in 1994 and never answered Tajikistan's cries for \n     help.\n       This inaction led to Tajikistan's thrust into political \n     turmoil, an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 internally displaced \n     people, and left more than 1 million innocent civilians dead. \n     The United States never seized the opportunity for the \n     advancement of democratic ideals in Tajikistan. Furthermore, \n     regional security was compromised because of the absence of \n     meaningful U.S. policies.\n       Said Akhmedow, Senior Lecturer of Philosophy at Tajik State \n     University and Chairman of the Committee for Religion of the \n     Council of Ministers of Tajikistan, relates the conflict most \n     significantly to both religious and political struggles after \n     the fall of communism. Mr. Akhmedov credits the political \n     differences of the Party of Islamic Renaissance of Tajikistan \n     (PIRT) and the Democratic Party of Tajikistan (DPT) to the \n     social differences between these two groups. Democratic \n     modernists were pitted against the Islamic traditionalists in \n     the fight for control of the country, while inversely the \n     democratic forces did not. The United States neglected to \n     form policies to promote the democratic ideals. Thus, \n     Tajikistan was left to fight for itself without the tools a \n     free society could utilize. America, because of domestic \n     pressures, was unable to promote the democratic ideals Davlat \n     Kludonazarov and other Tajiks has asked for. Therefore, \n     Tajikistan lost its autonomy to the repression of democracy \n     and the destabilization of the region.\n       Sudan has also been plagued by struggle. The conflict has \n     resulted in a total of 6 million people displaced, over 1 \n     million injured, and the worst famine in the world this \n     century. The war continues because, as according to Francis \n     Deng, a former ambassador from Sudan, it is a ``zero-su?n \n     conflict.'' Lengthy wars cannot reach resolution without \n     significant intervention. The United States has not \n     implemented effective policies that have resulted in the \n     necessary change for the Sudanese people. The universal goals \n     of regional security and the promotion of democracy have been \n     discarded for a conflict which, ``. . . Even by the tortured \n     yardstick of Africa, a continent riven by armed conflict, \n     the scarcely visible war ravaging southern Sudan has \n     surpassed most measures . . . The conflict rates as the \n     continent's most deadly . . .'' The Sudanese People's \n     Liberation Army (SPLA) of the southern part of the country \n     who are generally moderate Muslims have been in conflict \n     with the Northern Islamic Front (NIF), Islamic \n     fundamentalists and seek to have the SPLA assimilate \n     culturally.\n       In the region, Kenya, Egypt, and Uganda have all felt the \n     effects of the conflict. Kenya has felt the economic impact \n     of refugees, while Egypt has felt a security threat from the \n     Islamic fundamentalists. Uganda on the other hand was \n     politically drawn into the conflict because of President \n     Museveni's support of the SPLA. The security of the region \n     can easily become weakened when all these factors collide. \n     The extension of the civil war outside the borders of Sudan \n     means that a full scale war could easily ignite in the hot \n     desert sand. The United States never intervened with \n     peacekeepers or policies that would marginalize the African \n     conflict. Instead, domestic issues and pressures took \n     precedence, while NGO's were expected to provide humanitarian \n     aid. Conflicts as lengthy as Sudan's war require third party \n     intervention into the root of the conflict, and not simply \n     surface level corrections with humanitarian aid. Clearly, \n     Uganda cannot make effective and fair foreign policy to \n     support Sudan, but the United States, because of its \n     nonpartial status, can provide for the protection of the \n     Sudanese, help to establish fair peace accords, and can \n     objectively examine the situation and formulate policies to \n     best support the goal of regional security.\n       Most recently the United States formed the wrong agenda \n     which jeopardized its relations with Sudan. As Donald \n     Patterson, the last United States Ambassador to Sudan, wrote, \n     ``The Clinton administration's continuing criticism of Sudan, \n     its call for a cease-fire, and the lead it had taken in the \n     United Nations to bring about the adoption of resolutions \n     condemning Sudan put additional strains on U.S.-Sudanese \n     relations.'' The damage to relations could have easily been \n     avoided if cooperation would have been used. Instead, the \n     policies were formed in the sole interests of the United \n     States.\n       This is not the most advantageous way to support democratic \n     reforms of emerging nations. Sudan has many Islamic \n     fundamentalists who resist the modernization and \n     liberalization of their country. This is the root cause of \n     the hostility. The country in the mid-1980's was going \n     through a ``transitional'' period where a new constitution \n     was established along with a new government. Political \n     fragmentation between the NIF, SPLA, and others led to a lack \n     of cohesiveness that is necessary for a new government. This \n     allowed for the strengthening of Islamic fundamentalist ideas \n     and the subsequent loss of budding democratic ideals. If the \n     United States had cultivated its relationship with the \n     Sudanese, then the prospects for a true democracy would have \n     had more time to flourish. Both regional security and \n     democratic ideals were compromised because of the United \n     States' lack of legitimate and meaningful foreign policy \n     directed towards Sudan.\n       In the future, conflicts will continue to be defined by \n     root causes of religious and social differences, but to \n     reduce the animosity amongst these nations, it is imperative \n     that the United States establish policy with the cooperation \n     as the guiding principle. With globalization, only through \n     cooperation can effective policies be created. The post-\n     Soviet world, specifically for Tajikistan and Sudan, has \n     meant difficulty for the formulation of United States' \n     foreign policy. The principle of cooperation was often placed \n     second behind the self-interests of the United States. Future \n     conflicts, similar to Tajikistan and Sudan, deserve the \n     United States' help and cooperation in the rendering of both \n     regional security and the promotion of democracy. Only \n     through these goals will the society of the 21st Century \n     attain true and lasting peace.\n\n\n                              bibliography\n\n       Akhmedov Said. ``Tajikistan II: The Regional Conflict in \n     Confessional and International Context.''

Mr. President, this weekend we will commemorate an \nimportant day in American history. June 25th, the 50th anniversary of \nthe start of the Korean War, will provide all Americans the opportunity \nto pause and remember the men and women who fought and died in the \nKorean War.\n  Some historians refer to the Korean War as the ``forgotten war.'' \nPerhaps the reason the Korean War has receded in our memories is \nbecause it was unlike either the war that preceded it or the war that \nfollowed it. Rationing brought World War II into every American home. \nAnd television brought the Vietnam War into every home with \nunforgettable images and daily updates.\n  But Korea was different. Except for those who actually fought there, \nKorea was a distant land and eventually, a distant memory. Today, as we \nremember those who served in Korea, it is fitting that we remember what \nhappened in Korea, and why we fought there.\n  The wall of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC, bears \nan inscription that reads, ``Freedom is not free.'' And in the case of \nSouth Korea, the price of repelling communist aggression and preserving \nfreedom was very high indeed. Nearly one-and-a-half million Americans \nfought to prevent the spread of communism into South Korea. It was the \nbloodiest armed conflict in which our nation has ever engaged. In three \nyears, 54,246 Americans died in Korea--nearly as many as were killed \nduring the 15 years of the Vietnam War.\n  The nobility of their sacrifice is now recorded for all of history in \nthe Korean War Veterans Memorial. As you walk through the memorial and \nlook into the faces of the 19 soldier-statues, you can feel the danger \nsurrounding them. But you can also feel the courage with which our \ntroops confronted that danger. It is a fitting tribute, indeed, to the \nsacrifices of those who fought and died in Korea.\n  But there is also another tribute half a world away. And that is \ndemocracy in the Republic of South Korea. Over the last five decades, \nthe special relationship between our two nations that was forged in war \nhas grown into a genuine partnership. Our two nations are more \nprosperous, and the world is safer, because of it.\n  The historic summit in North Korea earlier this month offers new hope \nfor a reduction in tensions and enhanced stability in the region. We \ncan dream of a day when Korea is unified under a democratic government \nand freedom is allowed to thrive.\n  As we continue to move forward, however, we pause today to remember \nhow the free world won an important battle in the struggle against \ncommunism in South Korea. Let us not forget that it is the \nresponsibility of all those who value freedom to remember that struggle \nand to honor those who fought it. The enormous sacrifices they made for \nour country should never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5451-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS \n                          COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, today on the East Front of the Capitol \nground is being broken for the new Capitol Visitor Center, a project \nthat will take at least five years and hundreds of millions of dollars \nto complete. Nearly a century ago, in March 1901, the Senate Committee \non the District of Columbia embarked on another project. The Committee \nwas directed by Senate Resolution 139 to ``report to the Senate plans \nfor the development and improvement of the entire park system of the \nDistrict of Columbia * * *. (F)or the purpose of preparing such plans \nthe committee * * * may secure the services of such experts as may be \nnecessary for a proper consideration of the subject.''\n  And secure ``such experts'' the committee did. The Committee formed \nwhat came to be known as the McMillan Commission, named for committee \nchairman, Senator James McMillan of Michigan. The Commission's \nmembership was a ``who's who'' of late 19th and early 20th-century \narchitecture, landscape design, and art: Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law \nOlmsted, Jr., Charles F. McKim, and Augustus St. Gaudens. The \ncommission traveled that summer to Rome, Venice, Vienna, Budapest, \nParis, and London, studying the landscapes, architecture, and public \nspaces of the grandest cities in the world. The McMillan Commission \nreturned and, building on the plan of French Engineer Pierre Charles \nL'Enfant, fashioned the city of Washington as we now know it.\n  We are particularly indebted today for the commission's preservation \nof the Mall. When the members left for Europe, the Congress had just \ngiven the Pennsylvania Railroad a 400-foot wide swath of the Mall for a \nnew station and trackage. It is hard to imagine our city without the \nuninterrupted stretch of greenery from the Capitol to the Washington \nMonument, but such would have been the result. Fortunately, when in \nLondon, Daniel Burnham was able to convince Pennsylvania Railroad \npresident Cassatt that a site on Massachusetts Avenue would provide a \nmuch grander entrance to the city. President Cassatt assented and \nDaniel Burnham gave us Union Station.\n  But the focus of the Commission's work was the District's park \nsystem. The Commission noted in its report:\n\n       Aside from the pleasure and the positive benefits to health \n     that the people derive from public parks, in a capital city \n     like Washington there is a distinct use of public spaces as \n     the indispensable means of giving\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\n     dignity to Government buildings and of making suitable \n     connections between the great departments . . . (V)istas and \n     axes; sites for monuments and museums; parks and pleasure \n     gardens; fountains and canals; in a word all that goes to \n     make a city a magnificent and consistent work of art were \n     regarded as essential in the plans made by L'Enfant under the \n     direction of the first President and his Secretary of State.\n       Washington and Jefferson might be disappointed at the \n     affliction now imposed on much of the Capitol Grounds by the \n     automobile.\n\n  At the foot of Pennsylvania Avenue is a scar of angle-parked cars, in \nparking spaces made available temporarily during construction of the \nThurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building. Once completed, spaces in \nthe building's garage would be made available to Senate employees and \nPennsylvania Avenue would be restored. Not so. Despite the ready and \nconvenient availability of the city's Metrorail system, an \nextraordinary number of Capitol Hill employees drive to work. The \ndemand for spaces has simply risen to meet the available supply, and \nthe unit block of the Nation's main street remains a disaster.\n  During the 103rd Congress and thereafter I proposed the ``Arc of \nPark,'' legislation that would almost completely eliminate surface \nparking. Under my proposal the Architect of the Capitol would be \ninstructed to eliminate the unsightly lots, and reconstruct them as \npublic parks, landscaped in the fashion of the Capitol Grounds. A key \nelement of my proposal was that--to the extent we continue to offer \nit--parking must be put underground. I rise today to emphasize the need \nfor us to remain focused--as we break ground for the Visitor's Center--\non a project currently being designed: an underground parking \nstructure.\n  One year ago the Architect of the Capitol received approval from \nChairman McConnell of the Rules Committee to proceed with preliminary \ndesign for an underground garage to be located on Square 724, which is \njust North of the Dirksen and Hart buildings. Upon completion it will \nreplace the existing lot of surpassing ugliness. By getting cars off \nthe streets and underground it will bring us nearer to the pedestrian \nwalkways and parks McMillan--and before him L'Enfant--envisioned.\n  The final garage will include three levels with capacity for 1210 \nparking spaces. The 1981 report on the Master Plan identified Square \n724 as the site for a future Senate office building. Thus the garage \nwill be designed and constructed to accommodate an eight story office \nbuilding on top of it, should the need for such building ever arise. \nThe current plan, however, would be to top the garage with a simply \nlandscaped plaza. Upon approving advancement with the design of the new \nstructure, Chairman McConnell stated that, ``Square 724 appears to \noffer the most cost-effective opportunity for phased growth of Senate \ngarage parking within the Capitol Complex.'' I understand that this \ntime next year, after I have left this Body, the Architect of the \nCapitol will ask Congress to appropriate the funds needed to actually \nbuild Phase I of the garage, which will accommodate 500 cars. And then \nfunding will be crucial--with the Russell garage in dire need of \nrenovation and the Capitol Visitor Center expected to displace some \nparking. I urge you to support the Architect in his request.\n  Today, as we break ground on a new project, one that will nearly \ndouble the size of the Capitol, let us not forget the grand vision of \nthe McMillan Commission from a century ago. Washington is the capital \nof the most powerful nation on earth, and deserves to look it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5452-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE F.I.R.E. ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to \nAmerica's local fire fighters who put their lives on the line every day \nprotecting the lives and property of their fellow citizens. When the \ncall comes in, they answer without question or hesitation. \nUnfortunately, local and volunteer fire departments are in dire need of \nfinancial support. The health and safety of fire fighters and the \npublic is jeopardized because many departments cannot afford to \npurchase protective gear and equipment, provide adequate training, and \nare short staffed. It is time for Congress to lend them a helping hand.\n  That is why I have cosponsored a bill in the Senate called the \nFirefighter Investment and Response Enhancement or FIRE Act. This bill, \nS. 1941, authorizes a program granting up to one billion dollars for \nlocal fire departments across our great country. The money would be \navailable to volunteer, combination, and paid departments. It would \nhelp pay for much needed equipment, training, EMS expenses, apparatus \nand arson prevention efforts and a variety of education programs.\n  Wildfires across America and Montana are a growing threat. The FIRE \nAct is especially critical for rural states such as Montana as we rely \nheavily upon our volunteer firefighters to protect those things we hold \ndear. Quite often these volunteer departments are the only line of \ndefense in these rural communities. It's time we provide them with the \nneeded funds for proper training and equipment to better protect their \ncommunities.\n  I offer my sincere gratitude to our Nation's fire fighters who put \ntheir lives on the line every day to protect the property and safety of \ntheir neighbors. They too deserve a helping hand in their time of need.\n  I commend Senators Dodd and DeWine for introducing this important \nlegislation, and urge all my colleagues who have not done so to sign \nonto this bill. I would like to encourage the Committee to hold \nhearings on S. 1941 and suggest that we continue to move this bill \nforward toward ultimate passage.\n  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5452-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GUN VICTIMS OF TUESDAY, JUNE 20, 1999\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout the recent arrest in Russia of Vladimir Gusinsky and its negative \nimpact on press freedom and democracy under the leadership of President \nPutin.\n  Mr. Gusinsky runs Media Most, a major conglomerate of Russian media \norganizations, including NTV, Russia's only television network not \nunder state control. Media Most is a relatively independent force in \nRussian news reporting, and its outlets have offered hard-hitting, \noften critical accounts of Russia's brutal campaign in\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\nChechnya, as well as reports on alleged Government corruption. Besides \nbeing an important media and business executive, Mr. Gusinsky is a also \na leading figure in the Russian Jewish community, serving as President \nof the Russian Jewish Congress.\n  On May 11, just days after President Putin's inauguration, Russian \nfederal agents in a major show of force raided several of Media Most's \ncorporate offices, raising immediate concerns about the direction of \npress freedom in the new government. These concerns intensified on \nTuesday June 13 when a Russian prosecutor called Mr. Gusinsky in for \nquestioning, and then arrested him on suspicion of embezzling millions \nof dollars worth of federal property. On June 16, Mr. Gusinsky was \nreleased from prison after the prosecutor formally charged him with \nembezzlement.\n  It is very difficult for anyone to address fully the specifics of \nsuch charges, and the Russian government's case against Mr. Gusinsky, \nwhen so little information has been made available by the Russian \ngovernment. However, the circumstances of the case raise serious \nconcerns about the initial direction of press freedom and democracy \nunder President Putin. As one of the opening acts of the new \nAdministration, the government chose to carry out a heavy-handed, much \npublicized raid on an organization led by high profile Government \ncritic. It chose to arrest the leader of an organization, Media Most, \nthat is one of the few outlets of independent news about controversial \nRussian government policies. The fact that this arrest took place while \nPresident Putin was traveling abroad, and that he publicly speculated \nthat the arrest might have been excessive, serves to make the situation \nand the Government's policy even more confusing and unsettling. \nMoreover, this case in not occurring in a vacuum. After President \nPutin's election, but before his inauguration, there were disturbing \nsigns of government hostility toward Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, \nevident in the harassment of RFE/RL correspondent Andrei Babitsky.\n  I am encouraged to see that prominent Russians have been speaking out \nabout the arrest of Mr. Gusinsky, and that our Government is signaling \nits concern too. I echo the New York Times editorial on June 15 that \nthis is ``A Chilling Prosecution in Moscow.'' I would ask unanimous \nconsent that this piece, as well as similar editorials from the June 15 \neditions of the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, be printed \nin full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, June 15, 2000]\n\n                    A Chilling Prosecution in Moscow\n\n       While President Vladimir Putin is traveling through Europe \n     this week extolling the virtues of Russian democracy, his \n     colleagues in the Kremlin have been acting like Stalinists. \n     The arrest and detention of Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of \n     media properties that have carried critical coverage of the \n     government, is an assault against the principle of a free \n     press. Whatever the merits of the alleged embezzlement case \n     against Mr. Gusinsky, there was no need to haul him off to \n     prison, an action that cannot help but stir fear in a nation \n     all too familiar with the arbitrary exercise of state power.\n       If the rule of law prevailed in Russia, and Mr. Gusinsky \n     could count on a presumption of innocence, quick release on \n     bail and a fair trial, his arrest might seem less ominous. \n     But Russia lacks a fully independent judicial system, and the \n     government still uses criminal prosecution as a political \n     weapon. He is charged with embezzling at least $10 million in \n     federal property, apparently involving his purchase of a \n     state-owned television station in St. Petersburg. He says the \n     accusations are false.\n       There is a stench of political retaliation about this case. \n     Mr. Gusinsky's company, Media-Most, owns numerous newspapers \n     and magazines as well as Russia's only independent television \n     network. Their coverage of the war in Chechnya has been \n     aggressive and skeptical, and they have not been hesitant to \n     investigate government corruption and other misconduct. Last \n     month heavily armed federal agents raided the Media-Most \n     office in Moscow, the first signal that the Kremlin might be \n     trying to intimidate Mr. Gusinsky.\n       Mr. Putin seemed surprised by the arrest, calling it ``a \n     dubious present'' when he arrived in Madrid on Tuesday. That \n     offers little comfort to anyone concerned about Russia's \n     fragile freedoms. If the arrest was meant to embarrass Mr. \n     Putin while he is visiting Western Europe, it is disturbing \n     evidence of palace intrigue and political instability in the \n     Kremlin. If Mr. Putin received advance notification about the \n     arrest and failed to order the use of less draconian tactics, \n     he has done a disservice to the press freedoms he says he \n     supports.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 15, 2000]\n\n                      Mr. Putin Shows His KGB Face\n\n       The most recent defining act of Russia's new president, \n     Vladimir Putin, is more Soviet than democratic. In an \n     apparent effort to intimidate the press, Mr. Putin has \n     engaged in police-state tactics so crude that even his \n     severest critics seem stunned. For those who wonder whether \n     Mr. Putin's Russia will move toward joining civilized Europe, \n     and whether it will nurture the legal protections that could \n     attract investment and encourage prosperity, the latest news \n     is ominous.\n       On Tuesday Mr. Putin's prosecutors summoned Russia's \n     leading media tycoon, ostensibly simply to answer some \n     questions about an ongoing case. When Vladimir Gusinsky \n     appeared, without lawyers, the government threw him into the \n     Moscow hellhole known as Butyrka Prison. He remains there, \n     though he has not yet been formally charged with any crime.\n       The case has significance beyond the rights of any one \n     person. Mr. Gusinsky heads a media company that owns the only \n     Russian television network not under Kremlin control. The \n     company also owns a radio station and publishes a daily \n     newspaper and a weekly magazine (the last in partnership with \n     Newsweek, which is owned by The Washington Post Co.). All of \n     these properties have challenged official orthodoxy by \n     reporting an official corruption and on Mr. Putin's savage \n     war in Chechnya. The arrest will be seen, and no doubt was \n     intended, as an attempt to silence President Putin's critics. \n     ``There is a pattern here, and we have seen it for some \n     time,'' U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told \n     The Post yesterday. ``It has a look and feel to it that does \n     not resonate rule of law. It resonates muscle; it resonates \n     power; it resonates intimidation.''\n       Some Russian officials have presented the arrest as a \n     normal, even commendable, sign of Mr. Putin's determination \n     to fight corruption and establish a ``rule of law.'' Mr. \n     Gusinsky is one of a band of Russian businessmen who became \n     wealthy after the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 in part \n     by exploiting close ties to those in power. Whether a \n     plausible case can be made against Mr. Gusinsky or any of the \n     other oligarchs is something we cannot judge. But that Mr. \n     Putin's government should choose as its first target the only \n     businessman who has dared challenge Mr. Putin (and by far not \n     the wealthiest of the oligarchs) shows that this affair is \n     not about the rule of law.\n       Mr. Putin's KGB background is widely known, but when he \n     ascended to power, many analysts expected him to wield power \n     with some subtlety. The audacity of the government's assault \n     is almost as stunning as the assault itself. The arrest is a \n     slap at President Clinton, who recently in Moscow urged Mr. \n     Putin to respect freedom of the press and who chose to speak \n     on Mr. Gusinsky's radio station. With how much spine will Mr. \n     Clinton and other Western leaders who have been even more \n     eager to embrace Mr. Putin, such as Britain's Tony Blair, now \n     respond? Many Russians will be watching.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 15, 2000]\n\n                           Putin v. Gusinsky\n\n       The arrest Tuesday of mogul Vladimir Gusinsky is either the \n     first salvo in a Kremlin war against rent-seeking oligarchs \n     or a return to the Soviet-era practice of taking political \n     prisoners. It was either carried out with the knowledge of \n     the Russian President, or (as he says) it was done behind his \n     back while he is on a foreign trip. However you serve it, it \n     doesn't look good.\n       Mr. Gusinsky may fit the stereotype of a Russian oligarch, \n     but his arrest is significant because his Media-Most group \n     includes Russia's only independent national television \n     channel, NTV. While state television in Russia often has all \n     the objectivity of a broadcast in Castro's Cuba. NTV is \n     regarded as relatively objective in its news coverage. In \n     commentary, however, NTV and other Media-Most holdings have \n     been fiercely critical of the Kremlin, President Putlin and \n     the war in Chechnya, which remains his main policy \n     achievement to date. For this reason, any campaign against \n     Media-Most, wittingly or not, sends a chill throughout \n     Russia's free press.\n       The allegations against Mr. Gusinsky are unclear. A \n     statement said he is accused of embezzling $10 million from \n     the state, though no details were given. Even taking the \n     explanation of embezzlement at face value, one is left with \n     the question of just what is the Kremlin's agenda. After all, \n     as the chief of the oligarchs and Gusinsky rival Boris \n     Berezovsky noted. ``There is no doubt that any person who did \n     business in Russia over the last 10 years broke the law, \n     directly or indirectly in part because of the contradictory \n     nature of Russia law.'' Mr. Berezovsky may be thinking, there \n     but for the grace of the Kremlin go I, but he has a point.\n       The lack of precise laws and enforcement and the ease with \n     which insider contacts could be parlayed into millions has \n     contributed to the moral turpitude and general disregard for \n     law and fair play in much of the Russian establishment. Now \n     even Boris Yeltsin's daughters are under investigation\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\n     by Swiss authorities for allegedly running up large credit \n     card bills at the expense of a Swiss company that was awarded \n     lucrative Kremlin building contracts.\n       In Moscow yesterday, 17 prominent businessmen, including \n     Mr. Berezovsky, wrote an open letter to the prosecutor \n     general, saying Mr. Gusinsky's arrest threatens to destroy \n     confidence in Russian as a place to do business. ``Until \n     yesterday we believed we live in a democratic country.'' they \n     wrote. ``Today we have serious doubts about that.''\n       If Mr. Putin really want to tackle corruption, he may have \n     to put the worst offenders in jail. But more important, he \n     will have to overhaul the Russian legal system and its \n     enforcement mechanisms and reduce the bureaucracy and \n     regulation that give rise to so much graft and make \n     government more transparent. Since most successful or \n     powerful people in Russia have something to hide. It is not \n     hard for the Kremlin to wield the ``law'' as a political \n     weapon to badger its enemies. But that's not cracking down on \n     corruption; that's just cracking down.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Financial Times, June 15, 2000]\n\n                            Putin's Pressure\n\n       A move by Vladimir Putin, Russia's new president, to clip \n     the wings of his country's formidable business barons was \n     widely anticipated. If he is going to reassert the power of \n     the state over the financial oligarchs who usurped much of \n     its authority during the Kremlin rule of Boris Yeltsin, that \n     is necessary. But the decision to arrest Vladimir Gusinsky, \n     the media tycoon, raises a number of questions.\n       He is neither one of the most powerful nor one of the most \n     notorious of that group. His real claim to fame is that his \n     Media-Most group owns the television station NTV and Sevodnya \n     newspaper among others--outspoken critics of Mr. Putin's \n     government. In particular, they have questioned the conduct \n     of the war in Chechnya. They have undoubtedly reflected the \n     inclinations of their owner but they have also been healthily \n     outspoken. In so doing, they have been helping ensure that \n     the press acts as a critic of government--an essential \n     element in Russia's slow progress towards democracy.\n       Mr. Gusinsky now appears to be paying the price. Although \n     his arrest is ostensibly on suspicion of fraud and the \n     illegal acquisition of state property worth $10m, the action \n     follows a particularly heavy-handed raid by security police, \n     armed to the teeth and wearing balaclava helmets, on his \n     headquarters--all suggesting a deliberate campaign of \n     intimidation. Other actions by Mr. Putin's administration \n     indicate a similarly harsh attitude to any sign of media \n     opposition. The TV station controlled by Yuri Luzhkov, \n     Moscow's mayor, is having to fight in the courts to renew its \n     license. The registration system for new publications has \n     been greatly tightened.\n       The president does not appear to be a believer in glasnost, \n     the openness introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev into the Russian \n     media. More than any other reform, that probably guaranteed \n     the end of Communist rule and the Soviet Union. By allowing \n     exposure of the iniquities, incompetence and corruption of \n     the previous regime, glasnost ensured there was no going \n     back. By definition, however, glasnost was inimical to the \n     old KGB security service--Mr. Putin's secretive former \n     employer.\n       President Bill Clinton has already expressed his concern \n     about signs of restrictions on press freedom in Russia. When \n     Gerhard Schroeder, the German chancellor, meets Mr. Putin \n     today, he should do the same, in strong terms. The Russian \n     president has said he knew nothing of Mr. Gusinsky's arrest. \n     He should have done, particularly in view of the widespread \n     protests that followed. An unfettered press is an essential \n     part of a market economy. He has a lot to learn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5454-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           WEST VIRGINIA DAY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today we celebrate West \nVirginia's 137th year as a state. West Virginia joined the Union in the \nmidst of the Civil War when President Lincoln admitted it to the Union \nas the 35th state on June 20, 1863.\n  The spirit of pride and determination that gave the first West \nVirginians the courage to start anew can still be seen in the ever-\ninnovative and evolving ways that West Virginians have adapted to \nchanging economics and culture. This is apparent in the transitions of \nthe coal and steel industries as well as in the increasing cultivation \nof the tourism industry. However, through the continual change, West \nVirginians have held a heritage that remains rich in song, craft, and \ntradition. It is as visible at the State Fair of West Virginia in \nLewisburg, the Appalachian Heritage Festival in Shepherdstown, and the \nTamarack Arts Center in Beckley as it is at Bob's Grocery in Lindside. \nThe state has an abundance of coal, steel, forests, rivers, and \nmountains, but her greatest resource has always been her people.\n  This natural charm of West Virginians is reflected in the scenic \ntreasures that crown the state. Though born during a time of turmoil, \npresent-day West Virginia is an emblem of peace and tranquility. Ernest \nW. James captured it perfectly:\n\n     There autumn hillsides are bright with scarlet trees;\n     And in the spring, the robins sing,\n     While apple blossoms whisper in the breeze\n     And where the sun draws rainbows in the mist\n     of waterfalls and mountain rills,\n     My heart will be always in the West Virginia hills.\n\n  So on this, West Virginia's 137th birthday, I am enormously proud to \ninvite my colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating this \nWest Virginia Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5454-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nALASKA RECIPIENTS OF PRESIDENTIAL AWARDS FOR EXCELLENCE IN MATHEMATICS \n                          AND SCIENCE TEACHING\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor \ntoday to congratulate three exceptional teachers in Alaska--Douglas \nHeetderks of Anchorage, Lura Hegg of Palmer, and Gretchen Murphy of \nFairbanks. President Clinton named these Alaskans as recipients of the \n1999 Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science \nTeaching. This is our Nation's highest honor for mathematics and \nscience teachers in grades K through 12.\n  Each year, a national panel of distinguished scientists, \nmathematicians and educators recommends one elementary and one \nsecondary math teacher and one elementary and one secondary science \nteacher from each state or territory to receive a presidential award. \nThe 1999 recipients were selected from among 650 finalists.\n  The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science \nTeaching Program is administered by the National Science Foundation \n(NSF) on behalf of the White House. The program was established in 1983 \nand is designed to recognize and reward outstanding teachers. In \naddition to a presidential citation and a trip to Washington, DC, each \nrecipient's school receives a NSF grant of $7,500 to be used under the \ndirection of the teacher, to supplement other resources for improving \nscience or mathematics programs in their school system.\n  Douglas Heetderks, Lura Hegg and Gretchen Murphy are exceptional and \nhighly dedicated teachers. Douglas Heetderks teaches Elementary Science \nat Susitna Elementary in Anchorage; Lura Hegg teaches Secondary Science \nat Colony Middle School in Palmer; and Gretchen Murphy teaches \nElementary Math at University Park Elementary School in Fairbanks. In \naddition to having extensive knowledge of math and science, they have \ndemonstrated an understanding of how students learn and have the \nability to engage students, foster curiosity and generate excitement. \nMr. Heetderks, Ms. Hegg, and Ms. Murphy have displayed an experimental \nand innovative attitude in their approach to teaching and are highly \nrespected for their leadership.\n  Mr. President, our nation's future depends on today's teachers. \nCurrently, 40 percent of America's 4th graders read below the basic \nlevel on national reading tests. On international tests, the nation's \n12th graders rank last in Advanced Physics compared with students in 18 \nother countries. And one-third of all incoming college freshmen must \nenroll in a remedial reading, writing, or mathematics class before \ntaking regular courses.\n  If we are to turn these dismal statistics around we are going to need \nmore and talented teachers like Mr. Heetderks, Ms. Hegg and Ms. Murphy. \nI applaud them for their hard work and dedication to our children. They \nare educating those who will lead this country in creating, developing, \nand putting to work new ideas and technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5454-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5454-S5455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LIEUTENANT GENERAL RONALD B. BLANCK\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor Lieutenant General Ronald B. Blanck as he retires from the United \nStates Army after more than thirty-two years of active duty service. \nFor the last four years, General Blanck has served as\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\nthe United States Army Surgeon General and Commander, U.S. Army Medical \nCommand General. During his tenure, he had significant oversight of \neight Department of Defense activities as well as the management of the \nArmy's $6.6 billion, worldwide integrated health system.\n  Beginning his career as a general medical officer in Vietnam, General \nBlanck went on to hold a variety of executive positions that include: \nprofessor and teaching chief in graduate medical education at the \nUniformed Services University; medical consultant to the Army Surgeon \nGeneral; Commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the North \nAtlantic Regional Medical Command; and finally as the U.S. Army's 39th \nSurgeon General. General Blanck has met every challenge with enthusiasm \nand zeal. His team-building, compassion, and vision have resulted in \ngreater cooperation among the Federal Health Services and improved \ndelivery of medical care to our nation's military, past and present.\n  General Blanck guided the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) \nthrough a period of re-engineering and instituted collaborative \nmissions with the Department of State, Department of Treasury, Federal \nBureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency, National Aeronautic \nand Space Administration, National Transportation and Safety Board, and \nthe Veterans Administration. These partnerships have fostered \nunparalleled advances in science and facilitated the reputation of AFIP \nas being known as the ``People's Institute.''\n  He re-energized the Army Medical Department and instituted best \nbusiness practices to ensure the provision of comprehensive, quality \nhealthcare to service members, retired and active, and their family \nmembers. Faced with a military medical end-strength reduction of 34%, a \nreduction in Army medical treatment facilities of 45%, and medical \nforce structure requirements reduction of 77%, General Blanck met the \nchallenge. His brilliant leadership, compassionate vision and \nunprecedented achievements will guide the Army Medical Department and \nthe entire federal health care system into the new millenium.\n  General Blanck's contributions to Persian Gulf Illness and Anthrax \nprograms, his interactions with Congress and the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), and his commitment to \nthe delivery of world-class medical care in support of contingency \noperations, national emergencies, and potential weapons of mass \ndestruction scenarios are unsurpassed. Mr. President, while General \nBlanck's many meritorious awards and decorations demonstrate his \ncontributions in a tangible way, it is the legacy he leaves behind for \nthe Army Medical Corps, the United States Army, and the Department of \nDefense for which we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I \ncongratulate General Blanck on his outstanding career of exemplary \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5455-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PACENTRO, ITALY, REUNION 2000\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on July 2, 2000, a very special \nevent will take place in Sterling Heights, Michigan: the first reunion \nof United States citizens who trace their roots back to the town of \nPacentro, Italy. Over 800 people will attend the event, some of them \nwith ancestors who immigrated to the United States over 150 years ago. \nIn addition, the Mayor of Pacentro himself, Mr. Fernando Caparso, will \nbe attending the event. I rise today to welcome Mr. Caparso to the \nState of Michigan.\n  Pacentro is a small town located east of Rome. It sits in the Abruzzo \nregion in the province of L'Aquila. Born in medieval times, the town is \nfamous for its three castle towers, the oldest of which was built by \nCount Boarmondo and dates back to the thirteenth century. Another dates \nfrom the fifteenth century, and is recognized as the loveliest castle \nin the region. More recently, Pacentro has gained fame as the \nbirthplace of the rock star Madonna's grandparents.\n  Mr. Caparso was born there on February 12, 1951, to Antonio and \nRosina Fabiilli. He was one of five children; three sisters remain in \nPacentro and the oldest sister resides in Washington, Michigan.\n  After completing high school in Pacentro, Mr. Caparso graduated from \nLiceo Classico Ocidio in Sulmona, Italy. He followed his studies there \nat La Sapienza University in Rome, where he received a doctorate \ndegree. Finally, he attended Gabriele d'Annunzio University in Chieti, \nwhere he specialized in sports medicine. Mr. Caparso is presently \ncaring for three towns in the Abruzzo region: Secinaro, Gagliano Aterno \nand Castel Di Ieri.\n  The sport of soccer has also played a very large role in Mr. \nCaparso's life. While completing his studies, he always played for an \namateur team in the Peligna Valley Region. And, when his playing days \nwere behind him, he became a referee. Mr. Caparso has refereed women's \nmajor league games throughout Italy, and is currently the President of \nthe Sulmona Referee Administration.\n  Mr. Caparso was elected Mayor of Pacentro in 1999. Having decided \nthat the city needed a better administration, an administration which \ntended to the needs of all its citizens, he further decided to do \nsomething about it. Mr. Caparso was elected Mayor along with a list of \nconservative councilmen.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that the Pacentro, Italy, Reunion 2000 will \nbe a wonderful success. I know that a great number of individuals have \nput their hearts and souls into this reunion, and I applaud their many \nefforts. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I welcome Mr. \nFernando Caparso, Mayor of Pacentro, Italy, to the State of \nMichigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5455-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CAPTAIN JOSEPH P.

From September 1995 to August \n1996, Avveduti commanded the U.S.S. Kalamazoo. This ship is named after \nKalamazoo, Michigan and the history of its service is of particular \ninterest to Michigan residents.\n  Captain Avveduti graduated from the United States Naval Academy in \n1974. Following his graduation he was designated a Naval Aviator and \nwent on to command several Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadrons. Among \nhis many leadership positions, Captain Avveduti served as the Executive \nOfficer of U.S.S. Independence from January 1993 to June 1995. In 1997, \nCaptain Avveduti graduated from the National War College in Washington, \nD.C. He currently holds the Chief of Naval Operations Chair at that \ninstitution where he serves as a great role model for the many young \nmen and women in the Navy. During his career, Captain Avveduti received \nthe Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service Medals, \nthe Air Medal and various campaign and service medals.\n  Mr. President, Captain Joseph Avveduti's service to the U.S. Navy, \nand in particular his command of the U.S.S. Kalamazoo, is to be \ncommended. The United States will lose a respected and well \naccomplished naval officer upon Captain Avveduti's retirement.

Mr. President. It is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay tribute to Lieutenant Colonel David A. DeKeyser for \nhis dedicated military service to our country.\n  LTC DeKeyser retired on June 5, 2000 from the United States Army \nReserve after serving 28 distinguished years as an officer in the \nTransportation Corps. I have known him well for many years and since I \njoined the Senate in 1997, he has served as my Chief of Staff. I came \nto know LTC DeKeyser personally during the 1970's and 1980's when we \nwere both assigned to the 1184th Transportation Terminal Unit (TTU) in \nMobile, Alabama. For 8 years we trained at monthly drills and annual \ntraining. We have worked with one another since that time in a series \nof increasingly important and difficult assignments.\n  LTC DeKeyser was born March 21, 1950 in Mobile, Alabama. He was \ncommissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1972 from Auburn University. \nThroughout his career--with duty assignments in Europe, the United \nStates, the Middle East during Operation Desert\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\nStorm, and most recently with duty at the United States Transportation \nCommand--he consistently distinguished himself. During times of peace \nand war, in both command and staff positions, he has achieved \nexcellence. He was activated with the 1184th TTU for duty during the \nGulf War and spent 6 months away from his family in Kuwait. LTC \nDeKeyser was decorated with the Joint Service Commendation Medal, and \nthe Southwest Asia Service Medal. His other notable military awards \ninclude the Legion of Merit, the Defense Meritorious Medal, and two \nawards of the Meritorious Service Medal.\n  LTC DeKeyser's professionalism and leadership as a military officer \nearned him the respect and admiration of his soldiers, fellow officers, \nand members of the U.S. Congress. No officer was better liked or \nrespected--from the newest private to the commanding officer--than LTC \nDeKeyser. He is known for his integrity, compassion, humor, and ability \nto inspire men and women from all walks of life. These are the \nqualities of a soldier who deserves the thanks of a grateful nation for \na job well done. In addition, he made notable contributions in his \ncommunity as a member of various civic organizations to include the \nGulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, the Alabama Coastal \nResources Advisory Council, the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, the \nAlabama-Mississippi Sea Grant Consortium Advisory Committee, Goodwill \nIndustries Board of Directors, the American Heart Association Board of \nDirectors, the Mobile Jaycees, and the Reserve Officers Association.\n  Armand has served his country for 28 years in the Army but he has \nalso provided magnificent services to the Nation in a number of other \ncrucial government assignments.\n  I know about these because we are partners. In the 1980's, I asked \nhim to leave his business career to serve as a law enforcement \ncoordinator for the office of the United States Attorney. As was \ntypical of Armand's nature he eagerly looked to expand our work and we \ndecided to initiate a ``Weed and Seed'' program in an attempt to \nrevitalize the Martin Luther King area of Mobile.\n  This historic neighborhood had fallen victim to decay, crime and \ndrugs. Working with our other law enforcement coordinator, Eric Day, \nArmand gave himself to the project with his typical enthusiasm. Mr. \nPresident. I can say that the program was a great success. I once told \nArmand, when they put you in the grave, your work to make this \nneighborhood a much better place may be your greatest accomplishment.\n  Later in 1994, I was elected Attorney General of Alabama and I asked \nhim to leave his beloved Mobile to come to Montgomery to serve as my \nAdministrative Officer.\n  When we took office, we faced a huge financial problem as a result of \nterrible financial management. Armand responded with great \neffectiveness--closing several off-site offices, disposing of one-half \nof the office automobiles, reducing staff, and helping us reorganize. \nPersonnel was reduced by one-third and legal work improved\n  Then, when I was elected to the U.S. Senate, I asked him to serve as \nmy Chief of Staff. Once again, he agreed. He has done a magnificent job \nand there can be no doubt that his military service has played a key \nrole in helping our office achieve the high level of effectiveness that \nwe currently enjoy.\n  Armand is a soldier's soldier. He has given his best to the Army. It \nhas caused him to be away from home and family and called for personal \nsacrifice. But, for 28 years, he has answered the call and served with \ngreat distinction.\n  I salute Armand for his faithfulness to the nation, and wish him, his \nwonderful wife Beverly, and sons David and Phillip many wonderful years \nof happiness and good health in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5456-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5456-S5457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TIM RUSSERT'S ADDRESS TO HARVARD LAW SCHOOL\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Tim Russert, who served for many \nyears as a member of the Senate staff, and who now serves the Nation as \nmoderator of ``Meet The Press'' gave the Class Day Address this past \nWednesday at the Harvard Law School. It is wonderfully reflective and \njust as emphatically exhorting. I ask that it be printed in today's \nRecord.\n  The address follows:\n\n   Address by Tim Russert, Harvard Law School Class Day, June 7, 2000\n\n       Well today I finally got into Harvard. And I thank you. But \n     most respectfully my perspective is different today than when \n     I applied to law school 27 years ago.\n       You have chosen for your class day speaker the son of a man \n     who never finished high school . . . who worked two jobs--as \n     a truck driver and sanitation man--for 37 years and never \n     complained.\n       And so may I dare suggest to you I now believe that my dad \n     taught me more by the quiet eloquence of his hard work and \n     his basic decency than I learned from 16 years of formal \n     education.\n       With that caveat, let me begin.\n       Former White House Chief of Staff John Sununu. Legend has \n     it, in 1991 he encountered some difficult times. He \n     approached the First Lady Barbara Bush and said ``Barbara . . \n     . I need your advice . . . your wisdom . . . your counsel . . \n     . why is it that people here seem to take such an instant \n     dislike to me?'' She replied, ``because it saves time John.''\n       Justice Frankfurter said it this way. ``Wisdom too often \n     never comes and so one ought not to reject it merely because \n     it comes late.'' In that humble spirit. Congratulations!\n       But before you can begin to move on to the next phase of \n     your lives--you must undergo the last grueling hurdle in your \n     career here at Harvard Law school.\n       The Class Day Address.\n       Let me be honest with you about my experiences with class \n     day or commencement addresses. I've been through several of \n     my own and I've sat through dozens of others. And I can't \n     recall a single word or phrase from any of those informed, \n     inspirational and seemingly interminable addresses. Despite \n     that, others wiser and more learned than I, have decided \n     there continues to be virtue in this tradition so I will \n     speak to you, but I will try not to delay you too long.\n       In 1985, I was granted an extraordinary opportunity--a \n     private audience with the Holy Father.\n       I'll never forget it. The door opened--and there was the \n     Pope--dressed in white. He walked solemnly into the room, at \n     that time it seemed as large as this field. I was there to \n     convince His Holiness it was in his interest to appear on the \n     Today show. But my thoughts soon turned away from Bryant \n     Gumbel's career and NBC's ratings toward the idea of \n     salvation. As I stood there with the Vicar of Christ, I \n     simply blurted, ``Bless me Father!'' He put his arm around my \n     shoulder and whispered--you are the one called Timothy''--I \n     said yes, ``the man from NBC''--``yes, yes, that's me.'' \n     ``They tell me you are a very important man.'' Somewhat taken \n     aback, I said, ``Your Holiness, with all due respect, there \n     are only two of us in this room, and I am certainly a distant \n     second.'' He looked at me and said ``right.'' That was not \n     the last time I pleaded nolo contendere.\n       In preparing for this afternoon, I had thought about \n     presenting a scholarly essay on the media coverage of the \n     private lives of Presidents and their interns, but I demurred \n     because as you've been taught res ipse loquitor.\n       Television has a very hard time conveying complicated \n     issues. It is a medium that seems to seek out simplicity over \n     nuance.\n       It is said that David Brinkley recently reminisced that the \n     way television news would cover Moses in the year 2000 would \n     be as follows: ``Moses came down from the mountaintop today \n     with the 10 commandments . . . here is Sam Donaldson with the \n     three most important.''\n       So let me skip the temptation of crafting an article for \n     your law review or honing a compelling oral argument.\n       Let me instead take a few minutes to have a conversation \n     with you.\n       You have chosen a profession and a university that is \n     unique and you made the choice deliberately.\n       The education you've received at Harvard Law School isn't \n     meant to be the same as you could have received at medical, \n     engineering or business school.\n       You've been given an education that says it's not enough to \n     have skill. Not even enough to have read all the books, \n     mastered all the briefs or shepardized all the cases.\n       The oath you will take, the ethics you must abide by, \n     demand more than that.\n       Embarking on a legal career will bring some uncertainty, \n     insecurity, apprehension. But fear not. I've overcome worse. \n     You should try being a Buffalo Bills fan in Washington! I \n     actually took Meet the Press to the Super Bowl one year. At \n     the end of the program, I looked into the camera and said, \n     ``It's now in God's hands. And God is good. And God is just. \n     Please God, please make three a charm. One time. Go Bills!\n       My colleague Tom Brokaw turned to me and said, ``you Irish \n     Catholics from South Buffalo are shameless.''\n       Well, as I moped back from the stadium after the Dallas \n     Cowboys snuck by 38-10. The first person I saw was Brokaw--he \n     came up put his arm around me and said, ``Well, pal, I guess \n     God is a Southern Baptist.'' I've had the opportunity to work \n     for Senators and Governors, meet Popes and interview \n     Presidents--I do know one thing to be true. The values you \n     have been taught, the struggles you have survived and the \n     diploma you are about to receive tomorrow, have prepared\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\n     you to compete with anybody, anywhere in the world.\n       But let us not forget--and Harvard Law graduates, if you \n     hear anything, hear this--it is people, not degrees, who \n     defend, protect and help those in need.\n       You will be the foot soldiers--the front-line of our legal \n     system dealing day in and day out with the problems and needs \n     of the ordinary folks, the common citizens--the ones the \n     Court calls plaintiffs and defendants.\n       Even if you choose to be a super lawyer/lobbyist in \n     Washington . . . a rainmaker on Wall Street . . . the clerk \n     of a prestigious court you must do your part that true \n     justice prevails for everyone.\n       Recall the admonition of Justice Learned Hand ``If we are \n     to keep our democracy, there must be one commandmant:\n       Thou shalt not ration justice. Your contributions as a \n     lawyer can be significant. You can help save lives, protect \n     the innocent, convict the guilty, provide prosperity, \n     guarantee justice and train young minds.\n       In words of an American Olympics coach, ``You were born to \n     be players. You were meant to be here. At this time. At this \n     moment. Seize it.''\n       And so, too, with the Harvard Law graduates of 2000. You \n     were born to be players in this extraordinary game called \n     life, in this extraordinary vocation called the law.\n       So go climb that ladder of success and work and live in \n     comfort. And enjoy yourself.\n       You earned it. For that is the American dream. But please \n     do this work and your honorable profession one small favor. \n     Remember the people struggling along side you and below you. \n     The people who haven't had the same opportunity, the same \n     blessings, the same education.\n       Recognize, comprehend, understand the society into which \n     you are now venturing . . .\n       13 children a day are shot dead in the United States of \n     America. We--you--have an obligation to at least ask why?\n       Be it criminal law, family law, corporate law, poverty law, \n     politics, litigation, academic--you cannot--you must not--\n     ignore these problems. They threaten the very foundation of \n     our system of jurisprudence--the very fabric of our society.\n       These are the real numbers--real problems--involving real \n     people.\n       Liberals may call it doing good; conservatives may call it \n     enlightened self-interest.\n       Whatever your ideology, reach down and see if there isn't \n     someone you can't pull up a rung or two--someone old, someone \n     sick, someone lonely, someone uneducated, someone \n     defenseless. Give them a hand. Give them a chance. Give them \n     a start--give them protection. Give them their dignity. \n     Indeed there is a simple truth. ``No exercise is better for \n     the human heart that reaching down to lift up another.''\n       That's what I believe it means to be a Harvard Law School \n     graduate--a lawyer in the year 2000. For the good of all of \n     us, and most important to me--my 14-year-old son, Luke--\n     please build a future we all can be proud of.\n       And one last thing, laugh at yourself . . . keep your sense \n     of humor.\n       One of your alumni, John Kennedy class of 1940, used to \n     send these words to his close friends:\n       ``There are three things which are real.\n       God . . . human folly and laughter. The first two are \n     beyond our comprehension so we must do what we can with the \n     third.'' A friend once told me. The United States is the only \n     country he knows that puts the pursuit of happiness right \n     after life and liberty among our God given nights.\n       Laughter and liberty--they go well together.\n       Have an interesting and rewarding career and a wonderful \n     and fulfilling life.\n       Thank you for inviting me to share your class day. I now \n     have the best of both worlds: a Jesuit education and a \n     Harvard baseball cap!\n       Take care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5457-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATIONS TO SCOTT GOMEZ OF ANCHORAGE\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nNational Hockey League's Rookie of the Year, Scott Gomez of the Stanley \nCup champion New Jersey Devils. Scott was born and raised in Anchorage, \nAlaska and is only the eighteenth Alaskan to play in the National \nHockey League and the first to make such a huge impact in his first \nyear.\n  This past Thursday, Scott was awarded the Calder Trophy for best \nrookie performance in the 1999-2000 season. He led all rookies with 19 \ngoals and 51 assists in 82 regular season games. During the playoffs, \nhe earned 10 points. Past winners of the Calder include Bobby Orr and \nRay Bourque.\n  Scott Gomez is an amazing young man. At the age of only 20, he has \naccomplished his lifelong dream of playing in the National Hockey \nLeague and winning the Stanley Cup, all in one year. He was a rising \nstar in Anchorage where he began playing as a child. From very early \non, it was evident that he would be a big star in the NHL. He was twice \nnamed Player of the Year by the Anchorage Daily News/State Coaches. In \nhis junior year of high school, he led the Alaska All-Stars team, ages \n16-17, to the USA Hockey Tier I national championship. After graduating \nfrom East High School in Anchorage, Scott played for Team USA in the \nWorld Junior Championship. In addition to this, he is the first Latino \nto play in the NHL. His father, Carlos, is Mexican and his mother, \nDalia, is Colombian.\n  Mr. President, Scott Gomez is a wonderful example of a young, \ntalented Alaskan who, I am sure, will continue to impress us all in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5457-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY REUNION OF ``COMPANY K''\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nmen of the National Guard's 169th Infantry Regiment of the 43rd \nDivision, or Company K, as they were called, who answered the call to \nserve their country 50 years ago in securing peace and democracy in \nGermany during the Korean War. The men of Company K were an elite group \nof civilian soldiers hailing from Middlesex County in my home state of \nConnecticut.\n  When Communist-led North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, \nPresident Truman decided to strengthen United States forces by calling \nup the National Guard. Worried that the Korean attack was only a \ndiversion for a planned Soviet attack on Berlin, the Truman \nadministration deployed troops in Germany to thwart any plans for \naggression. In order to make this possible, Truman relied heavily on \nsupport from the National Guard.\n  Company K, headquartered in Middletown, Connecticut, became part of \nthis defense effort and reported for roll call on September 5, 1950, \nofficially becoming part of the United States Army. While training at \nthe A.P. Hill Military Reservation in Virginia, Company K received word \nfrom Major General Kenneth F. Cramer that they were to report for duty \nin Germany. It was July 10, 1951, 12:10 p.m.\n  The Major General recalled the history of the 43rd, noting that never \nbefore had it been assigned such a task. It was to be the first time in \nhistory that a National Guard division went to Europe in peace time. \nMajor General Cramer said to his troops:\n\n       We are now participating in a determined effort by western \n     civilization to maintain its freedoms and to preserve the \n     peace through the cooperative effort under the Atlantic Pact. \n     . . . As we move into Europe, the eyes of that continent will \n     be upon us. All these people will judge the America of today \n     by us. By our conduct, by our appearance, by our soldierly \n     qualities, we must make certain that their judgments are most \n     favorable to our own country, whose ambassadors we shall be.\n\n  And great representatives of America they were. On January 4, 1952, \nthe Hartford Courant wrote that the 43rd Division had become an elite \nforce of respectable and dutiful soldiers. They further praised them \nfor their consideration towards the people of Germany, among whom they \nlived and interacted on a daily basis.\n  Company K stayed in Germany for more than two and a half years. \nThrough their efforts there in building defense systems, organizing the \nborder defenses, and strengthening the NATO forces, they successfully \nhelped to prevent any Soviet attacks.\n  The soldiers of the Company put the preservation of freedom and \ndemocratic society ahead of themselves. They proved that their loyalty \nto our society's ideals and their desire for peace was their first \npriority. As such, our nation could not have asked for finer \nambassadors in Europe.\n  On June 25, 2000, the members of Company K will be celebrating their \n50th Anniversary Reunion gathering. I am grateful to them for their \nactions 50 years ago and on behalf of the people of Connecticut, and \nthe nation as a whole, I wish to extend a heartfelt thank you to the \nmen of Company K. I hope that their reunion is a success and I wish \nthem well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5457-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5457-S5458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE TO DR. DENISE DAVIS-COTTON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. \nDenise Davis-Cotton, who will be honored this morning during the \nMillennium Commencement Ceremony at Detroit Symphony Orchestra Hall. \nDr. Davis-Cotton is\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\nbeing honored for her many contributions to the Detroit Public School \nSystem. In particular, she will be honored for her role as the founding \nprincipal of the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, \nand for the work she has done in this capacity.\n  In founding the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, \nwhich opened its doors to students in the fall of 1992, Dr. Davis-\nCotton established a unique center for learning: a small inner city \npublic school dedicated primarily to the study of the arts. She \ndesigned the school curriculum, developed its program components, and \nwrote the philosophy and mission statement for the school, all of which \nare based upon a strong commitment to the study of the arts.\n  After an initial application process, students are asked to audition \nin one of the following areas: instrumental music, vocal music, speech \nand theater, dance or visual arts. Only after this audition are \nstudents accepted to the school. Upon acceptance, students partake in a \nrigorous college preparatory curriculum, along with an intensive study \nin their selected art field.\n  The results of this demanding program have been resoundingly \nsuccessful. 100 percent of the first graduating class received \nacceptance to college; the school holds a 97 percent student retention \nrate; a 95 percent student attendance rate; and the Class of 2000 had \nan overall grade point average of 3.08. Mr. President, the 107 students \nwho comprised the Class of 1998 were awarded seven and a half million \ndollars in scholarships and grants for higher education. The school has \nhad national champions in Academic Games and the Tri-Math-A-Lon, and \nits Forensics Team has won the Michigan State Championship four \nconsecutive years.\n  Another important aspect of the Detroit High School for the Fine and \nPerforming Arts is the unique relationship the school has formed with \nthe Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Through this partnership, students have \nbeen given the opportunity to work with jazz greats Brandford Marsalis \nand Frank Foster; award winning composer Alvin Singleton; Detroit \nSymphony Orchestra Music Director Neeme Jarvi; and Detroit Symphony \nOrchestra Assistant Conductor Ya-Hui-Wang. In addition to instrumental \nstudents studying privately with members of the Detroit Symphony \nOrchestra, an annual joint concert is presented featuring Detroit High \nSchool for the Fine and Performing Arts and Detroit Symphony Orchestra.\n  This partnership was taken to an even higher level in 1996. With \nfinancial assistance from the Detroit Medical Center, an $80 million \ndollar project was undertaken, to be called Orchestra Place. Orchestra \nPlace, when completed, will be an office, retail, education and arts \ncomplex centered around the historic home of the Detroit Symphony, \nOrchestra Hall. It will also include the new home of the Detroit High \nSchool for the Fine and Performing Arts. It is expected to be an \nimportant regional performing arts complex, which will offer \nprofessional and student performances in the world class Orchestra \nHall.\n  Mr. President, all of these many accomplishments would not have been \npossible were it not for the many efforts and the incredible vision of \nDr. Denise Davis-Cotton. Not only has she provided the youth of Detroit \nwith an entirely new opportunity in education, she has also provided \nthe nation with a blueprint for success in inner city public education. \nOn behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Dr. Davis-\nCotton on her many contributions to the State of Michigan, and wish her \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5458-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMENDING FOUR BRAVE COAST GUARDSMEN\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr President, I rise today to commend a \nhelicopter crew from the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka, Alaska. \nThese four brave men rescued three fishermen from a fierce storm at sea \nlast November. Pilot Lt. Robert Yerex, co-pilot Lt. James O'Keefe, and \nPetty Officers Third Class Christian Blanco and Noel Hutton flew their \nhelicopter into 40- to 60-knot winds and pulled three fishermen from \n35- to 40-foot high swells. The Coast Guard awarded this intrepid crew \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross, the highest peace time honor that can \nbe awarded, earlier this month.\n  On November 12, 1999, the four-member crew of the Becca Dawn was \ncaught in a storm 160 miles southwest of Sitka, on the coast of \nSoutheast Alaska. The storm caused the 52-foot vessel to begin sinking \nso quickly the crew had no time to radio a mayday. Instead, an \nemergency position-indicating radio beacon was triggered. The signal \nfrom the beacon was picked up by the Coast Guard and the helicopter \ncrew was immediately sent out. When they arrived, they found the \nfishermen had already abandoned ship.\n  The storm made the rescue extremely difficult. The gusting winds made \nit extremely difficult to maintain the helicopter's stability, and \nblowing snow made visibility extremely low.\n  Once the Coast Guard crew arrived on the scene they pulled up three \nof the four crew members. This operation took thirty minutes. With \nwinds gusting to 60 knots, the crew of the bucking helicopter became \nnauseous, but persevered in their search for the missing fourth \nfisherman in the cold, turbulent water. They only returned to land at \nthe last moment, almost out of fuel, when staying longer would have \nmade them into casualties themselves. Unfortunately, the fourth \nfisherman was never found and is presumed lost at sea.\n  Obviously, this brand of courage and tenacity is worthy of the \nDistinguished Flying Cross and I am very proud of my fellow Coast \nGuardsmen and Alaskans and I congratulate their hard work and \ndedication. All Coast Guardsmen pride themselves on being ``always \nready,'' and these four courageous rescuers showed just what that \nspirit is all about. I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5458-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1967.

A bill to provide for the exchange of certain land in the \nState of Utah; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               utah west desert land exchange act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Utah West \nDesert Land Exchange Act of 2000. I am pleased that my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, joins me in introducing this important \nlegislation.\n  The Utah Enabling Act of 1894 granted to the state four sections, \neach section approximately 640 acres in size, in each 36 square-mile \ntownship. These lands were granted for the support of the public \nschools, and accordingly are referred to as school trust lands. The \nlocation of these lands, as they are not contiguous to each other, has \nmade management by the state difficult. In addition, as school trust \nlands are interspersed with Federal lands, Federal land designations, \nsuch as wilderness study area, have further complicated the state's \nability to manage its lands.\n  The Utah West Desert Land Exchange Act of 2000 seeks to resolve these \nproblems through an equal-value, equal-acreage land exchange between \nthe state of Utah and the Federal Government. The lands that will be \nexchanged are located within the West Desert region of Utah. Each party \nwill exchange approximately 106,000 acres. The Federal government will \nreceive state lands located within wilderness study areas, lands \nidentified as having wilderness characteristics in the Bureau of Land \nManagement's Utah Wilderness Inventory, and lands identified for \nacquisition in the Washington County Habitat Conservation Plan. The \nstate will receive federal lands that are more appropriate to carry out \nits mandate to generate revenue for Utah's public schools.\n  I would like to address two issues some have raised about this land \nexchange. The first issue is regarding land valuation. Both the state \nof Utah and the Department of the Interior firmly believe that this \nexchange is approximately equivalent in value. The parties have reached \nthis conclusion after many months of thorough research and evaluation \nof the parcels to be exchanged. The process of research and evaluation \nincluded review of comparable sales, mineral potential, access, and \ntopography. One may ask why each parcel of land was not appraised \nindividually. The answer is that for many of the 175 state parcels it \nwould have cost more to have appraised those lands than their agreed \nupon value. Please note that the average value of the school trust \nlands outside of Washington County is $85 per-acre; if each individual \nparcel was required to be formally appraised the high appraisal costs \nwould place this land exchange, and all of its benefits, in jeopardy. \nNevertheless both the state of Utah and the Department of the Interior \nhave maintained their fiduciary responsibility by putting together a \npackage that is equal, in both value and acreage.\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\n  The second issue that has been raised is in regard to the LaVerkin \ntract. Governor Leavitt, in his testimony before the United States \nHouse of Representatives Committee on Resources, stated: ``I want to \nassure you the state of Utah will be sensitive to local needs as this \ntract is developed, and will comply with, and participate in, local \nplanning and zoning decisions. Also, you can be assured the scenic \nviews at the entrance to Zion National Park will be protected to the \nmaximum extent practicable,'' It is my hope that this commitment made \nby Governor Levitt will satisfy those concerned by the exchange of the \nLaVerkin tract.\n  The Utah West Desert Land Exchange Act of 2000 is the result of over \n12 months of negotiations between the state of Utah and the Department \nof the Interior. For too long the school trust lands in the West Desert \nhave been held captive by neighboring federal lands, unable to produce \nthe revenue that are legally required to for Utah's schools. This bill \nprovides that Congress with an opportunity to reduce the state of \nUtah's holdings in Federal wilderness study areas and other sensitive \nareas while increasing lands that are more suitable for long-term \neconomic development to the state of Utah for its school children. \nAdditionally, the Federal Government will consolidate its ownership in \nthe existing wilderness study area, which will allow for more \nconsistent management. This bill is a win-win proposal, and the right \nthing to do. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation in the remaining months of the session.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my support for the \nWest Desert Wilderness Land Exchange Act, introduced by my good friend \nand colleague, Senator Robert Bennett. This is a proposal of importance \nto the citizens of my home state of Utah and to all Americans.\n  Utah is the home to some of the most environmentally diverse lands in \nthe nation. These lands contain environmentally significant plants, \nanimals, geology, and many priceless archaeological sites.\n  This legislation will transfer 106,000 acres of state school trust \nlands that are currently held within Wilderness Study Areas to areas \nwhere they may better benefit Utah schools. School trust lands are \nintended to raise revenue for Utah's schools. The economic benefits of \nthese lands are vital to Utah schools and their funding. Trapped within \nWilderness Study Areas, these lands have not been able to be developed, \nand Utah's school children have been left holding the short end of the \nstick. This proposal will allow for a land swap between the Department \nof the Interior and the State of Utah, and both parties have given \ntheir blessing to this proposal.\n  The lands that will be given to the Department of the Interior are \nhome to a variety of endangered and threatened species of plants and \nanimals. A few of these are: the desert tortoise, the chuckawalla, \npurple-spined hedgehog cactus, and the golden and bald eagles. These \nlands also contain some of the most magnificent vistas in the western \nUnited States with views of Zions National Park, Elephant Butte, and \nthe Deep Creek Mountains. This land exchange will preserve the \nunparalleled landscapes characteristic of Utah.\n  The Utah State School Lands Trust was established at the time Utah \nbecame a state with lands deeded to the trust by the federal government \nfor the purpose of creating a reliable source of income to support our \nstate's educational system. Every student in Utah benefits from the \nresources made available by the school trust lands. It is a critical \nsource of support for Utah education.\n  This proposal, therefore, has the backing of all major Utah \neducational organizations, including the Utah PTA and Utah Education \nAssociation. This land exchange will unlock our school trust lands for \nthe long-term benefit of Utah's school children. And, quite frankly, we \nwill never be able to designate more wilderness in Utah without \nprotecting the integrity of our Utah State School Lands Trust.\n  This is one proposal where everyone benefits--our schools as well as \nour environmental interests. It is a logical proposal; it is a fair \nproposal. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with them on this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2755.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will bring focus to an issue that concerns the long-term economic \nviability of communities in much of America's heartland: the southern \nHigh Plains stretching from the middle of Kansas through Oklahoma and \nthe Texas Panhandle and including eastern portions of the State of \nColorado, and the eastern counties of my home state of New Mexico. This \nis farm country, and the cornerstone of its economy is its groundwater \nsupply, the Ogallala aquifer, which allows for irrigated agriculture.\n  The Natural Resource & Conservation Service estimates that there are \nover six million acres of irrigated farmland overlying the southern \nOgallala. These farms use between six and nine million acre-feet of \nwater each year. The problem is that current use of the aquifer is not \nsustainable, and it is being depleted rapidly.\n  As shown on this U.S. Geological Survey Map, the High Plains Aquifer, \nwhich is mostly the Ogallala Aquifer, starts in South Dakota, \nencompasses most of Nebraska and parts of Wyoming, and then continues \ndown into the southern High Plains.\n  This next chart shows the change in water levels in the aquifer over \na seventeen year period from 1980 to 1997. As shown by the gray and \nblue markings on this map, the northern portion of this aquifer is in \npretty good shape. The rate of water recharge from rainfall and \nirrigation water from the Platte River, for the most part matches or is \ngreater than the rate of water depletions.\n  However, the story is quite different in the southern High Plains. In \njust the 17 years characterized on this map, we have seen large areas \nof the southern aquifer experience a 10 to 20 foot drop in their water \ntable. That is shown in the dark orange areas on the map. More alarming \nis that for an almost equal area, as depicted in red on the map, the \ndrop in the water table has been 40 feet or greater.\n  These changes in the level of the water table mean that it takes more \nwells at a greater pumping cost to produce the same amount of water, \nand that's if the wells don't go completely dry. This raises the \nserious question about the viability of continued farming on the \nsouthern High Plains. However, while irrigated agriculture uses the \nlion's share of the water, farm viability is only part of the economic \nstory. This aquifer is also the primary source for municipal water on \nthe southern High Plains. Diminishing productivity from municipal wells \nand the increased cost of pumping can place huge strains on local and \ncounty resources.\n  The insecurity of groundwater resources on the southern High Plains \nis a multi-state issue with significant economic and social \nconsequences for America as a nation. We must act now to help steer the \ncommunities on the southern High Plains toward a sustainable use of the \nOgallala aquifer. Ignoring the problem and allowing continuing uses to \ngo unabated invites tremendous economic dislocation for a large section \nof our country.\n  To address this issue I am introducing the Southern High Plains \nGroundwater Resource Conservation Act. This bill creates three levels \nof approach to the problem.\n  First, it recognizes that to guide government decision makers and \nprivate investors, accurate, up-to-date, scientific information about \nthe groundwater resources in their area is necessary. Therefore it \ncalls upon the United States Geological Survey to initiate a \ncomprehensive hydrogeologic mapping, modeling, and monitoring program \nfor the Southern Ogallala, to provide a report to Congress and to the \nrelevant states with maps and information on a county by county basis, \nand to renew and update that report every year.\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\n  Second, it acknowledges that an effective water conservation plan can \nonly be measured against a multi-year goal. Also, modeling by the \nU.S.G.S. indicates that groundwater conservation is not economically \neffective if implemented on a small scale basis. Measures must be \nimplemented over a sufficiently large area in order to see a long-term \ngroundwater savings, and return on the investment in conservation. To \nensure groundwater savings over an appropriate area, this bill would \nauthorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide planning assistance, \non a cost-share basis, to states, tribes, counties, conservation \ndistricts, or other local government units to create water conservation \nplans designed to benefit their groundwater resource over at least 20 \nyears.\n  Finally, if the Secretary certifies that such a plan is in place, \nthis bill would provide two primary forms of assistance for groundwater \nconservation on individual farms. They are a cost-share assistance \nprogram to upgrade the water use efficiency of farming equipment, and \nthe creation of an ``Irrigated Land Reserve.''\n  The cost-share program is based on the knowledge that, while \nsignificant water savings could be made from moving farms from \nhistorical row or center-pivot irrigation to more modern techniques, \nthe upfront cost is often prohibitive to family farmers. However, \nestimates by the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the High \nPlains Underground Water Conservation District in Lubbock, Texas, are \nthat an initial $20,000 in Federal investment in equipment on a cost-\nshare basis would save between 325 to nearly 490 acre-feet of water \nover a ten year period. A bargain price, considering water prices on \nthe West.\n  The Irrigated Land Reserve in this bill, is designed to convert 10 \npercent, or approximately 600,000 acres, of the irrigated farmland on \nthe southern High Plains to dryland agriculture. Dryland agriculture, \nobviously, is less productive than irrigation. So this bill would \nprovide for a rental rate to farmers to ease the economic impact of \nchanging over. It is estimated that when fully implemented this program \nwould save between 600,000 and 900,000 acre-feet of water per year at a \ncost of $33 to $50 per acre-foot.\n  These two programs, the cost-share program for water conservation, \nand enrollment in an Irrigated Land Reserve are completely voluntary. \nHowever, from the interest I have received in discussions with farmers \non the southern High Plains, I expect that there will be no shortage of \nparticipants.\n  The program outlined in this bill would cost $70 million per year if \nfully implemented. Given the opportunity to move the southern High \nPlains communities to a sustainable use of their groundwater without \nmassive dislocations in their economy, I think it will be an investment \nworth making.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2755\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Southern High Plains \n     Groundwater Resource Conservation Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress Finds that--\n       (1) A reliable source of groundwater is an essential \n     element of the economy of the communities on the High Plains.\n       (2) The High Plains Aquifer and the Ogallala Aquifer are \n     closely related hydrogeographic structures. The High Plains \n     Aquifer consists largely of the Ogallala Aquifer with small \n     components of other geologic units.\n       (3) The High Plains Aquifer experienced a dramatic decline \n     in water table levels in the latter half of the twentieth \n     century. The Average weighted decline in the aquifer from \n     1950 to 1997 was 12.6 feet (USGS Fact Sheet 124-99, Dec. \n     1999).\n       (4) The decline in water table levels is especially \n     pronounced in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, reporting that \n     large areas in the states of Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas \n     experienced declines of over 100 feet in that period (USGS \n     Fact Sheet 124-99, Dec. 1999).\n       (5) The saturated thickness of the High Plains Aquifer has \n     declined by over 50% in some areas (1186 USGS Circular 27, \n     1999). Furthermore, the Survey has reported that the \n     percentage of the High Plains Aquifer which has a saturated \n     thickness of 100 feet or more declined from 54 percent to 51 \n     percent in the period from 1980 to 1997 (USGS Fact Sheet 124-\n     99, Dec. 1999).\n       (6) The decreased water levels in the High Plains Aquifer \n     coupled with higher pumping lift costs raise concerns about \n     the long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the \n     High Plains. (``External Effects of Irrigators' Pumping \n     Decisions, High Plains Aquifer,'' Alley and Schefter, \n     American Geophysical Union paper #7W0326; Water Resources \n     Research, Vol. 23, No. 7 1123-1130, July 1987).\n       (7) Hydrological modeling by the United States Geological \n     Survey indicates that in the context of sustained high \n     groundwater use in the surrounding region, reductions in \n     groundwater pumping at the single farm level or at a very \n     local level of up to 100 square miles, have a very time \n     limited impact on conserving the level of the local water \n     table, thus creating a disincentive for individual water \n     users to invest in water conservation measures. (``External \n     Effects of Irrigators' Pumping Decisions, High Plains \n     Aquifer,'' Alley and Schefter, American Geophysical Union, \n     paper #7W0326; Water Resources Research, Vol. 23, No. 7 1123-\n     1130, July 1987).\n       (8) Incentives must be created for conservation of \n     groundwater on a regional scale, in order to achieve an \n     agricultural economy on the Southern High Plains that is \n     sustainable.\n       (9) For water conservation incentives to function, federal, \n     state, tribal, and local water policy makers, and individual \n     groundwater users must have access to reliable information \n     concerning aquifer recharge rates, extraction rates, and \n     water table levels at the local and regional levels on an \n     ongoing basis.\n       (b) Purposes.--To promote groundwater conservation on the \n     Southern High Plains in order to extend the usable life of \n     the Southern Ogallala Aquifer.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a National Clean Water Trust Fund and to authorize the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to use amounts in \nthe Fund to carry out projects to promote the recovery of waters of the \nUnited States from damage resulting from violations of that Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n            THE NATIONAL CLEAN WATER TRUST FUND ACT 0F 2000\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm introducing a bill that will help \nclean up and restore our nation's waters. This bill, The National Clean \nWater Trust Fund Act of 2000, creates a trust fund from fines, \npenalties and other monies collected through enforcement of the Clean \nWater Act. The money deposited into the National Clean Water Trust Fund \nwould be used to address the pollution problems that initiated those \nenforcement actions.\n  A highly publicized case in Virginia illustrated the need for this \nlegislation. On August 8 1997, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Smith \nissued a $12.6 million judgement against Smithfield Foods for polluting \nthe Pagan River in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. The judge stated in \nher opinion that the civil penalty imposed on Smithfield should be \ndirected toward the restoration of the Pagan and James Rivers, \ntributaries to the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, due to current \nfederal law, the court had no discretion over the damages, and the fine \nwas deposited into the Treasury's general fund, defeating the very \nspirit of the Clean Water Act.\n  Today, there is no guarantee that fines or other money levied against \nparties who violate provisions in the Clean Water Act will be used to \ncorrect short and long term damage from water pollution. Instead the \nmoney is directed into the fund of the U.S. Treasury with no provision \nthat it be used to improve the quality of our water. Pollution from \nspills or illegal discharges can have a profound effect on our \nenvironment and can degrade our public water supplies, and recreational \nareas. Water pollution causes long term damage to fish and shellfish \nhabitat and destroys the livelihood of watermen, and leads to the long \nterm degradation of scenic areas. While the Environmental Protection \nAgency's enforcement activities are extracting large sums of money from \nindustry and others through enforcement of the Clean Water Act, we are \nmissing an opportunity to pay for the cleanup and restoration of \npollution problems for which the penalties were levied. To ensure the \nsuccessful implementation of the Clean Water Act, we should put these \nenforcement funds to work and actually clean up the nation's waters.\n  This legislation will establish a National Clean Water Trust Fund \nwithin the U.S. Treasury to earmark fines, penalties, and other funds, \nincluding consent decrees, obtained through enforcement of the Clean \nWater Act that would otherwise be placed into the Treasury's general \nfund. The EPA Administrator would be authorized, after consultation \nwith the States, to prioritize and carry out projects to restore and \nrecover waters of the United States using the funds collected from the \nviolations of the Clean Water Act. This legislation would not preempt \ncitizen suits or in any way preclude EPA's authority to undertake and \ncomplete supplemental environmental projects as part of settlements \nrelated to violations of the Clean Water Act or any other legislation. \nThe bill also provides court discretion over civil penalties from Clean \nWater Act violations to be used to carry out mitigation and restoration \nprojects. In this bill, EPA is directed to give priority consideration \nto projects in the watershed where the original violation was \ndiscovered. With this legislation, we can avoid another predicament \nlike the one faced in Virginia.\n  Mr. President, it only makes sense that fines occurring from \nviolations of the Clean Water Act be used to restore the waters that \nwere damaged. This bill provides a real opportunity to improve the \nquality of our nation's waters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the transfer or other disposition of \ncertain lands at Melrose Air Force Range, New Mexico, and Yakima \nTraining Center, Washington; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n  LAND TRANSFER AND WITHDRAWAL OF CERTAIN LANDS IN MELROSE AIR FORCE \n                           RANGE, NEW MEXICO\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that \nwould allow for the transfer of administrative jurisdiction over the \nMelrose Air Force Range in New Mexico and the Yakima Training Center in \nWashington to the appropriate Service in the Defense Department. Both \nof these affected areas are public domain lands under the Department of \nInterior. This legislation simply transfers authority from the \nDepartment of Interior to the Secretary of the Air Force in the case of \nthe Melrose Range and to the Secretary of the Army in the case of the \nYakima Training Center.\n  Transfer and conversion of the lands to real property is proposed in \nlieu of the more customary withdrawal pursuant to the Act of February \n28, 1958. The affected lands are multiple parcels of public domain \nlands within a large block of Military Service acquired real property. \nEnactment on this transfer would provide for simplified management of \nthese lands by the respective Defense Department Service.\n  Melrose Air Force Range in Roosevelt County, New Mexico, is comprised \nof six parcels of public land, totaling about 6,714 acres. Over 1,118 \nacres are utilized as bomb impact zone; the remainder is required as a \nsafety buffer. The transfer is needed to provide the Air Force with \ncomplete control over land uses on the Range. This should serve to \nminimize potential safety concerns, liability of the United States, and \nland use conflicts that could interfere with the training mission.\n  The lands have been used as part of the Range since 1957, under lease \nor other arrangement with the State of New Mexico which had ownership \nof the lands at the time. Expansion of the Range was authorized by \nPublic Law 89-568, in September 1966. In 1970 and 1973, the Bureau of \nLand Management (BLM) acquired the lands through a land exchange with \nthe State. During this same period, a land acquisition program to \nenlarge the Range was being conducted by the Air Force through the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers. The BLM exchange was undertaken in aid of that \neffort. In 1975, the U.S. Army Corps, on behalf of the Air Force, \napplied for withdrawal of the lands that the BLM had acquired.\n  The lands that would be transferred through enactment of this \nlegislation are an integral part of the Range, and continue to be \nsuitable for training purposes. These lands will continue to be needed \nfor Air Force training for the foreseeable future.\n  The second installation affected by this legislation is the Yakima \nTraining Center in Kittitas County, Washington. Congress authorized a \n63,000 acre expansion of the existing Center by the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 and the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Act of 1992.\n  The lands to be transferred at the Center consist of 19 scattered \nsmall tracts of public lands totaling 6,649 acres within the expansion \narea. The remaining approximately 56,400 acres of real property within \nthe expansion have already been acquired by the Army. There are an \nadditional 3,090 acres of public domain mineral estate associated with \nthe acquired land to be withdrawn from the general mining laws.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this bill provides for the transfer of \npublic domain lands to the Secretaries of the appropriate military \nservice to complete the acquisitions at both installations as \nauthorized by previous Acts of Congress. The consolidation of these \nlands as real property with the surrounding military acquired lands \nwould provide a common management situation for the Military Service. \nThis should serve to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their \nrange operations and natural resource management.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2757\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Rockfeller, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2758. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the medicare outpatient drug act (the mod act)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Bryan, Robb, \nConrad, Chafee, Baucus, Rockefeller, and Lincoln to introduce the \nMedicare Outpatient Drug Act of 2000.\n  We are all aware of the fundamental changes in Americans' life \nexpectancy throughout the century. When Medicare was created in 1965, \nthe average life expectancy for a woman who reached the age of 65 was \n80 and for a man 78 years of age. In 1998, the life expectancy jumped \nto 84 years for a woman and 81 for a man. Projections for the year 2100 \nassume that the average life span for an individual who reaches 65 will \nbe 94 years for a woman and 91 for a man.\n  These statistics paint a clear picture--seniors are living longer and \nto ensure their quality of life, they must have guaranteed access to \nprescription medications. The Republicans say that they want a \nprescription drug benefit. The Democrats say that they want a \nprescription drug benefit. The question facing both parties is this: Do \nthey really want a benefit or just an election year bully pulpit? If \nthe answer is a benefit, we're here today to help.\n  On far too many occasions in the last few years, important \nlegislation has been knocked off the tracks by election year, partisan \ntrain wrecks. We hope that this year can be different. That is why we \nare offering a new Medicare prescription drug benefit--one that we \nbelieve represents a workable compromise between the Democratic and \nRepublican positions.\n  Our Proposal--the Medicare Outpatient Drug Act of 2000--is centrist. \nIt is bipartisan. It is innovative. And we think it can pass Congress \nthis year. I must mention that this effort has been a truly \ncollaborative one from start to finish. The MOD Act has several key \ncomponents:\n  Universality--access for everyone;\n  Consistency--keeps with the important tradition of the Medicare \nprogram by providing a defined, reliable benefit for all seniors alike. \nA senior in Fargo, North Dakota is assured access to the same defined \nbenefit structure as a senior in Miami, Florida;\n  Voluntary participation, like Medicare Part B;\n  Special protections for low income Americans;\n  True stop-loss protection, which ensures seamless insurance without \ngaps in coverage;\n  A ramp-up payment system, which decreases beneficiary payments based \non their increased prescription medication needs; and\n  The use of Multiple Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) to administer \nthe benefit and promote competition and choice.\n  For many years I have spoken about the need to move the Medicare \nprogram from one based on acute care and illness to one focused on \nprevention and wellness. The Medicare Wellness Act of 2000, of which \nmany of my colleague are cosponsors and which ensures seniors access to \na variety of preventive programs and screenings, represents the first \npiece of this puzzle--The MOD Act represents the second step in my \nthree-point plan for accomplishing this goal.\n  Prescription drugs are an integral part of health care and must be \nintegrated in to the current Medicare system as a defined benefit--not \nas an ``add on.'' It is my understanding that the House Republicans \nhave proposed a bill that entrusts the private insurance market to \nprovide a prescription drug benefit to seniors. Though, on the surface \nthese ideals have appeal and they are initially less expensive or claim \nto be ``more flexible'' than a comprehensive, universal benefit, I find \nmyself asking the question: Are there other Medicare benefits that are \nor should be treated in this capacity?\n  Let's take the example of physician services, for example, \nanesthesiology services. Would we ask private insurance companies to \ncreate anesthesiology-only insurance packages? Would beneficiaries \npurchase such policies? Would they be available? What would be the \nresult of extricating this benefit from the Medicare program.\n  With prescription drugs representing one of the most prevalent \ntreatments in health care today--I ask myself, ``Is it wise to look \ntoward an approach to providing coverage of prescritpion medication \nwhich is arguably unworkable in everyother sector of medicine?''\n  Leaders in the health insurance industry have stated that ``Lawmakers \nshould avoid drug insurance-only coverage, which is unlikely to get off \nthe ground and which would be impossible to price affordably.'' The MOD \nAct creates a defined, affordable, consistent prescription drug benefit \nwithin the Medicare system where it should be.\n  The third piece to solving the Medicare puzzle lies in the need to \ngive the Medicare program the tools to compete in the current health \ncare market\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nplace. My colleagues and I will soon be introducing a reform bill that \nwill have the dual effect of providing significant savings to offset \nthe bill that we are introducing today.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues in \nunveiling this important bipartisan legislation. Our proposal to offer \na prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries is sound, \ncomprehensive, and workable.\n  We are introducing this bill for a very simple reason: the majority \nof Medicare beneficiaries lack meaningful prescription drug coverage, \nand we have an historic opportunity to do something about.\n  The inadequacy of the current Medicare benefits package is clear. It \nsimply does not make sense for a health insurance program to exclude \ncoverage of one of the most critical components of health care.\n  In 1996, 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had at least one \nchronic condition; drugs are frequently the best way to manage those \nconditions. Why offer hospitalization and physician visits to treat \nhigh blood pressure, heart problems, and depression, but not one of the \nmost effective treatment options?\n  Many Medicare beneficiaries are faced with the choice of paying \nextremely high prices at retail outlets--much higher than the prices \npaid by those with coverage--or going without medically necessary \nprescription drug.\n  With bipartisan support and unprecedented budget surpluses we can \ngive our seniors and those with disabilities another choice: to enroll \nin a Medicare prescription drug plan that is guaranteed to be \naccessible and affordable.\n  What should this plan look life? The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act \ncontains several important provisions:\n  First, it provides prescription drugs as a defined, comprehensive and \nintegral component of the Medicare Program. We need to be able to say \nexactly what we are promising seniors, and we need to make sure they \nwill get it--the only way to do that is to include it in the basic \nMedicare benefits package along with everything else.\n  Relying on private insurers to offer this benefit ``would result in a \nfalse promise'' to use the words of the President of the HIAA.\n  Second, our bill provides the greatest help to those with the \ngreatest need--beneficiaries with the lowest incomes and the highest \ndrug expenditures.\n  We do that by providing additional subsidies for those with the \nlowest-incomes, increasing the government's share of coinsurance as the \nbeneficiaries out-of-pocket costs increase, and income-relating the \npremium for high-income beneficiaries.\n  The bottom line: all seniors will be guaranteed access to affordable \ndrugs, and will have the peace of mind of knowing that full coverage is \nprovided for any and all expenses above $4000.\n  Third, ``The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act'' encourages maximum \ncompetition to achieve the greatest discounts, and uses the private \nsector to deliver and manage the benefit.\n  Finally, it is consistent with the need to strengthen and modernize \nthe Medicare program overall. Providing drug coverage is the first \nstep, but more work is needed. We will be introducing legislation soon \nthat takes the next steps.\n  The bill we are offering today bridges the gap between the proposals \noffered by the President and the House GOP.\n  It gives beneficiaries what they need: long-overdue coverage of \nprescription drugs, and also injects competition into the program and \nprovides choices for beneficiaries.\n  This is the first bill to offer universal, guaranteed, affordable, \nfully-defined comprehensive coverage--no limits, not gaps, no gimmicks.\n  Beneficiaries will know what they are getting, and they will know \nwithout a doubt that the benefit will actually be provided.\n  ``The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act'' is not a tough call. It will \naccomplish our goals of providing affordable, accessible coverage, and \nit will work.\n  This is legislation that Congress should enact this year. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nensure that we do just that.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, at a health care forum I \nsponsored in Virginia, a doctor told me of a woman with breast cancer \nsplitting her Tamoxofin pills with two other breast cancer patients, \nbecause the drug was so expensive that the other two couldn't afford \nit. This is a touching story from the perspective of a woman trying to \nhelp two peers, but from a health care perspective, it's an \nabomination. Not only does splitting a dose for one person into three \nnegate the effects of the drug for all three women, but the lack of \naccess to this drug only makes them sicker.\n  Unfortunately, stories like these are all too common today. Modern \nmedicine has become more and more dependent on prescription drugs, yet \nthe Medicare program, which provides health care for our nation's \nelderly and disabled, has not changed with the times. As a result, \nMedicare often finds itself in the position of paying for expensive \nhospital care, yet not paying for the prescription drugs that could \nhelp keep a patient out of the hospital. And as prescription drugs \nbecome more essential to seniors' health care, we hear many stories \nlike the one I've told you today.\n  It's time we did something to change this. While over 90 percent of \nprivate sector employees with employer-based health insurance have \nprescription drug coverage, the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries in \nAmerica today have no basic prescription drug benefit. At the same \ntime, the average Medicare beneficiary fills eighteen prescriptions \neach year, and will have an estimated average annual drug cost of \nnearly $1,100 in 2000. We have an obligation to our seniors, and future \ngenerations of seniors, to strengthen and modernize Medicare by adding \na prescription drug benefit.\n  Unfortunately, both the House and Senate have made little progress \ntoward passing a drug benefit this year. By and large, moderate, \nbipartisan solutions have been absent from the debate.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator Graham, Senator Bryan, \nSenator Conrad, Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus in introducing a bill \nwhich we believe will break this logjam, the Medicare Outpatient Drug \nAct, or MOD Act, of 2000. In crafting the MOD Act, we have combined the \nbest elements of insurance-based plans--which aim to promote \ncompetition and innovation--and the President's plan--which offers a \ndependable, universal benefit to all seniors. The result is a bill that \nall sides should be able to agree on.\n  Like the President's plan, our bill will offer a defined Medicare \nbenefit that will be available to all seniors, regardless of their \nhealth status or place of residence. But unlike the President's plan, \nour bill will allow private entities to compete for Medicare \nbeneficiaries--allowing seniors and the disabled to choose from a \nvariety of options that are custom-tailored to their specific \nprescription drug needs.\n  Moreover, the MOD Act is the first prescription drug bill to offer \nMedicare beneficiaries a comprehensive drug benefit, with no gaps in \ncoverage, and full protection against sky-high out-of-pocket costs. The \nMOD Act gradually increases its level of coverage as beneficiaries get \nsicker, so that the greatest assistance is devoted to those who need it \nmost.\n  There is only a handful of legislative days left in the Senate this \nyear, and if we're going to get anything done on the prescription drug \nfront, we'll have to settle on a proposal that is moderate and \nbipartisan. The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act is that bill, and I urge \neach of my colleagues to give it their full support.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Graham, \nBryan, Robb, Conrad, and Baucus in introducing the Medicare Outpatient \nDrug (MOD) Act of 2000 today.\n  The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act addresses an area of great concern \nto our nation's seniors: the need for a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Seniors today are facing staggering and burdensome drug \nprices. Studies show that the average American over 65 spends more than \n$700 per year on drug prescriptions. In Rhode Island, seniors pay twice \nas much for certain prescription drugs as the drug companies' most \nfavored customers (for example, Medicaid and the Veteran's \nAdministration). On average, Rhode Island seniors pay 84 percent more \nthan prescription drug consumers in Canada or Mexico.\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\n  We must update the Medicare program to include a prescription drug \nbenefit. This bipartisan, comprehensive bill will provide universal \ncoverage to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries in this country. As \nyou know, Medicare was established in 1965 at a time when prescription \ndrugs were not widely used. These days, drug therapies have replaced \novernight stays in hospitals and long convalescence in nursing \nfacilities. In light of this, we must update the Medicare program to \nkeep pace with these scientific and medical advances.\n  This legislation does many things that other legislative proposals do \nnot. First, it provides universal coverage on a voluntary basis to \nevery Medicare-eligible individual. Second, it is based on a standard \ninsurance model, with coinsurance, a deductible, and a defined stop-\nloss benefit. In other words, once a senior pays $4,000 in annual drug \ncosts, our plan covers the rest. Third, the amount of a senior's \npremium would be directly related to his/her income, on a sliding \nscale. In other words, the lowest-income senior will receive the \ngreatest subsidy. Conversely, the highest-income senior will receive \nthe lowest federal subsidy.\n  Finally, this legislation emulates market-based insurance coverage by \nallowing multiple ``pharmacy benefit managers'' (PBMs) to contract with \nMedicare to provide the pharmaceutical benefit to seniors. This would \nensure competition in the delivery of this benefit, which means a \nbetter benefit and lower prices for consumers. This competition would \nalso prevent the government from ``setting'' drug prices. In my view, \nprice setting would weaken the ability of pharmaceutical companies to \nconduct valuable research and development into new drug therapies that \none day may cure diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's Alzheimer's, \ndiabetes, and HIV/AIDS.\n  In sum, I believe our proposal to be one of the most responsible and \ncomprehensive drug bills in Congress. It achieves these twin goals \nwhile relieving seniors of the huge burden of high drug bills. Seniors \nshould never have to choose between filling a prescription for needed \nmedication or buying groceries. Sadly, this is often the case today.\n  This past April, I received a letter from an elderly couple in Rhode \nIsland, with a list of their prescription drug expenses for 1999 \nenclosed. This couple spent almost $7,000 in 1999 on these \nprescriptions. They are living on a fixed income, and told me that \ntheir savings are being wiped out by the high cost of prescription \nmedications. In addition, the grandmother of one of my staffers cannot \nafford Prilosec, which she needs to prevent nausea. She cannot hold \ndown food without this drug. This grandmother has to get her Prilosec \nprescription from her daughter, who has it prescribed and then ships it \nto her mother.\n  This should not be happening. Our bill will ensure that these seniors \nwill get the prescription medications they need without having to wipe \nout their personal savings or resort to getting the prescription \nthrough a relative.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nlegislation and finally provide this necessary medical coverage to our \nnation's seniors.\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today to salute the new reigning \nchampions of the National Basketball Association--California's own Los \nAngeles Lakers.\n  The tradition of greatness continues in Los Angeles. Building on the \nexcellence personified by the likes of Jerry and Wilt the Silt, and \nlater by Magic and Kareem, today's Lakers regained that status by \nplayers known around the world by two words: ``Kobe'' and ``Shaq.''\n  What can you say about Shaquille O'Neal? He is the most dominating \nforce in the game today. He was the most valuable player in the All-\nStar Game, the regular season and the NBA finals.\n  Kobe Bryant has that creative, slashing style that is pure \nexcitement. The way he fought through tough injuries to spark the \nLakers was an inspiration.\n  And Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the rest of the Lakers \nteam. The steady hand and championship experience of Ron Harper was \ncrucial. Robert Harry's stifling defense, strong rebounding and \nopportunistic scoring were key. Rick Fox, whose ten years' experience \nand clutch three-pointer in the waning moments of Game Six were \ninvaluable. The persistent of Glenn Rice was matched only by the beauty \nof his jump shot. A.C. Green, who came back to the Lakers for this \nchampionship season, reminded us of his original ``Showtime'' days when \nhe was running the wing with Magic and Worthy. And Brian Shaw and Derek \nFisher made big shots and took care of the ball during minutes off the \nbench. What a team!\n  Finally, the man who brought all of these elements together, is \nsimply the best of all time--the man they call Zen master, coach Phil \nJackson.\n  The Lakers victories were made more special by the determination of \ntheir opponents. Larry Bird and the Indiana Pacers deserve the respect \nof basketball fans everywhere.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of millions of adoring Angelenos, California \nand basketball fans everywhere congratulations to the 2000 World \nChampion Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5469-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5469-S5470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 325--WELCOMING KING MOHAMMED VI OF MOROCCO UPON HIS \n   FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to;\n\n                              S.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The armed conflict and resulting lawlessness and \n     violence in Colombia present a danger to the security of the \n     United States and the other nations in the Western Hemisphere \n     and to law enforcement efforts intended to impede the flow of \n     narcotics.\n       (2) Colombia is the second oldest democracy in the Western \n     Hemisphere with a history of open and friendly relations with \n     the United States.\n       (3) In 1998, two-way trade between the United States and \n     Colombia was more than $11,000,000,000, making the United \n     States Colombia's number one trading partner and Colombia the \n     fifth largest market for United States exports in Latin \n     America.\n       (4) Colombia is faced with multiple wars, against the \n     Marxist Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), the \n     Marxist National Liberation Army (ELN), paramilitary \n     organizations, and international narcotics trafficking \n     kingpins.\n       (5) The FARC and ELN engage in systematic extortion and \n     murder of United States citizens, profit from the illegal \n     drug trade, and engage in indiscriminate crimes against \n     Colombian civilians and security forces. These crimes include \n     kidnapping, torture, and murder.\n       (6) Thirty-four percent of world terrorist acts are \n     committed in Colombia, making it the world's third most \n     dangerous country in terms of political violence.\n       (7) Colombia is the kidnapping capital of the world, with \n     2,609 kidnappings reported in 1998.\n       (8) During the last decade more than 35,000 Colombians have \n     been killed.\n       (9) The conflict in Colombia is creating instability along \n     its borders with neighboring countries Ecuador, Panama, Peru, \n     and Venezuela.\n       (10) The United States has a vital national interest in \n     assisting Colombia in the resolution of these conflicts due \n     to the inherent problems associated with Colombian drug \n     trafficking and production.\n       (11) The United States has a vital national interest in \n     assisting Colombia in the resolution of these conflicts due \n     to the strong economic and political relationship that exists \n     between the two countries.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should support the military and \n     political efforts of the Government of Colombia, consistent \n     with human rights, that are necessary to effectively resolve \n     the conflicts with the armed insurgents that threaten the \n     territorial integrity, economic prosperity, and rule of law \n     in Colombia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5475-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Res. 325\n\n       Whereas Morocco was the first country to recognize the \n     independence of the United States;\n       Whereas Morocco and the United States signed a Treaty of \n     Friendship and Cooperation in 1787;\n       Whereas the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation stands as \n     the basis for the longest unbroken treaty relationship \n     between the United States and a foreign country in the \n     history of the Republic;\n       Whereas the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation has \n     established a close, friendly, and productive alliance \n     between the United States and Morocco that has stood the test \n     of history and exists today;\n       Whereas the close relationship between the United States \n     and Morocco has helped the United States advance important \n     national interests;\n       Whereas the United States and Morocco have long shared the \n     objectives of securing a true and lasting peace in the Near \n     East region and have worked together to establish and advance \n     the Middle East peace process;\n       Whereas, under the leadership of the late King Hassan II, \n     Morocco played a critical role in hosting meetings, promoting \n     dialogue, and encouraging moderation in the Middle East, \n     leading to some of the peace process's most important and \n     lasting achievements;\n       Whereas, with the ascension of the King Hassan II's \n     successor, King Mohammed VI, Morocco is suitably positioned \n     and ably guided by its current leadership to maintain its \n     traditional role in the peace process;\n       Whereas Morocco and the United States have worked \n     successfully to enhance economic stability, growth, and \n     progress in the Maghreb region and its environs, including \n     Morocco's role as host to the inaugural Middle East and North \n     Africa Summit held in Casablanca in 1994, and Morocco's \n     continuing prominence in sustaining that dialogue and \n     promoting economic integration with Tunisia and Algeria;\n       Whereas King Mohammed VI has assumed and expanded the \n     legacy of his father, the late Hassan II, in strengthening \n     the rule of law, promoting the concepts of democracy, human \n     rights and individual liberties, and implementing far-\n     reaching economic and social reforms to benefit all of the \n     people of Morocco;\n       Whereas the preservation of the rights and freedoms of the \n     Moroccan people and the expansion of reforms in Morocco \n     represent a model for progress and bolster the foreign policy \n     objectives of the United States in the region and elsewhere;\n       Whereas leading American corporations such as the CMS \n     Energy Corporation, the Boeing Company, the Goodyear Tire and \n     Rubber Company, the Gillette Company, and others are \n     responsible for substantial and increasingly higher levels of \n     trade, investment, and commerce between the United States and \n     Morocco, involving increasingly diverse sectors of the \n     Moroccan and American economies;\n       Whereas the expansion of economic activity is emerging as a \n     new and increasingly important component of the historical \n     friendship between the United States and Morocco, and is \n     helping to strengthen the fabric of the bilateral \n     relationship and to sustain it throughout the 21st century \n     and beyond;\n       Whereas the people of the United States and Morocco have \n     long enjoyed fruitful exchanges in fields such as culture, \n     education, politics, science, business, and industry, and \n     Americans of Moroccan origin are making substantial \n     contributions to these and other disciplines in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas Morocco and the United States are preparing for the \n     first official visit to the United States by King Mohammed VI \n     to highlight these and other achievements, to celebrate the \n     long history of warm and friendly ties between the two \n     countries, to continue discussions on how to advance and \n     accelerate those objectives common to the United States and \n     Morocco, and to inaugurate a new chapter in the longest \n     unbroken\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\n     treaty relationship in the history of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator from West Virginia would give me 1 to 2 \nminutes before his remarks, I would be finished and glad to yield the \nfloor to him.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I learned a long time ago that a good Boy \nScout should do a good deed every day. I want to do my good deed at \nthis moment. I am very happy for the Senator to speak as long as he \nwishes, and then I will follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \ncourtesy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5477-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMENDING SENATOR BROWNBACK FOR HIS STATEMENT ON INDIA\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a few moments ago the Senator who is \npresiding over the Senate spoke on the floor, expressing some views \nabout the nation of India. I believe the Senator raised a very \nimportant matter that is too little discussed in our Government, in our \nnews media, and in this country. It seems to me every time I have heard \nthe Senator speak on it, he makes perfectly good sense.\n  I believe the Senator is on the right track with a very important \nissue for our country. I simply want to say to the Senator, thank you \nfor raising it. I believe it is a matter we need to discuss more.\n  India is soon to be the most populous nation in the world. It is a \ndemocracy. There is no reason for us to have an adversarial \nrelationship with them. The CTBT issues can be overcome. It is time for \nus to rethink our policy in that area.\n  I thank the Senator for raising the issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, today, on June 20, 2000, the 35th star on \nthe American flag--the star on the third row up from the bottom, second \nfrom the left--glows just a little bit brighter than the rest, at least \nfor me and my fellow West Virginians. For today is the 137th \nanniversary of West Virginia's statehood in 1863. And like the star, I \nthink that I, too, glow just a bit with pride, basking in the reflected \nbeauty of my home State of West Virginia.\n  I am especially glad that West Virginia's birthday falls in June. \nWhile every month has its special joys, June is an exceptionally \nbeautiful month in West Virginia, full of wildflowers and birdsong, of \nneat gardens laid out in orderly rows, of trees still fresh and richly \ngreen. June is a month of optimism, of outdoor weddings and picnics, of \nfresh corn still just a promise on the stalk, of children learning to \nfish along quiet streams, and of knobby-kneed colts and calves peeking \nshyly from between their mother's legs in meadows lush with grass. June \nis a month for celebrating.\n  We celebrate a fairly young State laid over a very old foundation. \nThe history of West Virginia as a State has lasted for but an instant \nin the geologic scale of the steeply curving mountains that comprise \nmost of the State's landmass. The soil and the rock of these mountains \nwas first mounded up some 900 million years ago in the Precambrian era. \nOver time, this first Appalachian mountain chain eroded to form a \nseabed during the shifting movement of the continents. Then, about 500 \nmillion years ago, during the Ordovician period, the continents drifted \nback together, and these titanic forces pushed that sea floor up, \ncreating the multiple parallel ridges that form the Appalachian \nmountains today. During the subsequent Triassic and Jurassic periods, \nknown to every schoolchild as the age of dinosaurs, the continents \nsettled into the configuration we know today. They are still settling. \nIn the most recent period, 200 million years of wind and rain and snow \nand ice have eroded the Appalachian mountains to about half of their \noriginal height--a happenstance that I am sure West Virginia's early \nsettlers appreciated as they hauled their belongings over rough tracks \nin wooden-wheeled carts.\n  West Virginia's topography has always been important. It shaped the \nkind of agriculture still seen today--smaller family farms carved out \nof sheltered hollows, small valleys, and steep hillsides. It shaped the \nkind of industry that developed, favoring resource extraction of fine \ntimber, rich coal deposits, and chemicals over land-intensive, large-\nscale manufacturing. It shaped the politics of West Virginia's history, \ncreating a divide between the independent mountaineers who settled \nthese hills and the rest of what was then the Commonwealth of Virginia. \nAnd the mountains have always served as a kind of fortress wall around \nthe hidden beauty of the State.\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nBefore the advent of modern highways--which came late to the State of \nWest Virginia, and which are still coming--it took a special \ndetermination to make one's way into our mountain fastnesses.\n  A child of war, West Virginia has the somewhat dubious honor of \nhosting the first major land battle of the Revolutionary War, at Point \nPleasant, as well as the last skirmish of that war, at Fort Henry in \nWheeling, in 1782.\n  Now, this information I came upon in a history of West Virginia, \nwritten by a West Virginian.\n  West Virginia gained her statehood during the Civil War, and her \nhills are dotted with battlefields from that conflict. Many historians, \nin fact, consider the clash at Philippi between Union Colonel Benjamin \nF. Kelly and his First Virginia Provisional Regiment and the forces \nunder Confederate Colonel George A. Porterfield on the morning of June \n3, 1861, to be the first land battle of the Civil War. So, from these \nviolent beginnings, West Virginia has come a long way in just 137 years \nto host an international peace conference earlier this year in \nShepherdstown.\n  West Virginia has come a long way, as well, from her early days as a \nresource-rich provider of building-block essentials like coal, and \nchemicals, and timber to a diversified economy of old staples and \nleading-edge, information-age high technology. And West Virginia has \ncome a long way from being a quiet backwater region of narrow, winding, \ngravel and dirt roads that kept people isolated and insular to a State \ntraversed by modern, safe, business-attracting highways.\n  I have seen these changes happen. I can remember the old dirt roads, \nthe old gravel roads. I can remember when there were only 4 miles of \ndivided four-lane highways in my State. And I can remember prior to \nthat. When I was in the State legislature, in 1947, West Virginia only \nhad 4 miles of divided four-lane highways.\n  Let me say that again. In 1947--53 years ago--when I was in the West \nVirginia Legislature, West Virginia only had 4 miles of divided four-\nlane highways.\n  It is much different now. West Virginia has at least between 900 and \n1,000 miles of four-lane divided highways. Now there are some people \nwho would like to see us go back to the time when we only had 4 miles \nof divided four-lane highways. In some ways I would like to go back to \nthat time, too. But certainly I do not want to go back to that \ncircumstance.\n  West Virginia has blossomed as she has matured, reaching out \ngracefully to the future while preserving and honoring the rich history \nof her past.\n  As a State, West Virginia is aging, and her population is aging, as \nwell. West Virginia boasts the oldest median age in the Nation. I like \nto think that this statistic, in part, proves that West Virginia is as \nattractive a place in which to retire as are some of the more steamy \nStates in the Nation. Of course, West Virginia's bracing climate, with \nits breathtaking seasonal changes, may be responsible for keeping West \nVirginia's elders active long after retirement. There is always a \ngarden to plant, or leaves to rake, or simply beautiful walks to take, \nactivities that keep the joints--joints of the arms and legs--agile and \nthe mind busy. Age, and the wisdom that can only be accumulated with \nexperience, is respected in the Mountaineer state. Just two weeks ago, \nthe State hosted the first-ever United Nations International Conference \non Rural Aging, taking its place at the forefront of efforts to keep \nthe 60 percent of seniors around the world who live in rural areas \nhealthy, active, and independent.\n  Yet despite all the changes, one thing has remained constant in West \nVirginia; namely, the down to earth, faith-in-God values of her people. \nWe have no hesitancy in using that word and not using it in vain. There \nis a tendency these days to kind of put the lid on using the word \n``God.'' No, don't use his name; don't use God's name. I am against \nusing his name in vain. I can't say that I have not done that in my \ntime, but I am very much opposed to that. But I am not opposed to using \nGod's name in schools and anywhere else. I am for that. I will have no \nhesitancy to do it myself, no hesitancy whatsoever.\n  West Virginians are taught to honor their mother and father and to do \nwhat is right, even if that is not the easiest path. In West Virginia, \nwe try to live by the Golden Rule, and always remember to give thanks \nto the Creator for the many blessings he has bestowed upon us. We ought \nto go back and read the Mayflower Compact and see how those men and \nwomen felt about God. In a time when society is focused on speed and \ninstant gratification, West Virginians know the value of taking time to \nenjoy the beauty around them. Those values, which have survived for 137 \nyears, I expect will be around for another 137, at least.\n  So, at age 137, the 137th birthday, West Virginia is a youngster on \nthe geologic time scale and just entering her middle age on the \npolitical scale. In terms of her population's age, well, let us be \npolite and say only that she is ``of a certain age,'' still at least a \nfew steps way from becoming, a grand dame. All that I will say is, she \ncertainly is grand!\n\n     West Virginia, how I love you!\n     Every streamlet, shrub and stone,\n     Even the clouds that flit above you\n     Always seem to be my own.\n\n     Your steep hillsides clad in grandeur,\n     Always rugged, bold and free,\n     Sing with ever swelling chorus:\n     Montani, Semper, Liberi!\n\n     Always free! The little streamlets,\n     As they glide and race along,\n     Join their music to the anthem\n     And the zephyrs swell the song.\n\n     Always free! The mountain torrent\n     In its haste to reach the sea,\n     Shouts its challenge to the hillsides\n     And the echo answers ``FREE!''\n\n     Always free! Repeat the river\n     In a deeper, fuller tone\n     And the West wind in the treetops\n     Adds a chorus all its own.\n\n     Always Free! The crashing thunder\n     Madly flung from hill to hill,\n     In a wild reverberation\n     Adds a mighty, ringing thrill.\n\n     Always free!

The robin twitters\n     As the sunset gilds the skies.\n\n     Perched upon the tallest timber,\n     Far above the sheltered lea,\n     There the eagle screams defiance\n     To a hostile world: ``I'm free!''\n\n     And two million happy people,\n     Hearts attuned in holy glee,\n     Add the hallelujah chorus:\n     ``Mountaineers are always free!''\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/20/senate-section/article/S5478-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
