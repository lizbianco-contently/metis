There is a provision on \nthat bill which is required to adjust the spending caps because of the \nlimitations in the 1997 Budget Act.\n  Subsection (a) of the amendment that will be before the Senate \nincreases the discretionary cap for budget authority under the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 from $541.1 billion to $637 billion, and increases \nthe discretionary cap for general purpose outlays under the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 from $547.3 billion to $612.7 billion.\n  When discretionary highway and mass transit outlays of $32.3 \nbillion--separate cap categories--are added to this amount, we will \nhave allowable discretionary spending of $645 billion under this raised \ncap.\n  Subsection (b)(1) includes emergency spending already committed \nduring this session under the new cap limits. Emergency spending is \nusually excluded from cap limits. In this instance, we have included \nsuch spending within the cap limits in order to be assured we will not \ninvade the Social Security surplus.\n  We have another subsection, (b)(2), that provides for adjustments \nunder these caps to continue, as permitted by current law, for \ncontinuing disability reviews, CDRs: $450 million in budget authority; \nthe earned-income tax compliance initiative, EITC, that is $145 million \nin budget authority, and adoption assistance of $20 million in budget \nauthority; and for an outlay adjustment of 0.5 percent.\n  Subsection (c) provides for a 0.5-percent adjustment for budget \nauthority to cover the differences between CBO and OMB scoring methods. \nA similar adjustment was provided last year.\n  These caps assure us that we will have the funds available to deal \nwith the remaining two bills that are very contentious; the State-\nJustice-Commerce bill and the Labor-Health and Human Services bill. For \neach of those bills, we allocated portions of the 302(b) authority that \nwas given to our Appropriations Committee under the budget resolution \nfor the year 2001. However, after those bills had passed and gone to \nconference, we recovered portions of the 302(b) allocation and \nallocated that to Housing and Urban Development and the energy and \nwater bill. The result is that these two bills that are in conference \nnow do not have the full funding that would be required to bring them \nback across the floor to the Senate.\n  This adjustment to the 2001 discretionary spending caps, as contained \nin the foreign assistance bill that will be before the Senate, I hope \nthis afternoon, are necessary in order that those two bills can be \nreallocated funding sufficient to assure that they will be able to be \nconsidered and passed by the Senate.\n  It has been a very difficult year for the Appropriations Committee \nbecause of the circumstances, because of the differences between the \nPresident's budget and the congressional budget resolution. There is a \nsubstantial gap\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\nbetween those two documents, and we have done our best to work with \nthem. This action that we have taken now to lift the spending caps will \ngive us the opportunity to work out the differences with the \nadministration. I do believe that should and can be completed today. It \nis my firm hope we will complete action on the other two bills today so \nthe House may commence consideration of them tomorrow and that the \nSenate will consider them Friday. That, of course, is going to take a \nlot of understanding and cooperation from all Members of the Senate, \nand I for one urge that take place.\n  I have not been home since the first week of August. We, on the \nAppropriations Committee, have been working around the clock on this \nprocess since the second week of August. It is time this come to an \nend. The disputes and conflicts between the bills, and between the \nadministration and the Congress, between the House and Senate, and \nbetween Members of each body and within each body, are the most \nintensive I have ever seen. But it is time we realize that at the end \nof this week we will be 1 week away from the elections. I do not think \nCongress ought to be in session in the week before the elections, and I \nam going to do my utmost to see that we finish these bills by Friday.\n  If that is not possible, the leader will have to decide what we do. \nI, for one, intend to go home Saturday.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, there is so much happening in the world of \npolitics and elections, it is almost hard to know what topic to talk \nabout. Education is certainly No. 1 on the agenda of the American \npeople, and we are now in the final stages, I hope, of agreeing--I am \nhopeful--on an education bill for our country. We have made some good \nprogress. I am very glad; it appears President Clinton's budget \npriority for afterschool programs is winning out. I am hoping that is \nthe case.\n  Many of us have worked long and hard to make the point that \nafterschool care is crucial, that it is the best antidote to high \ncrime, juvenile crime that occurs in the afternoons after school. It is \na no-brainer. We know if kids are kept occupied after school, it keeps \nthem out of trouble. We have seen these programs work. We have seen \nthat juvenile crime occurs between 3 and 6 p.m. If children are engaged \nin stimulating activity after school, it helps.\n  President Clinton and the Democrats have been trying to ensure that \nthe 1 million children who are waiting for afterschool programs, in \nfact, get afterschool programs. After reading press reports, I am glad \nto report to my colleagues that this looks as if it is on the way. \nHowever, we still have a major disagreement on school construction. I \nhave seen some of our schools that are falling apart. Again, I hope we \ncan reach agreement on this crucial issue.\n  The two candidates for President have been arguing over education. \nThe good news is that education is the topic of the day. It is \nimportant, when we realize we have to import people to come into this \ncountry to take the high-tech jobs, and what a tragedy it is that our \nyoung people are not trained. So education is key.\n\n  Of course, there is an argument between the two candidates on whether \nor not education should be a national priority, which is Vice President \nGore's view, or Governor Bush's view that really the National \nGovernment should not get very involved. This is a key distinction.\n  I side with Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican President, who said it is \ncrucial to our national defense to have education as a top priority and \nto make sure that our young people are educated in math, science, and \nreading, everything they have to know--even in those days before high \ntech. I think Vice President Gore is correct.\n  There is also a flap over some claims that the Texas students were \ndoing really well. It turns out that the independent Rand report issued \njust yesterday says, in fact, those Texas students were not tested with \nnational tests. If one looks at the national tests, they are just not \nmaking it. Clearly, this education issue is going to go on.\n  I come here as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee to talk \nabout another issue, a very important issue, and that is an issue that \nis being debated in the Foreign Relations Committee right now. I am not \non the particular subcommittees that are holding this hearing, but it \nseems to me the hearing going on about U.S.-Russia policy in 1995 are \nreally aimed at trying to take a hit at Vice President Gore.\n  It is interesting that Republican officials who are speaking up 2 \nweeks before the election never even talked about the agreement that \ncame out of those meetings in 1995. They did not talk about them for 5 \nyears, but 2 weeks before an election they are out there trying to hurt \nthe Vice President. This is politics at its very worst.\n  Frankly, what we ought to be talking about is foreign policy in the \nyears 2000 and 2001 in this century because some of the comments made \nby Governor Bush and his advisers are raising all kinds of alarms \nthroughout the world. It is important that they be put on the table. \nThese remarks have to do with the U.S. policy in the Balkans. Advisers \nto Governor Bush have followed up on his statements he made in the last \ndebate that if he was elected President, he would negotiate for the \nremoval of all U.S. peacekeeping troops from the Balkans. As one can \nimagine, this announcement has set off alarms in capitals of our \nEuropean allies who rightly believe that such a policy would weaken and \ndivide NATO.\n  One of the things that alarmed me about Governor Bush's comments was \nhe said our military is really there to fight wars and win wars, not to \nkeep the peace; that is our role. That puts our people in a very \ndifficult position because if, in fact, we have a situation where \nsuddenly our military is no longer involved in peacekeeping but only in \nfighting, then I think our NATO allies will say: OK, you do the \nfighting, we will do the peacekeeping. And it means that our troops \nwill be in harm's way and our pilots will be in harm's way. This is a \ngreat concern to me.\n\n  According to today's New York Times, Lord Robertson, the NATO \nSecretary General, has regularly told visiting American Congressmen \nthat the Bush proposal could undermine the whole idea of risk sharing, \nwhich is precisely the glue that holds our alliance together.\n  The Washington Post quotes one European Ambassador saying:\n\n       If the U.S. says it will not perform certain tasks, then \n     the basic consensus of ``all for one and one for all'' begins \n     to unravel. . . . The integrated military command could fall \n     apart and so would [our] alliance.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield as long as I do not lose time \nand do not lose my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Let me take us back from before the unanimous consent \nrequest was made and kind of summarize where I was going.\n  We had a statement by Governor Bush. The statement was that he wanted \nto see all of those peacekeeping troops come home from the Balkans. He \nsaid we should not be involved in peacekeeping, only in fighting. As a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, I am concerned and clearly \nour NATO allies are concerned. Lord Robertson, the NATO Secretary \nGeneral, again, has said this could undermine our relationship with our \nNATO alliance.\n  The Washington Post says one European Ambassador was quoted as \nsaying: If the U.S. says it will not perform certain tasks, then the \nbasic consensus of NATO begins to unravel.\n  Now, I remember being very surprised, because I was at the second \ndebate, when Governor Bush made the point that we were carrying the \nload in the Balkans in terms of the peacekeeping troops. I knew that \nwas incorrect. The fact is, American troops are no more than 20 percent \nof the total. American aid represents no more than 20 percent of what \nis being provided to Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  I would hate to see us walk away from peacekeeping and tell everyone \nwe are the fighters; and then have our allies say: OK, you do the \nfighting; we do the peacekeeping. It is of great concern to me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsome editorials that have been written on this subject by the New York \nTimes, the Washington Post, and USA Today.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 2000]\n\n                              Risking NATO\n\n       Gov. George W. Bush wants a new ``division of labor'' \n     within NATO, the U.S.-European alliance that has helped keep \n     the peace for the past half-century. His proposal would more \n     likely lead to a division of NATO itself--to the end of the \n     alliance.\n       Mr. Bush hinted at this view before, with his denunciation \n     of U.S. ``nation-building'' in the Balkans, but it was his \n     national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, who spelled out \n     exactly what he means in a New York Times interview published \n     Saturday. Ms. Rice said that America's allies in Europe \n     should furnish the ground troops for missions such as \n     peacekeeping in Kosovo and Bosnia, while the United States \n     should offer ``the kind of support we can provide, such as \n     air power.'' In other words: You Europeans take all the risks \n     while we hover safety above the fray. No allies would long \n     accept such a deal, nor should they be expected to.\n       The proposal is particularly misguided given that European \n     allies already are bearing the brunt of peacekeeping duties \n     in the Balkans. They provide about four-fifths of needed \n     troops. The United States has deployed some 11,000 troops in \n     Kosovo and Bosnia, less than one percent of its active duty \n     force. For the United States, this is a win-win situation: \n     Its policy is implemented, but the burden of implementation \n     is widely shared. Under Ms. Rice's proposal, which was \n     officially endorsed by Bush campaign headquarters, the United \n     States would lose its ability to steer policy, risk the \n     world's most successful alliance--and very likely inherit a \n     far larger burden once the Balkans erupted again.\n       The Clinton Administration has picked an unfortunate \n     argument in response. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, \n     again to the Times, said that even raising the issue was \n     dangerous to U.S. interests. This recalls the Gore-Lieberman \n     campaign's contention that Mr. Bush's criticism of U.S. \n     military readiness is dangerous because it comforts U.S. \n     enemies. This effort to squelch debate is preposterous; these \n     are precisely the kinds of issues that should be aired in a \n     campaign.\n       The more sensible response would be to point out that the \n     Clinton-Gore policies seems to be having an effect. The \n     Balkans are at peace; democracy is sprouting almost \n     everywhere; even the apparently invulnerable Slobodan \n     Milosevic has been knocked from his perch. Of course many \n     problems remain, the gains are fragile and, yes, U.S. troops \n     will be needed for some time. But surely helping democracy \n     take root throughout Europe is worth the modest price of that \n     modest deployment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 24, 2000]\n\n                       No Time for a Balkan Exit\n\n       Sharp contrasts emerged over the weekend in the way the \n     Bush and Gore campaigns view America's proper military role \n     in Europe. The debate began when Condoleezza Rice, one of \n     Gov. George W. Bush's leading foreign policy advisers, told \n     The Times's Michael Gordon that a Bush administration would \n     ask European members of NATO to gradually take over full \n     responsibility for providing peacekeeping forces for Bosnia \n     and Kosovo. Vice President Gore countered that carrying out \n     such a policy could destabilize the Balkans and jeopardize \n     the future of NATO, America's most important military \n     alliance.\n       Debates over how and where United States military forces \n     should be stationed are a healthy part of presidential \n     contests. Ms. Rice's proposal is consistent with the Bush \n     campaign's view that extended peacekeeping missions degrade \n     the combat readiness of American military forces and that the \n     Pentagon should concentrate its resources on preparing for \n     crises where Washington alone has the might to deter, and, if \n     necessary, combat aggression, whether in the Persian Gulf, \n     the Korean Peninsula or a future military conflict in Europe.\n       But on the specifics of America's role in the Balkans, Ms. \n     Rice's proposal is misguided for several reasons. The job of \n     securing peace in Bosnia and Kosovo is far from complete. The \n     American share of the peacekeeping has already been \n     substantially reduced. Finally, the NATO alliance has been \n     built on a concept of shared risk that is inconsistent with a \n     total withdrawal of American ground forces from Balkan \n     peacekeeping.\n       It is true that military conditions in Bosnia are now more \n     stable than they were when NATO troops were first introduced \n     five years ago and that the situation in Kosovo has also \n     improved in the year since Serbian forces withdrew. But in \n     neither place is there yet enough security for displaced \n     refugees to return to their homes or for elections to take \n     place without the risk of physical intimidation. The \n     departure of Slobodan Milosevic from Yugoslavia's presidency \n     creates new opportunities for easing tensions in both Bosnia \n     and Kosovo, provided local troublemakers can be kept in \n     check. That will require a continued strong NATO presence.\n       The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has done a good job \n     of insisting that America's share of peacekeeping \n     responsibilities be steadily reduced. There are now only \n     11,400 American troops in the Balkans, about one-fifth of the \n     NATO total. When NATO first went into Bosnia, about a third \n     of its 60,000 troops were Americans. Balkan peacekeeping \n     costs account for just over 1 percent of the Pentagon's $280 \n     billion budget, leaving more than enough for military needs \n     elsewhere.\n       Asking Europe to accept a total withdrawal of American \n     ground forces from the Balkans needlessly challenges some of \n     the basic assumptions of the Western military alliance. NATO \n     was formed not just to counter Soviet bloc military threats. \n     It was also designed to eliminate some of the historic \n     military rivalries in Europe that led to two world wars. NATO \n     provides a framework for European and American forces to \n     cooperate in joint operations under a single overall \n     commander--traditionally an American. Europe cannot be \n     expected to accept an alliance in which Washington exercises \n     political and military leadership but does not subject its \n     own forces to any of the risks of ground operations. The Bush \n     campaign is right when it insists that the United States must \n     be selective in where it stations ground forces. But the \n     Balkans is not the place to cut back.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the USA Today, Oct. 24, 2000]\n\n             Bush Takes Unwise Step Away From Peacekeeping\n\n\n                    today's debate: u.s. and europe\n\n        our view: for the u.s. to lead nato, it must participate\n\n       Most Americans want to see their country as a world leader, \n     but they are unenthusiastic about the human and financial \n     costs of doing what may be necessary to lead. So it's no \n     surprise that both presidential candidates have treaded \n     carefully on defining America's future role in peacekeeping.\n       But during the weekend, the Bush campaign refined its \n     position in a way that's likely to win votes while weakening \n     the United States' leadership role in Europe.\n       In a proposal that plays into the public's ambivalence, \n     George W. Bush's senior national security aide, Condoleezza \n     Rice, suggested that a Bush administration would tell NATO \n     that Europeans should take over peacekeeping in the Balkans. \n     The U.S. would focus instead on potential trouble spots where \n     it alone can act, she said, such as the Persian Gulf and the \n     Taiwan Straits.\n       Her remarks were an effort to flesh out Bush's repeated \n     theme that U.S. forces should focus on the ability to fight \n     wars, not what he derides as ``nation building.'' It's \n     appealing logic to a country that has never been enthusiastic \n     about long-term foreign commitments. But it is rooted in the \n     dubious assumption that the United States can effectively \n     lead NATO, the West's primary defense alliance, without being \n     a full player.\n       Both the recent history of the Balkans and the longer-term \n     history of Europe say that is shortsighted.\n\n[[Page S10956]]\n\n       The tragedy of post-Cold War Europe in the '90s was that \n     our allies were unable to deal with chaos, ``ethnic \n     cleansing'' and the serious threat of an expanding war on \n     their doorstep until the United States belatedly got \n     involved. In both Bosnia and Kosovo, European governments \n     squabbled among themselves until the United States finally \n     agreed to share some of the risk on the ground. The ethnic \n     cleansing was curtailed without a single U.S. casualty.\n       Today, Americans comprise less than 20% of the Bosnia-\n     Kosovo peacekeeping force, a contribution former NATO \n     commander Wesley Clark calls the bare minimum if the United \n     States wants to have any influence on NATO actions there. If \n     the United States were to pull out, the record suggest it \n     would be naive to expect Europe to respond meaningfully to \n     the next Bosnia or Kosovo.\n       The deeper risk extends beyond the Balkans to the overall \n     U.S. role in NATO. Since NATO's formation in the wake of \n     World War II, it has served to quiet the continent's \n     longstanding rivalries. Weakening U.S. leadership would set \n     off a counterproductive race to fill the gap, with \n     unfavorable consequences for U.S. interests.\n       A core part of the Bush argument is that the armed forces \n     are too stretched to manage peacekeeping and prepare for war \n     effectively. But the U.S. deployment to the Balkans is less \n     than 10% of our military in Europe, and the cost is scarcely \n     1% of the Pentagon budget. Whatever shortcomings there may be \n     in defense readiness or troop morale, blaming them on Balkans \n     peacekeeping defies logic.\n       Vice President Gore, who played a central role in the \n     Clinton administration's policy in the Balkans, accused Bush \n     of a ``lack of judgment and a complete misunderstanding of \n     history.''\n       Expecting Europe to act decisively on its own or to accept \n     U.S. leadership without at least token U.S. involvement in \n     the field is sadly unrealistic.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to read a little bit from those editorials \nwhen I can find my glasses, which is an important thing. Here they are. \nWhen I started out in politics, I did not need these reading glasses. \nSo that shows you how long I have been around.\n  This is from the Washington Post:\n\n       The Balkans are at peace; democracy is sprouting almost \n     everywhere; even the apparently invulnerable Slobodan \n     Milosevic has been knocked from his perch. Of course, many \n     problems remain, the gains are fragile and, yes, U.S. troops \n     will be needed for some time. But surely helping democracy \n     take root throughout Europe is worth the modest price of that \n     modest deployment [of peacekeeping troops].\n\n  The New York Times says that George Bush's adviser's proposal is \nmisguided. That is the proposal to say that we will no longer \nparticipate in peacekeeping.\n\n       The job of securing peace in Bosnia and Kosovo is far from \n     complete. The American share of the peacekeeping has already \n     been substantially reduced. Finally, the NATO alliance has \n     been built on a concept of shared risk that is inconsistent \n     with a total withdrawal of American ground forces from Balkan \n     peacekeeping.\n\n  Now, we know that America's share, they say, of peacekeeping \nresponsibilities is steadily reducing.\n\n       There are now only 11,400 American troops in the Balkans, \n     about one-fifth of the NATO total. When NATO first went into \n     Bosnia, about a third of its 60,000 troops were Americans. \n     Balkan peacekeeping costs [are only] 1 percent of the \n     Pentagon's . . . budget. . . .\n       Asking Europe to accept a total withdrawal of American \n     ground forces from the Balkans needlessly challenges some of \n     the basic assumptions of [our] western military alliance.\n\n  Our Western military alliance has served us well. Why would we now--\nwhen we see the tinderbox over in the Middle East--come up with a plan \nthat would shake up our allies, that would worry our friends? This is \nthe time not to make those kinds of proposals. And those proposals \nthemselves are dangerous for the world.\n  I will also quote from USA Today. So you are seeing a whole number of \nnewspapers coming out against this Bush plan.\n  They say:\n\n       The deeper risk extends beyond the Balkans to the overall \n     U.S. role in NATO. Since NATO's formation in the wake of \n     World War II, it has served to quiet the continent's \n     longstanding rivalries. Weakening U.S. leadership would set \n     off a counterproductive race to fill the gap, with \n     unfavorable consequences for U.S. interests.\n\n  I have to believe this kind of a policy--either it was not thought \nout or it is a radical departure from what has worked for us not only \nthrough the cold war but after the cold war. Governor Bush says we \ncan't do all this alone. And I agree with him; we can't do all this \nalone. But the bizarre thing is, he is pulling us out of a situation--\nor would want to, if he were President--where we are only about 20 \npercent of the force. This is an example of the way we ought to \nintegrate all of the responsibilities of the various allies. I find it \namazing that this policy would come up at this time when we have the \nworld in such a precarious position as we look at what is happening in \nthe Middle East.\n  So in any event, in closing, I will make these points in two areas: \neducation and foreign policy.\n\n  I think there are some interesting new developments the American \npeople ought to look at. One, we have a candidate for President, who is \nthe Governor of Texas, who is using Texas as the model. We just learned \nthat Texas is almost dead last as a place people would want to raise \ntheir children. That is an unbiased report that came out. We have a \nRand study, which is a study that Bush himself has cited, which says \nthese kids in Texas are simply not making it.\n  We now have this foreign policy fiasco. While the Republicans want to \nlook at what went on in 1995 between Russia and America, we now realize \nthat what we ought to be looking at is this latest proposal by Governor \nBush, and to try to debunk it, that would say we ought to pull our \npeacekeeping troops out, that America should not even have a role in \npeacekeeping. It is rattling our NATO allies.\n  Again, NATO has served us well. Why? Because we all cooperate and we \nwork together and we come up with plans together. And to have this, if \nyou will, ``Molotov cocktail'' from George Bush just thrown out--\nunprovoked--to shake up our NATO allies, and say, ``We are not going to \ndo peacekeeping; we are going to do fighting,'' I say to this Senate \nthat I do not like that division of responsibilities, where America \ndoes all the fighting and our NATO allies do the peacekeeping.\n  I do not like shaking up our allies at this time. I think it shows a \ncertain recklessness, a certain lack of experience, a certain \nmisunderstanding of history of what it has been like for us to build \nthese alliances. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I am \nvery concerned by this proposal. I believe it will have a very negative \nimpact.\n\n  I am someone who has fought long and hard for burdensharing. I have \noffered a number of amendments in the House and the Senate asserting \nthat it is important our allies carry their fair share. I will go on \nrecord as saying 80 percent of the troops in the Balkans is a fair \nshare; 80 percent of our commitment in the Balkans is being paid by the \nEuropeans, 20 percent by the Americans. That is good. That is a fair \nshare. That is working.\n  To throw this kind of a proposal out there at this time when the \nMiddle East is in crisis, when we need our allies at the table, when we \nneed good relationships with our friends, shows a certain \nirresponsibility and riskiness upon which the American people are not \ngoing to look very kindly. And certainly, while the Foreign Relations \nCommittee is beating up on the Vice President 2 weeks before an \nelection about Russia-United States relations; our problem today isn't \nRussia-United States relations; our problem today is trying to do the \nbest we can with our allies in the world to end some of these tragedies \ngoing on in the Middle East, to work for a new Yugoslavia that is \ndemocratic, to make sure we build on Madeleine Albright's seeming \nsuccess in North Korea where, by the way, we have 37,000 troops. Maybe \nmy friend from Illinois knows this. I did not hear any comments about \npulling out troops from the Koreas, but maybe that is his next \nproposal, where we have kept the peace and stability.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from California will yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. She has raised an important point. Most people would \nagree that the Governor of Texas has limited personal exposure and \nexperience when it comes to foreign policy issues. That does not mean \nhe is disqualified. There have been Presidents who have been Governors. \nBut we have to judge him on what he has said.\n  His suggestion of the withdrawal of troops in some parts of the world \nraises serious questions as to whether or not he has considered the \nconsequences. The United States made a commitment, for example, in \nEurope after World War II to stop the spread of communism. It cost the \nAmerican people\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\ntrillions of dollars. It paid off: 250 years later, communism is \nvirtually wiped off the map and these countries, the Balkans and \neastern European countries, now enjoy democracy and freedom.\n  There was only one country in the world that could do that, and that \nwas the United States. We have military skill, the great men and women \nin uniform, and we have a reputation of involving ourselves in foreign \npolicy--not to come away with any property or treasure; we are there to \ntry to promote the ideals and values of our country.\n  So when Governor Bush suggests withdrawing troops in some parts of \nthe world, you have to wonder, has he really reflected on this? Has he \ntaken the time to try to measure why he would change policies that even \nhis father supported, perhaps President Reagan supported, and now he \nwants to change these policies and approaches?\n  This is an important element. Thank goodness we live in a world that \nis generally at peace, but it is a dangerous world that at any moment \ncan flare up. We need leadership in the White House that understands \nthe consequences of its actions.\n  I salute the Senator from California. What we are seeing happen today \nin North Korea--where they are finally talking to us; they are finally \nagreeing to perhaps end the missile testing--is a very positive \ndevelopment. It is only because the United States made a commitment in \nSouth Korea with the lives of our service men and women and then kept \ntroops there to protect it that we have reached that point today.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be given 5 minutes \nfollowing the completion of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I did not hear the request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that Senator Durbin be given 5 minutes when I \nconclude my time.\n  Mr. KYL. I object, Mr. President, on the ground that I was going to \nspeak at a quarter till.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I make an inquiry of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to be fair to my colleagues. It was my \nunderstanding that the Democratic side would have the first 25 minutes \nin morning business and then the Republican side. But in the interest \nof my colleagues who have given up their own time, I am happy to work \nout an arrangement with them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the objection over adding 5 minutes or \ntaking the 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me withdraw the objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was just making sure that Senator Durbin would be \nrecognized for the next 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I withdraw my objection. I did not \nunderstand the Senator's request. My understanding was that the \nminority time would have expired about now. I understand that is not \nthe case. Therefore, I do not object to the request of the Senator from \nCalifornia to have Senator Durbin speak next. I was hoping to be able \nto speak before noon, but that may not be possible.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask for clarification? How much time does the \nDemocratic side have remaining in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has a little over 24 \nminutes. The Republican side has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Chair make an inquiry of my two Republican \ncolleagues as to how long they would like to speak.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, if I could clarify, it is no big deal. \nWhat we had was the morning business time divided between Republicans \nand Democrats. The leader's time took some of that, so we didn't have \nenough. We ought to share equally what remains. Whatever that division \nis, it ought to be divided between the two of us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I may restate my unanimous consent request, \nunderstanding that we have 24 minutes remaining, I would appreciate it \nif Senator Durbin could follow my remarks so we have some train of \nthought. Then we can take the next 10 minutes from the Republican time, \nif they would like to use it. I don't think Senator Durbin has a \nproblem; I don't have a problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. If we would determine exactly the time that is remaining and \nthen maybe add to that my opportunity to speak after Senator Durbin.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to.\n  Mr. KYL. If we could suspend one moment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I ask if we could suspend the request \nfor one moment. Senator Thomas is technically in control of the time on \nour side. He should be the one who understands this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When the Senator from California finishes, the \nSenator from Illinois will speak for 5 minutes, followed by the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Out of the 10 minutes I originally had, how much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 60 seconds to recap what I \nsaid before the time goes to Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have taken longer deciding who is going to talk than \nwe have on what we really want to say. I will sum up my points today.\n  I think two issues are coming to the floor in this election. \nEducation is one of them. We have the Governor of Texas saying his kids \nin Texas are doing great. We learned today that was based on a State \ntest, not a national test. So that is something we have to look at. We \nhave a new study showing that Texas is one of the worst places to raise \na child. That is from another objective, nonpartisan study.\n  Now we have a hearing going on in Foreign Relations beating up on \nVice President Gore for something that happened in 1995, when not one \nRepublican ever complained about it until 2 weeks before the election, \nwhen Governor Bush has now made a proposal that in essence threw a bomb \ninto NATO--figuratively, not literally--and our NATO allies are worried \nand concerned that suddenly we have on the table a proposal--not very \nwell thought out, in my view--that would drastically change NATO and \nwould say, in essence, that the United States will be the fighters, \nsomeone else will be the peacekeepers.\n  I think it is more dangerous for our people to take that on alone. It \nis a big worry I have. It shows in this sensitive time why we need \nproven, effective, experienced leadership in the White House. We don't \nwant to have someone coming in and throwing this kind of proposal into \nNATO. We need our NATO allies now more than ever. We have great \nopportunities for peace in the world. We are not going to make them \ncome true if we dissect NATO and destroy it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the sake of my colleagues on the \nfloor, Senator Thomas and others, it is my understanding that I am to \nspeak for 10 minutes, and then the Republican side will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was made for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Five minutes, fine. I will confine my remarks to 5 \nminutes in the interest of my patient colleagues. After Senator Thomas \nand Senator Kyl, I would like to reclaim the Democratic time under \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10957-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10957-S10958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MAKING TOUGH CHOICES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 2 weeks the American people are going \nto face one of the toughest choices they have had perhaps in modern \nmemory.\n  This Presidential race is not just a choice between two individuals \nand whether, frankly, one has a better image on television, or more \nexperience, or a better speaking voice. It comes down to basic \nquestions of values envisioned for this country. There\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\nare two contrasting views to be chosen. I can recall 4 years ago coming \nto the Senate when the Republicans all lined up and said that our \neconomy was in such terrible shape, and the Federal budget was in such \nbad shape, we would have to amend the Constitution with a balanced \nbudget amendment because of our deficits. They were so desperate they \nwanted to give the power to the Federal courts to stop Congress from \nspending.\n  Four years later, look at the difference. We are not talking about \ndeficits; we are talking about how to spend the surplus, and we are \ntalking about an economy which, for 8 years, has been cooking, creating \n22 million new jobs. There is more home ownership than at any time in \nour history. Welfare rolls are coming down and crime rates are coming \ndown. Opportunities for businesses, for minorities, for women are \nunparalleled in our history. When you look at advanced placement \ncourses in schools, we have more Hispanics and African Americans \nenrolling in them than ever before in our history.\n  America is moving forward, and I am glad to say we have been part of \nit in Congress. We can't take credit for it anymore than the President \ncan or Alan Greenspan can. It is a joint effort of families and \nbusinesses across America. But make no mistake, the right policy in \nWashington set the stage for this to happen. When President Clinton \nsaid, ``I am going to make a meaningful effort to reduce the national \ndeficits,'' frankly, we didn't get a single Republican vote to support \nus. Not one. Vice President Gore came to the floor of the Senate and \ncast the tie-breaking vote, and we started on a path in 1993 that led \nto where we are today. There are some people who think this is \nautomatic in America, that prosperity is a matter of standing aside and \nwatching it happen.\n  I know better. I have been in the Congress long enough to know that \nthe wrong policies in the White House can jeopardize economic \nprosperity. Do you remember the early days of the Reagan years when \nthey came up with an idea called ``supply side economics'' and the \nappropriately named ``Laffer curve''? We followed that crazy notion \nlong enough to find ourselves deep in red ink, with the biggest \ndeficits in history, the largest national debt and America on the \nropes. Thank goodness we have broken away from that.\n  Should we experiment again? George W. Bush suggests he wants a $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut going primarily to wealthy people in America. Can we \nrun that risk? The highest 1 percent of wage earners who will see over \n40 percent of the George W. Bush tax cut are people who are making more \nthan $300,000 a year. I can't understand why a person who has an income \nof $25,000 a month needs a $2,000 a month tax cut. But that is what \nGovernor Bush has proposed. He says it is only fair and right; these \nare taxpayers, too. Think of Bill Gates. He has been very successful \nwith Microsoft. He is worth billions of dollars. According to George W. \nBush, he needs a tax cut. I don't think so.\n  George W. Bush should take into consideration that the net worth of \nBill Gates is greater than the combined net worth of 106 million \nAmericans. He doesn't need our help. The people who need our help, \nfrankly, are families struggling to pay for college expenses. We on the \nDemocratic side believe that we need tax cuts targeted to help families \nin a real way so they can deduct college tuition and fees up to $12,000 \na year to help kids get through college and have a better life.\n\n  We also believe we ought to help families who are going to work \ntrying to find something to do with their children. Day care is an \nimportant issue for so many families. We want to increase the tax \ncredit for day care and also give a tax credit for stay-at-home moms \nwho are willing to make the economic sacrifice for their children.\n  Finally, when it comes to long-term care, so many of us have seen \naging parents and grandparents who need a helping hand. I have seen \nfamilies making extra sacrifices for those parents. Our tax program \nwould give a targeted tax cut to help those families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we now have more reports of specific credible \nevidence of planned attacks against the United States--terrorism that \nmust be prevented. We have not done everything we can do to prevent \nterrorism. According to a Commission that has reported to the Congress, \nthere is more to be done. I have incorporated that Commission's \nrecommendations into a bill. We are trying to get the bill passed. It \nruns into objections from the other side. Today, I am going to lay it \nout because there isn't much time left.\n  Earlier this month, I introduced the Counterterrorism Act of 2000, \ncosponsored by my friend and colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein. This \nshould have bipartisan support. As the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government \nInformation, I have held hearings, along with Senator Feinstein, on \nsteps that would better prepare this country to thwart and defend \nagainst and prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. Our legislation \nwill do that by capturing many of the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Terrorism.\n  The Commission was mandated by the Congress, and it released its \nreport earlier this year. It is bipartisan, led by Ambassador Paul \nBremer and Maurice Sonnenberg. They have a long record--both of them--\nof experience and expertise in this matter. The Commission, with 10 \nmembers in all, came to unanimous conclusions on the gaps in America's \ncounterterrorism efforts and made extensive recommendations in their \nreport.\n  In addition to Ambassador Bremer, who formerly served as Ambassador-\nat-Large for Counterterrorism and Mr. Sonnenberg, who serves on the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the Commission \nincluded eight other outstanding experts in the field: former CIA \nDirector, James Woolsey; former Assistant Director-in-Charge of the \nFBI's National Security Division, John Lewis; former Congresswoman Jane \nHarman, who served on the House Armed Services and Intelligence \nCommittees; former Under Secretary of Defense, Fred Ikle; former \nCommander-in-Chief of U.S. Special Operations Command, Gen. Wayne \nDowning; Director of National Security Studies at the Council on \nForeign Relations, Richard Betts; former foreign policy adviser to the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Gardner Peckham; Harvard \nprofessor Juliette Kayyem, who formerly served as legal advisor to the \nU.S. Attorney General.\n  In June, the members of this Commission testified before the \nIntelligence Committee, of which I am a member, with their findings and \nrecommendations. A week later, the Commission's report was the subject \nof a Foreign Relations Committee hearing. At the end of June, Senator \nFeinstein and I invited the Commissioners to testify at a hearing of \nthe Judiciary subcommittee which I chair. The purpose of our hearing \nwas to explore the findings of the Commission and clarify some \nrecommendations that have been mischaracterized. So the Senate thought \nthat this Commission report was important enough to hold three specific \nhearings on its findings and recommendations.\n  Senator Feinstein and I then decided to take action on the \nrecommendations by drafting the Counterterrorism Act of 2000. We \nbelieve this is an important first step in addressing shortfalls in \nAmerica's fight against the growing threat of terrorism.\n  In summary, this is what the bill would do:\n  First, it expresses the sense of Congress that the United States \nGovernment should take immediate actions to\n\n[[Page S10959]]\n\ninvestigate the unprovoked attack on the U.S.S. Cole, should ensure \nthat the perpetrators of this cowardly act are brought to justice.\n\n  It directs the President to establish a joint task force to develop a \nbroad approach toward discouraging the fundraising of international \nterrorists.\n  It directs the Director of the CIA to report to Congress with a \nresponse to the Commission's findings regarding guidelines for \nrecruitment of terrorist informants and whether those guidelines \ninhibit the recruitment of such informants.\n  In effect, what the Commission said is if you are going to try to \ninfiltrate terrorist organizations, you are probably dealing with \nnefarious characters. They are not Boy Scouts. And you can't demand of \nthem the same clean standards that we would in trying to recruit \ninformants against other governments. When you are dealing with \nterrorist organizations, you are dealing with terrorists.\n  The bill also directs the Attorney General to conduct a review of the \nlegal authority of various agencies, including the Defense Department, \nto respond to catastrophic terrorist attacks, and it requires that a \nreport be provided to the Congress.\n  It directs the President to establish a long-term research and \ndevelopment program relating to technology to prevent, preempt, \ninterdict, and respond to catastrophic terrorist attack.\n  It directs the FBI Director to report to Congress on the feasibility \nof creating an intelligence reporting function within the Bureau to \nassist in disseminating information collected by the Bureau on \ninternational terrorism and other national security matters.\n  It directs the President to report to Congress on legal authorities \nthat govern the sharing of criminal wiretap information between law \nenforcement agencies and the intelligence community. The Commission \nnoted there is currently a great deal of confusion in this area. We \nhave to get that squared away so the agencies know how they can share \ninformation with each other.\n  The bill would direct the Attorney General to report to Congress the \nrecommendations on how to improve controls on biological pathogens and \nthe equipment necessary to produce biological weapons. It directs the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress with \nrecommendations for improving security and physical protection of \nbiological pathogens at research laboratories and other facilities.\n  It authorizes the full reimbursement for professional liability \ninsurance for law enforcement or intelligence officers performing \ncounterterrorism duties.\n  And finally, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that Syria \nshould remain on the list of states that sponsor terrorism, as should \nIran, until they meet certain conditions.\n  I recently received a letter from Ambassador Bremer and Mr. \nSonnenberg, expressing very strong support for the Kyl-Feinstein \nlegislation. I also received letters from the American Israeli Public \nAffairs Committee, the Zionist Organization of America, and the Anti-\nDefamation League applauding the bill. In addition, the American Jewish \nCongress released a statement in support of the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of my remarks these \ndocuments be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. The text of the Counterterrorism Act 2000 should be familiar \nto Members because we tried to move it as an amendment to the \nintelligence authorization bill. We were open to comments by Senators \nand we made several modifications to the language in order to suit \nSenators and the Department of Justice. We agreed in the end to \nwithdraw the bill at that point so the intelligence bill could move \nforward but indicated our desire then to move the bill as a separate \nbill, which is now what we are doing.\n  Among the Senators who have talked to us is Senator Leahy. We have \ntried to address his concerns with respect to the bill. Originally his \nstaff advised that if the Justice Department didn't object to the bill, \nSenator Leahy would consent to its passage. The Justice Department has \ncleared the bill. After that, Senator Leahy's office advised us they \ndesired to have 10 other changes considered and sent another list of 4 \nother changes. Senator Feinstein and I agreed to make changes to the \nbill to accommodate 12 of those 14 requests of Senator Leahy. Yet he \nstill remains in opposition. Under the rules of the Senate prevailing \nat this time, any Senator can object to the consideration of the \nlegislation and thus block it, which Senator Leahy, I understand, has \ndone.\n  This morning my office received some additional concerns purportedly \ncoming from Senator Leahy. I find them, frankly, not to rise to the \nlevel that should take the Senate's time. For example, he objects to a \nprovision, or his staff objects to a provision, that requires the \nPresident to report to Congress on the Commission's recommendations \nabout sharing law enforcement information with intelligence agencies on \nthe grounds that this would help set ``a dangerous precedent \nfor blurring the line between law enforcement and intelligence \nactivities.'' A report to Congress on legal authorities on the state of \nthe law sets no dangerous precedent. There are similar types of \nconcerns expressed.\n\n  We have to get serious about this. At the very moment that our forces \nare on a heightened state of alert, at the very moment our embassies \nare telling people not to travel to certain countries because of \nterrorist threats against Americans, the Congress has before it a bill \nembodying the recommendations of the Terrorism Commission, and we are \nnot acting on it because, as far as I know, one Member of this body is \nnot willing to allow it to move forward.\n  I plead with him, I plead with other Members, if there are concerns, \nlet's talk about them. But the time is short. Perfection cannot be the \nenemy of the good considering the nature of the challenge that we face \nwith terrorists around the world and the need to do more about it. This \nisn't simply something that has been pulled out of thin air to try to \ndeal with this problem. We have embodied most of the recommendations of \nthe Terrorism Commission specifically mandated by Congress to give us \nrecommendations about what else we need to be doing in this \nlegislation.\n  I say to Senator Leahy and any others, time is short. We need to \nvisit. We need to talk about these things. We need to clear them away \nso we can pass this legislation. After the Senate acts, the House will \nneed to act. They are expected to act with alacrity. For example, \nRepresentative Gilman, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and \nRepresentative Goss, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and I \nunderstand the leadership is prepared, if we can pass this bill, to \ntake it up very quickly. However, I don't know how many days or hours \nare left in this session.\n  I think it would be a travesty, given the events of the past month, \ngiven the threats that currently have been made against the United \nStates, for the Congress to ignore the recommendations of the very \nCommission that we asked to give us advice, to ignore the \nrecommendations of that Commission and conclude this Congress without \nacting to pass those recommendations to take additional steps to deal \nwith the terrorist threat.\n  Let's leave politics aside. This is a bipartisan effort of Senator \nFeinstein and myself. It has broad support on both sides of the aisle. \nI encourage my colleagues to please come forth if they have additional \nconcerns so we can get this done.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 22, 2000.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: In our capacities as former Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism, we \n     have been asked to comment on the proposed legislation which \n     we understand you intend to introduce to the 106th Congress \n     (called the ``Counterterrorism Act of 2000'').\n       As you know, our bipartisan Commission concluded that the \n     threat to Americans from terrorism is changing and becoming \n     more serious. To meet this threat, the Commission made a \n     number of important recommendations to the President and \n     Congress in its final report of June 5, 2000.\n       We have reviewed the draft bill and wish to commend you and \n     your colleagues for the job of translating into law a number \n     of the Commission's most important recommendations. We are \n     particularly pleased to see the bill address issues such as \n     state sponsorship of terrorism, better collection and \n     dissemination of terrorist intelligence, a broader strategy \n     for disrupting terrorist fund-raising, and\n\n[[Page S10960]]\n\n     efforts to prevent or deal with catastrophic terrorism in the \n     United States.\n       We hope that this important bill will become law and that \n     Congress and the Executive branch will do everything possible \n     to implement it expeditiously.\n           Respectfully,\n     L.

Jon L. Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: On behalf of AIPAC, we are writing to \n     express our appreciation for your introduction of the \n     Counterterrorism Act of 2000. This legislation takes a number \n     of important steps to address the growing problem of \n     terrorism in our country and abroad.\n       This bipartisan measure adopts many of the key \n     recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorism, \n     particularly with respect to long-term research and \n     development efforts and methods of improving controls over \n     biological pathogens. We believe this legislation will \n     encourage cooperation among states like the United States and \n     Israel that have worked so closely in fighting the scourge of \n     terrorism. Of course, we also endorse the legislation's \n     intent that Iran and Syria should remain on the list of \n     states that sponsor terrorism until they cease their support \n     for terrorist actions.\n       Thank you again for your leadership, and please let us know \n     if we can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Howard Kohr,\n       Executive Director.\n     Marvin Feuer,\n       Director of Defense & Strategic Issues.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Zionist Organization\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                   New York, NY, October 11, 2000.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: On behalf of the Zionist Organization of \n     America (ZOA), which is the oldest and one of the largest \n     Zionist organizations in the United States, I am writing to \n     express the ZOA's enthusiastic support for S. 2507, the \n     Counterterrorism Act of 2000.\n       This vital legislation will ensure that our country takes \n     swift and effective action to impede the ability of terrorist \n     groups to receive funding, acquire technology for use as \n     weapons, and recruit new members. We have all seen, in recent \n     years, the kind of devastation that terrorist groups can \n     wreak. Our government must do everything possible to combat \n     terrorist groups--and S. 2507 will mandate specific and \n     important steps that will play a crucial role in the fight \n     against terrorism.\n       We are also pleased to note that the S. 2507 urges that \n     Syria be kept on the U.S. list of terror-sponsoring states \n     until it takes concrete anti-terror steps, such as shutting \n     down terrorist training camps and prohibiting the transfer of \n     weapons to terrorists through Syrian-controlled territory. \n     The legislation also appropriately urges that Iran be kept on \n     the list of terror-sponsors until there is concrete, \n     indisputable evidence that Iran has changed its ways and \n     forsaken terrorism. In the absence of such actions, \n     governments such as those in Syria and Iran must be treated \n     as the rogue regimes which they are.\n       With gratitude for your leadership role in this effort,\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Morton A.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We welcome your leadership in \n     introducing legislation to codify several important proposals \n     of the bipartisan National Commission on Terrorism. As an \n     organization committed to monitoring hate groups while \n     safeguarding civil liberties, we support the bill's tough, \n     constitutional approach to investigating and prosecuting \n     terrorist crimes.\n       The bill's mechanism for allowing classified evidence to be \n     used within a sound due process a framework represents the \n     kind of balanced approach which would prevent the improper \n     treatment of individuals, while allowing the government to \n     protect sources. The legislation would also implement useful \n     steps to prevent the US from being used as a fundraising base \n     for terrorism.\n       It is well established that the government has the \n     constitutional right--and the duty--to keep our nation from \n     being used as a base for terrorist activity. The legislation \n     you have crafted makes vital improvements in our nation's \n     capability to investigate, deter, and prevent terrorism.\n           Sincerely,\n     Howard P. Berkowitz,\n       National Chairman.\n     Abraham H. Foxman,\n       National Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\nAJCongress Welcomes Legislation Responding to Threat of Biological and \n  Chemical Attacks by Terrorists; Calls Measure `A Beginning Plan' to \n                          Deal With the Danger\n\n       American Jewish Congress Executive Director Phil Baum \n     issued the following statement today following the decision \n     by Senators Jon Kyl and Dianne Feinstein to introduce \n     legislation responding to the recent report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorism:\n       The danger not only to this country but to all of civil \n     society from the threat of biological and chemical weapons is \n     becoming ever more real and apparent. For some time now, \n     commentators have been warning of the growing risk of \n     terrorist attacks with these weapons unless effective counter \n     measures are quickly put in place.\n       Those most expert and familiar with these matters warn that \n     the question is not whether there will be an attack, but \n     when.\n       A sobering report released recently by the National \n     Commission on Terrorism has documented these concerns and has \n     begun the process of alerting Americans to the danger we face \n     and the steps that can be taken to meet that threat.\n       Until now, little has been done concretely to implement the \n     Commission's report. Fortunately, there are now plans in the \n     Senate to attach as an amendment to the fiscal 2001 \n     Intelligence Authorization Act a measure which is attempting \n     to respond to this challenge. Introduced by Senators Jon Kyl \n     (R-Ariz) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif), the legislation lays \n     out at least a beginning plan for dealing with these \n     problems.\n       The bill for the first time would impose rigorous \n     restrictions on procedures used in research labs handling \n     pathogens; calls for presidential leadership in the \n     development of new technologies to counter terrorist attacks; \n     limits the capacity of terrorist groups to raise funds in \n     this country--which is often done under the guise of raising \n     funds for social programs; and mandates the CIA and the FBI \n     to report on the continuing effectiveness of anti-terrorist \n     measures currently in place.\n       One provision of the bill--authorizing the FBI to share \n     foreign intelligence information obtained from domestic \n     wiretaps with the CIA and other intelligence agencies--has \n     quite properly met with criticism has consequently has been \n     dropped by Senator Kyl. We are convinced that an effective \n     fight against the new terrorist threat can be waged without \n     violating Constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties--\n     protections which must remain our first priority.\n       As the American people begin to focus on the dangers of \n     chemical and biological terrorism, two equally unacceptable \n     dangers present themselves: that we remain indifferent to the \n     threat, or that we overreact, at the expense of our civil \n     liberties. Neither is acceptable. A measured response is \n     necessary, and the Kyl-Feinstein bill begins that process.\n       The legislation presents the Senate with the opportunity to \n     move the American people off dead center and to address the \n     danger in a composed and rational manner, without endangering \n     American freedoms or our country's sense of confidence in its \n     future. The new legislation rests on the premise that the \n     future can be best assured by a realistic address to the \n     dangers we confront.\n       New technologies have been a blessing for this generation. \n     In the hands of terrorists, they become a curse for all \n     generations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join my colleague from Arizona in \nrequesting the business of the Senate be allowed to go forward. We have \nseen many filibusters all year. That is what has gotten us into this \nsituation where we are past October 1 and still working on the budget.\n  I think we ought to be doing the business of the Senate. My \npredecessor, Alan Simpson, who had this seat in the Senate, said \nseveral times, an accusation that isn't answered is an accusation \naccepted. There are a couple of things I have to clear up from this \nmorning.\n  First, we did all this work on a balanced budget without the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment. Yes, we did. But the debate on the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment is what made the people of \nAmerica rise up and tell every single one of their representatives that \nthey wanted the budget of this country balanced. And it was the heat \nthe people of this country put on the Congress that led Members to \nbalance the budget. That wouldn't have happened without the debate on \nthe balanced budget.\n  That is the reason we have what is being referred to as a ``surplus'' \ntoday. It isn't a surplus. It is tax overcharge. We have collected more \nfrom the people than we had planned to spend. We ought to refer to it \nas that.\n\n[[Page S10961]]\n\n  I could not begin to cover all of the accusations that were \nmisaccusations. Another real important one I have to cover is the \nReaganomics attack. Yes, giving the money back to the people, as Reagan \nsuggested, resulted in a 30-percent increase in revenue to this \ncountry. So why do we have such a big deficit? Because people spent it. \nWe cannot spend more than we take in. It is a pretty basic principle of \neconomics. Reaganomics increased revenue.\n  The other side, who was in control of the Congress at that time, \noutspent what he was able to bring in by increasing business in this \ncountry. The balanced budget amendment increased the economy of this \nNation. Everybody agrees balancing the budget has done that. If we get \nback to a position where it isn't balanced, people will lose confidence \nin the economy, and we will be back where we started, with ever-\nincreasing deficits, particularly if we dramatically increase spending \neach year.\n  I notice the Secretary of the Treasury took an unusual approach \nyesterday and got into the debate on Social Security.\n  The Social Security issue does come down to: Whom do you trust? Every \nyear that I have been here, there has been a promise that there will be \nSocial Security reform. I went to a White House conference. I have to \nsay it was one of the best planned, best organized, and best done \nconferences I have ever seen. One of the reasons was that Republicans \nand Democrats, House and Senate, were invited to be a part of it. When \nit finished, there was a special part for everybody from the House and \nSenate to participate in--again, Republicans and Democrats. We sat down \nwith the President and we agreed there needed to be Social Security \nreform and that reform had to have the fingerprint of everybody on it, \nthat it could not be used as a Social Security scare.\n  We have saved bill No. 1 for the President's Social Security reform. \nEvery year that I have been here, the President in his State of the \nUnion speech has said: The most important thing for this country is to \nsolve the Social Security problem. We saved bill No. 1 for him. We \nnever got a solution.\n  The President of the Senate, who is the Vice President of the United \nStates, has been a part of these efforts. He says he has delivered on \nall his promises. That is a promise that was made. That is a promise \nthat has not been kept. Social Security has not been reformed.\n  There has been another effort involved in this, too, and that has \nbeen a bipartisan commission--again, Republicans and Democrats sitting \ndown to talk about how to save Social Security. They came up with a \nplan. They had to have a supermajority to have that plan actually \npresented to us, and the President's nominees to that committee were \nthe ones who objected and made it one vote short of being a request \nthat could be presented to us. Again, a bipartisan solution. That \nbipartisan solution is what you are hearing Governor Bush talk about. \nIt is something that has been presented in a number of plans here in \nthe Senate, but it needs the endorsement of both Republicans and \nDemocrats, and the elimination of a veto threat at the Presidential \nlevel, to be able to solve that problem.\n  Why do we need to solve it? You have heard how far we extended it and \nhow we are getting extra money into the Social Security trust fund. The \nmoney in the Social Security trust fund is IOUs, T-bills. Now we are \nusing the Social Security surplus to pay down the private debt for the \nUnited States. Do you know what that does? That lets us spend more \nmoney. When we have private debt out there, we pay the interest on a \nregular basis. When we spend Social Security surplus to pay down the \nnational debt, the private part of the national debt, we increase the \nSocial Security debt and we just put in IOUs to pay the interest.\n  Why is that important? Sometime the debt will come due. You hear a \nlot of different numbers about when the debt comes due: 2013 is the \nmagic time when the baby boomers move into the group of recipients of \nSocial Security and start jerking out enormous amounts of money from \nSocial Security--2013. They say Social Security is secure until 2037. \nThat is until the last dime is drawn. It will not work that way. Here \nis why it will not. In 2025, the ones of us who are here--with the \nexception of maybe one or two--will not be here. There will be a \ndifferent generation that will be in the Senate and in the Congress. \nThese will be people who have paid into Social Security their whole \nlife and will realize they will not get a dime out of it.\n  Here is another little problem. When it comes appropriations time, \nall they are going to do is decide how big the check for interest is \ngoing to be, because the national debt will be so huge at that time \nthat we will not build a road, we will not do anything for the \nmilitary, we will not do anything for education--we will pay interest. \nHow excited do you think the people of this country are going to be to \njust be paying interest on a debt from the last century and to have no \nbenefit coming their way? I suggest there could be a revolution in this \ncountry, an end to Social Security. Future generations may not feel the \nsame need to take care of their parents and other elderly in the \ncountry because they themselves are not going to get any benefit. It is \nnot going to be there to take care of them. So it needs to be solved \nnow.\n  We are also talking about prescription drugs. This is a very \ncomplicated issue. There are at least six plans out there, any one of \nwhich could provide prescription drug coverage for seniors. It is \nsomething in which we are all interested. It is something that needs to \nbe done. We need to be sure that every person in this country can get \nthe prescription drugs they need, and we need to be sure every person \nin this country doesn't have to make a choice between food or their \nprescription drugs. There have been two plans proposed. They are quite \ndifferent.\n  One of the things I like to use is this chart. I think it lends a \nlittle validity to the decisions between the two principal plans. One \nis provided by Governor Bush, one is provided by Vice President Gore. \nThose are the two main ones. I have to tell you, the biggest difference \nbetween the two is that Governor Bush's plan provides for choice, your \nchoice. Vice President Gore's plan calls for a national plan. The \ndecisions will be made in Washington. You will not have the \nflexibility.\n  Since we are talking about how some of Mr. Gore's drug proposals \nwork, I suggest they lack a little sincerity and are going to make life \nmuch harder for working Americans. Here are some thoughts on the \nMedicare prescription drug plan. This is the biggest secret out there. \nMr. Gore's plan would cover 2.6 million fewer low-income Americans than \nthe plan offered by Governor Bush and introduced in the Senate by \nRepublicans. That is because Mr. Gore's plan offers low-income \nsubsidies only up to 150 percent of poverty, while Mr. Bush's plan \nwould help seniors up to 175 percent of poverty.\n  Mr. Gore's plan would not even become effective until 2002. On top of \nthat, Mr. Gore's plan would also displace the coverage that 70 percent \nof the current Medicare recipients already have. For those seniors \nwhose employer offered a retirement benefit, there is now no incentive \nfor the company to continue that coverage, leaving the senior with no \noption but the HCFA-run program. For all the stock Mr. Gore puts into \nthe agenda, and the advice of the AMA, he apparently has not been \nconcerned by their assertion that the HCFA--that is, this national \norganization that will run his prescription drug plan--is the IRS of \nthe new millennium. I, for one, do not see the sincerity in putting \nmore people on the Titanic. As my friend from Texas often says about \nputting people on programs under the care of HCFA, it would be a \ndisaster.\n  If Mr. Gore had sincere concerns about the health and welfare of \nseniors, he would focus on real solutions that stabilize the Medicare \nprogram, offer seniors comprehensive health care, and enable seniors to \nselect coverage, including prescriptions, that meets their needs and \nbudgets. That is a commitment Governor Bush has already made. Governor \nBush would provide immediate drug coverage for those seniors who right \nnow cannot afford it. He doesn't cross his fingers and take his chances \nwith HCFA. Instead, he builds on the existing drug assistance programs \nin the States.\n\n  Here are a few statistics about the immediate impact of the proposal. \nHalf of women beneficiaries who are currently without coverage would \ngain immediate coverage. Almost three-\n\n[[Page S10962]]\n\nfourths of the minority seniors currently without coverage would gain \nimmediate coverage. And the most frail of our seniors, those over 80 \nyears old, would improve their access under the Bush plan.\n  Another important part of the Bush proposal is that States will not \nbe restricted from offering low-income subsidies above 175 percent of \npoverty. Under the Gore plan, there is no option for States to pool \nfunds and ease the expense of drug coverage for even more seniors.\n  Why is this chart important? This chart was done by the Washington \nPost. People who understand newspapers in this country understand what \nthe Washington Post does will not be favorable to Governor Bush. They \nhave a tendency to be favorable to the other side. So when they do a \nchart, a person ought to pay a little bit of attention to it. This is \nfrom the article that came with the chart:\n\n       Bush details Medicare plan, September 5: Texas Governor \n     George Bush today proposed spending $198 billion to enhance \n     Medicare over the next 10 years, including covering the full \n     cost of prescription drugs for seniors with low incomes.\n       Bush's plan was modeled on a bipartisan proposal by Senator \n     John Breaux, Democrat from Louisiana, and Senator Bill Frist, \n     Republican from Tennessee.\n\n  This is the commission I was talking about.\n\n       Bush's plan proposes ``fully subsidizing people with \n     incomes less than 135 percent of the poverty level and \n     creating a sliding scale for people with slightly more money. \n     But Gore would stop the sliding scale at 150 percent of the \n     poverty level, while Bush would extend it to 175 percent.\n\n  As I mentioned, a lot of States like that flexibility. A newspaper \nthat normally would not give good reviews, gives a good review. One \nproblem is the cost over the next 10 years would be $198 billion. The \nchart they did comparing the two shows $158 billion. They were charging \nhim with $40 billion more in costs than what their chart actually \nshows.\n  I hope people will pay some attention to the comparisons. I ask \nunanimous consent that the chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 6, 2000]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Bush                                 Gore\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                PREMIUMS\n \n25 percent of health plans' monthly charge  $25 per month starting in\n                                             2002, increasing to $44 by\n                                             2008.\n \n                     COPAYMENT FOR EACH PRESCRIPTION\n \nNot spelled out.

It is my understanding the $600 has been subtracted \nfrom the $253 billion to make that cost a little bit lower. So it is a \nanother tax for a proposal that provides for Federal control as opposed \nto your control.\n  HCFA versus your decisions: Talk to your doctors about HCFA and how \nit participates and interacts with them. Talk to them about the crisis \nthat HCFA has already caused in this Nation in medical care and ask \nyourself: Do I want to give them the added burden of a prescription \ndrug plan and only give myself one option? That is what we are looking \nat here.\n  I hope you will do some comparisons and see the difference and \nconcentrate on this bipartisan solution to providing prescription \ndrugs. The one thing about the Governor from Texas with which I have \nreally been impressed has been his ability and effort to work with both \nsides in the Texas Legislature. I used to be in the Wyoming \nLegislature. I know how important it is for people to work together. It \nis a little different atmosphere than we have in Washington.\n  How did Governor Bush do that when he moved in and had a Democrat \nlegislature? He sat down with them one on one, face to face, and talked \nto them about his priorities and their priorities, and they worked \ntogether. What excites me is following the history of Presidents, they \ntend to repeat what they have done successfully before, and I am really \nexcited about that because I see a Governor coming to Washington and \nsitting down with both sides, one on one, face to face--a long process; \nthere are 535 of us, but it is doable. That is what is needed in \nWashington: more effort across the aisle, effort like the Medicare \nCommission that has provided a solution for prescription drugs that can \nbe done. I thank the Chair and yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, when I finished speaking, the Senator from \nArizona came to the floor and said it is unseemly that we would be \ndiscussing the Presidential race. The race has been discussed by \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, as it should be. There is no more \nimportant decision to be made by the American people than the choice of \nthe President of the United States, and that choice will determine what \nthis body considers for the next 4 years.\n  Frankly, we ought to reflect on what has happened with this \nRepublican-led Congress. If you take a look at the fact that we are \napproaching the Halloween holiday, in that spirit we might consider the \nfact that Congress has become ``Sleepy Hollow,'' the final resting \nplace for priorities of American families.\n  Take a look at the list of things that have been offered by the \nDemocratic side but have not been acted upon by the Republican side: A \nreal Patients' Bill of Rights. When you go to a doctor, who should make \nthe decision; a doctor or insurance company clerk? That is an easy \nchoice for me. I want the doctor to make the call. When we tried to \npass that bill in the Senate, the Republicans defeated us.\n  Prescription drug coverage under Medicare: Not one of these \nconvoluted schemes we just heard described that would somehow give \nprescription drugs to the States for 4 years, take it back, give it to \nthe insurance companies--we know how it should work. Medicare has been \non the books for 35 years. It is proven. It is universal.\n  Frankly, we think all seniors and disabled in that category should be \nable to make the choice themselves, voluntarily, whether or not they \nwant the benefit under Medicare. The Republicans do not care for \nMedicare. They called it socialized medicine when the Democrats \nproposed it and, frankly, they are still criticizing it, doing little \nto help that system.\n\n  Most Americans know how valuable Medicare has been to their families. \nWe think a prescription drug benefit under Medicare should be the law. \nThe Republicans and pharmaceutical interests have stopped us.\n  We also believe in an increase in the minimum wage. Ten million \nAmericans went to work this morning for $5.15 an hour, and they are not \njust kids in their first jobs. Over half of them are women and many of \nthem are raising children and trying to eke out a living at $5.15 an \nhour. We used to give them a periodic increase in the minimum\n\n[[Page S10963]]\n\nwage without even debate, but the Republicans now think this is \nunacceptable; that we cannot give a minimum wage increase without \nlording billions of dollars in tax breaks on businesses. For goodness' \nsake, give these people--400,000 of them in Illinois--an increase in \nthe minimum wage of at least 50 cents an hour for the next 2 years. \nThat bill has not passed, and the Republican Congress has had ample \nopportunity to address it.\n  We believe on the Democratic side we need tax cuts; use the surplus \nfor tax cuts for families for the deductibility of college education \nexpenses. That is a concern I hear from families as soon as the baby is \nborn. How are we going to pay for this kid's education? When you see \nthe cost of education going up over a 20-year period of time, from the \ntime that child was born until they will be in school--it goes up 200 \npercent, 400 percent--people ask: How can we possibly do this?\n  On the Democratic side, we want to give the families deductibility of \ntuition and fees to help them pay for college. The Republicans oppose \nit. We support it. That is the difference. When we offered it, they \nstopped us.\n  Also, we are talking about education funds to improve our Nation's \nschools, to reduce class size. This does not take a Ph.D. in education \nto understand. If you were a teacher, would you rather walk in on the \nfirst day and see a classroom with 30 kids or 15 kids? Are you more \nlikely able to help a struggling student if there are 15 children in \nthe classroom or 30? It is not rocket science. It does not take a Ph.D.\n  We on the Democratic side believe reducing class size is the first \nstep to helping kids from falling behind and helping those better \nstudents get a little more attention.\n  We also believe we ought to be supporting afterschool programs for \nstudents. Letting kids go now at 3 o'clock is just a gamble because \nvery few of them have parents at home. They do not have Ozzie and \nHarriet waiting with cookies and milk anymore. They are by themselves.\n  Some do pretty well, but a lot of them do not. We think afterschool \nprograms, supervised, so kids have a chance to maybe catch up on their \nschool subjects, maybe appreciate the arts a little more, maybe become \nbetter on a computer, or even just play some basketball, makes some \nsense as long as there is supervision. We support afterschool programs \nand fought the Republicans every step of the way trying to put this \nvaluable money back into education.\n  We also believe in commonsense gun safety legislation. The No. 1 \nstory in 1999 in the news was the Columbine tragedy. What has America \ndone to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals? Congress \nhas done nothing. Nothing.\n  The National Rifle Association and its leader, ``Mr. Moses,'' have \ndecided we are not going to do anything to keep guns out of the hands \nof children and criminals, and that is criminal. The Republican-led \nCongress should be held accountable for that.\n  If you have an aging parent or grandparent, the Democrats believe you \nshould have a tax break to help pay for their care.\n  How many folks and families do you know worried about that aging \nparent and how their last years are going to be? They need a helping \nhand. We support it, as we support increased targeted tax cuts to help \npeople pay for day care, so kids can be left in a healthy, safe \nenvironment and families can afford to pay for it. Stay-at-home moms, \nwho sacrifice for their kids, should get a tax break, too. They are \nmaking a sacrifice that will enhance that child's future. We should \ninvest in them as well.\n  When it comes to these myriad issues I have just given you, these are \nthe issues with which working families, middle-income families, and \nsingle people as well can identify. Yet we have had no help whatsoever \non the Republican side of the aisle. The Republican Congress has failed \nto address the basic issues of education and health care, taxes that \nare reduced and targeted tax cuts and credits for families who really \nneed them, prescription drug coverage under Medicare, and a Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  We came to this Congress with all kinds of lofty goals. We are \nleaving now, unfortunately, with appropriations bills as large as the \nWashington, DC, telephone book, scarcely read, that serve too many \nspecial interests and too few families across this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we live in a period of unprecedented \nprosperity and opportunity.\n  We can go more places than ever before. We are living longer and \nhealthier lives than ever before. We are employed in jobs today that \nwere unthinkable just a few years ago.\n  Our lives have changed dramatically because of computers, the \nInternet and technology.\n  But with all the good that comes with technology, there are elements \nthat cause us concern. One such concern that has captured our attention \nis the issue of privacy.\n  As more of us use the Internet to shop and conduct business, more of \nour personal information is being spread throughout the web. That \ninformation, in many instances, is used properly and in a way that is \ngood for consumers. But as in any field, there are those who abuse the \npublic trust by using this personal information in unethical ways.\n  Because of concerns about consumer privacy, the Senate has considered \nhow we might do better at protecting consumers while not unwittingly \nturning off the Internet engine that is such a key part of the economic \nprosperity we currently enjoy.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee recently held its third hearing this \nyear on the privacy of information gathered from consumers who use the \nInternet. Since the Federal Trade Commission recommended legislation in \nthis area earlier this session, I, and I believe a substantial number \nof my colleagues, have come to agree that we must act on this issue in \nthe not-too-distant-future.\n  I have come to believe that Federal legislation is needed to protect \nconsumers. I don't think that the current voluntary privacy policies \nare sufficient. Consumers who use the Internet should be given more \ninformation about what data is being gathered about them, and they \nshould be given greater control over how this data is used.\n  I have also come to believe that Federal legislation is needed to \nprotect and improve Internet commerce which, of course, benefits \nconsumers and businesses alike. Not only will the assurance of \nadequate, enforceable privacy standards increase consumers' comfort \nwith on-line transactions, but the possibility of States acting to \nprotect consumers in the absence of a Federal law threatens to create a \npatchwork of conflicting privacy mandates that could be hard to apply \nto a medium that does not recognize State borders.\n  Though I know that I support Federal legislation regarding the on-\nline collection and use of consumer information, I confess to not \nknowing at this time exactly what should be legislated. At the last \nhearing in the Senate Commerce Committee we considered three different \nbills, and additional, and more varied, bills have been introduced in \nthe House of Representatives. I don't know which of these approaches or \ncombination of approaches will best protect consumers without making \non-\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\nline transactions overly burdensome. On-line merchants, providers of \nboth goods and services, have touted the benefits to consumers of using \nthe Internet to gather information that facilitates targeted marketing. \nThis could very well be the case but I want to know that consumers are \ninformed of and agree with these marketing practices.\n\n  Determining more specifically what consumers want from privacy \nlegislation is something that I hope we can do in the next session of \nCongress.\n  While much, through certainly not all, of the discussion in Congress \nabout privacy is focused on the issue of the on-line collection and use \nof consumer information, I think it is also important that Congress \nremain cognizant of the fact that ``privacy'' as it relates to the \nInternet is a far broader and more complex issue. For all of its \nsalutary effects, the ease with which the Internet allows for the \ncompilation and sharing of private information gathered in the physical \nworld, information about financial transactions, medical histories, \nreading habits, eating habits, sleeping habits, information about \nalmost every aspect of one's life raises legitimate concerns that \nCongress should and will continue to address.\n  The privacy of medical information, which can be intensely personal, \nis one such issue about which Congress must remain vigilant. Improved \ntechnology along with changes in health care delivery, billing systems, \ninformation gathering and genetic testing all increase the number of \npeople who have access to health records. Americans should know that \npersonally identifiable health information is private and they should \nhave control over who has access to it. At the same time our challenge \nis to find a way to balance legitimate needs for health care \ninformation--for example, medical research--and individual privacy \nrights.\n  Future Congresses will adopt additional health care reforms. We \nclearly need to improve our Nation's health care system. Although most \nAmericans are satisfied with their health care, most Americans are also \nconcerned about those in our country who have inadequate health care \nand no hope of improving their situation. I support reforms that \nimprove access to quality health care for those who have none, that \nkeep intact our wonderful system of hospitals and clinics in all areas \nof our country and that provide people with meaningful choices.\n  When future Congresses address this area, one issue I will watch most \ncarefully is the amount of health care information that is provided to \nthe Government, and how this information is used. We must be careful \nnot to adopt measures that give Government regulators the ability to \npeek into people's private medical records. A few years ago, my home \nState of Washington embarked on several health care reforms. Most of \nthese reforms were in the wrong direction. Our legislature adopted \nreforms that put the government in charge of health care decisions for \npeople and gave a government commission the ability to cancel private \nhealth insurance coverage in our state.\n  I found both of those moves bothersome, but our legislature didn't \nstop at just controlling health care decisions for our citizens. No, \nour legislature took one additional chilling step. It decided that if \nthe government was providing health care, as well as dictating which \nprivate health plans could remain in business, the government should \nhave access to personal, private medical records.\n  That is going way too far, and fortunately, the good people of \nWashington made sure that radical change was not placed into the law.\n  Over the next year, I am convinced that Congress will adopt \nmeaningful health care reforms that help people, but as we do that, I \nmust constantly advise my colleagues to follow the ``do no harm'' rules \nof medicine and not fall prey to those who believe that government-run \nhealth care, along with all that it brings, is the right solution to \nthis challenge.\n  No matter the type of information in question--consumer or medical--\nAmericans have the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy. \nThoughtful legislative action is needed at the federal level to address \nthe legitimate concerns many Americans currently have in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been an effort in recent days \nto score partisan political points by misrepresenting Governor Bush's \ncommitment to NATO and southeast Europe. Unfortunately, some of my \nSenate colleagues have been involved in this effort.\n  No one in the Senate has been more involved in our policy toward \nsoutheast Europe, and no one cares more than I do about that part of \nthe world. I have traveled to the region three times this year--on a \nfactfinding mission, to participate in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, \nand to participate in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. I have been to \nKosovo twice and visited with troops.\n  I have been involved in efforts to bring about alternative leadership \nin Serbia--something that has finally happened. I have been a leader on \nthe Stability Pact with the belief that its successful implementation \nis crucial to the long-term stability, prosperity, and peace in the \nregion. I have also constantly watched the situation in Kosovo, \noutraged at the ongoing ethnic cleansing going on there today.\n  With this background and involvement, I can say definitely that \nGovernor Bush understands the importance of the region to our national \nsecurity interests.\n  I think it is important that we set the record straight. Governor \nBush has said that he would systematically review our military \ncommitments internationally upon his inauguration. He will look at them \nacross the world. This will include a review of our deployments in the \nBalkans. He has said that he will work with our allies to develop a \nstrategy to remove our troops from the region when it is possible to do \nso without threatening peace and stability in the region or our \nrelationship with our European allies. He understands the important \nrelationship we have with our NATO allies.\n  There never was and never will be any statement by Governor Bush or, \nif he is elected, President Bush, regarding a reduced commitment to \nNATO. He understands how important NATO is.\n  Vice President Gore has joined Governor Bush in saying that we should \npull out of the Balkans when we are no longer needed.\n  Governor Bush is committed to political stability and security in the \nBalkans. He emphasized this point repeatedly--that stability in \nsoutheast Europe is vital to Europe and hence to the U.S. In other \nwords, we have strategic interests in southeast Europe, which are \nimportant to Europe and to the security of the U.S. and, for that \nmatter, peace in the world. So Governor Bush is committed to political \nstability.\n  Without the Governor's involvement in the Byrd-Warner debate on our \ntroop commitment to Kosovo, the next President would be facing a July 1 \ndeadline to decide whether to stay or go. Governor Bush stood up and \nwas counted at the time of the Byrd-Warner discussion in the Senate. He \ndemonstrated leadership at a time when leaders from both parties were \nconsidering having the U.S. unilaterally withdraw from a NATO \ncommitment. That was a very important thing that he did at that time, \nbecause if he had not stood up and said he thought it was overreach, we \nwould have lost that on the floor of the Senate and would have done \nirreparable damage to our relationship with NATO.\n\n  We must remember that the Clinton-Gore administration promised the \nAmerican people in 1995 that our troops would not be in Bosnia for \nlonger than a year. That promise was never kept. Rather than set a \nmisguided deadline, Governor Bush is simply saying we should not, and \nwill not, be in the Balkans forever. Nothing more.\n  Governor Bush has said time and again that he would actively consult \nour European allies in the formation and implementation of our policies \nin NATO and in southeast Europe. I hope Lord Robertson, who heads up \nNATO, understands that. I made that very clear when I was at the NATO \nAssembly in Budapest. We understand how\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\nimportant our leadership and our commitment is to NATO.\n  Governor Bush is an internationalist who is committed to NATO and our \nEuropean allies.\n  These attacks are just partisan politics designed, in my opinion, to \nturn attention from a growing scandal involving Vice President Gore.\n  Just this morning, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a \nhearing to examine Vice President Gore's dealings with former Russian \nPrime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin regarding weapons sales to Iran. It \nhas been widely reported that the Vice President failed to fully and \nproperly inform relevant congressional oversight committees regarding \nagreements reached with Russian officials. He has to be more \nforthcoming about what went on there.\n  The hearing was in response to new and critical information on this \nmatter which surfaced in the New York Times report dated October 13. \nGovernor Bush remains fully committed to NATO and American leadership \nin Europe. Repeating, he remains fully committed to NATO and American \nleadership in Europe.\n  He understands our unique role and is committed to maintaining that \nleadership. We know how important our leadership is to NATO. We \ncertainly found that out during the Kosovo-Serbian war that we had. To \nsuggest that he doesn't understand is just plain hogwash.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the period of the past weeks and \nmonths, as the ranking member of our Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, I have tried to point out the failing of this \nCongress and the fact that we have not addressed reauthorization of the \nelementary and secondary education bill, which we are charged to do--we \nhad 22 days of hearings and we had a markup and legislation was \nreported out of our committee.\n  It has been several months since that legislation was on the floor \nand then withdrawn by the majority leader. In spite of the efforts of \nmany of us to bring that measure back on the floor of the Senate, we \nhave been unable to do so. We think it is enormously important that we \nhave an opportunity to do so.\n  We are now some 3 weeks after the date that was suggested that we \nmove into the adjournment for this Congress, and we have seen days go \nby, quorum calls held, and still no action. Now pending before the \ncommittee, we have the bankruptcy legislation, which is going to \nbenefit in a substantial way the credit card industry. But we are not \nhaving the opportunity to address the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, which can benefit families all across this country, with \nsupport for State and local communities.\n  This issue, I think, is back before the Senate because, during the \nperiod of our national debate between the Vice President and Governor \nBush, great attention has been given to the issues of education. \nAssurances were given to the American people representing the different \npositions of the candidates. We have pointed out--I did last week--some \nof the realities and some of the facts about what is happening in our \npublic schools across this country. And also I pointed out the fact \nthat Texas has not been keeping up with the rest of the country on \nobjective tests. That was challenged by some colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. Now we have the Rand Corporation--virtually a \nnonpartisan organization--which has done a very careful review of the \nTexas experience, and they agree with us and, in effect, agree with \nVice President Gore on the issues of education.\n  I am glad we are getting some clarification. We only have 2 weeks \nleft in this campaign, but I am glad we are beginning to get some \nclarification on this issue. First of all, I remind our colleagues \nabout what assurances were given to the American people about the \ncommitment of our majority leader on the issues of elementary and \nsecondary education. We only provide some 7 cents out of every dollar \nthat goes into the local communities. States have the primary \nresponsibility. Nonetheless, we can give some focus and attention to \nprograms that have demonstrated positive results in terms of academic \nachievement and accomplishment. That really is the purpose for which \nthese resources are out there, and also to give special emphasis to the \nmost economically disadvantaged children in this country so they are \nnot going to be left out or left behind.\n  We come to this debate and discussion looking over the period of \nrecent years. We wonder whether the positions that have been accepted \nby the Republican leadership are very much in conflict with the age-old \npositions of the Republican Party with regard to education, where they \nbelieve there should not be a role for any Federal aid to education. We \nhad that debate in the early sixties. We have had it many times since \nthen.\n  Nonetheless, we have seen in the early 1990s when the Republican \nleadership assumed control of the Senate the first order of business \nfor them was a massive rescission of moneys that had been appropriated \nand were going to be allocated to school districts that would have \nprovided help and assistance to needy schools across the country.\n  That money had been appropriated by the House and Senate and agreed \nto by the conference, signed by the President of the United States. One \nof the first orders of business by the Republican leadership was to \nrescind that money. We saw a rescission of about $2 billion. The \ninitial request was considerably higher. It was reduced, but we had the \nrescission.\n  Then in the 1990s we faced the onslaught of our Republican leadership \nwho wanted to abolish the Department of Education. I think most Members \nand most parents across the country believe that when the President of \nthe United States sits down with the Members at the White House, we \nwant someone sitting at the President's elbow when there is a \ndiscussion and debate about domestic priorities in the United States, \nsomeone who is always going to say: What about education? What about \neducation, Mr. President?\n  Those voices are there, appropriately so, in terms of the security \ninterests of the United States and defense, for the foreign policy of \nthe United States, the Secretary of State. We have them there with \nregard to housing. We have them there in terms of the environment. We \nhave them there in terms of commerce and transportation. Many Members \nbelieve we should have them there with regard to the issues of \neducation.\n  That was not the position of the Republican leadership. They said: \nNo, we don't want to have that there. They tried unsuccessfully to \neliminate the Department of Education. Nonetheless, we find the \nDepartment is there. It is considerably downsized. It has had an \nextraordinary record, with great improvement over the previous \nRepublican Secretaries of Education in collecting the debts that are \nowed to the Department. They have reduced the student loan default rate \nfrom 22.4% in 1992 to 6.9% in 2000. Both the guaranteed and student \nloan collections have been much more efficient.\n  Now there is a different attitude by the new Republican leadership. \nIt is expressed by the Republican leader himself, going back to January \nof 1999:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. . . . \n     For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act.\n\n  January 29, 1999:\n\n       But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's \n     not going to be just words. . . .\n\n  June 22, 1999:\n\n       Education is number one on the agenda for the Republicans \n     in Congress this year. . . .\n\n  Chamber of Commerce, February 1, 2000:\n\n       We're going to work very hard on education. I have \n     emphasized that every year I've been majority leader . . . \n     and Republicans are committed to doing that.\n\n  February 3, 2000:\n\n       We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act. . . . Education will be a high priority in this \n     Congress.\n\n  May 1, 2000:\n\n       This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it \n     seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's \n     talk education.\n\n  May 2, 2000:\n\n       Question: . . . have you scheduled a cloture vote on that?\n       Senator Lott: No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. . . . \n     But education is number one in the minds of the American \n     people all across this country and every State, including my \n     own State.\n\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\n\n  July 10:\n\n       I, too, would very much like to see us complete the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n  July 25, 2000:\n\n       We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this \n     legislation this year and get it completed.\n\n  The fact is, for the first time in 35 years we do not have a \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is \nagainst the background, Mr. President, of what is happening out there \nacross this country and what young children are doing.\n  We have challenges in our education system. Here is a chart: ``More \nStudents are Taking the SAT.'' That test, by and large, is necessary to \ngain entrance into the colleges; not virtually unanimous, but by and \nlarge it is required. Look at what has happened since 1980, when 33 \npercent of the children took it: 36 percent in 1985; 40 percent in \n1990; 42 percent in 1995; and now in 2000, it is 44 percent.\n  This is a reflection of the attitude of children in our high schools. \nThe percentage of children taking the SATs is going up significantly. \nThe children want to take those tests. They understand the significance \nof the SAT and the importance of a college education. The SAT test is \ndemanding. It is hard. It is difficult. Children have to work extremely \nlong hours to prepare for these SATs. The increasing numbers of \nstudents taking the SAT is a clear indication from the children of this \ncountry that they are serious about education and they want to be able \nto try to improve their academic achievement.\n  Not only do we see their willingness to take the most strenuous of \ntests, which are the SATs, but they are also willing to take the \nadvanced courses in math and science, probably the most difficult \ncourses in our high school.\n  We see what has been happening in precalculus: In 1990, 31 percent of \nstudents enrolled in precalculus; in 2000, 44 percent did. In calculus, \nthe rate increased from 19 percent to 24 percent. In physics, 44 \npercent to 49 percent. These are the percentage increases of students \nwho are taking the advanced courses in these subject matters--all on \nthe rise. The number of children who are taking the SAT tests is on the \nrise.\n  Let's take a look at the results. We have now more children taking \nthe SAT tests. They are taking more demanding courses. What have been \nthe results? We see across the board, going back from 1972 and 1975, \n1980, the constant downward movement in terms of results. What we have \nbeen seeing since 1990 is the gradual, slow--and I admit it has been \nslow, but it is going in one direction, and that is up. There has been \nan improvement in SAT math scores and they are now the highest in 30 \nyears. More kids are taking them, more kids are doing better. That is \ntrue across the board in terms of males as well as females.\n  We have challenges in our education system. This is a reflection on \nwhat is happening generally across the country. These are the matters \nthe Vice President has talked about, how he wants to strengthen those.\n  Now we see what has been happening in the State of Texas. We saw what \nis happening generally across the country, that all the indicators are \ngoing up. Here we have Texas, falling far below the national average on \nthe SAT scores from 1997 to the year 2000.\n  I brought this up to the Senate floor last week, and a lot of my \ncolleagues were dismissive. But let's look at this. This is the \nnational test, the SAT. These are not homegrown tests in Texas and \nhomegrown tests in Massachusetts, homegrown in other States. The SAT is \na national standardized test. I will come back to that in a minute.\n  These are the national averages for the SAT test. Notice the national \naverage total scores since 1997 has gone up. That, I think, is a clear \nindication that the children, working harder, taking more challenging \ncourses, have a greater desire, more of them, to go on to the schools \nand colleges. It is a very definite upward swing, although not great in \nterms of the total numbers. All of us want these higher. However, the \nfact remains that progress has been made and the national average is \ngoing up.\n  But not, Mr. President, in the State of Texas. From 1999 to the year \n2000, we have seen it flatten out. Going back to 1997, scores have \ndeclined; Texas scores have gone down. It is also interesting that \nTexas scores are well below the national average in the SATs.\n  I think this is a pretty fair indication about the facts in the State \nof Texas. With all respect, I am not getting into criticizing the \nGovernor or commenting on his desire to try to do better. But I do \nthink that when he talks about it and he claims how well Texas is \ndoing, it is fair enough to look at the facts and examine whether this \nis so. We have this as a result of these Scholastic Aptitude Tests that \nshow Texas is well below the national average, and under Governor Bush \nit hasn't improved on the national average in the last several years, \nat least while he has been Governor.\n  These are the earlier facts. Then we have the blockbuster report, the \nRand Commission report, which basically sustains that argument that the \nschools may not have been making as large of improvements as claimed. \nIt has been an important indictment of what has been happening on \neducation in the State of Texas.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask the Senator from Massachusetts to yield while \nwe do a unanimous consent request, and the Senator as part of the \nrequest would retain the floor?\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I was just pointing out that we have this \nextraordinary report. I have it in my hand. It is the October 24, 2000 \nRand Commission report: What do test scores in Texas tell us? It is an \nexcellent report. I will have excerpts of it printed in the Record. But \nI hope those who are interested in this issue, trying to make up your \nminds over the period of these last 10 days, will have a good \nopportunity to examine that report.\n  Let me just mention a few of the highlights of the report. First of \nall, the study was released, as I mentioned, on October 24. It raises \nserious questions about the validity of gains in Texas math and reading \nstores. The study compares the results of the Texas Assessment of \nAcademic Skills, the test taken by Texas students, with the results \nachieved by those same students on the National Assessment of Education \nProgress tests. There were large discrepancies between the results of \nthe Texas TAAS test and the national NAEP test. The student gains on \nthe TAAS, the Texas test, are far greater than what has been found with \nthe same group of students on the NAEP or other standardized national \ntests.\n  Do we understand what we are saying? Significant improvement on the\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\ntest just given to Texas students; but for the Texas students who took \nboth the Texas and national test, we found a very dramatic disparity. \nIn Texas, many teachers say they are spending especially--these are the \nconclusions of the Rand report--large amounts of class time on TAAS \ntest preparation activities. Teachers in low-performing schools \nreported greater frequency of test preparation than did teachers in \nhigher-performing schools. While this preparation may improve the TAAS \nscores, it may not help students develop necessary reading and math \nskills. Also, this could lead to a superficial appearance that the gap \nbetween minority and majority students is narrowing when no change has \nactually occurred.\n  The exclusion of students with disabilities increased in Texas while \ndecreasing in the Nation. Texas also showed an increase over time in \nthe percentage of students dropping out of school and being held back. \nThese factors produce a gain in average test scores that overestimates \nactual improvement in student performance.\n  We understand now what is happening. Regarding those individuals with \ndisabilities, students we have worked long and hard to make sure they \nare going to be a part of the student body and have the opportunities \nfor educational advancement, if you can exclude some of them from test \ntaking, as in Texas, plus most likely some of the poorer performing \nstudents have dropped out and won't be able to take any of those \nassessment tests, this is going to have an artificial inflator on test \nscores.\n  That is the Rand Corporation that is making that conclusion.\n  Also, Rand researchers hypothesize that a small but significant \npercentage of students may have topped out on the TAAS. In other words, \nsome students may have scored as high as the TAAS would allow them to. \nIf that happened, it would artificially narrow the gap on TAAS between \nwhite students and students of color because white students tend to \nearn higher scores than minority students. Thus, the reduced gap on the \nTAAS relative to NAEP may be a result of TAAS being too easy for some \nstudents.\n  As with other tests, there have been documented cases of cheating on \nthe Texas TAAS test.\n  The NAEP is a national test, which students from around the country \ncan take so States and communities--and parents, most importantly--are \nable to evaluate the differences between how their children are doing \nin school compared with how those in other parts of the State and other \nparts of the country are doing. According to the NAEP, Texas fourth \ngraders were slightly more proficient in reading in 1998 than in 1994. \nHowever, the country as a whole also improved to the same degree. Thus, \nthere was nothing remarkable about the reading score gains in Texas. \nSmall improvements in Texas eighth grade math scores were also \nconsistent with those observed nationally.\n  There is nothing remarkable about the NAEP scores in Texas, and \nstudents of color did not gain more than whites. Score increases in \nTexas are identical to those nationwide when using the NAEP data. \nHowever, the gains on TAAS were several times larger than they were on \nNAEP.\n  That is what we are hearing the good Governor talking about. That is \nwhat he is talking about. This puts it all in the light that that is \nnot a true reflection of what is happening among the young people. The \ngains on TAAS were greater for students of color than they were for \nwhites. The large discrepancy between the TAAS and the NAEP results \nraises concern about the validity of the TAAS scores and validity of \nclaims regarding student achievement.\n  According to the NAEP results, the gap between white students and \nstudents of color in Texas is very large and also increasing slightly.\n  In 1998, the average fourth grade reading score for black students \nwas at the 38th percentile compared to the average white student at the \n67th percentile. This gap was slightly larger than the gap between \nthese groups in 1994. In other words, the black-white reading gap \nincreased during this 4-year period. The gap between the blacks and \nwhites had actually increased during this period.\n  In fourth grade math, the white-Hispanic NAEP gap grew in Texas but \nnot nationally, and the white-black gap remained constant in Texas but \nactually shrank nationally. In short, the gap sizes between the whites \nand minorities on the NAEP were improving nationally but getting worse \nin Texas.\n  That is not a satisfactory prescription for improving education. It \nsuggests the Texas system is more an education mirage than an education \nmiracle. I think it is important for parents--as they are looking now, \ntrying to get beyond the cliches, beyond the slogans, beyond the set \nstatements, beyond the give and take, even in those debates--to look at \nthe record, and the record is very clear. That is that we have not seen \nthe kind of advancement that has taken place in many other States that \nare doing a number of things that have been recommended, as we were \ngoing to have a chance to hear about in the debate on the ESEA.\n  We find out the States that made the greatest advancement are States \nthat had smaller class sizes, where they had continuing enhancement and \nproficiency for teacher education, mentoring with teachers, afterschool \nprograms, accountability. They had a number of those programs and even \nbenefited from early education help and assistance as well.\n  What we wanted to try to do is to have a debate on those particular \nmatters that have made a difference in States around the country, where \nwe had seen advancements in education. But we have been denied that \nopportunity. What basically the leadership, the Republican leadership, \nhas denied us is the opportunity to have that debate, denied us the \nopportunity to raise these issues. What the American people are being \nasked is, let's just look back on what has happened in Texas.\n  When we examine Texas, not out of partisanship, but using the \nobjective standards for the SATs--they do not benefit a Democrat or \nRepublican; they are focused on children--and if we take the Rand study \nwhich has been available and can be reviewed by anyone--we are finding \nout that this has been a mirage in terms of education.\n  I want to spend a few moments going into another area which I think \nthe American people ought to give some focus and attention to in these \nfinal few days, and that is on the critical issue of the credibility \ngap in health care. Few, if any, issues are of greater concern to \nAmerican families than quality, affordable health care. Americans want \nan end to the HMO abuses. They want good health insurance coverage, \nthey want a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens under \nMedicare, and they want to preserve and strengthen Medicare so it will \nbe there for today's and tomorrow's senior citizens. And they want \nthese priorities not only for themselves and their loved ones but for \nevery American, because they know that good health care should be a \nbasic right for all.\n  The choice in this election year is clear. It is not just a choice \nbetween different programs. It is a choice based on who can be trusted \nto do the right thing for the American people. Al Gore's record is \nclear. He has been deeply involved in health care throughout his \ncareer. The current administration has made significant progress in \nimproving health care in a variety of ways--from expanding health \ninsurance to protecting Medicare. He has consistently stood for \npatients and against powerful special interests.\n  Al Gore lays out a constructive and solid program that is consistent \nwith his solid record. He is for expanding insurance coverage to all \nAmericans, starting with children and their parents. He is for a strong \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I daresay, when Al Gore is elected President, \na Patients' Bill of Rights will be the first major piece of legislation \nthat passes this Congress. I am absolutely convinced that will be the \ncase, Mr. President.\n  He has a sensible plan for adding prescription drug coverage to \nMedicare. He will fight to preserve Medicare without unacceptable \nchanges designed to undermine Medicare and force senior citizens into \nHMOs and private insurance plans.\n  George W. Bush's approach is very different. His proposals are deeply \nflawed. But even worse than the specifics of his proposals is his \nfailure to come clean with the American people about his record in \nTexas or about his own proposals.\n\n[[Page S10968]]\n\n  On health care, George W. Bush does not just have a credibility gap. \nHe has a credibility chasm. He has consistently stood with the powerful \nagainst the people. He refuses to take on the drug companies, the \ninsurance companies, or the HMOs. His budget plan puts tax cuts for the \nwealthy ahead of every other priority, and leaves no room for needed \ninvestments in American families. His health care values are not the \nvalues of the American people.\n  On the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, George Bush said in the \nthird debate that he did support a Patients' Bill of Rights. He said he \nwanted all people covered. He said he was in favor of a patient's right \nto sue, as provided under the Texas law. And he said he brought \nRepublicans and Democrats together in the State of Texas to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. That is what he said. But the reality is very \ndifferent, as was pointed out in the New York Times after the debate on \nOctober 18. ``Texas record: Taking credit for patients' rights where it \nis not necessarily due.''\n  That is the understatement of the year. The reality is George W. Bush \nvetoed the first Patients' Bill of Rights passed in Texas. He fought to \nmake the second bill as narrow and limited as possible. He was so \nopposed to the provision allowing patients to sue their HMOs that he \nrefused to sign the final bill, allowing it to become law without his \nsignature.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Briefly for a question, and then I would like to make a \npresentation, and then I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very concerned about what I see \nas attacks on my State of Texas on the Senate floor. I certainly think \nit is legitimate to have a Presidential campaign out in the light of \nday where people can see it. I just ask the question: Is the Patients' \nBill of Rights the Senator is referring to the law today in Texas?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, it is law.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Does the Senator think it would be law in Texas today \nif the Governor had not allowed it to become law?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think another Governor would have gotten the bill \nfaster. If the Senator----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The question is, Is it law today?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts reclaims his \ntime.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask if the Senator will give me some time to rebut \nwhat I consider to be an attack on my State.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield to the Senator after I spell out \nexactly what happened in Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, then I ask unanimous consent that I \nhave some time before we go to the foreign ops bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I get up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will lay out the facts--and if I can \nhave the attention of the Senator from Texas now--I will lay these \nfacts out, and if the Senator from Texas finds a problem with these \nfacts, then I will be glad to yield for that purpose to listen to what \nthe facts are.\n  These are what the facts are: George Bush said in the third debate \nthat he did support a national Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  He said he wanted all people covered.\n  He said that he was in favor of a patient's right to sue as provided \nunder Texas law.\n  He said he brought Republicans and Democrats together in the State of \nTexas to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is what he said.\n  The reality is different. The Governor vetoed the first Patients' \nBill of Rights passed in Texas. He fought to make the second bill as \nnarrow and limited as possible. He was so opposed to the provision \nallowing patients to sue their HMOs that he refused to sign the final \nbill and allowed it to become law without his signature. That is not \nthe record of a person who is candid about where he stands and what he \nhas done. Those are the facts.\n  It is not a record that recommends him for national office for any \ncitizen concerned about a strong, effective Patients' Bill of Rights. \nIt is the record of a candidate who stands with powerful insurance \ncompanies and HMOs, not with American families. He was forced \neffectively to take a Patients' Bill of Rights. So when the Senator \nsays, isn't it law today? yes, but it was required because of what \nhappened in the legislature, not the leadership that was provided by \nthe Governor on that issue.\n  On health insurance, the record is equally clear--and equally bleak. \nGovernor Bush claims he wants insurance for all Americans. He blames \nVice President Gore for the growth in the number of the uninsured. But \nGovernor Bush's record in Texas is one of the worst in the country. \nTexas has the second highest proportion of uninsured Americans in the \ncountry. It has the second highest proportion of uninsured children in \nthe country. Yet Governor Bush has not only done nothing to address \nthis problem, he has actually fought against the solutions.\n  In Texas, he placed a higher priority on large new tax breaks for the \noil industry, instead of good health care for children and their \nfamilies. When Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program \nin 1997, we put affordable health insurance for children within the \nreach of every moderate and low-income working family. But George \nBush's Texas was one of the last in the country to fully implement the \nlaw.\n\n  Do we understand that? Texas was one of the last States in the \ncountry to fully implement the law. Despite the serious health problems \nfaced by children in Texas, Governor Bush actually fought to keep \neligibility as narrow as possible.\n  This is what happened in 1994: The Governor takes office; Texas ranks \n49th. The year 2000: Bush runs for President; Texas ranks 49th.\n  These are the facts. People might not like those facts. People might \nnot want to talk about those facts, but these are the facts. If you \nhave different facts, let's have them.\n  Texas: One of the last States to implement CHIP. October 1997, CHIP \nfunds were available. November 1999, Texas implements the full CHIP \nprogram. We had a program where the funds were there. We did not have \nto appropriate the additional funds. Still it took 2 years. Children \ncannot wait 2 years when they are sick. They cannot wait when they have \na sore throat, or cannot see the blackboard, or cannot see the teacher. \nThey need help and assistance, and the fact it took 2 years, I think, \nis inexcusable.\n  Bush places a low priority on children. Bush fights to restrict CHIP \neligibility to children below 150 percent of poverty. Most of the other \nStates, a great majority of the other States, went to 200 percent of \npoverty. Maybe the Senator from Texas has an explanation for that.\n  Texas has been one of the only States that has been cited, not by the \nSenator from Massachusetts and not by Democrats, but by a Federal judge \nfor failure to enroll children in Medicaid. That is the record, Mr. \nPresident. You might not want to hear about it, but that is the record.\n\n  Now, perhaps the most ominous revelation about the Governor's \nattitude towards this issue came in the third debate when he said:\n\n       It's one thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.\n\n  Insurance a Washington term? Governor Bush should try telling that to \nhard-working families across the country who don't take their children \nto the doctor when they have a sore throat or a fever because they \ncan't afford the medical bill. He should try telling that to the young \nfamily whose hopes for the future are wrecked when a breadwinner dies \nor is disabled because an illness was not diagnosed and treated in \ntime. He should try telling that to the elderly couple whose hopes for \na dignified retirement are swept away in a tidal wave of medical debt.\n  Insurance is far more than a Washington term. It is a Main Street \nterm in every community in America, and its lack of availability is a \ncrisis for millions of families across the country.\n  Prescription drug coverage under Medicare is another major aspect of \nthe health care challenge facing America. Few issues are more important \nto\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\nsenior citizens and their families. They deserve a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare. And we should try to provide it in a way that \nstrengthens the promise of Medicare, not in a way that breaks that \npromise and breaks faith with the elderly.\n  The differences between Vice President Gore and Governor Bush on this \nissue are fundamental. Governor Bush stands with the big drug \ncompanies. The Vice President stands with the senior citizens. Governor \nBush has sought at every turn to blur the differences between their two \nplans in a way that is so misleading as to make a mockery of his own \nattacks on the Vice President's credibility.\n  Vice President Gore has clearly pointed out the many flaws in \nGovernor Bush's prescription drug plan for senior citizens. But \nGovernor Bush has no response on the merits. Instead, he hides behind \nphrases like ``fuzzy numbers'' and ``scare tactics.''\n  But the numbers are not fuzzy, and senior citizens should be \nconcerned. Let's look at the facts.\n  Prescription drug coverage under the Bush plan is not immediate and \nmost senior citizens would be left out.\n  As the Vice President has pointed out, for the first 4 years, the \nBush plan would cover low-income seniors only. Al Gore cited the \nexample of a senior citizen named George McKinney. He said:\n\n       George McKinney is 70 years old, has high blood pressure. \n     His wife has heart trouble. They have an income of $25,000 a \n     year. They cannot pay for their prescription drugs. And so \n     they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order \n     to get their prescription drugs.\n\n  Governor Bush responded:\n\n       Under my plan, the man gets immediate help with \n     prescription drugs. It's called immediate helping hand. \n     Instead of squabbling and finger-pointing, he gets immediate \n     help.\n\n  He kept accusing Vice President Gore of using ``fuzzy math'' and \n``scare tactics.''\n  But Governor Bush's own announcement of his Medicare plan proves Al \nGore's point. This is what Governor Bush said:\n\n       For four years, during the transition to better Medicare \n     coverage, we will provide $12 billion a year in direct aid to \n     low income seniors . . . Every senior with an income less \n     than $11,300-$15,200 for a couple--will have the entire cost \n     of their prescription drugs covered. For seniors with incomes \n     less than $14,600-$19,700 for couples--there will be a \n     partial subsidy.\n\n  George McKinney has an income of $25,000. He would clearly be \nineligible for help under Governor Bush's plan. If Governor Bush thinks \nthat is fuzzy math, then education reform is even more urgent than any \nof us realized.\n  In the third debate, Governor Bush finally admitted that the first \nphase of his program is only for ``poor seniors.''\n\n  George McKinney is not alone. The vast majority of senior citizens \nwould not qualify for Governor Bush's prescription drug plan, and many \nof those who did qualify would not participate.\n  Even this limited program for low-income seniors would not be \nimmediate, because every State in the country would have to pass new \nlaws and put the program in place, a process that would take years in \nmany States.\n  George Bush's prescription for middle-income seniors is clear--take \nan aspirin and call your HMO in 4 years.\n  Governor Bush's prescription drug plan would also require senior \ncitizens to go to an HMO or an insurance company to obtain their \ncoverage. In the first debate, Vice President Gore pointed out that \nmost senior citizens ``would not get one penny for four to five years, \nand then they would be forced to go into an HMO or an insurance company \nand ask them for coverage. But there would be no limit on the premiums \nor deductibles or any of the terms or conditions.\n  Again, Governor Bush did not respond to the Vice President's specific \npoints. Instead, he claimed that the Vice President was trying to \n``scare'' voters.\n  The facts are clear. George W. Bush's policy paper states that:\n\n       Each health insurer, including HCFA-sponsored plans that \n     wish to participate . . . will have to offer an ``expanded'' \n     benefit package, including out-patient prescription drugs. . \n     . . This will give seniors the opportunity to select the plan \n     that best fits their health needs.\n\n  In other words, to get prescription drug coverage under the Bush \nplan, you have to get it through a private insurance plan. How high \nwill the copayments be? How high will the premiums be? How high will \nthe deductible be? Governor Bush has no answer. Those important points \nare all left up to the private insurance companies.\n  Governor Bush says senior citizens will have the opportunity to \nselect the plan that best meets their health needs. But what they will \nreally have is the opportunity to select whatever plan private insurers \nchoose to offer. If it costs too much, senior citizens are out of luck. \nIf it does not cover the drugs their doctors prescribe, they are out of \nluck. The Bush plan is an insurance industry's dream, and a senior \ncitizen's nightmare.\n  On prescription drugs, and every other aspect of Medicare, the choice \nbetween the two Presidential candidates is very clear, and it is clear \non every other aspect of health care. The Bush record in Texas is one \nof indifference and ineptitude--of putting powerful interests ahead of \nordinary families.\n  The Bush record in the campaign is one of distortion. The Bush \nproposals are at best inadequate and at worst harmful. Tax cuts for the \nwealthy are not as important as health care for children and \nprescription drugs for seniors. The American people understand that, \nbut evidently Governor Bush does not.\n  Al Gore has a career-long record of fighting for good health care for \nfamilies, for children, and for senior citizens. The current \nadministration has a solid record of bipartisan accomplishment, ranging \nfrom protecting the solvency of Medicare to improving health insurance \ncoverage through the enactment of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill and the \nChild Health Insurance Program. Al Gore's program responds to the real \nneeds of the American people with real resources and a detailed action \nplan.\n  I am hopeful that every American will examine the records of the two \ncandidates carefully. On health care, there should be no question as to \nwhich candidate stands with the powerful special interests and which \ncandidate stands with the American people. The choice is clear. \nGovernor Bush stands with the powerful, and Al Gore stands with the \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10969-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10969-S10972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to refute everything the \nSenator from Massachusetts has said about my State and my Governor.\n  Mr. President, I think it is legitimate to talk about a person's \nrecord when you are running for President of the United States. But, \nMr. President, I object to the use of the Senate floor to trash my \nState of Texas. And I object to a misrepresentation of the record of my \nState.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will yield on your time--on the time of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, not on my 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has no time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But there is not a time limitation, is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is under a time \nlimitation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask my response not be charged to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, does the Senator from Texas deny that \nTexas is 48th out of 50 States in terms of the total number of \nuninsured children? Does she deny that?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I deny that that is the relevant \npoint. Because, in fact, 41 States are behind in the CHIP program sign-\nup because when Congress passed the Children's Health Care Program, \nthey gave the States 3 years to spend the money. It just happened that \nour State meets every other year in the legislature. By the time they \nwere able to meet and start the CHIP program, the State had had a very \nsteady influx of children. We are on the way, and 40 other States are \nin the same situation.\n  So I am going to reclaim my time. I would like for the rest of my 15 \nminutes to start now because I thought the\n\n[[Page S10970]]\n\nSenator from Massachusetts was going to ask a question. But I am not \ngoing to yield further.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has been speaking for quite awhile \nabout my home State of Texas. If there is more than 15 minutes before \nwe start the foreign operations bill, I ask unanimous consent to be \nable to continue speaking until Senator McConnell comes and have the \nfull time to refute what I think are misrepresentations of the Texas \nrecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised, there is an \nagreement to recognize Senator Baucus. But subject to that agreement, \nwithout objection, the Senator may proceed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that I have up until the time \nthat the foreign operations bill starts. What is the agreement with \nSenator Baucus?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an agreement that Senator Baucus be \nrecognized with no time limit before the foreign operations bill. \nHowever, the Senator is not here at this point.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until \nI finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the State of Texas has just surpassed \nNew York as the second largest State in America. That didn't happen \nbecause our State wasn't well run. It didn't happen because we have a \nsorry education system. It didn't happen because we don't take care of \nour children. It happened because we have a great quality of life. We \nhave a Governor, George W. Bush, who is doing a great job, and we have \na legislature led by our Lieutenant Governor, Rick Perry, and our House \nSpeaker, Pete Laney. One is a Democrat; one is a Republican. They work \ntogether. That is the way we do things in Texas.\n  There has been a gross misrepresentation about Texas throughout the \ncampaign for President and on the Senate floor today. I will tell the \nSenate why the State of Texas is in great shape and why it is \nabsolutely unconscionable to trash Texas in order to get an advantage \nin the Presidential race.\n  Let's take education. Everyone would acknowledge that we have a \nproblem in the public education system of our country. Our Congress, \nthe Republicans, and our Governor in Texas have tried to open up our \npublic education system. Governor Bush has tried to take the problems \nwe have and put creativity and more State resources into those problems \nso that every child will have a chance to reach his or her full \npotential in our State of Texas. That is what we have tried to do in \nCongress for the entire United States. We have tried to put creativity \ninto the schools. We have tried to give parents more choices.\n  Every time we do, however, it is the people on the other side of the \naisle who throw up the roadblocks, who want to have the Federal \nGovernment, from the top down, dictate what the local governments and \nthe school boards would do all over our country.\n\n  If you think that Governor Bush disagrees with that, you are right. \nAnd so do I. He believes in local control. He is very pleased that \nCongress is going to put more money into public education, but he wants \nthe decisions made by the people who know the children and who know \nwhat the children's needs are.\n  Let me tell you what he has done in Texas. We were very concerned \nabout the high school dropout rate in Texas. It was especially high in \nour Hispanic community. Governor Bush believes, as do I, that if our \nyoung people are dropping out of high school, that is trouble--T-R-O-U-\nB-L-E--for all of us. It means those children will not have a chance to \nsucceed, and it means our society is losing the benefit of a productive \ncitizen.\n  Governor Bush said: Let's find out what the problem is. Well, we \nfound out what the problem is. Many of those young people who are \ndropping out of high school can't read very well. So he said: We are \ngoing to attack this so that every child will be able to read at grade \nlevel, so that every child will be able to participate in public \neducation all the way through the system. So we start testing our \nchildren in Texas in preschool, kindergarten, in the first grade, in \nthe second grade. And in the third grade, the child must read at grade \nlevel. The child is tested. And if the child cannot pass the test, the \nchild will not progress to the fourth grade.\n  That child will be given extra help to learn how to read until that \nchild can read at grade level. Then that child will go to the fourth \ngrade. Governor Bush believes that a child is not going to be able to \nlearn multiplication tables if a child can't read in the third grade. \nGovernor Bush wants to go back to basics in education. He wants \nreading, writing, arithmetic, and history to be the core subjects that \nare taught in our schools. That is what he has done in Texas. The test \nscores are going up, and especially they are going up among our \nminority students. In fact, we have phenomenal increases in the test \nscores of our minority students, which is the emphasis we have put in \nthe program, because we are so hopeful that by starting at that third \ngrade level, every child will be able to reach his or her full \npotential.\n  Texas is one of two States that has made the greatest recent progress \nin education according to the congressionally mandated National \nEducation Goals Panel. African American fourth graders in Texas ranked \nfirst in the Nation in math. Since 1992, African American fourth \ngraders in Texas have made the greatest gains in math, and Hispanic \nfourth graders have made the second greatest gains.\n  African American and Hispanic eighth graders in Texas ranked first \nand second in the Nation in writing. Texas eighth graders, as a whole, \nranked fourth in the Nation. Under Governor Bush, the number of \nstudents passing all parts of the State skills test has increased by 51 \npercent. The number of both minority students and economically \ndisadvantaged students passing all parts of this test increased by 89 \npercent.\n  I think that is a record of which our Governor should be very proud.\n  We have had problems in our public education system. We have had \nchildren who don't speak English in great numbers in our education \nsystem. We are a border State. We value education. Our Governor was the \nfirst to step up to the line and say we would educate every child in \nTexas regardless of whether or not that child was a legal resident of \nTexas. The children of illegal immigrants are educated in Texas, and \nthat is under the leadership of our Governor.\n  So I think it is very important that we set the record straight \nbecause it is a good record. We take care of our children, and we \nbelieve a strong system of public education is the ticket to success in \nour country. We believe Texas is leading the way.\n  Now the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out that a Federal judge \nhad said we are not doing enough for the children in the insurance \nprogram that has been a part of Medicaid. I think that is very \ninteresting because that lawsuit was filed when we had another Governor \nin Texas, not Governor Bush. That lawsuit was filed when Ann Richards \nwas the Governor of Texas. Governor Bush has been in office for 7 \nyears, so that lawsuit has been pending for over 7 years. I wonder what \nit was that made Federal Judge William Wayne Justice decide to rule in \nthe last 6 weeks in that case. I wonder why he waited for over 7 years \nto declare that Texas was not meeting its responsibilities. \nFurthermore, I wonder why he waited until October 30 to ask for the \nreport from the State--October 30 of an election year in which our \nGovernor is running for President. I just ask that question about the \ntiming.\n  As a matter of fact, it happens that our State is going to report \nthat they are doing everything they can to cover every child with \nMedicaid and under the CHIP program because 41 States were not able to \nmeet the 3-year mandate of the CHIP program, for a combination of \nreasons. Partly, it was regulations put out by the Federal Government \nthat our States had to digest before they would be able to go forward \nand put the program in place. Our State legislature meets every other \nyear, as do many other State legislatures. So once they met, they put \nthe program in place. Texas has been going full steam ahead ever since \nthat point. Mr. President, 100,000 children are now covered under our \nCHIP program; 400,000 are expected to be covered by the end of next \nyear.\n  Under Governor Bush, the percentage of Medicaid-eligible children who \nget\n\n[[Page S10971]]\n\nprevention care has doubled from 30 percent to 60 percent. Congress is \ngoing to pass legislation that is going to help all 41 States that \nhaven't been able to get their programs up completely and running, so \nthat all of them will be covered and they will have the money they \nneed, including Texas. So 41 States had to get the program up and going \nwith legislatures that meet every other year. So the States and the \nFederal Government are working together to make sure children are \ncovered, and our Governor is leading the way.\n  I want to discuss the Patients' Bill of Rights, which was mentioned \nby the Senator from Massachusetts. He acted as if we didn't have a \nPatients' Bill of Rights in Texas. We do have a Patients' Bill of \nRights in Texas, and the Governor worked very hard to get that bill \npassed. The disagreement between the Governor and some of the people in \nthe legislature, which was the subject of the negotiation, was how much \nthe caps on pain and suffering lawsuits would be. The Governor thought \nthey were too high. He didn't veto the bill; he let it go into law. \nIn fact, because he did that, it is the basis of the law that \neventually Congress will pass, because it has very clear internal \nreviews and very clear external reviews and because those reviews are \nso comprehensive and independent, there have been virtually no lawsuits \nfiled, which is exactly what you want. You want patients to be covered; \nyou want them to get the care they need. You don't want a bunch of \nlawsuits in which the patient is a person forgotten in the process. You \nwant a Patients' Bill of Rights so that you can get the care and \nbecause the internal and external reviews have been so good, the system \nis working.\n\n  It is law in Texas today because Governor Bush was the leader who \nworked to get those internal and external reviews, who worked to have \nreasonable caps, who let the bill become law, and who now, I hope, will \nlead our country to a Patients' Bill of Rights that will not be a \nlawsuit machine but will give patients and their doctors the ability to \nmake their decisions.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts said our Governor, in running for the \nPresidency, has a prescription drug benefit for our elderly, but he \nsaid it was ``fuzzy.'' It is not fuzzy. He wants a prescription drug \nbenefit for our elderly people who need it. He wants to do it \nimmediately. He does not want one person to have to decide between a \nnecessity in life and a prescription drug. So he is advocating exactly \nwhat we have been trying to do in Congress, which is to get money to \nthe States immediately to help in a transition until we can have a real \naddressing of the issue of prescription drug benefits. He is advocating \nan option in Medicare so that every person will have the ability to \nhave coverage, if that is the option the person in Medicare chooses to \nhave--prescription drug benefits--something that would operate like \nMedicare Part B or Medicare Part C.\n  I think we should not have to criticize a State in order to make a \npoint in a Presidential race. I don't think the people of America are \nvery persuaded, and if Vice President Gore doesn't have anything else \nto talk about but the State of Texas, he should not be the leader of \nour country because I think most people would like to know what Vice \nPresident Gore and what Governor Bush are planning to do in the future \nfor our country. I think their platforms are pretty clear. I don't \nthink you have to say that the State of Texas is backward when we have \none of the best qualities of life of any State in our Nation, and \npeople are voting with their feet because they are moving to Texas by \nchoice. Texas is a great place to live. We have wonderful people, and \nwe have a legislature that operates in a bipartisan way. I don't think \nyou would hear one of our legislators stand on the floor of the House \nor Senate and trash another State in order to make a point, because it \nis just not necessary.\n  We have a system of public education that is improving every day in \nTexas. It is under the leadership of Governor Bush that that is \nhappening. We are covering our children in the CHIP program, and our \noutreach is comprehensive. We are trying to do the education efforts \ntoday so that every child who is eligible will know through that \nchild's parents that they are eligible.\n  We have a Patients' Bill of Rights that is the leader in the Nation \nfor patients in our State, with their doctors having control of their \nhealth care. We did it under the leadership of Governor Bush.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me say I have been busy all morning \ntrying to work out our Medicare and Medicaid Improvement Act and work \non finalizing actions so we can, hopefully, finish the business of the \nSenate tomorrow or Friday. I have not had an opportunity to come over, \nthough I understand Senator Kennedy has gone on at great length talking \nabout Texas.\n  Let me respond in the following way. There are a lot of States in the \nUnion I wouldn't want to live in. But I know there are people who love \nthose States. I am proud when people ask: What State do you represent \nin the Senate? I am proud I can say I am a Senator from the greatest \nState in the Union. I am a Senator from Texas.\n  Now, Texas does not need defense against Ted Kennedy. The fact that \nTed Kennedy is not for George Bush for President is a very good reason \nto vote for George Bush for President. The fact that Ted Kennedy does \nnot like our Patients' Bill of Rights in Texas is a pretty good \nindication we have a good Patients' Bill of Rights in Texas. After all, \nit was Ted Kennedy who joined the Clintons in proposing that the \nGovernment take over and run the health care system in America.\n  I don't have to defend Texas because people vote with their feet. We \nhave had 321,666 people move from other States to Texas since George \nBush has been Governor. They must think things are pretty good in \nTexas. We have created 1.6 million permanent, productive tax-paying \njobs for the future in Texas while George Bush has been Governor. While \nAmerica has lost manufacturing jobs, we have gained 100,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in Texas. Come to think of it, wouldn't it be great \nif America were a little bit more like Texas?\n  I quote from the rules of the Senate, rule XIX, clause 3: No Senator \nin debate shall refer offensively to any State of the Union.\n  Now I don't intend to come over and say bad things about \nMassachusetts. Some great Americans have come from Massachusetts. \nMassachusetts is a great and wonderful State. I don't choose to live \nthere, but I know the people who live there love it.\n  It is interesting that we are gaining two congressional seats because \nso many people are moving to Texas; Massachusetts keeps losing \ncongressional seats. But I am not going to come out here and criticize \nMassachusetts.\n  I say to Senator Kennedy and to others: if you want to run for \nPresident, you want to campaign, go out and do it. But I don't think we \nought to turn the floor of the Senate into the fulcrum of that \ncampaign.\n  I thank my colleague for coming over. She does a great job in \ndefending Texas and defending its interests. I am always proud to be \nassociated with her. Texas doesn't need any defending. But obviously \nthe rules of the Senate do. I call on my colleagues to abide by the \nrules. I don't think we help each other if we try to tear down other \npeople's States. I think it behooves us to try to build up our own \nStates--to try to build up our own country. I think when we do that, \nthe country benefits.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to discuss for a moment this \nRand report that has been quoted so many times by Senator Kennedy and \nothers. It seems there are some people in the Rand organization who \nhave put something out showing Texas in a bad light in the education \nsystem.\n  That was not a full study. Rand actually did a full and comprehensive \nstudy. It was released July 25 of this year. I will read a few \nhighlights of the comprehensive study. The study examined and compared \nthe results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress Tests \ntaken between 1990 and 1996 among 44 States. They judged the States \naccording to State score improvements, raw achievement scores, and \nscores comparing students from similar demographic groups.\n  Results from the Rand study show that math scores in Texas had \nimproved at twice the rate of the national average. Texas was second \namong all States in improved math scores. Texas leads all States in a \ncomparison of students from similar socioeconomic and family \nbackgrounds. Texas African\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\nAmericans and non-Hispanic white fourth graders ranked first on this \ntest in math in 1996. Texas Hispanic fourth graders ranked fifth. The \nstudy confirms earlier reports that Texas is one of two States that has \nmade the greatest overall academic gains in recent years.\n  The report went on to say one reason why Texas has been so \nsuccessful, according to the Rand study, has been the higher percentage \nof teachers who are satisfied with their teaching resources. Governor \nBush provided those resources. He wants to do the same thing through \ninitiatives such as Reading First, at the Federal level, which would \noffer training and a curriculum for teaching reading to K-through-12 \nteachers.\n  Governor Bush thinks reading is fundamental. I think his mother is \nthe one who started that when she started the Reading First Program for \nAmerica. He believes if a child can read, that child is going to be \nable to take the next steps in public education. That is why Governor \nBush put the resources there in Texas. That is why the real Rand study \nthat was comprehensive showed the great improvement in Texas. That is \nwhy his education plans for America will work because we want no child \nto be left behind in Texas or any other State.\n  I hope the campaign rhetoric doesn't hit the Senate floor again. I am \nnot going to stand here and I am not going to sit in my office and \nlisten to anyone else use Texas as a whipping boy, A, because Texas is \na great State; B, we have a great Governor; C, the things that are \nbeing said are misrepresentations; and D, in Texas, where we have been \nbehind in the past, Governor Bush has said we are going to get ahead.\n  We are tackling our problems. Every State has problems. I am proud of \nthe leadership in Texas of our Speaker, Pete Laney and our Lieutenant \nGovernor, Rick Perry, and our Governor, George Bush, who have worked \ntogether in a bipartisan way to make sure the resources are going into \npublic education and into our children's health insurance program. It \nwas our legislative leaders working with Governor Bush who said our \nentire State tobacco settlement would go to fund the children's health \ninsurance program, and they took a huge part of our State tobacco \nsettlement and put it in a trust fund in which every county in Texas \nwill participate in perpetuity for the treatment of our indigent health \ncare patients all over Texas. That was the leadership of our State \nlegislature, and our Governor. Because they do want quality health care \nfor all our Texas residents.\n\n  Maybe I am a little biased, but I think I come from a very great \nState. I think the statistics prove it. I do not want to hear anyone \nelse say that Texas is not meeting its responsibilities in education, \nin health insurance, in patients' rights--because we are a leader. We \nare a leader and we want everyone in America to have the quality of \npublic education that we are building to get in Texas. We want every \nchild in America to reach his or her full potential. We want every \nchild to have health insurance coverage. We want every person in Texas \nto have quality health care. That is why all of our tobacco settlement \nis going for health care or education programs to educate young people \non the hazards of smoking. That is it, that is the entire use of our \ntobacco money: to educate young people on the hazards of smoking and \nhealth care for every citizen of Texas who needs it.\n  I am very proud of our record. I am proud of our Governor and I think \nhe is the person who can bring these qualities to the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10972-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10972-S10984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n              APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate on the bill H.R. \n     4811, ``Making appropriations for foreign operations, export \n     financing, and related programs for the fiscal year 2001, and \n     for other purposes,'' having met, have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree \n     to the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on the \n     part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 24, 2000.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the conference report \non the foreign operations bill.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Speaker, the bill before the Senate is a half \nbillion dollars below last year's appropriation--the fiscal year 2000 \nbill was $15.4 billion--this year we are presenting a $14.9 billion \nbill. This includes $14.5 billion in fiscal year 2000 funds plus an \nadditional $466 million in supplemental funding for debt relief, \nSouthern Africa, and the Balkans.\n  Although we are below last year's level, we have managed to \nsubstantially increase key priorities, including providing $865 million \nfor Ex-Im, a nearly $100 million increase over last year, $1.3 billion \nfor development assistance, again a $100 million increase, within child \nsurvival we surpassed the request for AIDS funding and provided $315 \nmillion. Overall child survival funding was also increased to $963 \nmillion. In addition to over $1 billion in supplemental funds for \nColombia, the Narcotics and Law enforcement account was increased by \n$20 million over the request to $325 million. For the first time in \nyears, we managed to increase security assistance. This account is of \nreal concern to our friends and allies in Central and Eastern Europe. \nWe exceeded the request and provided $3.545 billion. To respond to \ncrises from Chechnya to Sierra Leone, we substantially increased \nfunding both over last year's level and this year's request for \nrefugees to $700 million. In this account we were able to work out a \ncompromise that will improve management and oversight of UNHCR while \naffording the administration flexibility to respond rapidly to any real \nemergency.\n  Finally, we provided funds for the fiscal year 2001 and the \nsupplemental request for debt relief. In addition to language on IMF \nreforms recommended by Senator Gramm, we have included a number of HIPC \nconditions worked out between Senator Helms and Congressman Leach, \nrepresenting the authorizing committees. There are a number of policy \nprovisions which are also important to mention. Within the $675 million \naccount for Eastern Europe, we have provided up to $100 million for \nSerbia. Senator Leahy and I agree that we will never be able to \nwithdraw troops and help stabilize the Balkans as long as Milosevic and \nother criminals responsible for outrageous atrocities across the \nBalkans are allowed to go free. No government in the region will have \nconfidence in Belgrade if the rule of law is not upheld.\n  The administration lobbied heavily against our arguments that U.S. \nsupport for the new government should come with specific conditions \nattached. We thought aid should flow only if the Serb government met \nthree specific conditions: First, they need to cooperate with the War \nCrimes Tribunal. Second, they must take steps to end support for \norganizations in the Republic of Srpska which prevent effective \nintegration of Bosnia Hercegovina. Finally, given Belgrade's vicious \ntrack record, we thought it was important to seek assurances that the \nnew government will implement policies which respect the rights and \naspirations of minorities and the rule of law. Each of these conditions \nwas designed to serve our interests in stabilizing the region so that \nan exit strategy for U.S. troops can be safely and effectively \nexecuted. The bill modifies this approach and includes an agreement \nwhich will give this administration and the new government in Belgrade \na 5-month window in which assistance can move forward. After that \nperiod, only humanitarian aid and support to local mayors will be \nallowed if Belgrade refuses to meet the conditions which I have \noutlined.\n  I must confess my reservations about this approach. I listened to the \narguments for flexibility, but I have little confidence in the \nadministration's past record of support for the Tribunal and\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\nstanding up to Belgrade. I believe that there is no problem in Serbia \nthat will be made easier by Milosevic's predatory presence. No regional \ngovernment will have confidence in Belgrade as long as he is allowed to \ngo free. It is in their interest and ours to see him turned over for \ntrial. In the end I agreed to this compromise because funds for Serbia \nare made available subject to the committee's notification. If there is \nno sign of cooperation or progress on our conditions during the next \nfive months, the administration should understand that I will put a \nhold on funding. This compromise is not a free pass to spend for five \nmonths--Senator Leahy and I will be expecting concrete progress. The \nsecond area of tremendous concern addressed in the bill is Russia's \naction in Chechnya. Since launching this war, Moscow has blocked all \nhumanitarian relief operations or international human rights \ninvestigations from proceeding in Chechnya. While we cannot always \nchange the views in Moscow, I was extremely disappointed by the \nadministration refusal to support the U.N. High Commissioner for Human \nRights call for an international investigation. Instead Secretary \nAlbright testified the administration preferred to allow Moscow to \nconduct its own internal investigation. The State Department has also \nrejected support for non-government groups providing relief and \npreferred instead to work through the Russian government.\n\n  To address these problems, we have earmarked $10 million for the more \nthan 400,000 displaced families in Chechnya and Ingushetia which can \nonly be provided through NGOs. Aid to the Russian government is also \nmade contingent upon cooperation with international investigations in \nChechnya. We have also made aid to the Russian Government contingent \nupon a certification that Moscow has terminated support for the nuclear \nprogram in Iran. In the past we have withheld 50 percent of the Russian \ngovernment funds until this certification is made--this year we have \nincreased the withholding to 60 percent. Putin has said Russia must \nbuild a dictatorship of law--what remains unclear is whether his \npersonal emphasis will be on dictatorship or law. I think our aid \nshould be leverage to secure a result which serves American interests \nand nuclear armed Iran certainly is not in U.S. interests.\n  Finally, let me mention debt relief. Senator Helms and Congressman \nLeach reported out bills which conditioned U.S. support to the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries Initiative managed by the IMF and the World \nBank. The Foreign Relations Committee bill requires the Secretary of \nTreasury to certify that it is World Bank policy to--(1) suspend \nfunding if loans are diverted or misused, (2) not displace private \nsector funding, and (3) disburse funds based on the implementation of \nreforms by the recipient country including the promotion of open \nmarkets and liberalization of trade practices, the promotion of \nprojects which enhance economic growth and the establishment of \nbenchmarks to measure progress toward graduation from assistance. \nSimilar conditions are required of the IMF. In addition to including \nlanguage supported by Senator Helms and Congressman Leach, we have \nincluded House language limiting resources to countries engaged in a \npattern of human rights abuses. I supported stronger language which \nwould have required that the Secretary of Treasury certify that the IMF \nand Bank actually were implementing new policy conditions before \nTreasury was allowed to disburse funds--this approach was recommended \nby Senator Gramm, the chairman of the Banking Committee. That was my \nview of how it should have been handled. Instead, my colleagues on the \nconference supported Helms-Leach language which releases the funds and \nthen requires reporting on performance over the course of the next \nyear.\n  While I completely agreed with Senator Gramm, I also shared the \nproblem he has with his committee--there simply were not the votes to \nsustain this position. I think we have made progress on conditioning \ndebt relief, but the Treasury Department should understand that I will \ncontinue to consult with Senator Gramm when we receive notifications on \nintended debt relief recipients. Performance benchmarks are essential \nif we are to avoid seeing the same groups of countries and banks back \nin 5 years seeking the same relief all over again. Separate from the \nHIPC relief, we did include binding requirements that the Treasury \nDepartment withhold 10 percent of our contribution to any multilateral \nbank until specific conditions are met on procurement and management \nreforms. Not only will the banks have to improve internal management \npractices through audits, they will have to improve recipient country \nprocurement management and financial practices. This is an important \nstep in our battle against fraud and corruption. Once again, I think we \nhave produced a balanced bill which funds U.S. priorities within sound \nbudget principles and I urge its favorable consideration.\n  Finally, I repeat, this bill is below the amount spent for foreign \noperations last year. That makes it somewhat unique among the \nappropriations bills we have been in the process of passing, and I am \nproud to say we were able to bring this bill in under last year's \ntotal.\n  Mr. President, are we under some time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is under a 1-hour time limit.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum and further suggest \nthe time during the quorum call be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Bennett is here and wishes to speak in morning \nbusiness. It seems to me he ought to speak on the bill time so we do \nnot have to move the vote any later in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The ranking member is here. Maybe Senator Bennett can \ncomment after the ranking member addresses the bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad we are here. I commend Senator \nMcConnell and also our counterparts in the House, Chairman Callahan and \nMrs. Pelosi. The chairman, Senator McConnell, and I have worked closely \ntogether on this bill. In the same way I tried to accommodate those \nconcerns of his side of the aisle, he has tried to do the same on our \nside. As a result, we have a good bipartisan bill.\n  We tried to meet everyone's concerns without putting in unnecessary \nearmarks or taking away the appropriate flexibility the President \nshould have. We funded the President's important priorities, and I note \nthat both sides of the aisle supported those.\n  I am disappointed, of course, as I am sure the Senator from Kentucky \nis, with the amount of time it took to get here. Finally, we are here. \nHad it been left to the two of us, we could have finished this bill \nbefore the August recess, but while we were told to make sure the cars \nin the train would follow, we were not allowed in the engineer's seat \nto get it down the track. It is here now, and it is a good result.\n  I am glad that we found an acceptable compromise on family planning \nthat does not restrict what private organizations can do with their own \nprivate funds. That is only wise. After all, we have heard speeches \nforever from people here about how the government should get off the \nbacks of individuals. We have finally agreed to do that. It was not \neasy. I give very high praise to Congresswoman Pelosi for her work on \nthis.\n  I am also pleased that we include $425 million, the Senate funding \nlevel for family planning. This is not money for abortions. No funds in \nthis bill can be used for abortions. This is money for family planning. \nSo many countries I have visited are among the poorest of the poor, and \nthey tell me that reducing the rate of population growth is one of \ntheir highest priorities but they lack the money to do so. They also \nsay that when they have money for family planning, the number of \nabortions in their country goes down.\n\n[[Page S10974]]\n\n  We provide adequate authority and funding for debt forgiveness. That \nhad overwhelming support at the meeting the President had with \nRepublicans and Democrats, members of the clergy across the ideological \nspectrum, representing all faiths and persuasions. I felt honored to be \nin that meeting.\n  One of our Senate guest Chaplains that week, Father Claude Pomerleau \nof the University of Portland, accompanied me there. I thank him for \nhis advice and help on this. I should also say that Father Pomerleau is \nmy wife's brother, my brother-in-law. Even the President said that it \nwas probably Father Pomerleau's recommendation that got me into the \nWhite House, rather than my position that got him in.\n  In seriousness, on the issue of debt forgiveness, we want to help the \nworld's poorest countries get out of debt. We also want to be sure they \nmake the necessary economic reforms so they can stay out of debt in the \nfuture. It is not enough to say, look, we are going to pay your bills \nso you can get out of debt. It does nothing if then within a few years \nthey are back in debt.\n  We provided aid to Serbia, subject to important conditions relating \nto Serbia's cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal. Chairman \nMcConnell, myself, as well as Senator Biden and others, strongly \nsupport these conditions.\n  The conditions do not take effect until March 31, 2001, and we do not \nintend the aid spigot to be opened wide before then. We expect the \nadministration--this administration and the next one--to proceed \ncautiously. We will be watching, as appropriators, just how cautious \nthey are. After all, administrations come and go, but the \nAppropriations Committee stays here, and we will be here to watch what \nis done next year.\n\n  We want to support the new Serbian Government, but only if it is \ntruly democratic and respects the rights of its neighbors and also the \nrights of minorities. We expect the administration to treat the \napprehension and prosecution of war criminals as a priority.\n  I am pleased with the amount of funds for HIV/AIDS. It is a $100 \nmillion increase above last year's level. We provided up to $50 million \nfor child immunization, and substantial increases for programs to \ncombat TB, malaria, and other infectious diseases.\n  There are a lot of other provisions I could mention, from \nrestrictions on assistance for Peru--we did that because of the recent \nefforts to subvert democracy there. We hear the President of Peru make \npromises, but then take actions that belie what he has said. We put in \nadditional funding for refugees. Unfortunately, we know that the \nreality throughout the world today is that there are more and more \nrefugees. However, I strongly object to one House provision that was \nincluded. And I told the conferees that I objected. It is a $5.2 \nmillion earmark for AmeriCares. This is a private organization that \ndoes work in Latin America and other places. I cannot recall a single \ninstance--certainly not since 1989, when I became chairman of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee; nor in the 5 years I have been ranking \nmember, and the Senator from Kentucky has been chairman--when we have \nearmarked funds for a private organization such as this.\n  It was done here, as I understand it, because a 6-year, $5.2 million \nproposal of AmeriCares was rejected by AID. According to AID, the \nproposal was too high-tech to be sustainable in the country in \nquestion, and because some of the work was already being done by \nothers. I suspect it was a proposal which would buy a lot of expensive \nequipment from some manufacturer somewhere but might not be something \nappropriate for that country.\n  Although AID suggested to AmeriCares that they submit a revised \nproposal, AmeriCares opted instead to seek a congressional earmark, \nignoring the usual practice, and basically saying: Just give us the \nmoney. We will decide what to do with it.\n  I have no opinion on the merits of their proposal. But if you are \ngoing to be applying for Federal funds, you ought to follow the same \nrules everybody else does.\n  There are literally hundreds of PVOs that submit requests to AID, and \nmany are rejected--some because they do not make sense, and others \nbecause there is not the money to fund them. Are we now going to give \nthose other dissatisfied PVOs their own earmarks? It is a terrible \nprecedent. It does not belong in this bill.\n  I will give you an example. I have fought to ban landmines all over \nthe world. We have the Leahy War Victims Fund that spends millions of \ndollars every year for landmine victims. I wrote the legislation that \nwas the first piece of legislation ever in any country to ban the \nexport of landmines.\n  There are many NGOs and PVOs--that is, nongovernmental organizations \nand private voluntary organizations--that have come in and worked to \nget rid of landmines and care for landmine victims. Some are funded \nthrough the foreign aid bill or the defense appropriations bill. Some \nare funded through private donations that they raise. Many contact me \nbecause of my identification with this and say: Could I get Federal \nfunding?\n  One of the nice things is that a lot of these--they are screened just \nbefore the money goes out. But can you imagine how it would be if we \nsimply gave them the money just because it was requested by a Senator \nwho wants to eradicate landmines?\n  It has always been my view we should let the experts judge the merits \nof these proposals, rather than just hand over the money to whichever \norganizations have the most political clout.\n  Some have complained--and I heard this morning--that this is a \nRepublican bill. Others have said it is a Democratic bill. They are \nboth wrong. Neither side got everything they wanted. There were \nsignificant compromises on funding and on policy by both sides. That is \nas it should be, especially for a bill that deals with foreign policy. \nAnd that is why I am proud to be here with the Senator from Kentucky, \nbecause we should not have a Republican foreign policy or a Democratic \nforeign policy. We should have a foreign policy that represents the \ninterests of the United States.\n  We have had somewhat of an uneven record since the time when Senator \nVandenberg spoke about ``politics ending at the water's edge.'' But on \nthis bill, at least, Republicans and Democrats have come together.\n  It is interesting, too, because the Subcommittee on Foreign \nOperations of the Appropriations Committee has probably the smallest \nstaff of any committee around here--on the Republican side, with Robin \nCleveland, and Tim Rieser on our side, aided by just a couple of people \nwhom I will mention later--to put this together. We don't have huge \narmies of people to help us, but maybe that is just as well because as \na result, in the end, Senators talk to Senators. That is the best way \nto do things around here.\n  I see the Senator from Utah is on the floor.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                             The Rand Study\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ncourtesy. I was more than happy to give him whatever leeway he wanted, \nbut I appreciate the opportunity to make a comment. Given the nature of \nthe session in which we find ourselves, we have to take every \nopportunity as it comes along. As the chairman of the subcommittee, the \nSenator from Kentucky, indicated, the time will be taken off the bill.\n  I rise to take the opportunity to respond to the comments that were \nmade earlier by the Senator from Massachusetts in his scathing attack \non the education system in Texas. The Senator from Massachusetts, as \nwell as Senator Harkin yesterday, referred to a Rand Corporation study \non the State of Texas schools. They would have us believe that based on \nthat study, the Texas schools are terrible and, further, that those of \nus who are saying nice things about Texas schools are deliberately \nmisleading the public.\n  I want to make it clear that the people who are missing this story \nare the people who sit in the gallery above the Chair. The press has \nmissed the story here because they have bought the line laid down by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and others in his party that somehow the \nRand Corporation has denounced Texas schools as being terribly \ninferior. The Rand Corporation has done no such thing. Democrats\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\nhave used the recent Rand study to try to tell everybody that the Rand \nCorporation has done that. If I may, too many journalists have taken \nthe press release as it has come out of the Democratic headquarters and \nnot read the record for themselves.\n  I took a class in journalism. The first thing they said was, check \nthe facts yourself. I didn't follow that career, but I have tried to \nremember that advice. So I have checked the facts myself. The place I \nwent to begin with, with the help of my staff, was the Rand \nCorporation. Let us go back to the Rand Corporation and see what they \nhave to say about Texas schools. I will leave aside the argument as to \nwhether or not they are right. There is always the possibility that \neven these so-called experts could be wrong in their analysis. Let us \nset that aside for just a minute and ask ourselves, what does the Rand \nCorporation have to say about Texas schools?\n\n  This is what the Rand Corporation has to say about Texas schools. I \nam reading from a news release issued by the Rand Corporation itself. I \nask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Rand Corporation says:\n\n       The education reforms of the 1980s and 1990s seem to be \n     working, according to a new RAND report, but some states are \n     doing far better than others in making achievement gains and \n     in elevating their students' performance compared with \n     students of similar racial and socioeconomic background in \n     other states. Texas and Indiana are high performers on both \n     these counts.\n\n  I will repeat that last sentence:\n\n       Texas and Indiana are high performers on both these counts.\n\n  This is not a Republican speaking. This is not the Bush campaign \nspeaking. This is the Rand Corporation speaking. Texas, a high \nperformer.\n  It goes on:\n\n       Math scores are rising across the country at a national \n     average rate of about one percentile point per year, a pace \n     outstripping that of the previous two decades and suggesting \n     that public education reforms are taking hold. Progress is \n     far from uniform, however. One group of states--led by North \n     Carolina and Texas and including Michigan, Indiana and \n     Maryland--boasts gains about twice as great as the national \n     average.\n\n  This is the Rand Corporation, Mr. President, saying Texas is boasting \nrates of improvement twice the national average.\n  Back to the report:\n\n       Even more dramatic contrasts emerge in the study's \n     pathbreaking, cross-state comparison of achievement by \n     students from similar families. Texas heads the class in this \n     ranking with California dead last.\n\n  Interesting. They go on to say:\n\n       Although the two states are close demographic cousins, \n     Texas students, on average, scored 11 percentile points \n     higher on NAEP math and reading tests than their California \n     counterparts. In fact, Texans performed well with respect to \n     most states. On the 4th-grade NAEP math tests in 1996, Texas \n     non-Hispanic white students and black students ranked first \n     compared to their counterparts in other states, while \n     Hispanic students ranked fifth. On the same test, California \n     non-Hispanic white students ranked third from the bottom, \n     black students last, and Hispanic students fourth from the \n     bottom among states.\n\n  How can this be, for the Rand Corporation to be saying such wonderful \nthings about Texas and then having Democratic Senators come to the \nfloor and quote the Rand Corporation as saying terrible things about \nTexas? If I were a conspiracy theorist, I would think the release of \nthe latest Rand study might have something to do with the fact that \nthere is an election in less than a week. But the president of the Rand \nCorporation has insisted that is not the case. He has insisted that the \ntiming of the release of this second study, which is being used to \ntrash Texas, was entirely coincidental and had nothing whatever to do \nwith the election.\n\n  All right. Let's take him at his word and read his words to see how \nhe reconciles the earlier Rand statement with the later one. I didn't \ntell you, but that first study I quoted from was released in July, \nbefore either of the conventions took place, before the question of \nTexas performance in education became a national priority or a national \nissue.\n  How does the president of Rand reconcile these two apparently \nirreconcilable positions, one where Rand says, in July, Texas is No. 1, \nTexas comes in first with California last, and the two States are \ndemographically very similar--how do they reconcile that statement with \nthe statements we are hearing on the floor today?\n  Read what he has to say, I say again to my journalist friends, who \ntake the press release from the Democratic headquarters, put it in the \nheadlines--top story in today's television--that the Rand Corporation \nhas trashed the Texas record. I don't think any of them read what the \npresident of Rand had to say because if they had, the story would have \nbeen different on this morning's news.\n  This is what he has to say:\n\n       The July study ``Improving Student Achievement'' touched on \n     the Texas schools and received widespread press play. Both \n     efforts--\n\n  Talking about the July study and this last one--\n\n       draw on NAEP scores. The new paper suggests a less positive \n     picture of Texas education than the earlier effort, but I do \n     not believe these efforts are in sharp conflict. Together, in \n     fact, they provide a more comprehensive picture of key \n     education issues.\n\n  So Rand is not backing away from their earlier statement that Texas \nis No. 1 in the areas that they quoted and covered in their first \nstatement. They are not repudiating that.\n  They are not contradicting it. They are not backing away from it. \nAgain, the president of Rand says:\n\n       I do not believe that these efforts are in sharp conflict.\n\n  It is the politicians who have put them in sharp conflict, not the \nresearchers. Let's examine the research and see what it says. Quoting \nagain from the president of Rand:\n\n       The July report differed in scope.\n\n  Then in parentheses he says:\n\n       (It covered almost all States, not just Texas.)\n\n  Therein lies the answer to this dilemma. The July report that says \nTexas ranks No. 1 was a comparative study of Texas against other \nStates. In that study, they said: In these areas we are checking, Texas \nis the best. The Rand Corporation said ``Texas is the best.''\n  Now, they came back to Texas to do a different study on an entirely \ndifferent issue, and the issue they studied the second time was whether \nor not the Texas test system was a good one. They came to their own \nconclusion that the Texas system of testing needs to be improved. Their \njudgment, their opinion. Never at any time did they say that Texas was \nnot getting better results than any other States, even with a system \nthey claim needs to be improved.\n  I see the chairman of the subcommittee has returned. I will be happy \nto yield the floor now and get back to the foreign operations bill, \nwhich is before us. I could not pass the opportunity to straighten out \nthe Record.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Iowa have misled \nus because they have not read the fine print of the report they are \nquoting from, and they have not consulted the opinion of the president \nof the organization they are citing. At no time, in no place, in spite \nof what the political headline said, has the Rand Corporation backed \naway from its conviction that Texas is first in many, if not all, of \nthe categories they examined on education. The Governor of Texas and \nthe two Senators from Texas who spoke earlier are rightly entitled to \nbe very proud of the progress that has taken place in education in \ntheir State.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        Rising Math Scores Suggest Education Reforms Are Working\n\n\n state achievement differences tied to spending, policies texas first, \n           california last in test scores of similar students\n\n       Washington, D.C., July 25--The education reforms of the \n     1980s and 1990s seem to be working, according to a new RAND \n     report, but some states are doing far better than others in \n     making achievement gains and in elevating their students' \n     performance compared with students of similar racial and \n     socioeconomic background in other states. Texas and Indiana \n     are high performers on both these counts.\n       The study is based on an analysis of National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress (NAEP) tests given between 1990 and \n     1996. The authors rank the 44 participating states by raw \n     achievement scores, by scores that compare students from \n     similar families, and\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\n     by score improvements. They also analyze which policies and \n     programs account for the substantial differences in \n     achievement across states that can't be explained by \n     demographics. Here are the key findings:\n       Math scores are rising across the country at a national \n     average rate of about one percentile point per year, a pace \n     outstripping that of the previous two decades and suggesting \n     that public education reforms are taking hold. Progress is \n     far from uniform, however. One group of states--led by North \n     Carolina and Texas and including Michigan, Indiana and \n     Maryland--boasts gains about twice as great as the national \n     average. Another group--including Wyoming, Georgia, Delaware, \n     and Utah--shows minuscule gains or none at all. Most states \n     fall in between.\n       Even more dramatic contrasts emerge in the study's \n     pathbreaking, cross-state comparison of achievement by \n     students from similar families. Texas heads the class in this \n     ranking with California dead last. Wisconsin, Montana, Iowa, \n     Maine, North Dakota, Indiana and New Jersey cluster closely \n     behind Texas. Louisiana, Mississippi, West Virginia, \n     Alabama and Rhode Island perform almost as dismally as \n     California.\n       Although the two states are close demographic cousins, \n     Texas students, on average, scored 11 percentile points \n     higher on NAEP math and reading tests that their California \n     counterparts. In fact, the Texans performed well with respect \n     to most states. On the 4th-grade NAEP math tests in 1996, \n     Texas non-Hispanic white students and black students ranked \n     first compared to their counterparts in other states, while \n     Hispanic students ranked fifth. On the same test, California \n     non-Hispanic white students ranked third from the bottom, \n     black students last, and Hispanic students fourth from the \n     bottom among states.\n       Differences in state scores for students with similar \n     families can be explained, in part, by per pupil expenditures \n     and how these funds are allocated. States at the top of the \n     heap generally have lower pupil-teacher ratios in lower \n     grades, higher participation in public prekindergarten \n     programs and a higher percentage of teachers who are \n     satisfied with the resources they are provided for teaching. \n     These three factors account for about two-thirds of the \n     Texas-California differential. Teacher turnover also has a \n     statistically significant effect on achievement. (California \n     is now implementing class-size reduction and other reforms \n     but these steps began after the 1996 NAEP tests.)\n       Having a higher percentage of teachers with masters degrees \n     and extensive teaching experience appears to have \n     comparatively little effect on student achievement across \n     states. Higher salaries also showed little effect, possibly \n     reflecting the inefficiency of the current compensation \n     system in which pay raises reward both high- and low-quality \n     teachers. However, the report points out that salary \n     differences may have more important achievements effects \n     within states than between states. Also, they may have \n     greater impact during periods when teachers are in shorter \n     supply than during the 1990-1996 measurement period.\n       To raise achievement scores, the most efficient and \n     effective use of education dollars is to target states with \n     higher proportions of minority and disadvantaged students \n     with funding for lower pupil-teacher ratios, more widespread \n     prekindergarten efforts, and more adequate teaching \n     resources. As for teacher salaries and education, the report \n     adds, ``efforts to increase the quality of teachers in the \n     long run are important, but . . . significant productivity \n     gains can be obtained with the current teaching force if \n     their working conditions are improved.''\n       The most plausible explanation for the remarkable rate of \n     math gains by North Carolina and Texas is the integrated sets \n     of policies involving standards, assessment and \n     accountability that both states implemented in the late 1980s \n     and early 1990s.\n       The RAND study, led by David Grissmer, is based on NAEP \n     tests given in 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1996 to representative \n     samples of 2,500 students from the 44 voluntarily \n     participating states. Five tests were given in mathematics \n     and two in reading at either the 4th- or 8th-grade level. Not \n     all of the states took all of the tests. And there were too \n     few reading tests to permit a separate analysis of those \n     results. Taken together, however, the tests provided the \n     first set of data permitting statistically valid achievement \n     comparisons across states. The researchers used data from the \n     census and from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey \n     to establish the student samples' family characteristics.\n       The 1998 NAEP reading and math scores became available too \n     late to be incorporated in this analysis. ``We're examining \n     those data now, however, and we find that the state rankings \n     change little and our findings about which policies make the \n     most difference aren't affected at all,'' Grissmer declares.\n       ``Our results certainly challenge the traditional view of \n     public education as `unreformable','' he concludes. ``But the \n     achievement of disadvantaged students is still substantially \n     affected by inadequate resources. Stronger federal \n     compensatory programs are required to address this \n     inequity.''\n       Grissmer's coauthors include Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata \n     and Stephanie Williamson. Improving Student Achievement: What \n     NAEP Test Scores Tell Us was supported by the ExxonMobil \n     Foundation, the Danforth Foundation, the NAEP Secondary \n     Analysis Program, the Center for Research on Education \n     Diversity and Excellence and by RAND.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Utah has made \nan extraordinarily good point. If he would like to speak further, I can \nwait. I am going to propose a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have probably exhausted my indignation on that \nsubject, I say to the Senator from Kentucky. I will be available again \nif someone comes along to try to misinterpret and misquote these \nstudies.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend for his very important contribution \nto what has become an issue across America.\n  Mr. President, with relation to the foreign operations bill, I ask \nunanimous consent that the vote regarding the foreign operations \nconference report occur beginning at 4:30 p.m., and that there be 4 \nminutes for debate immediately following the vote for closing remarks \nwith respect to the pending Feingold amendment and S. 2508, and that \nthat vote immediately occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was told this had been cleared on \nboth sides. We will propound the unanimous consent request later when \nit is cleared.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I had to leave the floor for a moment. Am I \ncorrect that the continuing resolution will not be here for a 4:30 \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, would it be \nhis intention, once all time is finished or yielded back, to go to a \nrollcall vote on this bill?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am told that is fine with our side. We will be happy \nto finish up the debate and vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I know we are discussing the underlying bill. I ask \nunanimous consent to be yielded 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: It is my \nunderstanding that we have a vote scheduled at 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not correct; that has been changed.\n  Mr. REID. I don't understand how we are not having a vote at 4:30. \nHow could it have been changed?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I propounded a unanimous consent \nagreement to which the Senator from Florida objected and that is how we \nfound ourselves where we are.\n  Mr. REID. So what I stated earlier on the floor--that we had a vote \nat 4:30--was really not accurate, is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote was to occur at that time, but the \nmeasure on which the vote was to occur has not yet arrived from the \nHouse.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have requested time. I understand under a previous \nunanimous consent request, Senator Graham of Florida was granted 30 \nminutes. He is yielding me a part of his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Florida yield the time \nto the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know we have been discussing a variety \nof subjects in the last few hours. The matter before the Senate is the \nForeign Operations Appropriations bill.\n  One of the difficulties all Members are having, is trying to get some \naccurate information about what is actually in these bills, as they \ncome to us rather quickly. That is one of the things we have been \ntalking about today. I think Senator Leahy raised an excellent point. \nThere are provisions in\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\nforeign ops about which I also have some serious concerns. But right \nnow, I just wanted to take a few minutes to discuss the Adoption Tax \nCredit.\n\n\n                          Adoption Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. President, the adoption tax credit is broadly supported in this \nChamber by Democrats and Republicans. It is one of the issues we seem \nto be able to come together on to say, yes, we believe in adoption. \nAdoption affirms life. It affirms families. It helps us to build \nfamilies in very special ways. It provides an opportunity for children \nwho don't have parents, and for parents who desperately want children, \nto get together.\n  Over the last couple of years, together, Democrats and Republicans, \nthe White House, President Clinton and the First Lady, have been \naggressive advocates of adoption. We have made great progress.\n  Just last week, under the tremendous leadership of Chairman Helms, we \npassed the first ever International Treaty on Adoption. This treaty is \ngoing to reduce corruption, minimize the costs of international \nadoptions, and expedite this process so the children all around the \nworld can find homes. We believe there are no unwanted children, just \nunfound families. We passed historic legislation a few years ago to \nhelp break down racial barriers to allow people of all different races \nto adopt children in need, in order to build families. We all know that \nlove knows no color lines.\n  We are doing a wonderful job. I am on the floor today to encourage my \ncolleagues to just try to do a little bit better. I am concerned that \nwe are not going to expand this adoption tax credit and increase it in \nways that are meaningful, in ways that will make a difference.\n  Just two months ago, many members of this body gathered in \nPhiladelphia and vowed that under their leadership, no child would be \nleft behind. This is a laudable goal, and one I think that every member \nof this body embraced. Here is our opportunity to prove it.\n  Let me briefly explain what I mean. Right now, as many people know--\nparticularly those who have adopted children, or who have been touched \nin a positive way in their life through adoption, either as an adoptee, \nas a birth mother who is happy with the choice she made, or an adoptive \ncouple--there is in place a $5,000 tax credit for adoption. We adopted \nthis tax credit in 1996, in an effort to provide assistance to families \nwishing to adopt. It allows parents who adopt a child to receive a \nmaximum of $5,000 in credit on their taxes. If that child is what we \ncall a special needs child, the amount of the credit is raised by \n$1,000. In addition, reimbursements for adoption expenses from a \nprivate employer are also excluded from an adoptive parent's gross \nannual income.\n  The National Adoption Clearinghouse estimates that a private adoption \ncosts anywhere from $4,000 to $30,000. International adoptions are \nreported at between $10,000 and $30,000. About six months ago, I was at \na citizenship ceremony for newly adopted children. One mother came up \nto me and told me that, without the tax credit, she could not have even \nthought about adopting a second child.\n\n  So this is an important tax credit. It helps waiting children find \nhomes. It helps working couples who want to be parents experience the \nsheer joy parenting brings. But it is not working for everyone. \nUnfortunately, the way the credit is currently structured, it is not \nhelping all adoptive families, just some. Let me show you why.\n  As you can see, I have pictures of three children here, all of whom \nwere adopted. The first Elena, a child from Guatemala, who was adopted \nwhen she was one year old. She has no known health conditions. This \nsecond child is Jack, a little boy from the United States, who was \ngiven up for adoption when he was born. Jack was immediately placed \nthrough a private adoption agency. Jack also has no known health \nconditions.\n  And this is Serina, a little girl, also from the United States who \nwas also recently adopted. Serina was taken into foster care \nimmediately upon her birth. She was born with prenatal cocaine \naddiction. She is small, in a wheelchair, and has difficulty seeing and \nhearing. She suffers from Cerebral Palsy, as well as multiple other \nproblems.\n  As I mentioned, these two children, Elena and Jack, are relatively \nhealthy. The third child, Serina, has multiple challenges. Under our \ncurrent system, one would think all of these children and their \nfamilies would deserve some help with adoption. But right now under our \nsystem, Elena and Jack have received help. Elena's parents received \n$9,786, while Jack's family claimed $5,890. Serina's parents, on the \nother hand, received nothing.\n  Under the current tax code, only expenses which are incurred in the \nact of adoption are eligible. Although adopting Serina meant that her \nadoptive parents had to renovate their car and make their home \nwheelchair accessible, such costs are not ``qualified adoption \nexpenses.''\n  As I mentioned, the difficulty lies in the tax code. One can be \nreimbursed for expenses related to the adoption. But, as is widely \nknown in the adoption community, when you adopt a special needs child, \nperhaps one who is not physically handicapped, or one who has emotional \nor mental difficulties or has been in foster care, there are little or \nno expenses related to the active adoption.\n  Serina is a special needs child, just like the 100,000 special needs \nchildren who are freed for adoption in the United States and yet are \nstill waiting for a home. These are all children like Serina, waiting \nfor a family to love and care for them. We want that adoption tax \ncredit to work for these children, as well. The Department of Treasury \nestimates that, not including step parents, there were 77,000 adoptions \nin 1998, 31,000 of which were special needs. That is almost half.\n  Therefore, under our current system, the very children and families \nwe are trying to help, encourage, and reward for opening up their homes \nand hearts to these children are actually being left out.\n  Here is a report to Congress from our own Department of Treasury, a \nreport we received just in the last week. I brought this to the \nattention of our ranking member on the Finance Committee, Senator \nMoynihan. This has also been transmitted to Chairman Roth from \nDelaware, to help my colleagues understand that, according to this \nreport, special needs children are being left out. I know that in the \nfinal days of the session, negotiators have been trying to reach a \nfinal agreement on a tax package. However, I am told that, while this \npackage does include a provision to extend the non-special needs tax \ncredit for two additional years, it does not include any relief for \nspecial needs children.\n\n  I know some people might say: Senator Landrieu is not right. She \ncouldn't possibly be right. This can not be happening. We are not \ngiving a tax credit for healthy kids and no tax credit for special \nneeds kids.\n  That wasn't our intention. At least I believe it wasn't our \nintention.\n  Let me conclude by saying, when people stand up on this floor, or in \nPhiladelphia, or in California, giving speeches all over America, and \nsay they don't want to leave children behind, that ``no child will be \nleft behind'', we are about to leave 100,000 children behind, because \nwe will not take the time and the energy to fix this adoption tax \ncredit. Children such as Serina, children in my State and a number of \nothers, all of these beautiful children from different States--these \nare the kids who are about to be left behind.\n  If I have to come to this floor every day until we are finished--and \nLord only knows how long we will be here--I will continue to do so, to \nspeak for the children who are being left behind. We can fix the tax \ncredit; it costs very little to fix it. If we are truly a body which \nvows to leave no child behind, then we must do something to help both \nspecial needs and non special needs children.\n  Mr. President, I will come to the floor every day if necessary to \nensure that these children are not left behind.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time remains under my 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes 10 seconds.\n\n\n                             Fiscal Policy\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as is necessary.\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\n  For the last several weeks, I have been raising concerns about the \ndirection of our fiscal policy. Today, we reach a historic moment. Many \nwere here in the 1980's and 1990's when the Federal Government, through \nannual deficits, acquired a record national debt of almost $5.5 \ntrillion. In 1992, we reached the peak of this when we had a 1-year \ndeficit of in excess of $290 billion.\n  In the 1990s, we took a number of steps to try to rectify this \nsituation and to mitigate this constant increase in the national debt.\n  A key part of that process occurred in 1997. In 1997, we set spending \nlimits for ourselves, including spending limits on the discretionary \naccounts of the Federal Government such as the account that we are \ndealing with today. We promised ourselves and the public that for every \ntax dollar cut there would be $1 less spent, and vice versa. That is \nthe way in which a family would approach having to restrain its budget \nin order to come into line with its income. It would buy the holiday \ngifts that it could afford but not necessarily the ones that everyone \nin the family wants because for those family budgets there are some \nvery real caps.\n  But, for Congress, the commitment to realistic budget and fiscal \nresponsibility was a novel, even a radical idea. We had not even \nthought about it that much in the preceding 20 or 30 years. Apparently, \nit was so radical that it was too much to ask. It is almost as if this \nHalloween season we have all turned into Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. On \nthe campaign trail we put on one costume; that is, the costume of our \nbetter selves where we boast about the courage and foresight it took to \nbalance the budget. We talk about all the good things we are going to \ndo, whether it is saving Social Security, providing a prescription drug \nbenefit for Medicare, cutting taxes, or adding spending in other \nfavorable programs. Then we return to Congress and we take off our \nmask. We begin grabbing for what we can get, a few billion here, a few \nbillion there, regardless of the long-term consequences.\n  We have doled out treats to line our political pockets while we are \nplaying a trick on the American public. That trick is that we are \nsleepwalking through the surplus. We are about to deny ourselves and \nfuture generations one of the greatest opportunities that we have had \nin American political and economic history: to use this enormous period \nof prosperity to deal with some of those long-term issues that will \naffect, not just ourselves, but future generations.\n  But as we vote to set the deficit monster free, we make the promise \nthat this is only for this year. We are not really going to let him out \nof the cage; we are just going to open the door a bit and let him sniff \nsome of the desirable consequences of profligate spending. This year we \ntell the American public this is our chance to celebrate this American \nprosperity. Next year we will cut the monster down to size, put him \nback in his cage, and no long-term harm will have been done. But the \ntruth is for our children and our grandchildren this could be a very \nscary Halloween.\n  My friends, are we really so humble as to believe that what we do \ntoday will not resonate through future years? I personally find it hard \nto believe that this will be just a 1-year exception to a constancy of \nfiscal discipline.\n  In 1997, we planned for the future because we knew that what we did \nwith the taxpayers' dollars would have real consequences. They are \nhaving real consequences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Washington Post article \naptly entitled ``Binges Becoming Regular Budget Fare'' be printed in \nthe Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this story chronicles the crumbling of our \nwall of fiscal resolve in the face of a behemoth of appropriations \nbills. The bill we have before us, the foreign operations bill, carries \na $14.9 billion price tag.\n  It has been stated that this bill is actually lower than the bill \nthat we passed last year. If I am in error--and it is very difficult to \nrespond since we have only in the last few hours gotten a copy of a \nmultipage bill, but as I read through the bill, it is my analysis that \nin calculating last year's $15.5 billion expenditure, we have included \nan almost $2 billion item, the Wye Plantation commitments for the \nMiddle Eastern peace, which are nonrecurring. So if you are comparing \napples to apples, those things that we spent money on last year and \nthose things we are going to spend money on this year, actually last \nyear's comparable appropriation for foreign operations was closer to \n$13.5 billion. So instead of the $14.9 billion being a reduction, it \nactually represents approximately a 10-percent increase over the \nspending that we had on this same account last year, a 10-percent \nincrease, while we are operating under the rule that we are only \nsupposed to spend the rate of inflation, which is 3.5 percent, as an \nincrease from 1 year's budget to the next.\n  But that is not what is the true monster in this bill. The true \nmonster in this bill is stuck into the appropriations language, which \nfor us on the floor is printed in the Congressional Record, since we do \nnot have a copy of the actual bill and conference report. It is \nspecifically stuck on page H10776, nestled in between a provision that \nrelates to gifts to the United States for reduction of the public \ndebt--and I am glad to know that we get some gifts to reduce the public \ndebt--and a provision that provides debt relief for heavily indebted \npoor countries. It may be appropriate that this language I am about to \nquote is inserted in between those two provisions.\n  In section 701(a), this language appears:\n\n       Section 251 (c)(5) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 . . . is amended by striking \n     subparagraph (A) and inserting the following:\n       ``(A) for discretionary category: $637,000,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $612,695,000,000 in outlays;''.\n\n  That might seem fairly unexciting, but let me tell you what we are \npreparing to do. In that Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we provided a \nspending limit for discretionary accounts for each of the future years. \nFor the fiscal year 2001, the year for which we are now appropriating, \nthe spending limit was established at $542 billion. The legislation we \nare about to vote upon will increase that figure from $542 billion to \n$637 billion, a 17.5-percent increase in the allowable expenditure in \nthis 1 year alone. That is the scale of the monster that we are about \nto let out of the cage by adopting this legislation.\n  This figure will put far more than a dent in the surplus that we \npromised. It will put a massive hole in our budget projections. The \nfact is, by the time we are done, Social Security is more likely to be \nfloundering midstream without a life vest than to be in a secure \nlockbox on dry land. Instead of fiscal responsibility, we are now \npracticing fiscal myopia. We are honing in on the magic number, a $4.6 \ntrillion surplus over the next 10 years. However, what we are \nforgetting to completely level with the American people about is that \nthat $4.6 trillion is predicated on the assumption we are only going to \nspend $542 billion this year. We are about to authorize a number that \nis almost $100 billion larger.\n  The forecasters of the Congressional Budget Office do not have a \ncrystal ball. They can only see the future the way we look at it and \nthe degree of confidence they place in our actions. The CBO numbers, \nupon which the $4.6 trillion surplus is predicated, are based on those \ncommitments made in 1997.\n  This appropriations bill demonstrates that we are not committed to \nthose commitments of 1997. The surplus projections assume that \ndiscretionary spending increases each year would be restrained to the \nrate of inflation. We are about to completely abandon that facade.\n  What are we about to do as we go into this new reckless era? The best \ncase scenario--and we can assume under that that we will, indeed, be \nable to increase discretionary spending for the future only by the rate \nof inflation, that this is just a 1-year aberration through which we \nare living; that Halloween is going to be repealed for future years--if \nwe have that best case scenario, we can anticipate that our surplus \nwill sink by about $100 billion over the next 10 years--$100 billion \nless than the projections.\n  I do not think that is a credible scenario. I do not believe there is \nany reason to believe that what we are doing today is exceptional. \nRather, what we\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\nare doing today is going to be precedential for the future. And assume \nthat it is precedential. The discretionary spending each year increases \nby the same rate that we are increasing it this year; that is, \napproximately 9 percent, or 5.5 percent more than the rate of \ninflation.\n  If we act in each of the next 10 years with the same abandon that we \ndo this year, we will spend the entire 10-year projected surplus on \nthis increased spending. There will be no money to strengthen Social \nSecurity. There will be no money to finance a tax cut. There will be no \nmoney to provide for prescription drugs through Medicare. In fact, \nspending at this rate will not only eliminate all of those potentials, \nbut Congress will be forced to dip into the Social Security surplus, \nthat thing which it has committed it would never ever do, by $400 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  So we are making some very serious decisions as we pass this \nappropriations bill with its enormous increase in the limitation on \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Save Social Security, indeed. Could it be that when we talked about \nsaving Social Security, we really meant preserving it as a museum piece \nso we could talk to our grandchildren about what it used to be like? We \nwill tell them that back when we were young, the Government actually \nsent you money when you grew older and deserved a rest. But if \ndiscretionary spending will dent the surplus, the direction we are \ntaking on mandatory spending will virtually hollow it out.\n  Our lack of fiscal discipline is not only to be found in the \nappropriations bill but also in the creation of new entitlements. We \nhave already passed the Defense Department authorization bill that \nchanges the health benefits as a new entitlement and will reduce the \nsurplus by $60 billion over the next 10 years.\n  We are poised to approve give-backs to Medicare providers that will \ncost another estimated $75 to $80 billion of our surplus over the next \n10 years.\n  Another $260 billion disappears if we pass a tax bill, which it is \nrumored that it is about to be presented to us by our colleagues from \nacross the hall in the House of Representatives.\n  So when you add up all of this laundry list, you will find that we \nhave reduced our surplus to another return to deficits.\n  It is very easy to add up these numbers and simply say it is too \nmuch, but I am well aware that much of the spending is for worthy \ncauses, many of which I myself support. But what these individual \npieces of legislation do not add up to is a solid plan for the future. \nWhat they do not add up to is the requirement that we make choices, \nthat we set priorities, that we decide which of all of these good \nthings is most important, and that we have the discipline to stick to \nthose priorities.\n\n  I ask again, whatever happened to ``Save Social Security first''?\n  Can we really say we have done anything to shore up the Medicare \nsystem which is desperately in need of an infusion if it is to remain \nviable for today's seniors, their children, and grandchildren?\n  Are we ever going to be able to pay down the debt?\n  Our colleagues in the House have suggested that 90 percent of the \nsurplus for this year go to debt reduction. That proposal was for this \nyear only, for fiscal year 2001, however, because they cannot do it \nover the next 10 years. Ten percent of the surplus would be $456 \nbillion. Congress may very well enact legislation in the next few years \nthat will exceed that amount by in excess of $100 billion.\n  We have already committed ourselves to more spending than the House \nof Representatives pledge would require using 90 percent of the surplus \nto pay down the national debt.\n  Mr. President, $100 billion is more money than most Americans can \never conceive of.\n  In a few short months, history will move forward again and we will \ngather together in the Chamber of the House of Representatives to greet \na newly elected President to hear his first State of the Union Address.\n  By almost any measure, the state of our Union is strong. Our economy \nis the envy of the world. Incomes are up. Unemployment is down. Home \nownership is up. Inflation is low. Mortgage rates remain modest.\n  As we await a new President, and the first State of the Union Address \nfrom that new President--the first new President elected in the 21st \ncentury--I am reminded of the historic State of the Union speech \ndelivered by President Clinton at the beginning of 1998.\n  To provide context from that time, we, as a nation, were on the verge \nof shifting from annual deficits to a hope for a promised projected \nsurplus. We were looking at a prospect we had not faced in years: What \ndo we do with a possible surplus?\n  In his 1998 State of the Union Address, President Clinton answered \nthat question. If I could quote from his eloquent words of that \nevening:\n\n       For three decades, six Presidents have come before you to \n     warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight, I \n     come before you to announce that the federal deficit--once so \n     incomprehensibly large that it had eleven zeros--will be, \n     simply, zero.\n       If we balance the budget for the next year, it is projected \n     that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that \n     immediately follow. What should we do with this projected \n     surplus?\n       I have a simple, four-word answer: Save Social Security \n     first.\n\n  Mr. President, that simple four-word answer, ``Save Social Security \nfirst,'' brought all of us to our feet in January of 1998. And, Mr. \nPresident at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, your greatest legacy will be the \nrestoration of fiscal discipline here in Washington.\n  Mr. President, you are being challenged as to the fidelity and \nsustainability of that commitment to fiscal discipline. We should now \nresist the temptation to allow the deficit monster to escape from the \ncage again.\n  We should give to President Clinton the rightful recognition for \nreversing decades of rampant borrowing and, as a result of that \ncourage, producing sustained national prosperity and the potential for \neven more prosperity.\n  But, Mr. President, at the end of your administration, we need you to \nremain true to the principles that have produced this legacy. If we in \nthe Congress are unable to exercise fiscal discipline, we will have to \nturn to you to provide us with the necessary restraints.\n  We are talking here about our children and our grandchildren. Are we \nagain going to return to the days when we expect them to pay our bills \nor are we going to accept the responsibility that virtually every \ngeneration of Americans--but for those who have lived in the last 30 \nyears--were prepared to accept? And that is that we would--each \ngeneration, each year--pay our bills and not ask future generations to \ndo so. That is the fundamental issue we face with this appropriations \nbill. Because I believe it fails to meet that test, I will vote no.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 25, 2000]\n\n                  Binges Becoming Regular Budget Fare\n\n                            (By Eric Pianin)\n\n       Rules created more than two decades ago to impose fiscal \n     restraint on Congress have broken down, helping fuel a year-\n     end spending spree that is resulting in billions of extra \n     dollars for highways and bridges, water projects, emergency \n     farm aid, school construction and scores of other projects.\n       Many budget hawks have derided the binge as a typical \n     election year ``porkfest.'' But key lawmakers and experts on \n     federal budgeting say another less visible problem is that \n     the law aimed at reining in such spending has been \n     effectively gutted by the congressional leadership.\n       In particular, lawmakers are increasingly ignoring the \n     annual congressional budge resolution, the document that is \n     supposed to guide spending and tax decisions in the House and \n     Senate every year. In years past, lawmakers might miss their \n     budget targets by a few billion dollars, but now they are \n     busting the budget by as much as $50 billion a year.\n       This year's budget resolution, for instance, called for \n     about $600 billion in spending this fiscal year on defense, \n     health, education and other non-entitlement programs. When \n     Congress and the White House finally complete their \n     negotiations, probably this week, the total will be $640 \n     billion or more.\n       One reason, lawmakers say, is that the GOP congressional \n     leadership has adopted--largely for political reasons--\n     unrealistic budgets that understate the amount of spending \n     members want. Another is that the emergence of big surpluses \n     has made Congress much less vigilant bout living within its \n     means--and more prone to make up the rules as it goes along.\n       ``I think the budget process has been destroyed and I \n     think, unfortunately, Republicans have been heavily numbered \n     among the assassins,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), a \n     veteran of budget skirmishes. ``I think we've made a mockery \n     of the process and it will be very difficult to revive it.''\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\n       Stanley Collender, a prominent expert on federal spending, \n     added: ``What we're seeing is budget decision-making by the \n     seat of their pants.''\n       Collender and other experts say the increased spending \n     being approved by Congress could begin to cut into projected \n     surpluses, leaving less for the spending and tax cut \n     initiatives proposed by Vice President Gore and Texas Gov. \n     George W. Bush. Outside of the Social Security program, \n     analysts have projected the federal government will run a \n     $2.2 trillion surplus over the next decade. But the Concord \n     Coalition, a bipartisan budget watchdog group, estimates that \n     the forecast surpluses are likely to shrink by two-thirds, to \n     about $172 billion, if congressional spending patterns \n     persist.\n       Congress is on track to boost non-defense discretionary \n     spending by 5.2 percent above the rate of inflation during \n     fiscal 2001--the sharpest spending increase of its type in 25 \n     years--according to a new analysis by Democrats on the House \n     Budget Committee.\n       The decision to ignore the budget resolution is only one \n     sign of a general brreakdown of fiscal discipline on Capitol \n     Hill, according to fiscal experts. Congress and the Clinton \n     administration are also ignoring spending caps both agreed to \n     as part of the 1997 legislation to balance the federal \n     budget.\n       Congress's enthusiasm for real budget constraints began to \n     wane almost as soon as deficits gave way to surpluses \n     beginning three years ago. Until then, the specter of \n     towering annual deficits of as much as $290 billion had \n     fostered a series of hardnosed policies, including a 1990 \n     budget deal that for the first time imposed caps on spending \n     and required Congress to offset tax cuts by reducing spending \n     or raising other revenue.\n       The emergence of surpluses has left it to lawmakers to \n     produce budget plans that would impose spending discipline \n     with an eye to the time when Medicare and Social Security \n     will begin to run short of money. But that has not happened.\n       In the politically charged environment of Capitol Hill, the \n     House and Senate budget committees in recent years produced \n     plans that budget experts say were more GOP political \n     manifestors than practical blueprints. The problem came to a \n     head in 1998, when House Budget Committee Chairman John R. \n     Kasich (Ohio), then a Republican presidential aspirant, \n     produced a House budget resolution so top-heavy with tax cuts \n     and tough on domestic spending that he could not sell it to \n     Senate Republicans or the White House.\n       For the first time in nearly 25 years, Congress completed \n     that year without a budget. The following year Republicans \n     managed to agree among themselves on a budget, but the \n     document was largely ignored by GOP leaders when they \n     negotiated a final spending agreement with the White House.\n       This year's plan was somewhat more pragmatic, but even so \n     it called for $150 billion of tax cuts--about twice what \n     Congress will finally settle for--and spending cuts in many \n     areas that GOP members of the appropriations committees \n     refused to accept.\n       Some of the additional funding this year will go for \n     emergencies, such as restoration of western forest lands hit \n     by fires last summer and security problems at the national \n     nuclear laboratory at Los Alamos, NM. But much of the \n     additional money will go to satisfy the election year demands \n     of Clinton and special projects sought by GOP and Democratic \n     lawmakers--ranging from $2 billion for extra highway and \n     bridge projects to $5 million for an insect-rearing facility \n     in Stoneville, Miss.\n       ``The budget process can only do what the political will \n     can support,'' said G. William Hoagland, the Republican staff \n     director of the Senate Budget Committee. ``I would argue \n     that, if anything, what this year shows is that you need a \n     [tough] budget process even more in times of surpluses than \n     in times of deficits.''\n       Another phenomenon in recent years has been a growing \n     propensity on the part of congressional leaders to overrule \n     key committees--even in promoting big policy changes. Last \n     year, for example, Republican leaders waited until late in \n     the year to unveil details of a plan to wall off the Social \n     Security surplus from the rest of the budget. They returned \n     from this year's August recess with a new idea for using \n     nine-tenths of next year's surplus for debt reduction.\n       While both proposals, arguably, will help to impose some \n     limitations on spending, they were presented without any \n     meaningful debate or review by the committees with \n     jurisdiction. House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.) \n     defended the practice, noting that ``the leadership can't \n     have any idea that holds water unless the [GOP] conference \n     holds it with them.''\n\n                           BUSTING THE BUDGET\n                          [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Budget      Actual     Excess\n              Fiscal year               resolution   spending   spending\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1997..................................        $528       $538        $10\n1998..................................         531        533          2\n1999..................................         533        583         50\n2000..................................         540        587         47\n2001..................................         600    \\1\\ 640        40\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Estimate.\n \nSource: Senate Budget Committee.\n\n                      THE CUBAN TRANSITION PROJECT\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator McConnell, \nChairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee in a \ncolloquy regarding an important project addressed in both the Senate \nand House Committee Reports. This project is the Cuban Transition \nProject located in Miami, FL.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would be pleased to engage in such a colloquy.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my purpose for entering into this colloquy \nis to seek clarification from the Chairman regarding the Conferees' \nintent to support the Cuban Transition Project. The House Committee \nReport states that it supports $3.5 million be provided through USAID \nfor this important initiative to provide policy makers, analysts and \nothers with accurate information and practical policy recommendations \nthat will be needed over a multi-year basis to assist this country in \npreparation for our next stage of interaction with the Cuban community \nand nation. The Senate Committee Report similarly supported this \nproject, and it is my understanding that you support this project and \nintend that it receive support from USAID.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct. Support for the Cuban Transition \nProject was clearly stated in both the House and Senate Reports, and it \nis the Committee's intention that the project be supported by USAID as \nindicated. This project is envisioned as a critical component as we \nprepare ourselves for dealing with Cuban issues in the future. It is \nour intent that the Cuban Transition Project receive funding this year.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for reiterating his support and \nclarifying the intent of the subcommittee. This project has the strong \nsupport of the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, \nand I know that this committee will also be expressing support to the \nagency. I would like to ask if you will be willing to further advise \nthe Agency formally of your position on this matter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the subcommittee will further clarify \nthis matter with USAID and I would be happy to work further on any \nconcerns that my colleague from Florida may have.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his comments.\n\n\n                           POLIO ERADICATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nSenator Leahy, ranking member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations \nSubcommittee. It is my understanding that the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee report recommended $30 million for the global polio \neradication campaign at USAID and the House recommended $25 million. It \nis also my understanding that the Child Survival and Disease Programs \nFund received a $248 million increase for Fiscal 2001 and that there \nare sufficient funds for the USAID to provide the $30 million for \nglobal polio eradication, am I correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, we have provided sufficient funds to fund polio \neradication at the Senate level of $30 million.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator work with me to ensure that the current \nUSAID Administrator and the Administrator in the new administration \nprovides $30 million for global polio eradication for fiscal 2001?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, I would be happy to work for the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Senator Leahy for your commitment and \nleadership on this issue.\n\n\n                         micronutrient funding\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Senator Leahy would \nengage in a brief colloquy about funding for USAID programs in \nmicronutrients?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would be delighted to do so with the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland, a member of the subcommittee.\n  Ms. MILKULSKI. It is my understanding that the conference report \ncurrently under consideration makes no reference to micronutrient \nprograms funded through the Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund. \nHowever, the Senate provided $30 million for this activity in its \nversion of H.R. 4811, while the House provided $25 million. Given that \nthe conference report before the Senate provides $963 million for child \nsurvival and disease prevention activities, an increase of almost $250 \nmillion that I strongly support, I was wondering if the Ranking\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\nMember would join me in working to obtain the Senate level of $30 \nmillion for micronutrient programs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would be happy to. As the Senator has correctly pointed \nout, the conference report includes a significant increase for child \nsurvival activities at USAID. AID is strongly encouraged to dedicate \nmore recourses to the micronutrient programs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the conference \nreport on the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.\n  I reluctantly voted against that conference report, because it \ncontained a provision dramatically increasing the budget caps, \neffectively throwing fiscal discipline to the wind.\n  But I want to go on record indicating that, if the amendment busting \nthe budget caps had not been included in the bill, my vote would have \nbeen an enthusiastic yes. Substantively, this is a remarkably good \nbill, and I commend the managers, Chairman McConnell and the ranking \nmember, Senator Leahy, as well as Chairman Callahan and Congresswoman \nPelosi for their excellent work.\n  An unprecedented commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS abroad and full \nfunding of the Administration's request for debt relief initiatives are \namong the many laudable provisions in the bill that complement this \nyear's authorizing work of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The conference report contains significant assistance for important \nfamily planning work, which can help to bring better health and \neconomic development to families and especially to women around the \nworld. Moreover, I am pleased to see that the bill does not contain \nrestrictive, so-called ``Mexico City'' language designed to limit what \nprivate organizations can do with funds raised from non-U.S. government \nsources.\n  During the debate on the Senate's version of this bill earlier this \nyear, I asked for, and received, the commitment of Senators McConnell \nand Leahy to pursue full funding for flood recovery assistance in \nMozambique and southern Africa, a region of the world utterly \ndevastated by a series of cyclones earlier this year. This was \nespecially tragic, because prior to the flooding, Mozambique had been \nmaking progress toward climbing out of poverty, enjoying economic \ngrowth rates of 10 percent per year. I want to thank both Senators for \nkeeping their word. This conference report contains $135 million in \nflood recovery assistance for the region. This is the right thing to \ndo.\n  I took a particular interest in the southern Africa issue, in part \nbecause I serve as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee's Subcommittee on African Affairs. In that same capacity, I \nhave joined with a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto insist that the Administration make accountability a top priority in \nthe context of our policy towards Sierra Leone. I am gratified to note \nthat the statement of the managers accompanying the conference report \nincludes language urging the State Department to provide support for \nthe Special War Crimes Court for Sierra Leone. The support of the \nForeign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee for this key \nCongressional priority in West Africa should not be overlooked.\n  In another area of interest, I note that the conference report \nretains language suspending certain types of military and security \nassistance to Indonesia until a set of conditions relating to the \ndisarmament and disbanding of militia forces and accountability for \ngross human rights abuses have been met. At the same time, it maintains \nan appropriate level of assistance for the people of East Timor, who \nare seeking to rebuild their communities and to fully realize their \nindependence each day.\n  Finally, the conference report provides strong support for the Peace \nCorps and for important development assistance accounts which, when \nresponsibly administered and monitored, can serve U.S. interests in \nbuilding a more stable, prosperous, and democratic world.\n  All of these sound provisions make it all the more unfortunate that \nthe bill has been tainted with the budget-busting amendment, so that my \nvote would have been an accurate reflection of my support for this \nbill. Too often in the past, the Congress has failed to understand the \ncritical link between U.S. engagement with the rest of the world and \nour national interests--our security, our health, our economic \nstability, and even our national values. This bill recognizes those \nlinks and moves in the right direction. It's a shame that a bill that \nmakes such sensible policy choices, so casually busts the budget caps \nthat we rely upon to ensure fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Conference \nReport for Foreign Operations Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2001.\n  The bill before us includes much that is good; in fact, it includes \nmuch that is important for our national security. For example, with the \nMiddle East experiencing a level of turmoil not witnessed since the \n1973 Yom Kippur War, the assistance in this bill for Israel and for \nother friends and allies in the region constitutes an essential \ncomponent of our policy there. Vital humanitarian assistance programs \nare funded, including debt relief for especially poor countries.\n  However, I cannot support this conference report because it raises \nfiscal year 2001 discretionary spending caps to $637 billion from the \n$600 billion that was provided for in the budget resolution passed in \nApril. Assuming that will be the new total amount of spending allowed, \nthat would be nearly $40 billion more than the budget resolution, $13 \nbillion more than what the President requested, and $50 billion more \nthan what was spent in fiscal year 2000.\n  In addition, there remains the usual plethora of parochially-driven \nspending directives. While the bill appears to avoid legally \nrestrictive earmarks, the effect of numerous provisions intended to do \nprecisely that: direct funds where Members of Congress want them to go, \nusually for parochial reasons. I will be submitting a list of such \nitems for the Record.\n  The decision to vote against this bill, irrespective of the usual \npork-barrel provisions, however, was difficult. I recognize the \nimportance of aid to Israel during this crucial period in its history, \nand I agree with the imperative of relieving the poorest countries of \nthe burden of their international debts. The fiscal irresponsibility of \nSection 701 of this bill adjusting the spending caps upward to \naccommodate greater levels of pork barrel spending is too much to \nignore. I'm not ignoring it, Mr. President. I oppose passage of this \nbill because I abhor the continuing disregard for fiscal responsibility \nit represents. And I abhor the cynicism illuminated by a decision to \nattach such fiscally irresponsible language to a spending bill so \nimportant to our national security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nearmarks, Member-adds, and directive language.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Conference Report on H.R. 4811, Foreign Operations Appropriations for \n    Fiscal Year 2001--Earmarks, Member-Adds, and Directive Language\n\n       International Fertilizer Development Center: $4 million;\n       United States Telecommunications Training Institute: \n     $500,000;\n       National Albanian American Council training program: $1.3 \n     million;\n       Section 536 Impact on Jobs in the United States: \n     restrictive language intended to curtail trade that adversely \n     affects employment in the United States;\n       Section 545 Purchase of American-Made Equipment and \n     Products: Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to \n     Congress on efforts by heads of Federal agencies to ensure \n     that directors of international financial institutions make \n     full use of American commodities, products and services;\n       Kiwanis/UNICEF Iodine Deficiency Program: $5 million;\n       University of California, San Fransisco: $500,000 to \n     develop detailed epidemiological HIV/AIDS profiles for \n     priority countries;\n       Gorgas Memorial Institute, University of Alabama: AID is \n     ``urged'' to work closely with the institute, drawing from \n     the $60 million alloted to address global health threat from \n     tuberculosis;\n       Notre Dame's Vector Biology Laboratory Tulane University's \n     Department of Tropical Medicine: AID is ``urged'' to direct \n     $2 million to these institutes to establish Centers of \n     Excellence for malaria research;\n       Carelift International: AID is ``urged'' to direct $7 \n     million to Carelift International;\n       University of Missouri-St. Louis International Laboratory \n     for Tropical Agriculture\n\n[[Page S10982]]\n\n     biotechnology program: AID is ``urged'' to allocate $1 \n     million;\n       University of California, Davis: AID is ``urged'' to \n     allocate $1 million for the university to train foreign \n     scientists;\n       Tuskegee University, Alabama: AID is ``urged'' to allocate \n     $1 million to establish a Center to Promote Biotechnology in \n     International Agriculture at Tuskegee University;\n       Marquette University, Wisconsin: AID is urged to allocate a \n     sum of money similar to that received under this bill as \n     other universities to the Les Aspin Center for Government;\n       United States Telecommunications Training Institute: \n     $500,000 ``should'' be made available for the institute;\n       Habitat for Humanity International: Department of State is \n     urged to coordinate with AID to ensure the program receives \n     $1.5 million;\n       Foundation for Environmental Security and Sustainability: \n     AID is ``urged'' to allocate $2.5 million to support \n     environmental threat assessments with interdisciplinary \n     experts and academicians;\n       Alfalit International: earmarks $1.5 million to combat \n     adult illiteracy;\n       University of San Fransisco: earmarks $1 million for the \n     Center for Latin American Trade Expansion to assist in the \n     development of trade promotion initiatives;\n       Patrick Leahy War Victims Fund: earmarks $12 million;\n       American Center for Oriental Research: DoS and AID are \n     ``urged'' to allocate $2 million for the center, \n     headquartered in Amman, Jordan, with operations in Boston, \n     MA;\n       Dartmouth Medical School: AID is ``urged'' to allocate \n     $750,000 for a joint program with the University of Pristina \n     to help restore educational programs;\n       Florida State University: AID is ``urged'' to allocate $2 \n     million for a distance learning program;\n       Synchrotron Light Source Particle Accelerator project \n     (SESAME): ``the managers intend that $15 million of the funds \n     made available for Armenia should support this or a \n     comparable project.''

Mr. President, in June of this year I expressed my \ndispleasure with the foreign operations appropriations bill when it \ncame to the floor of the Senate. The overall funding level was too low, \nsecurity assistant accounts were unfunded, burdensome conditions were \nplaced on contributions to international organizations and an \ninadequate appropriation was made for debt relief.\n  I'm pleased to find that the conference report has corrected some of \nthese problems in a very satisfactory way. Appropriators have done the \nright thing on debt relief, by fully funding the amounts requested. As \nthe wealthiest nation in the world, there is no excuse for us ignoring \nthe plight of the world's poorest countries which are laboring under an \nuntenable debt burden.\n  I'm also relieved to see that the overall funding level of the bill \ncomes far closer to the administration's request than the bill that the \nSenate passed in June. That bill, to my dismay, was $1.7 billion short \nof what was asked for. The conference report is a vast improvement. It \nis still some $200 million below what the executive branch has \nprojected that it will need to undertake foreign operations. Obviously \nthis is quite a large sum and there is a very serious need for Congress \nto reverse the trend of undercutting State Department and Agency for \nInternational Development programs. However the conference report \nbrings the money requested and the money appropriated substantially \ncloser.\n  The bill contains a provision for assistance to Serbia with which I \nam in agreement. To unilaterally lift sanctions, or to open up the aid \nspigot fully would be both premature and naive. The United States \nshould adopt the more measured response reflected in this provision. \nThe language in the conference report sends the right message that we \nmust condition our aid to the new regime in Serbia until it has clearly \ndemonstrated that it will cooperate with the Hague War Crimes Tribunal, \nrespect the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and not undermine \nthe Dayton Accords, and that it will unequivocally renounce the use of \nforce in Kosovo and take steps to implement policies that reflect a \nrespect for minorities and rule of law.\n  Finally Mr. President, let me say that I am also relieved to see that \nthe level of funding dedicated to the Non-proliferation, Anti-\nterrorism, De-mining and Related Programs (NADR) has been increased \nsubstantially. The amount is almost $100 million more than the level in \nthe Senate passed bill, and slightly higher than the President's \nrequest. Although I would like to see more resources dedicated to the \nInternational Science and Technology Centers program, I welcome the \nplus up in the larger account. These programs are a crucial element in \nour strategy to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, and combat \nterrorism.\n  One NADR account that received more than the amount requested was \nexport control assistance, and I truly applaud that. The assistance \nthat we give to other countries in developing export control laws, \nregulations, and enforcement is absolutely crucial from the non-\nproliferation standpoint, and it can also help combat international \nterrorism. As we plus up that program, however, we must remember to \nprovide the personnel to implement it. Many of those personnel are in \nthe Department of Commerce, and more are needed. Unless appropriators \nprovide elsewhere the requested 7 additional personnel (which \ntranslates into 5 additional FTE in Fiscal Year 2001) for the Bureau of \nExport Administration, the additional funds that we make available in \nthis bill simply will not be implemented as effectively as we would \nwish.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Conference report. It has taken some time to \nreach an agreement satisfactory to all interested parties, but I \nbelieve that the bill before us goes a long way toward advancing \nAmerican interests abroad. Furthermore, this bill contains important \nprovisions to help poor and vulnerable world citizens.\n  First of all, I am especially pleased that appropriators have agreed \nto fully fund the President's debt relief package for third world \ncountries, and that language has been included to allow the \nInternational Monetary Fund to release $800 million from the sale of \ngold reserves so that the interest earned on the proceeds can be put to \nwork providing debt forgiveness to heavily indebted poor nations in \nAfrica and parts of Latin America. The burden of external debt has \nbecome a major impediment to economic development and poverty reduction \nin many of the world's poorest countries--a reality I have witnessed \nfirst-hand throughout my travels in Latin America. Until recently, the \nUnited States government and other creditors sought to address this \nproblem by rescheduling loans, and in some cases, providing limited \ndebt reduction. Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of \nthe poorest countries has continued to grow beyond their ability to \nrepay, and thus, developing economies are struggling. And, even worse, \nit is the most vulnerable citizens in these fledgling democracies that \nare suffering from this debt. When already poor governments are \ninvesting vast amounts of their budgets in debt maintenance, little \nremains for social services for those most in need. As a result, women, \nchildren, and the poor end up suffering and living in want.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have supported efforts to \ntarget assistance for programs designed to address the special needs \nand concerns of the poor, and I am grateful that we have had some \nsuccess in this undertaking. United States assistance programs, \ntogether with other international aid efforts, have made basic human \nnecessities available to many of those most in need. However, I believe \nthat the debt reduction initiatives included in the Foreign Operations \nbill\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\ntoday build upon that success, and hope that they will dramatically \nincrease the quality of life for citizens in indebted countries. We \nstill have a long way to go to ensure that all people live free of \nhunger and want, but I think that today we are taking a dramatic leap \nforward toward that end.\n  I am also pleased with the increase in funding for children's health \nprograms included in this bill. This conference report provides $963 \nmillion for child survival and disease programs, $413 million more than \nthe administration requested. Besides providing funding of $110 million \nfor UNICEF, this money will be used for immunization programs, prenatal \ncare, polio eradication, combating illegal trafficking in women and \nchildren, and the establishment of orphanages for displaced children. \nMy colleagues know of my deep commitment to child welfare both at home \nand abroad. Indeed, too often children are overlooked because they do \nnot vote and have no voice in our political system. I am extremely \nhappy that children's welfare programs have been so generously funded \nin this bill, and hope that this represents a trend that will continue \nin the years to come.\n  Finally, I would like to comment on the family planning provisions in \nthe bill. I believe the problem of overpopulation is an extremely \nimportant issue and population stabilization is crucial to the well-\nbeing of the planet. Overpopulation threatens to exert tremendous \nsocial, ecological, medical, and economic hardship on much of the \nworld, and we must take strong action to limit it.\n  For families living under the conditions that exist in many \ndeveloping nations, family planning is critical. Without it, mothers \nhave great difficulty spacing their births and limiting the number of \nchildren they bear and, as a result, they suffer the tremendous \nphysical stress of repeated childbirth--often without the aid of \nphysicians or midwives. Furthermore, women are not the only ones who \nsuffer in these cases; their children suffer too. Children in large \nfamilies find themselves competing for food with other siblings. As a \nresult, they suffer from higher incidents of malnutrition and hunger.\n  Under the compromise included in the conference report, family \nplanning groups abroad can finally use their own money to provide \nfamily planning services, although the restriction on federal funding \nof abortions continues. In addition, Congress has boosted the general \nfunding available for international family planning from $370 million \nto $425 million which will be available for expenditure after February \n15, 2001. By helping women avoid pregnancy before conception, this \nfunding will help mothers in developing countries better plan their \nchild rearing, and will reduce the number of abortions performed \nannually. Moreover, it will ensure that every child born is a wanted \nchild and will reduce the number of children born to parents who do not \nhave the resources to care for them.\n  I believe that this is a good bill. It helps those who need it most, \nand provides funding for our international priorities. It includes \nmoney to help end the devastation of AIDS in Africa, assists women, \nchildren, and the poor, and allows governments to finally get out of \nthe shadow of crushing debt that both economic circumstance and \nmismanagement caused to be accrued. On balance, the programs funded in \nthis appropriations bill advance America's foreign policy and national \nsecurity interests. In short, it is good for the people of the world, \nand the people of America. When we invest pro-actively in global \nstability we encourage peace and commerce, and everybody wins. For \nthese reasons, I will vote in favor of this bill and encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Subcommittee to express my strong support for \nthis conference report. I want to extend my congratulations to Senator \nLeahy and Senator McConnell as this is clearly one of the best Foreign \nOperations bills produced in recent years.\n  This is a good bill which will advance U.S. interests on many fronts. \nThis is a good bill for my constituents who are engaged in global \naffairs in everything from international trade to humanitarian relief \nefforts. This is always a tough bill to finish because it address \nseveral very controversial issues. Unlike years past, however, this \nbill is being widely praised by both parties and by the Administration. \nAgain, that is a tribute to the leaders of our subcommittee who worked \nso hard to bridge very difficult issues.\n  Perhaps the most significant agreement within this bill is the \ncommitment to fulfill U.S. obligations on debt relief. By providing the \nrequested $435 million for debt relief, this Congress is sending a \npowerful message to the poorest countries in the world. The U.S. and \nthe international community, by following through on debt relief to the \nworld's poorest citizens, can give new hope to millions of people. I am \nproud to have supported this effort. And I am so proud of my \nconstituents who embraced campaigns like Jubilee 2000 which made debt \nrelief an issue no one could ignore.\n  I want to single out one gentleman in particular who touched so many \nof us here on Capitol Hill with his work. The Reverend David Duncombe \nfrom White Salmon, Washington was a heroic champion for debt relief. On \ntwo occasions in the last year, Reverend Duncombe staged hunger strikes \nhere in Washington, D.C. to demonstrate the effects of starvation on \nthe human body. Reverend Duncombe visited my office almost every \nWednesday morning when he was in Washington, D.C. He stood before us \nall, day after day, in solidarity with the millions of people affected \nby this issue. Passage of debt relief is a genuine tribute to people \nlike David Duncombe who rallied Americans to the debt relief cause all \nacross our country. I'm proud Americans came together to ensure our \nforeign aid dollars will make a difference for poor citizens around the \nworld.\n  I am strongly in support of this bill's increased funding for \ninternational family planning. This bill also repeals the global \n``Gag'' order which has crippled our international family planning \nefforts in previous bills. We know that more and more women in the \ndeveloping world are starting businesses and contributing to the \neconomic health of families. These women want access to family planning \nprograms and information to build strong, sustainable families. It is \ntime to take our domestic political debate out of the international \nfamily planning appropriations process once and for all. International \nfamily planning programs help save the lives of women throughout the \nworld. International family planning in a health issue and should be \ntreated that way.\n  This bill is also strong in the area of export promotion. This bill \nprovides more than $900 million to the Export-Import Bank of the United \nStates which facilitates job creating exports from throughout our \ncountry. Other trade promotion entities like OPIC and TDA will receive \nincreased funding under this bill as well. These programs are tangible, \nreal proof that our foreign aid program generates jobs and economic \nopportunity for Americans.\n  There's so much more in this bill which will benefit America's \ninterests. We continue our strong program of microcredit lending. Our \ncommitment to UNICEF and important organizations like the Peace Corps \ncontinues with this bill. And we are providing increased funding to \nconfront AIDS, tuberculosis and other health threats to the developing \nworld. I am particularly supportive of the bill's $50 million \ncontribution to the Global Alliance for Vaccines & Immunizations. The \nForeign Operations Subcommittee has devoted much energy to the GAVI \neffort, and I encourage the Senate to continue its involvement in this \npromising program.\n  Our efforts to assist Russia and the former Soviet states as they \ncontinue to struggle with reform are key parts of this bill. Washington \nstate is particularly interested in the Russian Far East. This bill \nfunds democracy-building initiatives, economic transition and other \nprograms for most regions of the former Soviet Union. It's frustrating \nwork, but I support this assistance because it is important to our \nnational interest. In other parts of the world, this bill funds human \nrights work, environmental protection programs, and other important \ndemocracy-building initiatives. From Burma to Serbia to Latin America, \nthis bill works to advance America's interests in so many areas.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HUTCHINSON). Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S10984]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, does the Senator from Florida still \nhave time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield back my 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is there any other time remaining under the agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Leahy has 9 minutes. Senator Byrd and \nSenator Stevens have 5 minutes each remaining.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier I had mentioned Robin Cleveland and \nTim Rieser. I also want to thank Jennifer Chartrand and Billy Piper on \nthe Republican side, who are always very helpful and did a superb job. \nOn the Democratic side, Mark Lippert, who recently joined my staff from \nthe Democratic Policy Committee, is mastering the Appropriations \nCommittee process. I saw Jay Kimmitt on the floor earlier of the \ncommittee staff. Not only is he a good friend but a repository of all \nknowledge and the one to whom we can all turn when we need to know just \nhow to get out of whatever mess we have stumbled into.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank Tim Rieser and Mark Lippert, a \nrepresentative of Senator Leahy's staff, Jennifer Chartrand, and, of \ncourse, my longtime associate, Robin Cleveland, and Billy Piper as \nwell, for their great work on this bill. I thank Senator Leahy. It was \ngood to work with him again this year.\n  Having said that, I understand there are 5 minutes that Senator \nStevens has reserved. I am told he is happy for me to yield that time \nback.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I also yield \nback the time of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me also thank Jay Kimmitt, majority appropriations \nstaff, for his outstanding work as well. With that, I believe we are \nready.\n  Mr. President, I will propound a unanimous consent request before we \ngo to the vote. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe vote regarding the foreign operations conference report, to be \nfollowed by 4 minutes of debate with closing remarks with respect to \nthe pending Feingold amendment to S. 2508 and that vote immediately \noccur following those closing remarks, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the continuing resolution.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Therefore, Mr. President, there will be three back-to-\nback rollcall votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mr. \nAshcroft), the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns), the Senator from \nTennessee (Mr. Frist), the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Grams), and the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMontana (Mr. Burns) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2508.\n  Pending:\n\n       Campbell Amendment No. 4303, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Feingold Amendment No. 4326 (to Amendment No. 4303), to \n     improve certain provisions of the bill.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold and I \nhave 2 minutes to address the Senate before the vote on the motion to \ntable Feingold amendment No. 4326.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4326\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My amendment is supported by the administration because \nit improves the bill. It actually makes the bill comply with Federal \nreclamation and environmental laws. It makes it clear that only the \nfeatures of the latest version of the Animas-La Plata Project will be \nconstructed, and the result of that, my colleagues, will be a better \nreturn for the taxpayers than the underlying measure. This is \nimportant.\n  The Ute and Navajo tribes will have their claims settled and paid \nfor, even under my substitute, 100 percent by the Federal Government, \nbut the nontribal water recipients will have to repay their share of \nthe construction, fish and wildlife mitigation, and recreation costs. \nThat kind of repayment is only fair. It is what other water users and \nother projects such as the California central valley and central Utah \nhave to pay.\n  If my colleagues will look at the fact, this is not unprecedented. \nThis is actually the way other water projects are handled now. The \nwater users have to pay these fair costs. This amendment not only does \nnot kill the bill, it just makes sure there is a fair opportunity for \ncourt review. The bill does not undercut; the non-Native American users \nactually pay their fair share.\n\n  Most importantly, this greatly expanded project that has now been \nscaled down to a reasonable level does not somehow get put back into \nthis large wasteful project. It is both strong in terms of \nenvironmental concern and very strong in terms of the taxpayers.\n  I hope by supporting this, my colleagues, the Senator from Colorado \ncould have this water project that he has worked on for so long, but \nthat it be done in a responsible way which the administration supports.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am joined by Senator Bingaman, Senator \nDomenici, and Senator Allard in asking the Senate to support our \nversion of the Animas-La Plata water project by voting to table the \nFeingold amendment. In 2 minutes they will not have time to speak, but \nI believe I am speaking for them.\n  Our version of S. 2508 is truly bipartisan. By the way, it is not an \nexpanded project. This is a much more reduced project. The Republican \nGovernor and the Democratic attorney general of Colorado strongly \noppose the Feingold amendment. By voting to table the Feingold \namendment, we will leave intact a bipartisan version of S. 2508, \nsupported by the administration, the States of Colorado and New Mexico, \nthe Ute tribes of Colorado, the Navajo nation, and rural and municipal \nwater users of southwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico.\n  In doing so, we will be saving the taxpayers over $400 million by \ndownsizing the currently planned Animas-La Plata water project. If the \nFeingold amendment is not tabled, most of those entities will withdraw \ntheir crucial support\n\n[[Page S10985]]\n\nfor the historic compromise and it will be dead.\n  If the Feingold amendment is adopted and the compromise collapses, \nthen our only option for satisfying the tribal water right claims will \nbe to build the entire huge Animas-La Plata water project as authorized \nin 1968.\n  In addition to killing our bipartisan solution to a regional water \nconflict, the Feingold amendment unfairly singles out rural water users \nand small municipalities in both of our States to pay higher costs for \ntheir domestic water supplies than the residents of big cities such as \nPhoenix and Tucson that are served by the central Arizona and central \nUtah projects, which were also authorized in 1968 at the same time the \nAnimas-La Plata Project was authorized.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, the Feingold \namendment sends the wrong message by penalizing a region for \nparticipating in historic water rights settlement. If the Feingold \namendment is not tabled, there will only be losers because the Indians \nand non-Indians will be locked into needless and expensive litigation \nand taxpayers will have to pay the costs of litigation on both sides. \nTherefore, I ask my colleagues to join with me, along with Senators \nBingaman, Domenici, and Allard, to support our bipartisan effort in \nvoting to table the Feingold amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next votes in the series be limited \nto 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I move to table the amendment of the Senator from \nWisconsin, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n4326.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I rise today to congratulate my \ncolleague from Colorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, on the \npassage of S. 2508, the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 2000. \nThis important Indian water rights settlement would never have gotten \nas far as it has in the Senate without the hard work and dilligence of \nSenator Campbell. As chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and a member of the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee, I know how difficult it is to reach consensus on Indian \nwater rights settlements. It takes a great deal of knowledge, \ndedication and downright hard work to get these kinds of bills through \ncommittee and onto the Senate floor and while the work can be \nfrustrating, the rewards of a job well done are the appreciation of the \nTribe and the water users. Senator Campbell should reap those rewards. \nThis settlement has been a long time coming and I hope the House of \nRepresentatives will look favorably on the hard work that has been done \nhere and\n\n[[Page S10986]]\n\npass this bill expeditiously so that it will make it to the White House \nand be signed into law.\n  My only regret is that this bill has taken so long to pass the \nSenate. Fulfilling this commitment to the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes \nand the Colorado water users never should have taken this long. The \nsettlement agreement was signed in 1986 and now--finally--after 15 \nyears of foot dragging and outright obstruction by outside groups, a \nbill to implement the agreement passes the Senate. The history of this \nunfulfilled promise is not a good one. For the past 15 years, numerous, \nand duplicative studies have been required, each of which resulted in \nsubstantial reductions in water to be diverted and stored in the \nAnimas-La Plata project. The tribes, in order to get a project, have \nagreed to substantial modification of their rights under the 1986 \nagreement and 1988 Settlement Act to make this proposal work. The cost \nof the project has been cut by almost two thirds, yet opponents of the \nproject are still unhappy. I wonder what would make them happy--\ncomplete and total derogation of the Federal Government's obligation to \nthe tribes? I know Senator Campbell would not let that happen and I \nwould certainly support him in his efforts.\n  This bill, as passed today, represents the best hope for the United \nStates to do right by the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes at this point and \nI am pleased to vote for it. I again congratulate Senator Campbell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10986-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the impact the \nInternet is having on database producers and the lack of Intellectual \nProperty protection we provide to creators of databases, in particular. \nThis is an issue that deserves the Senate's attention, and I will be \nencouraging the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, to \nhold hearings early next year to examine this issue in detail.\n\n[[Page S10987]]\n\n  Intellectual Property laws are about striking a balance between our \nneed to encourage invention and creativity with a public policy that \ndiscourages the use of monopoly power. Our founding fathers recognized \nthe importance of national patent and copyright laws in Article 1, \nSection 8 of the United States Constitution. Similarly, we have a long \ntradition of protecting the public from monopolistic abuses through our \nAntitrust laws, starting with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.\n  Through our copyright and patent laws, we allow artists and inventors \nto have monopolies of limited duration on their creations and \ninventions, which can have the short-term effect of limiting access by \nconsumers. However, these exclusive rights give artists and inventors \nincentive to create more--ultimately to the benefit of the public at \nlarge. Our thriving economy and the success of our country's technology \nsector is evidence that we have reached an appropriate balance between \nexclusive rights and consumer access.\n  However, the balance has shifted with the emergence of new \ntechnology. Digital technology, for example, allows an individual to \ncopy huge volumes of data from anonymous sources and then distribute it \nalmost immediately all over the world through the Internet.\n  I am very concerned about the utter lack of protection for \nindividuals and companies who invest substantial resources in gathering \nand organizing large volumes of data or information. These databases \nwere, at one time, protected by our copyright laws under a legal theory \nknown as ``sweat-of-the-brow.'' This policy protected collections of \ninformation from theft and recognized that significant resources often \nwere spent in collecting and organizing information. In 1991, the \nSupreme Court overturned the sweat-of-the-brow protection and said that \nonly ``original'' works are covered by copyright law. This ruling, \ncoupled with the ease of copying and distributing databases over the \nInternet, have created a significant problem with theft or ``piracy'' \nof databases. The creators of stolen databases are usually left with \nonly piece-meal protections and often have no recourse whatsoever.\n  I share the concerns of those who believe that database protection \nlegislation could limit the access of consumers to information, and I \ncertainly will not support legislation that harms consumers. However, \nMr. President, I believe that this is a case where our policies are out \nof balance.\n  Information is a resource that becomes much more valuable when it is \norganized in a coherent way. Database companies devote substantial \nresources to collecting, organizing, and maintaining information for \nusers. Without such investments, vast quantities of data would be \nincomprehensible and almost unusable. We must give the companies that \ncreate these databases some sort of exclusive right to enjoy the \nbenefits of their hard work and investment.\n  Without granting some exclusive right to database producers, \ninvestment in databases will diminish over time, as more and more \ndatabases are copied and distributed by pirates. Ultimately, the \nreliability of information available to consumers over the Internet \nwould be undermined.\n  This potential for unreliability has serious real-life implications. \nFor example, emergency room staff and parents use databases to identify \npoisons and their remedies; doctors use them to find specifics about a \nmedical procedure; farmers use them for weather and soil information; \nlawyers use them to find cases and precedents; pharmacists use them to \ndetect dangerous drug interactions; chemists use them to test new \ncompounds; workers use them to find new jobs; and home buyers use them \nto find the right house. If these databases are not available or are \ninaccurate, it is the consumer who loses. As with all of our \nintellectual property rights, some small limitations on consumer access \nin the short-term will produce significant long-term advantages and \nincreased access to accurate information.\n  This is not a new issue for the Senate. Two years ago, in the 105th \nCongress, a serious effort was made to pass legislation that would \nlimit database piracy. Judiciary Committee Chairman Hatch hosted \nextensive negotiations between all interested parties. Unfortunately, a \ncompromise on database protection could not be reached. At the last \nminute, the database provisions were dropped from the conference report \nfor the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n  When we passed the DMCA, I came to the Floor and expressed my \ndisappointment that we could not reach a consensus on a database \nprovision. Judiciary Committee Chairman Hatch and the Ranking Member \nLeahy also expressed their disappointment. I asked, and Senator Hatch \nagreed, that the Judiciary Committee address the database bill early in \nthe 106th Congress. Unfortunately, despite efforts particularly in the \nHouse of Representatives to reach an agreement, conflicts in the \nindustry remain. We have not been able to consider such a bill during \nthis Congress. Now, with only a few days left, it appears that we will \nnot consider database protection at all this year.\n  I believe that we should start fresh on database legislation early \nnext year. I ask Chairman Hatch for his commitment that the Judiciary \nCommittee will hold a hearing on this important matter in the Spring. \nFor my part, I will do everything I can to draw attention to this \nmatter. I will continue working toward a solution that protects \ndatabases from piracy while protecting the rights of consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10987-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10987-S10988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleague, \nSenator Helms, in expressing my strong support for this legislation to \nbenefit international broadcasting employees.\n  The bill is important for several reasons. A new special immigrant \nvisa class will be established to cover individuals working in the \nUnited States for the International Broadcasting Bureau or one of the \ngrantee organizations affiliated with the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors. Included among the grantee organizations are the well-\nrespected Radio Free Asia, the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe.\n  In creating a special immigrant visa category, we are making a \nconcerted effort to address the recruitment shortages plaguing these \nworthwhile broadcasting organizations. This legislation will help to \nattract qualified foreign employees for available positions with the \ninternational broadcasting industry here in the United States.\n  The mission of the United States with respect to international \nbroadcasting makes it important for us to be able to attract and retain \na large number of foreign language broadcasters. They must have a \nunique combination of journalistic skills, including fluency in various \nlanguages and an in-depth knowledge of the people, history and cultures \nof other nations. To carry out its mission, the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors and its grantees must employ a minimum of 3,400 broadcasters \nand support staff, such as reporters, writers, translators, editors, \nproducers, announcers, and news analysts.\n  Historically, the Broadcasting Board of Governors has been unable to \nobtain sufficient numbers of U.S. workers with the rare combination of \nskills needed for this mission. As a result, we have had to look to \nother nations to attract the necessary talent.\n  No current visa category exists which properly suits the needs of the \ninternational broadcasting industry. Neither the H-1B nor J-1 non-\nimmigrant visas are appropriate for the Broadcasting Board of Governors \nto use as a means to recruit foreign broadcasters and support \npersonnel. Each of these categories has restrictions which make it \ndifficult to recruit qualified applicants.\n  This legislation overcomes these problems by adding a special \nimmigrant category under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Up to one \nhundred immigrant visas will be available each fiscal year for foreign \nnationals employed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Spouses and \ndependent children will also be able to benefit from this legislation.\n  This proposal will provide significant assistance for the \ninternational broadcasting industry in meeting its goals and \nrecruitment needs in providing essential news coverage for many of the \nmost dangerous regions of the world. The people employed by \norganizations\n\n[[Page S10988]]\n\nlike Radio Free Asia, the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe are \nexceptionally talented and courageous. They and their families make \nsubstantial sacrifices, and they put themselves at great personal risk \nto carry out their important responsibilities. These dedicated men and \nwomen deserve our full support. I strongly urge my colleagues to pass \nthis needed legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10988-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the 106th Congress is about to adjourn \nwithout passing critical legislation to reduce the level of gun \nviolence in this country.\n  Over the last years, the American people have been demanding that \ntheir schools, places of worship, and other public places be better \nprotected from gun violence. Congress had an opportunity to address the \ngun violence problem in our country by passing sensible gun laws that \nwould help ensure that young people or those with criminal backgrounds \ndo not illegally gain access to firearms. In the end, Congress failed \nthe American people.\n  It is very disappointing that Congress refused to act on the issue of \ngun violence. Too many senseless shootings have put our sense of safety \nin jeopardy. Here are just some of the high profile shootings that took \nplace during this session of Congress, and the casualties that occurred \nas a result.\n  In the year 1999:\n  January 14, an office building, Salt Lake City, Utah, one dead, one \ninjured;\n  March 18, a law office, Johnson City, Tennessee, two dead;\n  April 15, a library, Salt Lake City, Utah, three dead, four injured;\n  April 20, a high school, Littleton, Colorado, 15 dead, 23 injured;\n  May 20, a high school, Conyers, Georgia, six injured;\n  June 3, a grocery store, Las Vegas, Nevada, four dead;\n  June 11, a psychiatrist's office, Southfield, Michigan, three dead, \nfour injured;\n  July 4, multiple locations, Illinois and Indiana, three dead, nine \ninjured;\n  July 29, two day trading firms, Atlanta, Georgia, 13 dead, 13 \ninjured;\n  August 5, two office buildings, Pelham, Alabama, three dead;\n  August 10, a Jewish Community Center, Los Angeles, California, five \ninjured, and later in the same day, one dead;\n  September 14, a hospital, Anaheim, California, three dead;\n  September 15, a church, Fort Worth, Texas, eight dead, seven injured;\n  November 2 an office building, Honolulu, Hawaii, seven dead;\n  November 3, a shipyard, Seattle, Washington, two dead, two injured;\n  December 6, a middle school, Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, four injured; and\n  December 30, a hotel, Tampa, Florida, five killed, three injured.\n  In the year 2000:\n  January 23, a Sikh temple, El Sobrante, California, one dead, one \ninjured;\n  February 14, a sandwich shop, Littleton, Colorado, two dead;\n  February 29, an elementary school, Flint, Michigan, one dead;\n  March 1, several locations, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, three dead, \ntwo injured;\n  March 8, the scene of a fire, Memphis, Tennessee, four dead, two \ninjured;\n  March 10, a high school dance, Savannah, Georgia, two dead, one \ninjured;\n  March 24, a State office building, Effingham, Illinois, two dead;\n  April 18, a seniors home, Lincoln Park, Michigan, two dead, one \ninjured;\n  April 24, a zoo, Washington, D.C., seven injured;\n  April 28, several locations, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, five killed, \none injured;\n  April 28, a restaurant and hotel, Salt Lake City, Utah, two dead, \nthree injured;\n  May 11, a middle school, Prairie Grove, Arkansas, two injured;\n  May 17, a ball park, Ozark, Alabama, two dead, one injured;\n  May 26, a middle school, Lake Worth, Florida, one dead;\n  June 25, a basketball court, Chicago, Illinois, seven injured;\n  August 28, a professor's office, Fayetteville, Arkansas, two dead;\n  September 7, a sewage lagoon, Bunker, Missouri, two dead, two \ninjured;\n  September 24, a high school, outside Seattle, Washington, one \ninjured;\n  September 26, a middle school, New Orleans Louisiana, two injured;\n  October 20, a courthouse, Yreka, California, one dead, two injured; \nand\n  October 23, a pizzeria in New Baltimore, Michigan, one dead.\n  Gun violence is a critical issue that the majority of Americans care \nabout deeply. The will of the majority can be frustrated in the short \nrun, but not in the long run. This issue will not go away. If this \nCongress will not pass legislation addressing gun violence in America, \nI am confident that another Congress will, and I will continue to work \ntoward that objective.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10988-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10988-S10989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARDS YUGOSLAVIA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the volatile \nsituation in Yugoslavia. Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslav dictator is \nhistory. The long nightmare is over. The Serbian people have spoken \nand, although Milosevic's ultimate fate is still uncertain, Kostunica's \nvictory marks a sea change in Serbia's current history, a clear choice \nfor democratic change over a stagnant and morally bankrupt \ndictatorship.\n  As Kostunica works hard to secure and stabilize his fledgling \ngovernment, the final outcome is not yet certain. The United States \nmust not fumble the opportunity to support the new Serbian government \nas it navigates a potentially treacherous transition. With Milosevic's \nparty still controlling the Serb parliament and Milosevic himself still \nlurking in the political shadows, we must engage in an open and \nconstructive dialogue with Kostunica and his allies.\n  To this end, I welcome the recent move by the administration to lift \nsome of the sanctions that specifically targeted the Milosevic regime, \nnamely the flight ban and the oil embargo, while retaining the so-\ncalled ``outer wall'' of sanctions. I also commend the State \nDepartment's decision to send a delegation to Belgrade to discuss the \nKostunica government's assistance needs.\n  Mr. President, extending a helping hand does not, however, mean \ngiving Kostunica and his new government a free pass when it comes to \naccounting for the terrible crimes of the Milosevic regime. To \nunilaterally lift all sanctions, or to open up the aid spigot fully \nwould be both premature and naive. Instead, the United States should \nadopt a more measured response, recognizing as well the fact that a too \nforward-leaning or heavy handed policy could risk undermining Kostunica \nbefore he is able to consolidate power. The following immediate steps \nwould, I believe, help lay the correct groundwork for future \ncooperation.\n  First, the United States must maintain its insistence that Milosevic \nbe delivered to the Hague to stand trial for war crimes. Anything less \nwould fatally undermine the International Tribunal.\n  Second, even as we congratulate Mr. Kostunica and recognize him as an \ninestimable improvement over his predecessor, we must emphasize to him \nthat his democratic credentials alone will not be a sufficient \nqualification for Serbia to reenter the international community. A \nKostunica government must fully respect the independence of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and not undermine the Dayton Accords. Kostunica's recent \nmeeting in Sarajevo with the three members of Bosnia's collective \npresidency gives some grounds for optimism. Serbia must also \nunequivocally renounce the use of force in Kosovo and take steps to \nimplement policies that reflect a respect for minorities and rule of \nlaw.\n  The foreign operations bill for fiscal year 2001 will, in fact, \ncondition U.S. assistance to Serbia on meeting the above benchmarks. I \nsupport this section of the bill because it is the right thing to do \nand the right message to send. But while we should remain firm in our \npolicy, we must also be flexible in our evaluation, recognizing what \nKostunica is able to do and what he is unable to do while pro-Milosevic \nforces still wield considerable power in the Serbian government.\n  Third, the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe must be given a jolt. \nToo much time has been wasted on conferences and working groups. \nAssistance must begin to flow in the next few months. A long-needed \nmeasure to help the front-line states would be a crash-effort to clear \nthe Danube River of\n\n[[Page S10989]]\n\nbombed-out bridges, thereby reopening vital trade links from Bulgaria \nand Romania to Western Europe.\n  Finally, we should strongly encourage the European Union to make good \non this commitment to expand its membership to candidates as soon as \nthey meet the qualifications. In Southeastern Europe this means Hungary \nand Slovenia. Brussels must not squander a once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity.\n  Mr. President, there is another reason I wanted to take the floor \ntoday, one that touches on the future of our commitment to the Balkans \nand, indeed, to a stable and secure Europe.\n  As we continue to work towards a Serbia that will meet the necessary \ncriteria to rejoin the community of western democracies, it is just as \nimportant to remember why we are engaged in the Balkans in the first \nplace. This is, after all, an election year, a time when Americans \nshould rightly question the policies and decisions of the current \nadministration when making their decision about the next.\n  U.S. military engagement on the European continent since the end of \nWorld War II has provided the security umbrella under which democracy \nand free-market capitalism have been able to develop and flourish. The \nBalkans, however, are a world away from that reality, the last \nremaining area of instability in Europe. During the last decade several \nhundred thousand people have been killed in three bloody wars there. \nThe NATO-led peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo are designed \nto provide the same kind of umbrella as in post-war Western Europe to \nallow democracy, civil society, and capitalism to take root and \ndevelop.\n  Without American leadership, this region would most likely still be \nmired in civil war, ethnic cleansing, and ultra-nationalist aggression, \nwith Milosevic firmly ensconced at the center of it all.\n  I remember well when in September 1992, reacting to the mass murders \nan ethnic cleansing that Milosevic directed in Croatia and Bosnia, I \ncalled for lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia and, six months \nlater, for hitting the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes. I was joined by \nBob Dole and Joe Lieberman, but for three years ours was a lonely \nfight. Finally, after hundreds of thousands killed and massacres in \nSrebrenica and Sarajevo that galvanized public opinion, our government \nundertook a bombing campaign that led to the Dayton Accords.\n  Just as that American military action in 1995 served as the catalyst \nfor change in Bosnia, so did Operation Allied Force in 1999 dash the \nmyth in Serbia of Milosevic's invincibility. If he had gotten away with \npurging Kosovo of most of its ethnic Albanians, those in Serbia who \nfound Milosevic to be odious would have had no reason to believe that \nanything could be done to stop his immoral and ruinous policies.\n  American leadership has been indispensable for successful military \naction in the Balkans. The bombing campaign our government undertook in \n1995 led to the Dayton Accords for Bosnia. Operation Allied Force in \n1999 forced Milosevic to withdraw his military and paramilitary units \nfrom Serbia, destroying the myth in Serbia of his invincibility. This \nleadership goes beyond the purely technical military assets that only \nthe U.S. can deploy; it also involves intangibles. SFOR in Bosnia and \nKFOR in Kosovo contain thousands of highly qualified soldiers from many \ncountries, but the American troop presence on the ground gave the \nmission its ultimate credibility with the Balkan peoples. This fact I \nhave witnessed firsthand from my many trips to the region.\n  I am, therefore, alarmed by the recent calls for a unilateral \nwithdrawal of U.S. forces from the Balkans. Such a radical shift in our \npolicy, I believe, would have a catastrophic effect not only on the \nvery real progress we have made in stabilizing both Bosnia and Kosovo, \nbut on U.S. leadership in Europe and on the Atlantic Alliance as a \nwhole. U.S. participation on the ground in the Balkans is essential to \nour overall leadership in NATO, which is an alliance not only of shared \nvalues, but also of shared risk and responsibility. To begin a \ndisengagement from the Balkans would not only guarantee the loss of \nAmerican leadership in NATO, but also, I fear, lead to the premature \nend of Western Europe's commitment to stabilizing the Balkans.\n  As my colleagues surely know, the vast majority of the troops in SFOR \nand KFOR--approximately eighty percent--are European. Yet despite this \nminority participation, the United States retains the command of both \nBalkan operations in the person of U.S. General Joseph Ralston, the \nSupreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR).\n  Let me be blunt: it is naive to believe that we could retain command \nof these operations--or, more importantly, leadership of NATO itself--\nif we would cavalierly inform our allies that we were unilaterally \npulling out of the Balkans. It just won't work.\n  If the U.S. withdrew, like it or not, the future of SFOR and KFOR \nwould be in jeopardy, and the likelihood of renewed hostilities and \ninstability beyond the borders of Bosnia and Kosovo would greatly \nincrease.\n  We are entering into a very sensitive period for the Balkans, one \nthat could either strengthen or tear apart the fragile peace that KFOR \nand SFOR have helped secure. Local elections will take place in Kosovo \nlater this month, in Bosnia in November, and in Serbia in December. The \nanti-democratic, ultra nationalist forces in the region are now no \ndoubt biding their time and hoping for a new administration that has \nalready laid its withdrawal cards on the table.\n  The assertion that our Balkan operations are a heavy drain on our \nresources is also completely off base. Our Bosnia and Kosovo operations \ntogether amount to little more than one percent of our total defense \nbudget. This hardly constitutes a ``hollowing out'' of the military.\n  The argument that our commitment to the Balkans is open-ended is \nequally misleading. There are detailed military, political, economic, \nand social benchmarks set in place. Our ``exit strategy'' is crystal \nclear: a secure, stable, democratic Balkans with a free-market economy \nthat can join the rest of the continent, a Europe ``whole and free.'' \nThese are the ideals for which the greatest generation fought and died. \nWe dare not embark upon a policy that fails to recognize the most \nimportant international lesson of the twentieth century: America's \nnational security is inextricably linked to the maintenance of a stable \nand peaceful Europe.\n  To pull the plug on a Balkans policy that has finally begun to yield \nreal dividends and at the same time to put NATO, the most successful \nalliance in history, at risk would jeopardize America's national \nsecurity.\n  It would also betray the brave crowds in Serbia, who have struggled \nto open up great possibilities for their country, the Balkans, and all \nof Europe. This is no time for Americans to retreat from the struggle \nout of ill-conceived, artificially narrow definitions of national \nsecurity. The American people have shown time and again that they lack \nneither vision nor patience when they are convinced of the importance \nof a cause. A Europe unified by democracy is such a cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10989-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10989-S10990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n S. 1854, THE 21ST CENTURY ACQUISITION REFORM AND IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF \n                                  2000\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was pleased that last Thursday the Senate \nunanimously passed S. 1854, the ``21st Century Acquisition Reform and \nImprovements Act of 2000.'' I originally introduced the bill last year \nwith Senators DeWine and Kohl, and we are hopeful that it will be \nenacted into law this year. I want to express my thanks to Senator \nLeahy, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, and to Senators \nDeWine and Kohl, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Antitrust \nSubcommittee, respectively, for their hard work and cooperation in \ndeveloping and passing the bipartisan proposal that the Senate \napproved. The reforms that will be put in place upon enactment of this \nlegislation are long overdue. Businesses, both small and large, as well \nas the antitrust enforcement agencies, have much to gain by its \nenactment.\n  As my colleagues know, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements \nAct of 1976 requires companies contemplating a merger or acquisition to \nfile a pre-merger notification with the Antitrust Division or the \nFederal Trade Commission if the size of the companies and the size of \nthe proposed transaction are greater than certain\n\n[[Page S10990]]\n\nmonetary thresholds. These monetary thresholds, however, are seriously \noutdated. They have not been changed--even for inflation--since the \nlegislation was enacted more than two decades ago.\n  Because these monetary thresholds are obsolete, businesses today \noften are required to notify the Antitrust Division and the FTC of \nproposed transactions that simply do not raise competitive issues. As a \nresult, the agencies are required to expend valuable resources \nperforming needless reviews of transactions that were never intended to \nbe reviewed. In short, current law senselessly imposes a costly \nregulatory and financial burden upon companies, particularly small \nbusinesses, and needlessly drains the resources of the agencies. \nBecause of the unnecessarily low monetary thresholds, current law fails \nto reflect the true economic impact of mergers and acquisitions in \ntoday's economy.\n  In addition, after a pre-merger notification is filed, the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Act imposes a 30-day waiting period, during which the \nproposed transaction may not close and the Antitrust Division or the \nFTC conducts an antitrust investigation. Prior to the expiration of \nthis waiting period, the agency investigating the transaction may make \na ``second request''--a demand for additional information or \ndocumentary material that is relevant to the proposed transaction. \nUnfortunately, many second requests require the production of an \nenormous volume of materials, many of which are unnecessary for even \nthe most comprehensive merger review. Complying with such second \nrequests has become extraordinarily burdensome, often costing companies \nin excess of $1 million. Second requests also extend the waiting period \nfor an additional 20 days, a period of time that does not begin to run \nuntil the agencies have determined that the transacting companies have \n``substantially complied'' with the second request. This procedure \nresults in many lawful transactions being unnecessarily delayed for \nextended periods of time, causing an enormous strain on the businesses, \ntheir employees, and their shareholders.\n  I am pleased that this legislation will rectify many of the problems \nwith the 1976 Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. First, the legislation increases \nthe size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, \neffectively exempting mergers and acquisitions that would not pose any \ncompetitive concerns from the Act's notification requirement. Such \nmergers make up over half of all transactions reported in 1999. \nTherefore, this legislation provides significant regulatory and \nfinancial relief for all businesses, particularly small and medium-\nsized ones. In addition, the legislation indexes the threshold for \ninflation, so that the problem of an expanding economy outgrowing the \nstatute's monetary threshold will not recur.\n  In addition to providing regulatory and financial relief for \ncompanies, another purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the \nAntitrust Division and the FTC efficiently allocate their finite \nresources to those transactions that truly warrant antitrust scrutiny. \nTo that end, one of its main objectives is to achieve a more effective \nand efficient merger review process by eliminating unnecessary burden, \ncostly duplication and undue delay. In order to accomplish this \nobjective, this legislation directs the Assistant Attorney General and \nthe FTC to conduct an internal review and implement reforms of the \nmerger review process, including the designation of a senior official \nfor expedited review of appeals regarding the scope of and compliance \nwith second requests. Fortunately, these reforms will be implemented \nquickly because, under this legislation, the Assistant Attorney General \nand the FTC will have 120 days to issue the guidelines and make the \nnecessary changes to their regulations and policy documents to \nimplement the reforms, and they must report back to Congress within 180 \ndays.\n  This legislation sets forth reforms to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act that \nare long overdue. It provides significant regulatory and financial \nrelief for businesses, while ensuring that transactions that truly \ndeserve antitrust scrutiny will continue to undergo review. Again, I \nthank my colleagues who joined me in supporting passage of this \nlegislation. In the waning hours of this Congressional Session, it is \nmy intention to see this non-controversial consensus legislation \nenacted into law this year, and I will seek its attachment to one of \nthe remaining ``must-pass'' vehicles.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the hard work and efforts of \nseveral staff members of the Judiciary Committee who were instrumental \nin the successful passage of this legislation. On my staff, I \nparticularly would like to thank the Committee's Chief Counsel and \nStaff Director, Manus Cooney, the lead counsels who worked on this \nmeasure, Makan Delrahim, Rene Augustine, and Kyle Sampson, and legal \nfellow Thadd Prisco. On Senator Leahy's staff, I would like to \nrecognize the professional skills and input of the Minority Chief \nCounsel, Bruce Cohen, and the Minority General Counsel, Beryl Howell. \nOn the Antitrust Subcommittee, I would like to thank Peter Levitas and \nMark Grundvig, who are Senator DeWine's able counsels, as well as Jon \nLeibowitz and Seth Bloom, counsels to Senator Kohl, for their tireless \nefforts and input. Without the assistance and hard work of these loyal \npublic servants, the important reforms in this legislation would not \nhave been possible. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10990-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10990-S10991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased that the House of Representatives tonight \napproved the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, S. 2413, \nand sent it to the president for his signature. President Clinton has \nalready endorsed this legislation to support our nation's law \nenforcement officers and is eager to sign it into law.\n  Senator Campbell and I introduced this bipartisan bill on April 12, \n2000. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed our bill unanimously on \nJune 29. For the past four months, we have been urging passage of the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000. The Senate finally \npassed our bipartisan bill on October 11, 2000 by unanimous consent.\n  I want to thank Senators Hatch, Schumer, Kohl, Thurmond, Reed, \nJeffords, Robb, Reid, Sarbanes, Bingaman, Ashcroft, Edwards, Bunning, \nCleland, Hutchison, Abraham and Grams for cosponsoring and supporting \nour bipartisan bill.\n  To better protect our Nation's law enforcement officers, Senator \nCampbell and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, \n1998, pubic law 105-181. That law created a $25 million, 50 percent \nmatching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state \nand local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years \n1999-2001.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 \npercent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty \nsince 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. \nIndeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while \nnot wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it.\n  In its two years of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram funded more than 325,000 new bulletproof vests for our nation's \npolice officers, including more than 536 vests for Vermont police \nofficers with federal grant funds of $140,253 for Vermont law \nenforcement agencies. More information about the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program is available at the program's web site at \nhttp://vests.ojp.gov/. The entire process of submitting applications \nand obtaining federal funds is completed through this web site.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the \nsuccess of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million \nfor fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by \nguaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive \nthe full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these \nsmaller communities. In addition, under the Leahy-Campbell floor \namendment to this bill, the purchase of stab-proof vests will be \neligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers and sheriffs \nwho face violent criminals in close quarters in local and county jails.\n  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the \ncountry\n\n[[Page S10991]]\n\nface deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine \ntraffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential the we \nupdate this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their \nlives everyday are able to protect themselves.\n\n  In the last Congress, we created the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program in part in response to the tragic Drega incident along \nthe Vermont and New Hampshire border. On August 19, 1997, Federal, \nState and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New \nHampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. This \nmadman had just shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two \nother victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with \nthe authorities, Drega lost his life.\n  During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore \nbulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For \nexample, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, who \nwas seriously wounded in the incident. If it was not for his \nbulletproof vest, I would have been attending Officer Pfeifer's wake \ninstead of visiting him, and meeting his wife and young daughter in the \nhospital a few days later. I am relieved that Officer John Pfeifer is \ndoing well and is back on duty today.\n  The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega \nwere not so lucky. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective \nvests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous \nofficers because of the high-powered assault weapons used by this \nmadman. We all grieve for the two New Hampshire officers who were \nkilled. Their tragedy underscore the point that all of our law \nenforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the \nprotection of a bulletproof vest. With that and lesser-known incidents \nas constant reminders, I will continue to do all I can to help prevent \nloss of life among our law enforcement officers.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 will provide state \nand local law enforcement agencies with more of the assistance they \nneed to protect their officers. Our bipartisan legislation enjoys the \nendorsement of many law enforcement organizations, including the \nFraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. In my \nhome State of Vermont, the bill enjoys the strong support of the \nVermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and many \nVermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state law \nenforcement officials.\n  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen \ninterest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont \nhas the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, \nwork and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the \nhard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we \nshould do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes \nto our attention.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the \nline of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. \nUnfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not \nnecessarily be ``routine.'' Each and every law enforcement officer \nacross the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to President Clinton signing this life-\nsaving legislation into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10991-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FAILURE TO PASS AN INTERSTATE WASTE BILL\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, one of the many items that the Senate failed \nto address during this Congress is legislation that would allow the \nstates to protect themselves from unwanted out-of-state garbage. Three \nseparate bills were offered in the Senate on this issue and each had \nmerit, at least as a point of departure. In fact two of the bills \nincorporated elements that easily passed the Senate a few years ago.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee held a hearing on these \nbills but failed to move any of the bills forward. This is more than \ndisappointing. For a state like Virginia that is now importing over 7 \nmillion tons of municipal solid waste each year, with no way to limit \nthe growth of this unwanted import, it is important that the committee \nand the full Senate act on legislation.\n  Seven million tons of imported solid waste represents 280,000 truck \nloads of waste moving into the Commonwealth of Virginia each year. The \ntraffic this generates is reason alone to authorize additional state \ncontrols. But there are other reasons. Cheap landfill disposal due to \nan over abundance of capacity, has made us less vigilant about \nrecycling. And although new federal landfill standards protect our \nenvironment better than the old standards, today's landfills are much \nlarger than yesterdays, and we are not yet certain that all the \nengineering improvements we have made are enough. We may not know if \nthese new landfills leak for a few more years.\n  Transporting waste hundreds of miles for disposal is also a senseless \nuse of diesel fuel, and when we are already facing a shortage we should \nseek to conserve our fuel resources. We are misallocating fuel that \ncould be used to heat homes this winter and using it to hall trash up \nand down the east coast. I understand from the Federal Highway \nAdministration that the large trucks used to transport waste get about \n6.1 miles per gallon. An out of state delivery of trash to Virginia \nlandfills can amount to 680 miles round trip and 68 gallons of gas. If \nonly half the trips to Virginia are that long, over 500,000 gallons of \ndiesel fuel will be used to ship waste several hundred miles. This is a \nwaste.\n  During this Congress, I introduced one interstate waste bill and co-\nsponsored two others, and if members of the Senate propose other ways \nto deal with this problem, I am more than willing to work with them to \ndevelop something that is workable for all parties. But at this time \nunless a state chooses, as some have, to simply stop siting land \ndisposal capacity, they lose all control in terms of how long that \ncapacity will last and what kind of traffic it will receive.\n  When we come back next year I will try again to move legislation. I \nwill meet with the exporting States and I will continue to work toward \na goal of wiser use of our resources, and that includes recycling, \nminimizing waste in the first place and certainly finding a way to \ndispose of it without moving half way across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10991-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10991-S10992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF SOLID WASTE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is outrageous that another Congress has \npassed without the enactment of legislation which would resolve the \nproblem of the interstate transportation of solid waste. The people \nshould not be dumped on any longer. They should have some control over \ntheir own jurisdictions and over their own land. It is up to us to give \nthem that authority. I just heard that Toronto Canada is thinking about \nsending its waste to Michigan and the people of Michigan have nothing \nto say about it.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that, under the Commerce Clause of \nthe Constitution, unless Congress acts, states and municipalities are \npowerless to stop trash from being brought into their jurisdictions--\npowerless to protect their citizens' safety, the environment and their \nquality of life. So our states and municipalities rely on us to pass \nthis protective legislation, and we let them down--again. The Senate \nhas expressed its will on this issue over and over again--A majority of \nSenators support this legislation. We passed it by an overwhelming vote \nof 94-6. But the House has not acted. There are a few people over there \nwho oppose it who have managed to displace the will of what appears to \nbe a clear majority of House Members.\n  What will it take? The problem is getting worse. Total interstate \nwaste shipments continue to rise and there is a finite amount of \nlandfill capacity available. Michigan, my State, imports over 12 \npercent of all of the solid waste it disposes of in landfills. Michigan \ncounties and townships have plans for waste disposal. They have \ninvested in it. They have made significant commitments to waste \nreduction and recycling. They have spent a lot of money on these \ninvestments to dispose of their waste locally. Those plans and those \ngood faith investments are totally undermined when contracts to bring \nin waste from other states and countries are entered into without \nconsideration by State, county, or local\n\n[[Page S10992]]\n\ngovernments of the impact of those contracts for importing waste into \nthose areas. When you import waste in that way, without consideration \nof plans, and without consideration of the efforts that local \ngovernments have made to dispose of their own waste, it totally \ndisrupts those efforts and those expenditures. It is not right. States \nand local governments have a right to do that planning and to make \nthose investments in order to dispose of their own waste and, should \nthey see fit, not to see their own plans displaced by the import of \nwaste from other places.\n  I want to commend all the Senators who have been involved in this \neffort for so many years. Our previous vote of 96 to 4 shows that this \ntruly is a bipartisan effort and it will continue to be.\n  Our States are counting on us to give them the authority to protect \ntheir citizens and the environment. I can assure you that, when \nCongress returns in January, I will be ready to fight this battle again \nuntil we pass legislation to prevent our states from being dumping \ngrounds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10992-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RELIGIOUS LAND USE AND INSTITUTIONALIZED PERSONS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, just before the August recess, the Senate \npassed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of \n2000, S. 2869. I had some serious concerns about this bill as \noriginally introduced. As my colleagues know, the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch and my \ndistinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, came up \nwith a bipartisan compromise that addressed many of the concerns I had \nabout the initial bill. Specifically, I was concerned that the bill \nwould have unintentionally impeded the ability of states and localities \nto protect the health and safety of children in a variety of ways. I am \nrelieved that the new Senate version has a much more limited scope. \nBecause the bill that was passed applies only to zoning decisions, \nlandmark designations and institutionalized persons, it will not have \nany impact on child welfare systems, including the ability of states \nand localities to protect the health and safety of children. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts on the floor and I would ask \nmy colleague, as one of the authors of this new legislation, if my \nunderstanding of this legislation correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Ohio is correct.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Since the definition of ``land use regulation'' is \nlimited to ``a zoning or landmarking law, or the application of such a \nlaw,'' am I also correct in understanding that this legislation will \nnot affect the ability of states and localities to enforce fire codes, \nbuilding codes, and other measures to protect the health and safety of \npeople using the land or buildings, such as children in childcare \ncenters, schools, or camps run by religious organizations?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, the Senator from Ohio is correct.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Am I also correct that the legislation will not affect \ncivil rights laws that protect young people?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

As American families have been paying sky-high \nprices at the gas pump and are bracing for record-high home heating \ncosts this winter, the oil industry has been savoring phenomenal \nprofits. Something is wrong when working families are struggling to pay \nfor basic transportation and home heat while Big Oil rakes in obscene \namounts of cash by the barrel.\n  The overall net income for major petroleum companies more than \ndoubled in the third quarter of 2000 relative to the third quarter of \n1999. Let me illustrate the phenomenal profits of the oil industry for \nthe past year when gasoline prices soared and heating oil stocks fell.\n  In the third quarter of 2000, Chevron Corporation reported net \nprofits of $1.53 billion, Exxon Mobil Corporation reported net profits \nof $4.29 billion, and Texaco reported net profits of $798 million. \nCompared to the third quarter of 1999, the profits in the third quarter \nof 2000 increased 163 percent for Chevron, 96 percent for Exxon Mobil, \nand 106 percent for Texaco. I ask unanimous consent that a chart of \nthese statistics be printed in the Record.\n  Not surprisingly, these multi-million and even multi-billion dollar \nprofits are making record profits. Exxon Mobil executive Peter Townsend \nis quoted as saying: ``We've got a lot of cash around here. It's coming \nin pretty fast, flying through the door.'' And according to Fadel \nGheit, an analyst with Fahnestock & Company: ``The fourth quarter could \nbeat the third.''\n  There is no doubt that Big Oil reaped record profits while American \nconsumers and small business owners dug deeper into their pockets to \npay for soaring gasoline prices. And more record profits for Big Oil at \nthe expense of consumers and small business owners are expected this \nwinter when heating costs go through the roof. Mr. President, that is \noutrageous.\n  Even more disturbing are the recent press reports that the major oil \ncompanies are not using their record profits to boost production and \nlower future prices, but are instead cutting back on exploration and \nproduction. Listen to this from a report in the Wall Street Journal: \n``Exploration and production expenditures at the so-called super \nmajors--Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Amoco PLC, and Royal Dutch/Shell Group--\nfell 20 percent to $6.91 billion in the first six months of the year \nfrom a year earlier. . . .''\n  The investment firm UBS Warburg in London estimated this month that \nthe surplus cash of the top 10 global energy companies will total $40 \nbillion this year and grow to $130 billion by the end of 2004. The \ncompanies, Warburg predicts, will use about two-thirds of the surplus \nto repurchase stock to bolster market price, and one-third to reduce \ndebt. Indeed, last week Texaco and Chevron agreed to merge with Chevron \npaying $35.1 billion to acquire Texaco.\n  Well I for one have had enough of Big Oil making record profits at \nthe expense of the working families and the small business owners who \npay the oil bills, live by the rules and struggle mightily when fuel \nand heating costs skyrocket.\n  On September 27, 2000, I introduced S. 3118, the Windfall Oil Profits \nFor Heating Assistance Act of 2000. My legislation imposes a windfall \nprofits assessment on the oil industry to fund heating help for \nconsumers and small business owners across America.\n  In true arrogance to the needs of Americans struggling to heat their \nhomes, John Felmy of the American Petroleum Institute has publicly \nstated: ``The profits aren't owned by consumers, they're owned by the \nshareholders. The companies have to do what's appropriate for owners of \nthe enterprise.''\n  The oil industry is made up of corporations formed under the laws of \nthe United States. These oil industry corporations have a \nresponsibility to the public good as well as their shareholders. To \nreap record windfall profits and then cut back on exploration and \nproduction to further increase future profits is poor corporate \ncitizenship and an abuse of the public trust by these oil industry \ncorporations and their executives.\n  In response to the energy crisis of the 1980s, Congress enacted the \nCrude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980. This windfall profits tax, \nwhich was repealed in 1988, funded low-income fuel assistance and \nenergy and transportation programs.\n  Similar to the early 1980s, American families again face an energy \ncrisis of high prices and record oil company profits. This past June, \ngasoline prices hit all-time highs across the United States, with a \nnational average of $1.68 a gallon, according to the Energy Information \nAdministration. This winter, the Department of Energy estimates that \nheating oil inventories are 36 percent lower than last year with \nheating oil inventories in New England estimated to be 65 percent lower \nthan last\n\n[[Page S10993]]\n\nyear. In my home state of Vermont, energy officials estimate heating \noil costs will jump to $1.31 per gallon, up from $1.19 last winter and \n80 cents in 1998.\n  Given the oil industry's record windfall profits in the face of this \nenergy crisis, it is time for Congress to act and again limit the \nwindfall profits of Big Oil. My bill would do just that and dedicate \nthe revenue generated from this windfall profits adjustment to help \nworking families and small business owners with their heating oil costs \nthis winter.\n  Specifically, the Windfall Oil Profits For Heating Assistance Act of \n2000 would impose a 100 percent assessment on windfall profits from the \nsale of crude oil. My legislation builds on the current investigation \nby the Federal Trade Commission into the pricing and profits of the oil \nindustry. The bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to expand this \ninvestigation to determine if the oil industry is reaping windfall \nprofits.\n  The revenue collected from windfall oil industry profits, under my \nlegislation, would be dedicated to two separate accounts in the \nTreasury for the following: 75 percent of the revenues to fund heating \nassistance programs for consumers such as the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program (LIHEAP), weatherization and other energy efficiency \nprograms; and 25 percent of the revenues to fund heating assistance \nprograms for small business owners.\n  American consumers and small business owners continue to pay sky-high \ngasoline prices and home heating oil costs are expected to hit an all-\ntime high this winter while U.S. oil corporations reap more record \nprofits. It is time for Congress to restore some basic fairness to the \nmarketplace. It is time for Congress to transfer the windfall profits \nfrom Big Oil to fund heating oil assistance for working families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Windfall Oil Profits For Heating \nAssistance Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the chart to which I referred, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            RECORD PROFITS FOR BIG OIL--THIRD QUARTER PROFITS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         3rd quarter             change\n           Company           ----------------------------------    (in\n                                    1999             2000       percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChevron.....................  $582 million...  $1.52 billion..       163\nExxon Mobil.................  2.19 billion...  4.29 billion...        96\nTexaco......................  387 million....   798 million...       106\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                                \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10993-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF TINKER ST. CLAIR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Tinker St. Clair, who is retiring at the \nend of this year after 21 years of outstanding service to the Senate as \ndoorkeeper.\n  Tinker goes back many many years with the Kennedy family. In a sense, \nI inherited Tinker from my brothers. At the time of the 1960 \nPresidential campaign, Tinker was active in Democratic Party politics \nin McDowell County in the heart of coal country in West Virginia. \nTinker supported Jack in the key West Virginia Presidential Primary \nthat year, and he campaigned effectively for my brother throughout \nsouthern West Virginia. Jack won a dramatic victory in that primary, \nand it put him solidly on the road to the White House. So it's fair to \nsay that the New Frontier was born right there in West Virginia, and \nTinker St. Clair was very much a part of that victory.\n  Tinker was also there for my brother Robert Kennedy in his \nPresidential campaign in 1968.\n  For the past 21 years in the Senate, Tinker has been a great friend \nof mine as well, and a great friend of many other Senators on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Day in and day out on the Senate floor, Tinker's welcoming smile and \nwonderful personality have warmed our hearts and minds. He is often \nhere with us, sitting in the back of the Chamber, listening intently to \nour debates, offering an encouraging word when we arrive and when we \nfinish speaking, reminiscing about past days in the Senate and past \ncampaigns in West Virginia, telling us with pride about his children, \nhis grandchildren, and in recent years, his great-grandchildren.\n  When Tinker leaves us this year, he will leave a place in our hearts \nthat will be impossible to fill. But as he said the other day, he feels \nit is time, as the West Virginia mountaineer he's always been, to sit \non the porch and enjoy his family.\n  As this session of Congress comes to an end, I express my warmest \nwishes to Tinker for a long and happy and healthy retirement. He has \nsurely earned it. He has served West Virginia well, he has served the \nSenate well, and he has served the Nation well, and we will miss him \nvery very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10993-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10993-S10994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PRESIDENT KIM DAE JUNG AND THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nPresident of South Korea, Kim Dae Jung, for winning the Nobel Peace \nPrize. This is a man who truly deserves this honor, as there are few \nmen in the world today who have worked so tirelessly for democracy and \npeace in East Asia. Like so many of the outstanding men of our time, \nPresident Kim's life reads something like a novel, from his early \nchildhood as a farmer's son on a small Korean island, to his criticism \nof the Japanese colonial rule, to his constant fight against \ndictatorship in South Korea, to his relentless pursuit of a \nconstructive engagement policy with North Korea. No part of his path to \nthe present has been easy, and, he came perilously close to losing his \nlife on several occasions. The stories that are told about his near \ndeath experiences at the hands of the military regime in South Korea, \nand the intervention by the United States to save his life, are \nlegendary in his country. He has been accused of nearly every possible \npolitical crime, from subversion to treason. But he has persisted and \nhas succeeded, this in spite of the formidable odds against him. \nSignificantly, South Korea has achieved its status as one of the \nworld's most stable democratic countries because of his efforts, and it \nis appropriate he should be recognized by the Norwegian Nobel Committee \nfor the impact he has made over the years.\n  As my colleagues know, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived \nin North Korea earlier this week, her stated goal being to improve \nrelations with that country. This follows the trip to North Korea by \nPresident Kim, the trip to this country by North Korean Vice Marshal Jo \nMyong Rok, and the normalization of relations between North Korea and \nboth Great Britain and Germany--all of which occurred in the last six \nmonths and are a direct result of the ``sunshine policy'' that \nPresident Kim introduced when he entered office. Needless to say, since \nthe initiation of the policy he has been roundly condemned by \ngovernment officials and analysts alike as an idealist who did not \nentirely understand what was at stake in the region. Recall it was only \nin June of 1999 that North and South Korea fought a battle off the \nSouth Korean coast. But President Kim has persevered and, as a result, \nhas brought the region closer to peace and stability than any time in \nthe last fifty years. This is no small accomplishment.\n  There is no doubt that South Korea has some serious challenges to \nface in the immediate future. Looking at the South Korean economy, \nalthough it has recovered substantially from the 1997 financial crisis, \nit is again showing signs of instability. The reforms that were \nconsidered necessary by President Kim for a sustained transformation--\nfinancial, corporate, and governmental--have not yet fully occurred, \nraising the possibility of another crisis down the road. It is also \ntrue that most of the rapprochement that has taken place between South \nKorea and North Korea is symbolic in nature, leading to hard questions \nconcerning what concrete actions will be undertaken to increase \ncooperation and decrease tensions in the region.\n  But hopefully the Nobel Peace Prize will provide President Kim with \nadditional leverage for the policies his country has been pursuing, and \nthrough greater national and international consensus, he will find a \npath to the desired end of peace and prosperity in the region. There is \nno doubt that remarkable steps forward have been taken by all those \ninvolved, and I remain optimistic that change can occur. Before she \nleft North Korea, Secretary Albright stated that there\n\n[[Page S10994]]\n\nwere ``many towering peaks ahead'' in the process. This is, no doubt, \ntrue. Pragmatic and reciprocal confidence-building mechanisms will be \nrequired to convince all the parties involved that the peace process \nshould move forward. But it is also true that the prospects for \ncooperation are brighter than ever before. And much of this progress \ncan be directly attributed to President Kim.\n  So, Mr. President, I take this opportunity to congratulate President \nKim for his selection by the Nobel Committee, to celebrate those things \nthat he has accomplished in his life, and to wish him much success in \nthe days, months, and years that follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10994-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE LEGACY OF GUNN McKAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all of us who knew him during his decade of \nservice in Congress, and others who knew him only by reputation, mourn \nthe recent passing of Gunn McKay.\n  Gunn McKay was a leading member of the Committee on Appropriations in \nthe other body and chaired the Subcommittee on Military Construction. \nHe was effective. He knew how to lead and how to legislate. His voice \nwas an influential voice on energy issues and military readiness and \nFederal land policy. And he knew how to bring people together to get \nthings done.\n  It was not politics that motivated Gunn McKay in his public service; \nit was people. He thrived in being able to help people get and keep \ngood-paying jobs. He deeply, unequivocally believed that there is a \nrole for government, through programs like Medicare and Social Security \nand in other ways, in helping those who struggle.\n  Gunn achieved all of the good he accomplished in life through a deep-\ndown and infectious optimism about people and about the future. More \nthan being a great public servant, he was a good man. Those who worked \nwith him will tell you that Gunn did not have a mean bone in his body. \nWhen he left public life Gunn and his wife, Donna, devoted much of \ntheir time to church service abroad.\n  The Nation and its Congress are better for the fact that Gunn McKay \nserved here. And so, certainly, are the people of his beloved State of \nUtah.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Salt Lake Tribune \nabout Gunn McKay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Salt Lake Tribune]\n\n                    Utah Demo Gunn McKay Dies at 75\n\n                            (By Judy Fahys)\n\n       K. Gunn McKay, the Weber County farmer's son and Democrat \n     who served five terms in Congress in the 1970s and earned \n     bipartisan praise for his down-home warmth and political \n     skill, died Friday night from cancer. He was 75.\n       ``Tell the facts and leave the right impression,'' McKay \n     used to tell his young congressional aides, and that credo \n     served the former teacher through a career in state and \n     national politics and on Mormon mission assignments in \n     Europe, Africa and Asia.\n       ``Unassuming'' and ``determined'' are the words Barry \n     McKay, a Salt Lake City lawyer, used to describe his eldest \n     brother. He recalled Friday how Gunn McKay spent most of one \n     Christmas, the day he returned home from a church mission in \n     England, helping neighbors start their frozen cars.\n       Political scientist J.D. Williams called McKay ``the \n     personification of Huntsville,'' McKay's hometown in the \n     Ogden Valley.\n       ``He talked with a rural Utah slang when he wanted to,'' \n     said Williams. ``He had a beautiful smile and demeanor, and \n     he was everybody's friend.''\n       ``You didn't have to guess what he meant,''said former Sen. \n     Jake Garn, a Republican who served with the Democrat in \n     Congress and lived near him outside the nation's capital.\n       ``He was extremely well-liked,'' said Garn, whose U.S. \n     Senate service overlapped with six years of McKay's time in \n     Washington. ``Whether you agreed with him or not, you could \n     trust him. He would always follow through.''\n       McKay even converted David L. Bigler, a Utah historian and \n     former public-relations director for Geneva Steel, then known \n     as U.S. Steel. Bigler switched political parties to raise \n     money for McKay's first campaign.\n       ``He really did care for people,'' said Bigler, who was \n     struck at once by McKay's integrity. ``All politicians say \n     that, but few of them do. He did.''\n       Politics may have been in McKay's blood. His grandfather, \n     Angus, was House Speaker in Utah's first Legislature. And his \n     father, James, had run for the 1st Congressional District \n     seat that McKay would win 35 years later, in 1970.\n       And unlike most emerging politicians, name recognition was \n     never a problem for McKay, whose father was a cousin to one \n     of the most beloved presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ \n     of Latter-day Saints, Huntsville-born David O. McKay. The \n     church leader died just a year before his relative took the \n     oath for his first term in Congress.\n       The eldest of eight children, McKay was a three-sport star \n     at Weber High School before serving in the U.S. Coast Guard \n     during World War II and on an LDS mission to England the \n     following three years. He later graduated from Utah State \n     University with a degree in education.\n       He was teaching history in Ogden City Schools and running a \n     deli when he was appointed to the first of two terms in the \n     Utah Legislature.\n       From there, he was tapped to be chief of staff to \n     Democratic Gov. Calvin L. Rampton.\n       During his five terms in Washington from 1971 to 1981, \n     McKay built a reputation for being one of the half-dozen most \n     conservative Democrats in a Congress long controlled by \n     Democrats.\n       He fought federally funded abortions and backed the U.S. \n     Supreme Court's decision to outlaw prayer in schools. He \n     pushed the Central Utah Project, military appropriations that \n     bolstered Hill Air Force Base and other Utah installations, \n     ``gasohol'' and a balanced-budget law. He also fought higher \n     fees for ranchers who leased federal range.\n       McKay's powers of persuasion helped land him a seat on the \n     coveted Appropriations Committee upon entering Congress--the \n     first ever for a Utahn.\n       ``Most people have to wait [10 years] to be considered,'' \n     said Jim McConkie, a Salt Lake City lawyer who served on \n     McKay's congressional staff for five years.\n       McConkie recalled how McKay used his influential role as \n     chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee to become \n     close to President Carter, who invited McKay to Camp David a \n     few times.\n       ``But he never lost his roots,'' said McConkie. ``He could \n     see to the heart of an issue.''\n       Nothwithstanding his Washington successes, McKay lost his \n     seat to Republican Rep. Jim Hansen in the Ronald Reagan \n     landslide of 1980.\n       In 1986, when McKay unsuccessfully challenged Hansen for \n     his old seat he shared his view of Utah voters, one that \n     contemporary Utah Democrats have taken to heart.\n       ``Utah voters are independent thinkers,'' McKay told The \n     Salt Lake Tribune. ``They are concerned with ineffective \n     federal policies and lack of congressional action on issues \n     which are increasingly having a negative impact on their \n     lives.''\n       The year after he left Congress, McKay went on an LDS \n     mission to Scotland with his wife Donna. Later, the couple \n     was called to serve in Kenya, where McKay found himself a \n     block away from the embassy bombing in 1998.\n       They also served in Singapore and Malaysia. McKay took ill \n     while serving in Pakistan.\n       The McKays, who married in 1950, had 10 children, 40 \n     grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n       Said former Utah First Lady Norma Matheson: ``He loved \n     being in public service, and it showed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10994-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10994-S10995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRESSMAN MEEHAN'S ELOQUENT TRIBUTE TO HIS FATHER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us who know and admire our \ndistinguished colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman \nMarty Meehan, were saddened to learn of his father's death earlier this \nmonth.\n  At the funeral service for his father on October 14 in Lowell, \nMassachusetts, Congressman Meehan delivered an eloquent tribute to his \nfather that deeply touched all of those who were present. He described \nin vivid terms and in many wonderful stories the lifelong love and \nsupport that Mr. Meehan gave to his family.\n  I believe that Congressman Meehan's moving eulogy to his father will \nbe of interest to all of us in Congress, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Eulogy of Martin T. Meehan\n\n           (By U.S. Rep. Martin T. Meehan, October 14, 2000)\n\n       On behalf of my mother, brothers and sisters, my Aunt \n     Katherine and Uncle John, my cousins, and my entire family, I \n     want to thank all of you for joining us today to help \n     celebrate our father's life. We are all honored by your \n     presence and are grateful for your support and affection over \n     the last few days.\n       I can imagine my father looking out at the long lines \n     forming outside the McCabe's funeral Home yesterday. He would \n     have said, ``Frankie McCabe must be giving something out for \n     Free!''\n       Frank isn't, Dad, believe me.\n       My father was born in Lowell on July 16, 1927 to Martin H. \n     Meehan and Josephine Ashe Meehan. His father immigrated to \n     the United States from County Clare, Ireland in 1912. His \n     mother, immigrated from County\n\n[[Page S10995]]\n\n     Kerry the year before, was a cousin of the great Irish \n     patriot Thomas Ashe, who died during one of the first hungers \n     strikes--in Ireland's fight for freedom in Mount Joy Jail in \n     1916.\n       Thomas Ashe's picture was hung on the wall of his family \n     home on Batchelder Street in the Acre Section of Lowell. In \n     1963, a portrait of President Kennedy was added.\n       The Acre was where the Greek and Irish immigrants settled \n     in Lowell. My father grew up there and he loved it. Swimming \n     in the canals, playing baseball for St. Patrick's and Lowell \n     High School, and building lifetime bonds. It was a \n     neighborhood where the kids were tough and strong, and \n     everyone had a nick name--hence ``Buster.'' The Acre was \n     where thousands of new immigrant families were becoming part \n     of the great American Dream.\n       In 1946, Dad met my mother at a party her cousin Maureen \n     Gay had. Dad was not invited, he crashed. And my mother was \n     glad he did. There were married three years later.\n       My father had a saying for everything in life. Some of them \n     really bugged me at times. But they all had a purpose and \n     wisdom for how to lead a good life.\n       ``One God, One County, One Woman'' he used to say. That--\n     one woman--was my mother. He was passionately in love with \n     her through 51 years of marriage. Their love for each other \n     intensified and grew. I believe the love our father and \n     mother shared for one another was extended to every person \n     who was a part of their lives.\n       I can remember as a very small boy first learning the \n     concept of love. ``I love you kids with all my heart'' he'd \n     say. ``But I love your mother even more''. ``But Dad'', I \n     once replied, ``Who am I supposed to love more? You or Ma? \n     ``You kids should love your mother the most'', he'd say. \n     ``She gave birth to you.''\n       First they lived in a three tenement on Lincoln Street \n     where Colleen and Kathy and I were born. Later they bought an \n     eight-room house the next street over at 22 London Street \n     where they raised seven children in a home that was filled \n     with love, laughter, energy . . . action 24 hour a day . . . \n     a strong commitment to the Catholic Church and to family.\n       It was a great neighborhood--and my father helped us spread \n     our family's love all over it. And there isn't a better \n     testament to that love--than our relationship with the Durkin \n     family who had seven children of their own, just down the \n     street. So many memories, so many stories.\n       Visiting the ice cream stand with Dad was unforgettable. He \n     would load all of us into the car with as many of our friends \n     as would fit. He would ask us what we wanted. ``I'll have a \n     banana split,'' I'd shout. My sisters would say, ``I'll have \n     a hot fudge Sunday.'' Our friends couldn't believe it--they \n     would order a shake or double ice cream scoop with extra \n     nuts, extra whipped cream!\n       He'd take everyone's order and then go up to the line. \n     Don't worry, he'd say, ``I'll carry it back''.\n       Ten minutes later he'd return with 13 single cups of \n     chocolate ice cream. ``That's all they'd had,'' he'd shrug?\n       Dad was also a very successful little league coach. On \n     Dad's White Sox team everyone played--at least three innings. \n     I remember how embarrassed I was when Dad's White Sox lost \n     every game--0-18. Some games we were winning after three \n     winnings, 8 to 4 or even 7 to 2. But in the fourth inning Dad \n     put all of the subs in--no matter what. ``Everyone plays!'' \n     he'd say. The other teams kept the best players in for the \n     whole game. Naturally, they would win.\n       Today I am so proud of the way my Dad coached the kids on \n     that 0 and 18 team. Today, I am so proud of how my father \n     lived his life.\n       As children, we shared so many happy times together each \n     summer with family and friends at Seabrook Beach. Later as \n     adults, with his grandchildren, we spent weekends at dad and \n     Mom's beach house. After a few morning hours together on the \n     beach, Mom and Dad would head back to the house to begin the \n     daylong cooking ritual so that we could have a dinner \n     together. Many times in the evenings, we would sing songs \n     around a bonfire on the beach. We enjoyed lobster bakes and \n     thankfully Mom and Dad got to enjoy an occasional sunrise \n     together. And many times, after a long day, many of us would \n     sit together and watch the sun go down and our father would \n     say to us all, ``It's a great life and it's a great \n     country''.\n       Dad worked at the Lowell Sun Publishing Company for 43 \n     years. He started as a truck driver . . . became a linotype \n     operator . . . Then became Assistant Foreman in the Composing \n     Room. He loved the Sun and the newspaper business, and he \n     knew it from soup to nuts. There were a lot of great \n     reporters that came through the Sun over the years, but my \n     father never hesitated to tell them when he felt they just \n     didn't get it right--especially on a political story.\n       Frank Phillips, Chris Black, Brian Mooney and others all \n     heard from Dad on more than one occasion. When he was \n     finished he had earned their respect and they appreciated his \n     wisdom and experience. And they all affectionately repeat \n     those stories--even today.\n       Dad was an active lifetime member of the Typographical \n     Union--serving in a leadership position. He always stressed \n     the importance of workers being able to organize for fair \n     wages and benefits. It's not surprising that my sisters \n     Colleen and Kathy are members of the teachers union and Mark \n     and Paul are active members of their respective unions as \n     well.\n       But as strong a union person as he was--he loved the Lowell \n     Sun and the company's ownership, the Costello Family. He \n     followed the Costello kids' lives as if they were his own--\n     always loyal to the company and the Costello family.\n       Supporting Mom and seven young children was not always \n     easy. For seven years he got a second job working nights as a \n     Corrections Officer. On Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays he \n     would get up at 5:30 to be at the Sun to punch in at 7 \n     o'clock. His shift was over at 3:30. He'd put on his uniform \n     at the Paper, punch in at the Jail at 4 o'clock and work \n     until midnight. He got home by 12:30 in the morning, and went \n     to bed for five hours so he could be back at the paper by 7 \n     am.\n       I'm sure it wasn't easy--but he wanted the best for his \n     children and he wanted my mother to be able to be home with \n     us.\n       My father didn't care what we did for work--but he wanted \n     us to get an education. And we all did. He was especially \n     proud of the fact that my sisters Colleen, Kathy, and Mary \n     all became school teachers. He thought it was the most \n     important job of all. ``Teaching is not a job''--Dad would \n     say--``it's a vocation''. He loved the idea that his \n     daughters were helping to shape the minds of 25 kids in a \n     classroom each day.\n       He was so proud of all his children, in a unique and \n     special way. My brother Mark, a master electrician, ``has the \n     biggest and best heart of all my kids'', he'd say. And Mark \n     gave Dad his newest precious grandchild ``Sarah'' just two \n     weeks ago. He was so proud that Paul followed him to the \n     Sheriff's Department. Paul is a model for overcoming \n     obstacles and winning. He recently went back to school for \n     his degree, got married and was promoted to Captain as well.\n       When I ran for Congress in 1992 my sister Maureen answered \n     the call and put her work--and life--on hold to take the most \n     important job in the campaign--raising the money to win. My \n     Dad just loved the fact that I turned to my sister. And when \n     we won he knew it was Maureen who was the rock behind us. \n     ``Politics is a tough business,'' he'd say--``you need people \n     you can really trust--and that means family''. That's why \n     President Kennedy had Bobby. 'Course after the election, I \n     remember Maureen was sick and I asked, ``What's wrong with \n     her now?''--Dad's split second response--``Working for you!''\n       Dad was so well read, a voracious reader . . . A lover of \n     poetry and words, and boy did he love to sing!\n       So much love in his heart, and this extension of love was \n     felt by his grandchildren and in-laws. The term ``in-laws'' \n     didn't mean much to Dad--he welcomed them and loved them like \n     they were his own. And they loved him back.\n       All fifteen of his grandchildren are loved as individuals \n     and each of them realizes the power of love and family \n     through their papa and munama. One of my young nieces asked \n     during the last couple of days, ``How did Papa have so much \n     love to give to so many people?'' Well, I really don't know \n     the answer to that for sure. I just know he did. Every time \n     our father gave us a hug--or as he would say a hug-a-deen--he \n     would accompany it with an ``I love you''. ``Aren't they \n     wonderful'', Dad would say. ``Your mother and I will live in \n     them in the next generation through these beautiful kids . . \n     . and as I've told you'', he'd say, ``that's the sweet \n     mystery of life''.\n       So happy, so content, there was nothing more in life that \n     he wanted--than that which he already had--His Family.\n       And he thanked God for our happiness every single day.\n       Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., once said that the measure of a \n     man's success in life was not the money he had made, but \n     rather the family he had raised. That quote has been framed \n     in my parents' home over 15 years. My father believed it and \n     devoted himself to family every day of his life for 73 years. \n     He was an immensely successful man.\n       We love you Dad and will miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10995-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10995-S10996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM TAX FAIRNESS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nretain the important ag tax provisions contained in the Senate version \nof the upcoming tax package that will soon be before us. I have not \nseen the final tax bill as of yet, but word is that most if not all of \nthe agricultural tax provisions are being stripped from the bill at the \nwill of the House. I hope this is not true. I cannot imagine why we \nwould choose to leave out farmers from important tax relief at a time \nwhen this Congress has clearly recognized the economic hardships in \nfarm country today.\n  I plead with my colleagues to include these necessary provisions in \nany final tax package.\n  Specifically, I am talking about a provision that came from a bill \nSenator Daschle and I introduced--along with 31 co-sponsors--to clarify \nthat Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) payments made to farmers for \ntaking agricultural land out of production for environmental \nimprovement--are not\n\n[[Page S10996]]\n\nsubject to self employment social security taxes--a rate of up to 15 \npercent of the payment amount.\n  The CRP has been a great success for this nation. The program \nprovides financial incentives for improving and preserving \nenvironmentally sensitive land--taking it out of production and \nenhancing its environmental benefit. The CRP program increases water \nquality, wildlife habitat and prevents soil erosion--all factors which \nhave become even more important in light of recent concerns about \nnonpoint source pollution in our nation's waterways.\n  The Senate has strongly supported this measure--passing it by \nunanimous consent earlier this year on the death tax debate--and our \nSenate leadership has held firm in fighting for this needed provision, \nbut for some reason, our fine colleagues in the House have decided to \nmake an issue of this provision and are trying to strike it from the \ntax package.\n  It makes no sense to yield to the House on this matter. The \nprovision, as currently contained in the Senate tax package--will only \ncost $292 million over 5 years--but that money and the clarity it \nbrings to our nation's farmers is worth far more than can be said in \nthis time of farm economic stress. This provision allows farmers to \nplan and better use their resources next year because they will no \nlonger have to wonder or worry about whether the IRS is going to come \nafter them for a conservation tax they didn't know they owed.\n  Currently, there is confusion over whether CRP income should be taxed \nowing to a recent court case in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals which \noverturned a 1998 Tax Court ruling that CRP income is not subject to \nsocial security taxes. The Tax Court found and I concur, that because \nit is a rental payment the government makes in exchange for farmers \ntaking environmentally sensitive land out of production, CRP payments \nshould be treated the same as other contractual agreements made by \nfarmers for land use--and be exempt from self-employment taxes.\n  The new court ruling creates a discrepancy between active farmers who \ntake part in CRP--which are now subject to the tax--and landowners who \ndo not farm but take part in CRP and are exempt from the tax.\n  This tax correction is just common sense. Now more than ever we \nshould appreciate the need for conservation and the co-benefits of \nwildlife, air and water quality it provides. We should not allow a tax \nto create confusion and a disincentive for farmers to trust and work \nwith government for the good of the environment.\n  Numerous ag groups support this bill including the National Corn \nGrowers, National Wheat Growers, American Soybean and Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociations--along with the National Farmer's Union and the American \nFarm Bureau. This is our only opportunity to address this important \nissue.\n  In my state of Kansas alone, $102.7 million in CRP payments were \nissued in 1999. Are we really going to tell farmers that this money--\npromised them for conservation purposes--will now be additionally \ntaxed? This would amount to a disincentive for farmers to participate \nin environmental and conservation programs. Is that the message this \nCongress really wants to send?\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to include this important provision--and \nall the ag tax provisions that have been so carefully worked out and \nincluded in the Community Renewal and New Markets Act. We cannot afford \nto leave this important work undone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10996-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        DISABILITY MENTORING DAY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack has \nproclaimed October 25 ``Iowa Disability Mentoring Day.'' Today, Iowans \naround the state will work to raise awareness of the benefits for all \nof us of increasing employment opportunities for young people with \ndisabilities. And young people with disabilities will learn about job \nopportunities through on-site work experiences, job shadowing, and \nother forms of job mentoring.\n  Many of the mentors will themselves be people with disabilities. All \nchildren need role models, and I'm thrilled that through mentoring, \nchildren with disabilities will see tangible evidence that their \ndisability does not diminish their ability to participate in the \ncultural, economic, educational, political, and social mainstream.\n  It's no surprise that Iowa is celebrating disability mentoring, \nbecause we are a leader in the field. This week, Iowa received a \nFederal grant under the Work Incentives Improvement Act for the Working \nTogether So All Can Work program. This grant will enable more people \nwith disabilities to participate in the workforce.\n  And Iowa Creative Employment Options, along with the University of \nIowa Hospital School, has started up the Healthy and Ready to Work \nMentoring Project. The project is run by a mentoring group of young \nadults with disabilities who have achieved their career goals or are \npursuing the education and training they need to reach their goals.\n  These young men and women are college students, computer programmers, \nteachers, television directors, social workers, and businesspeople. On \ntop of their studies and jobs, they are working with high school \nguidance counselors, meeting with students with disabilities, and \ndeveloping a resource book to help students with disabilities and other \nstudents prepare for their careers. And they're planning to do even \nmore in the future.\n  Mr. President, ten years ago, we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. We said no to exclusion, dependence, and paternalism \nfor people with disabilities, and we said yes to inclusion, \nindependence, and empowerment. Iowa Disability Mentoring Day and \nprojects like the Healthy and Ready to Work Mentoring Project and the \nWorking Together So All Can Work Program bring the ADA to life every \nday by increasing the independence and self-sufficiency of people with \ndisabilities. I thank everyone who is a part of these efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S10996-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF BERKELEY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize certain projects in California \nfor the use or reuse of reclaimed water and for the design and \nconstruction of demonstration and permanent facilities for that \npurpose, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n          california reclaimed water act for the 21st century\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nCalifornia Reclaimed Water Act for the 21st century. As California \ntakes its first steps into the 21st century, it is undeniable that the \nquality of water, the quantity of water, and the availability of water \nare among the most formidable challenges to our 34 million citizens and \nthe many diverse regions of our fast growing state. Our farmers, urban \ndwellers, sport and commercial fishing interests, tribes, mountain \ncommunities and environmentalists all seek a more reliable and a more \ncertain water future. Recycled water plays an important part in meeting \nCalifornia's water needs today and will play an even more important \nrole in the next several decades.\n  California is making significant progress in its effort to put its \nwater house in order. Between March and June of this year, two major \nwater policy initiatives occurred in California. On March 7, 2000, \nCalifornia voters overwhelmingly approved a $2 billion water bond. \nFurther, on August 28, 2000, Governor Gray Davis and Interior Secretary \nBruce Babbitt signed the landmark CALFED water agreement which broadly \nsets a course for California's water future. Water recycling and reuse \nis a major element of both these new actions and policies.\n  The existing federal program to support water recycling is found in \ntitle XVI, Public Law 102-575 and was enacted in 1992. The law \nauthorized recycling projects and studies throughout California, \nincluding in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco. The \nlaw also authorized projects in Colorado and Arizona. The 1992 law also \ncalled for a special Southern California Comprehensive Water \nReclamation and Reuse study to investigate\n\n[[Page S11000]]\n\nhow the use of recycled water could relieve water supply pressure in \nCalifornia. That study is being prepared by the U.S. Bureau of \nReclamation, State of California's Department of Water Resources, \nMetropolitan Water District of Southern California, Central Basin and \nWest Basin Municipal Water Districts, City of Los Angeles, City of San \nDiego, San Diego Water Authority, Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority \nand the South Orange County Reclamation Authority. It should soon be \ncompleted.\n  Expressing continued support for the title XVI program, in 1996 \nCongress authorized a second group of water recycling projects in \nCalifornia, from Watsonville to Ventura County, and from Pasadena to \nOrange County, plus individual projects in Utah, New Mexico, Texas and \nNevada. The legislation I introduce today builds upon these \ncongressional efforts, voter ballot initiatives and agency studies. The \nbill authorizes a series of title XVI water recycling projects and \ndirects the Secretary of the Interior to work with various water \ndistricts throughout the State including: Castaic Lake Water Agency \nReclaimed Water Project Lake County, Clear Lake Basin Water Reuse \nProject East Bay Municipal Utility District and the San Ramon Serves \nDistrict Recycled Water Project Inland Empire Utilities Agency, Inland \nEmpire Regional Water Recycling Project in San Bernardino County San \nPablo Baylands Water Reuse Project in Sonoma, Napa, Marin and Solano \nCounties State of California Water Recycling Program Regional Brine \nLines (salt removal) in Southern California, the San Francisco Bay and \nthe Santa Clara Valley areas Chino Basin Watermaster, Inland Empire \nUtilities Agency, Western Municipal Water District and the Santa Ana \nWatershed Project Authority for the Lower Chino Dairy Area Desalination \nDemonstration and Reclamation Project.\n\n  Additional research, in cooperation with the WateReuse Foundation, is \nmandated and two previously authorized projects, one in Los Angeles and \nthe other in the San Gabriel Basin, are modified. Finally, my bill \nmandates that the proposed projects be coordinated with the CALFED \nProgram. Taken together, these projects will have the capacity to \nproduce hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water. The Inland Empire \nRegional Water Recycling Project, for example, is designed to yield up \nto 66,000 acre feet of recycled water annually. Each acre foot of \nrecycled water reduces the demand for imported water from the Bay-Delta \nand the Colorado River. Inland proposed to ``drought proof'' its region \nwith these and related investments.\n  Beneficiaries of these projects and these investments include the \nimmediate service areas, downstream neighbors, and towns and \ncommunities throughout California. Water recycling projects in \nCalifornia also reduce the demand for imported water, be it from the \nSan Francisco Bay-Delta or the Colorado River. Recycling and reuse \ninvestments in Southern California have the effect of helping the Bay-\nDelta by reducing demand for additional imported Bay-Delta water. These \nsame investments benefit California's neighboring states up and down \nthe Colorado River. As more water is developed locally, pressure is \nreduced for imports.\n  Presently, negotiations are underway between California and the other \nsix states of the Colorado River Basin. California is being asked to \nreduce the amount of water it takes from the Colorado River. In fact, \nas a result of these talks, California faces a reduction of some \n800,000 acre feet. The water recycling projects proposed in this \nlegislation can help California meet this challenge. As a result, Utah, \nColorado, Nevada and Arizona also benefit from these programs. Unlike \ntraditional Bureau of Reclamation water projects, these water recycling \nprojects require a majority of funds to be locally provided. Consistent \nwith title XVI limitations on recycling projects as authorized in 1992 \nand 1996, the projects proposed in my bill require 75 percent local \nfunding. Federal cost sharing is limited to 25 percent. Moreover, this \nbill specifies that none of the funds can be used for annual operation \nand maintenance costs. Those annual expenses are the responsibility of \nthe local water districts or management agency.\n  The water recycling projects authorized by my bill are part of a \nlong-term solution to some of California's most difficult challenges. \nWater recycling is not the only solution. But, water recycling and \nwater reuse can play a significant part as these projects can be \ndesigned, built, and placed on line within a short time. This bill \nhelps communities throughout California. This bill helps communities in \nSouthern California, reducing pressure on the Bay-Delta water supplies. \nAnd, this bill respects our neighboring states up and down the Colorado \nRiver. I ask unanimous consent that this legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3232\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for Medicare beneficiary copayments for outpatient mental \nhealth services that are the same as beneficiary copayments for other \npart B services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            MEDICARE MENTAL HEALTH MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nMental Health Modernization Act, a bill to improve the delivery of \nmental health services through the Medicare health care system. This \nimprovement and modernization of mental health services in the Medicare \nsystem is long overdue, as it has remained virtually unchanged since it \nwas enacted by Congress in 1965. In the 35 years since then, the \nscientific breakthroughs in our understanding of mental illnesses and \nthe enormous improvements in medications and other effective treatments \nhave dramatically changed our understanding and treatment of mental \nillness. Yet, the health care systems, both public and private, lag \nbehind in its treatment of this potentially life-threatening disease, \none that affects the young and the old. As we work to improve health \ncare for all Americans, in all health care systems, the ever-growing \npopulation of older Americans make it all the more urgent that we bring \nthe Medicare system into the 21st century, and bring mental health care \nto those in need.\n  Though they are so often not recognized, mental health problems among \nthe elderly are widespread and life-threatening. Americans aged 65 \nyears and older have the highest rate of suicide of any population in \nthe United States, and suicide rates increase with age. While this age \ngroup accounts for only 13 percent of the U.S. population, Americans 65 \nand older account for 20 percent of all suicide deaths. All too often, \ndepression among the elderly is untreated or inappropriately treated, \nand this disease and other illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, \nanxiety, late-life schizophrenia, can lead to severe impairment or \ndeath.\n  Major depression is strikingly prevalent among older people, with \nbetween 8 and 20 percent of older people in community studies showing \nsymptoms of depression. Studies of patients in primary care settings \nshow that up to 37 percent are experiencing such symptoms, although \nthey often go untreated. Depression is not a normal part of aging, but \na serious debilitating disease. Almost 20 percent of the population of \nindividuals age 55 and older experience a serious mental disorder. What \nis most alarming is that most elderly suicide victims--70 percent--have \nvisited their primary care doctor in the month prior to their completed \nsuicide. It is critical that the mental health expertise that is needed \nbe provided within the Medicare system, and that screening, diagnosis, \nand treatment be provided in a timely manner.\n  Medicare coverage for mental health services is markedly different \nfrom other outpatient services. In order to receive mental health care, \nseniors must pay, out of their own pockets, half the cost of a visit to \ntheir mental health specialist, an extremely unfair burden to place on \nthe elderly, who are so often facing other health or life difficulties \nas well.\n  We know too that substance abuse, particularly of alcohol and \nprescription drugs, among adults 65 and older is one of the fastest \ngrowing health problems in the United States, with 17 percent of this \nage group suffering from addiction or substance abuse. While addiction \noften goes undetected and untreated among older adults, aging and \ndisability only makes the body more vulnerable to the effects of these \ndrugs, further exacerbating underlying health problems, and creating a \nserious need for treatment that recognizes these vulnerabilities.\n  Medicare also provides health care coverage for non-elderly \nindividuals who are disabled, through Social Security Disability \nInsurance, SSDI. According to the Health Care Financing Agency, HCFA, \nMedicare is the primary health care coverage for the 5 million non-\nelderly, disabled people on SSDI. Up to 40 percent of these individuals \nhave a diagnosis of mental illness and/or addiction, and also face \nsevere discrimination in their mental health coverage.\n  What will my bill do? The Medicare Mental Health Modernization Act \nhas several important components. First, the bill reduces this \ndiscriminatory 50 percent copayment for mental health care to 20 \npercent, which is equal to the level that applies to every other \noutpatient service in Medicare. This is straightforward, fair, and the \nright thing to do. By doing so, this provision will increase access to \nmental health care overall, especially for those who currently forego \nseeking treatment, and instead, find themselves suffering from \nworsening mental health conditions. Secondly, the bill adds intensive \nresidential services to the Medicare mental health benefit package. \nThis provision will give people suffering from mental illnesses such as \nAlzheimer's disease or late-life schizophrenia an alternative to going \nto nursing homes. Instead, they will be able to be cared for in their \nhomes or in more appropriate residential settings. I also ask the \nSecretary for Health and Human Services to conduct a study of the \ncurrent Medicare coverage criteria to determine the extent to which \npeople with these forms of illnesses are receiving the appropriate care \nthat is needed.\n  Finally, my bill expands the number of mental health professionals \neligible to provide services through Medicare to include clinical \nsocial workers and licensed professional mental health counselors. \nProvision of adequate mental health services provided through Medicare \nrequires more trained and experienced providers for the aging and \ngrowing population and should include those who are appropriately \nlicensed and qualified to deliver such care.\n  These changes are needed now. The mental health groups most concerned \nwith medicare improvement are strongly supportive of this bill, \nincluding, among others, the American Counseling Association, the \nNational Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Mental Health \nAssociation, the American Psychological Association, the Bazelon Center \nfor Mental Health Law, and the National Association of State Mental \nHealth Program Directors. The U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher \nrecognized the urgency in his recent reports on mental health: ``Mental \nHealth: A Report of the Surgeon General'' and ``The Surgeon General's \nCall to Action to Prevent Suicide''. Dr. Satcher stated, ``Disability \ndue to mental illness in individuals over 65 years old will become a \nmajor public health problem in the near future because of demographic \nchanges.

It \nis time to treat the elderly in our society, particularly those with \nserious, debilitating diseases, with the care, respect, and fairness \nthey deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 3234. A bill to protect the public's ability to fish for sport, \nand for other purposes, to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                        the freedom to fish act\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to send to the desk a bill \nthat is called the Freedom to Fish Act. The legislation cosponsored by \nSenator Hutchison addresses an unsettling situation arising over access \nto our nation's public coastal resources. I understand that it is very \nlate in the session to be introducing new legislation, but I believe \nthis matter is significantly important to require immediate \nrecognition. There is a growing movement to limit the use and enjoyment \nof America's coastal and ocean waters. This restriction of public \naccess is occurring under the guise of the establishment of marine \nprotected areas. Many in the environmental community are lauding the \ncreation of these undersea national parks as the silver bullet solution \nto our over-exploited fisheries and degraded habitat. The bill I am \nintroducing today aims to correct a system that would unfairly penalize \nour nation's approximately ten million marine recreational anglers. For \nwhile I support the goal of healthy marine fisheries, I disagree \nstrongly with any method that unnecessarily limits our citizens' access \nto public waters.\n  I believe that my record clearly indicates my dedication to \nprotecting and improving the health of our oceans and coasts. However, \nI believe that restricting public access to those waters is not the \nappropriate vehicle for accomplishing that goal in most cases. The \nnotion of a marine park is certainly not new, having its origins in \nsuccessful land management practices. The establishment of wildlife \nrefuges, national parks and forests has shown clear benefits to the \nnatural species living on those lands and fresh waters. However, in the \ntransfer from the land to the marine waters one very important aspect \nof the protected area has been neglected. While sport fishing is nearly \nuniversally accepted throughout this nation's terrestrial parks, and \nwilderness areas, those advocating the use of marine parks take pains \nto specifically restrict the access of recreational anglers. This seems \nironic to me, as an increasing number of recreational anglers practice \ncatch and release fishing and all contribute money to their state's \nfish and game departments through the payment of license fees and \ntaxes. I believe these anglers to be among this nation's first \nconservationists and their contributions to the resource need to be \nrecognized.\n  In response to criticism and attacks against our Nation's sportsmen \nand women, I introduce the Freedom to Fish Act. The act establishes \nguidelines and safeguards by which the public's right to use and enjoy \nthese resources is preserved in all but the most serious cases. It \nprovides assurances that the angling public will have a place at the \ntable when decisions are made regarding their use of the resource. \nSecond, the Freedom to Fish Act will ensure that recreational anglers \nwill be prohibited from an area only when they have been shown to be \ncausing significant adverse effects on that fishery resource. Further, \nshould prohibitions be justified, this bill prevents areas larger than \nscientifically necessary from being closed. In those cases, criteria \nwill be established so that once certain goals have been reached, the \narea will reopen to the public immediately. Restricting public \nadmission to our coastal waters should not be our first course of \naction, but rather our last resort. Open access to fishing is the \nsingle most important element of recreational fishing. We must defend \npublic access against those that would try to restrict it under the \ncloak of marine resource protection. With that, I submit the Freedom to \nFish Act for your review and discussion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 3235. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a deferral of tax on gain from the sale of telecommunications \nbusinesses in specific circumstances or a tax credit and other \nincentives to promote diversity of ownership in telecommunications \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           Telecommunications Ownership Diversity Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce revised \nlegislation that will make sure that new entrants and small businesses \nwill have the chance to enter and grow in today's megacorporation-\ndominated telecommunications marketplace. Together with my good friend \nand colleague, Communications Subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns, I am \npleased to bring forward for the Senate's consideration The \nTelecommunications Ownership Diversity Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, no one needs to be told that any small business faces \nsignificant barriers in trying to enter the telecommunications \nindustry. These barriers are even more formidable when the entrepreneur \nhappens to be a woman or a member of a minority group, due to their \nhistorically more difficult job of obtaining needed financing. \nTherefore, in this current telecom industry mixer, small businesses, \nespecially those owned by minorities or women, are often left without \npartners, watching as bigger, more established companies, get to dance.\n  That's not right, but there is an answer. The answer isn't to forbid \nmergers out-of-hand, or to retain hopelessly outdated FCC ownership \nrestrictions, or to pursue constitutionally or economically doomed set-\naside programs. The answer is to give established industry players \neconomic incentives to deal with new entrants and small businesses that \ncounterbalance the incentives they have to deal with larger companies.\n  And that's what this bill does. The Telecommunications Ownership \nDiversity Act of 2000 will promote entry into the telecommunications \nindustry during this period of unprecedented restructuring by providing \ncarefully-limited changes to the tax law. These changes to the tax law \nare an indispensable component of the solution. Under current law, \nsmaller companies typically must purchase properties for cash, and cash \ntransactions are fully taxable to the seller. So naturally sellers of \ntelecommunications businesses prefer to sell for stock, which is tax-\ndeferred, and which large companies have to offer.\n  The Act will level the playing field for new entrants and small \nbusinesses by giving telecommunications business sellers a tax deferral \nwhen the property is bought for cash by a small business \ntelecommunications company. The Act will also encourage the entry of \nnew players and the growth of existing small businesses by enabling the \nseller of a telecommunications business to claim the tax deferral on \ncapital gains if it invests the proceeds of any sale of its business in \npurchasing an interest in an eligible small business.\n  In recognition of the convergence of telecommunications services and \nthe growing importance of wireless and other services as an essential \ncomponent of the telecommunications market, the telecommunications \nbusinesses eligible for this capital gains tax deferral are broadly \ndefined to include not only broadcast and cable TV-type businesses, but \nalso wireline and wireless telephone service providers and resellers. \nTo eliminate the potential for abuse, the Act would require the \neligible purchaser to hold any property acquired for three years, \nduring which time it could only be sold to an unrelated eligible \npurchaser. The General Accounting Office is required to thoroughly \naudit and report on the administration and effect of the Act every two \nyears.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents a significant step toward \nhelping to ensure that small companies share a portion of the \ninvestment benefits our tax laws give to major telecommunications \ncompanies. Over the next several months, we look forward to working \nwith interested organizations to further refine this legislation. \nSpecifically, we would welcome comments on how to further refine the \nconcepts of qualified telecommunications business and eligible \npurchaser so as to ensure that this legislation meets its\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\ngoals in the most fair and effective manner. Moreover, we note that \nthis legislation contains a ``control'' test that is intended to ensure \nthat this legislation is not subject to abuse--and actually benefits \nthose that it is intended to help. We recognize, however, that this \ncontrol test may also need to be refined as we go forward.\n  Mr. President, hallmark developments in the telecommunications \nindustry have been made by gifted individuals with small companies and \nunlimited vision. In this sense the telecommunications industry is a \ntrue microcosm of the American free-market system, in which the \nbenefits produced by its entrepreneurs generate benefits that extend to \nall of us. It is therefore critically important that new entrants and \nsmall businesses have a chance to participate across the broad spectrum \nof industries that will make up the telecommunications industry in the \nInformation Age. The Act will help them do that, and Senator Burns and \nI are proud to sponsor it and to work for its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 3237. A bill to provide for an international scientific commission \nto assess changes in global climate patterns, to conduct scientific \nstudies and analyses on behalf of nations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          international climate change science commission act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this bill provides for the creation of an \ninternational scientific commission to assess changes in global climate \npatterns and to conduct scientific studies and analysis on behalf of \nthe nations of the world.\n  The Commerce Committee held three hearings on the subject of climate \nchange this year. We heard from several witnesses on the science of \nglobal warming, the impacts of climate change on the United States, and \nsolutions to climate change.\n  One of the most salient points of the three hearings was the \nimportance of good science to the policymaking process. Most \nimportantly, any action the United States takes in response to claims \nof global warming must be based on the best science available and not \non rhetoric or political expedience. We must continue to invest in our \nresearch capabilities to fully understand the scientific interactions \nbetween humans, the land, the ocean, and the atmosphere.\n  Based upon testimonies received by the Commerce Committee, the \nknowledge base in some countries is far greater than in others. To \nsolve this global problem of climate change, we must rely upon all the \nresources and knowledge available to us. We must ensure that the United \nStates research program is providing the maximum returns on our \ninvestment dollars. It was both surprising and disappointing to see \nthat for a recent assessment of the United States, we had to rely upon \ntwo foreign computer models. We must do better.\n  Mr. President, I feel it is of vital importance that we allow \nscientists the opportunity to pursue knowledge as opposed to being \nconstrained by politics. In introducing this bill entitled, \nInternational Climate Change Science Commission Act, it is my hope and \nintention that the membership of the Commission will be filled by those \nwho are scientists and fully appreciate the pursuit of truth and \nknowledge. I hope this commission will provide them with an opportunity \nto freely research, discuss, and document their scientific findings.\n  Mr. President, I realize this bill will not pass this session. \nHowever, it is my hope that by introducing this bill a discussion will \nbegin in the scientific community of how to better structure this piece \nof legislation and to ensure that the best available science is used \nfor policy decisions. After discussions with the scientific community, \nI intend to re-introduce this bill or a new version of the measure next \nsession and hopefully then move towards its enactment.\n  I also plan to offer other pieces of legislation next year in this \narea. There are several types of actions that may be taken to address \nthis situation as indicated in the Commerce Committee's hearing, \n``Solutions to Climate Change,'' held on September 21, 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3238. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprotections for individuals who need mental health services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                  the mental health access act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of the more than 50 million Americans each year who suffer from \nmental illness. This bill, the Mental Health Access Act, removes one of \nthe many barriers to health care faced by those who have been treated \nfor a mental condition.\n  The Mental Health Access Act limits the ability of health plans to \nredline individuals with a preexisting mental health conditions. I \nundertook this initiative when I learned that some of my constituents \nwere being turned away from health plans in the private non-group \nmarket due solely to a past history of treatment for mental conditions. \nUnfortunately, under the current system of care in the United States, \nindividuals who are undergoing treatment or have a history of treatment \nfor mental illness may find it difficult to obtain private health \ninsurance, especially if they must purchase it on their own and do not \nhave an employer-sponsored group plan available to them. In part this \nis because while the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct (HIPPAA) protects millions of Americans in the group health \ninsurance market, it affords few protections for individuals who apply \nfor private non-group insurance.\n  The Mental Health Access Act closes this loophole by limiting any \npreexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental health condition \nto not more than 12 months and reducing this exclusion period by the \ntotal amount of previous creditable coverage. It prohibits any health \ninsurer that offers health coverage in the individual insurance market \nfrom imposing a preexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental \nhealth condition unless a diagnosis, medical advice or treatment was \nrecommended or received within the 6 months period to the enrollment \ndate. And it prohibits health plans in the individual market from \ncharging higher premiums to individuals based solely on the \ndetermination that the such individual has had a preexisting mental \nhealth condition. These provisions apply to all health plans in the \nindividual market, regardless of whether a state has enacted an \nalternative mechanism (such as a risk pool) to cover individuals with \npreexisting health conditions.\n  The Mental Health Access Act complements ongoing efforts to enhance \nparity between mental health services and other health benefits. This \nis because parity alone will not help individuals who do not have \naccess to any affordable health insurance due to preexisting mental \nillness discrimination. The Access Act does not mandate that insurers \nprovide mental health services if they are not already offering such \ncoverage. It simply prohibits plans in the private non-group market \nfrom redlining individuals who apply for general health insurance based \nsolely on a past history of treatment for a mental condition.\n  Recognizing that we are nearing the close of this year's legislative \nsession. I plan to reintroduced this bill when Congress returns and it \nis my hope that many of my colleagues will join me. In the meantime, I \nhave asked the General Accounting Office (GAO)to examine the extent to \nwhich private health insurers medically underwrite for mental health \nconditions by either denying coverage or raising premiums, often to a \nlevel that is unaffordable for many individuals. Specifically, I have \nasked the GAO to examine: the types of mental health conditions for \nwhich individual health insurers typically underwrite; the degree to \nwhich there is an actuarial basis for these carrier practices; the \nprevalence of medical underwriting for mental health conditions that \nresult in denying coverage or raising premiums; and the extent of state \nlaws that prevent or constrain insurers from denying coverage or \nraising premiums due to a history of mental health conditions, \nincluding consumer protections such as appeals procedures and access to \ninformation.\n  It simply does not make sense that just because a person seeks \ntreatment\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\nfor mental illness he or she is rendered uninsurable. I invite my \ncolleagues to enlist in this important initiative to ensure that such \nindividuals are not discriminated against when applying for health \ninsurance coverage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Jeffords, \n        and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 3242. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to encourage equity investment in rural cooperatives and other \nrural businesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n        national rural cooperative and business equity fund act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Craig and I are introducing \nthe National Rural Cooperative and Business Equity Fund Act to create a \nnew public/private partnership designed to attract equity investment in \ncooperatives and other businesses in rural America. Senators Daschle, \nJeffords, and Johnson are cosponsoring this bipartisan measure.\n  The Iowa 2010 Strategic Planning Council was commissioned by Governor \nVilsack to identify barriers to Iowa's economic development progress \nover the next ten years. The council found that two very significant \nhurdles were lack of venture funding and access to capital.\n  The situation is no different in many other rural areas. Many new \nrural businesses, particularly cooperatives and farmer-owned \nbusinesses, have tremendous difficulty acquiring equity capital--\nespecially those involving value-added agricultural processing.\n  In Iowa alone, I have seen many cases where equity capital would have \nmade a big difference in the future of a rural business. And every time \nwe lose an opportunity to help a business, it means fewer jobs, fewer \nwell-paying jobs, and less income for rural and small town America.\n  In fact, just recently, in eastern Iowa, a group of turkey producers \njoined together to purchase the soon-to-be-closed West Liberty packing \nplant from Louis Rich. Ultimately--with the assistance of a USDA loan \nguarantee and state and private support--the co-op successfully \npurchased the plant. However, they almost went under because of limited \nequity. Only by the skin of our teeth are those jobs still in Iowa and \nthose farmers still enjoying the benefits of cooperative ownership of \nthat plant. In too many other cases, good ideas have been shattered \nbecause of a lack of equity.\n  My state has made some progress through the Iowa Department of \nEconomic Development's ``Community Economic Betterment Account'' or \nCEBA, which recently set aside some funding for venture capital. But \nfar more resources are needed in Iowa and across Rural America.\n  That's why this legislation is so important. If we pass the National \nRural Cooperative and Business Equity Fund Act, we will help quality \nrural cooperatives and businesses succeed and expand, and we will \ncreate jobs and raise the incomes of employees and farmers.\n  We're opening this bill up to discussion today with the hope of \npassing it in the next Congress. I believe this legislation has a \nstrong start in the support of Senators Craig, Daschle, Jeffords, and \nJohnson. We also have the support of a number of national organizations \nthat are key players in rural economic development including: Agribank, \nthe American Bankers Association, CoBank, the Farm Credit Council, the \nIndependent Community Bankers Association, the National Cooperative \nBusiness Association, the National Cooperative Bank, National Farmers \nUnion, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, and the \nNational Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Cooperation.\n  The equity fund created by this legislation will have a 12-person \nBoard of Directors that would decide which proposals to fund. This \nboard would include the Secretary of Agriculture and two of his or her \nappointees, and the remainder of the Board would be made up of private \ninvestors in the fund. The first $150 million in private sector \ninvestments will be matched dollar for dollar by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture over a three year period. As a compensation for the lower \nrate of return in the equity fund relative to other investments, the \nDepartment of Agriculture will guarantee up to 50 percent of an \ninvestment. Debentures, which would be guaranteed, could also be \nissued.\n  Businesses applying for equity from the fund must be sponsored by a \nlocal entity, such as a bank, a regional or local development council, \nor a cooperative or economic development group. The businesses must be \nbased in rural areas, and they cannot be primarily retail businesses. \nCooperatives and other businesses receiving an equity investment from \nthe fund will be required to invest a substantial amount of their own \ncapital.\n  The Fund is intended to support projects that will provide off-farm \nincome, additional markets for agricultural products, and new business \nopportunities in rural communities. A diverse range of viable projects, \nrepresenting a variety of business structures, operating in rural \ncommunities of various sizes would be encouraged.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues and those concerned about rural \neconomic development to examine this measure between Congresses and at \nthe beginning of the coming Congress. I am hopeful that we will be able \nto make the National Rural Cooperative and Business Equity Fund a \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url":

Res. 371\n\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was born in Boston, \n     Massachusetts on September 6, 1908, the 31st anniversary of \n     the death of Lakota Sioux leader Crazy Horse;\n       Whereas, although never trained in art or sculpture, \n     Korczak Ziolkowski began a successful studio career in New \n     England as a commissioned sculptor at age 24;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski's marble sculpture of composer \n     and Polish leader Ignace Jan Paderewski won first prize at \n     the 1939 New York World's Fair and prompted Lakota Indian \n     Chiefs to invite Ziolkowski to carve a memorial for Native \n     Americans;\n       Whereas in his invitation letter to Korczak Ziolkowski, \n     Chief Henry Standing Bear wrote: ``My fellow chiefs and I \n     would like the white man to know that the red man has great \n     heroes, too.'';\n       Whereas in 1939, Korczak Ziolkowski assisted Gutzon Borglum \n     in carving Mount Rushmore;\n       Whereas in 1941, Korczak Ziolkowski met with Chief Henry \n     Standing Bear who taught Korczak more about the life of the \n     brave Sioux leader Crazy Horse;\n       Whereas at the age of 34, Korczak Ziolkowski temporarily \n     put his sculpting career aside when he volunteered for \n     service in World War II, later landing on Omaha Beach;\n       Whereas after the war, Korczak Ziolkowski turned down other \n     sculpting opportunities in order to accept the invitation of \n     Chief Henry Standing Bear and dedicate the rest of his life \n     to carving the Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of \n     South Dakota;\n       Whereas on June 3, 1948, when work was begun on the Crazy \n     Horse Memorial, Korczak Ziolkowski vowed that the memorial \n     would be a nonprofit educational and cultural project, \n     financed solely through private, nongovernmental sources, to \n     honor the Native Americans of North America;\n       Whereas the Crazy Horse Memorial is a mountain carving-in-\n     progress, and once completed it will be the largest sculpture \n     in the world;\n       Whereas since his death on October 20, 1982, Korczak's wife \n     Ruth, the Ziolkowski family, and the Crazy Horse Memorial \n     Foundation have continued to work on the Memorial and to \n     continue the dream of Korczak Ziolkowski and Chief Henry \n     Standing Bear; and\n       Whereas on June 3, 1998, the Memorial entered its second \n     half century of progress and heralded a new era of work on \n     the mountain with the completion and dedication of the face \n     of Crazy Horse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That\n       (1) the Senate recognizes--\n       (A) the admirable efforts of the late Korczak Ziolkowski in \n     designing and creating the Crazy Horse Memorial;\n       (B) that the Crazy Horse Memorial represents all North \n     American Indian tribes, and the noble goal of reconciliation \n     between peoples; and\n       (C) that the creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial, from its \n     inception, has been accomplished through private sources and \n     without any Federal funding; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the Citizens' Stamp \n     Advisory Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General \n     that a commemorative postage stamp be issued in honor of \n     sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski and the Crazy Horse Memorial for \n     the 20th anniversary of his death, October 20, 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11007-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11007-S11009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AIRPORT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate agree to the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have just passed the Aviation \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2000. I am very pleased that we have been \nable, in a very bipartisan way, to pass this bill. I would like to just \ntalk a little bit about how we came to pass the Aviation Security Act \nof 2000.\n  Thanks to Senator Slade Gorton, the chairman of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, I was able to chair a hearing in which we heard from the \nFAA, particularly Admiral Flynn, about the state of our airport \nsecurity. ``What is the state of our airport security?'' we asked. We \nwanted to know if we were doing everything we could to give our \ntraveling public the most security possible.\n  Admiral Flynn did a report and shared that with the Members of the \nSenate who came to the hearing. Every single Senator who attended the \nhearing became a cosponsor of the bill that we have just passed because \nthere were some areas that we could clearly see needed to be made more \nstrict, more stringent, just to make sure that we take every single \nmeasure we can to make our airports totally secure. Not that they are \nnot, but there were some areas in which we could do better.\n  So after the hearing and because of the outstanding testimony of \nAdmiral Flynn of the FAA, we did put together a bill that was quite \nbipartisan. Chairman John McCain of the Commerce Committee came \ntogether with Chairman Slade Gorton of the Aviation Subcommittee. \nSenators Hollings, Inouye, Bryan, and Rockefeller all became immediate \ncosponsors of the bill. With that bipartisan group, we were able to \nmake the changes that have been passed by the House and now will go to \nthe President.\n  Six hundred million travelers will pass through U.S. airports. Their \nsafety depends on the soundness of the inspection points and the \ncheckpoints, and we all have been through those monitors and we know \nhow important it is that we have the best equipment and the best \ntrained technicians to make sure we do not have any kind of firearms or \nexplosives of any kind going into our airplanes.\n\n  So we were able to pass this bill. I just want to make a couple of \nthe points that are important in the bill.\n  First, today, a person who has a lapse in employment history--whether \nit would be a year, 18 months, 2 years--would have a criminal \nbackground check done before they could be hired to be an airport \nbaggage screener.\n  Under the bill that we are passing today, there will be a criminal \nhistory record check on every person who becomes a baggage screener.\n  Secondly, we looked at the airport training requirements for airport \nbaggage screeners. We found that in the most industrialized countries \nthere is a minimum of 40 hours of required training before a person can \nbecome a baggage screener, but in America the standard is 8 hours.\n  The committee and the Congress believe we need to have more hours of \nrequired training and a test for baggage screeners. That will happen \nbecause of the bill we have just passed.\n  Third, the security procedures in sensitive areas, such as the air \ntraffic control towers, will be beefed up. And there will be prescribed \nsecurity protocols and sanctions for people who violate those \nprotocols.\n  And fourth, the new generation of explosive detection systems will be \nutilized at a higher rate because of the bill we have passed today.\n  I think we have done a very good job. I am very pleased that we had \nsuch a bipartisan effort on this piece of legislation. It could not \nhave happened without the House and the Senate working together and so \nmany people who did come into the negotiations on this bill. The \nleadership of our chairman, John McCain, and our subcommittee chairman, \nSlade Gorton, were essential, along with Senators Hollings, Inouye, \nBryan, and Rockefeller.\n  I also thank the staff who worked so hard. As you know, many times \nSenators have 10 things that are being asked of them at any one time. \nWithout very good staff work, this would not have passed. So I \nespecially thank my Commerce Committee staff legislative aid, Joe \nMondello, who did yeoman service in making sure the bill got through \ncommittee and worked out all the little things that came up that could \nhave unraveled the bill and did not. On Senator McCain's staff, Mike \nReynolds, and Rob Chamberlin, who also did terrific work in making sure \nwe got this expeditiously through the committee in the last hours of \nthe session, because we did not want to wait 60 days before we could \nbring this back next year. It is too important.\n  The air traveling public deserve to have the very best airport \nsecurity. That is what this bill will allow. I believe the President \nwill sign the bill. I urge him to do so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11009-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 859, S. 1898.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1898) to provide protection against the risks to \n     the public that are inherent in the interstate transportation \n     of violent prisoners.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from the Committee on the Juidiciary, \nwith an amendment; as follows:\n\n  [Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the part printed \nin italic.]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Interstate Transportation of \n     Dangerous Criminals Act of 2000'' or ``Jeanna's Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Increasingly, States are turning to private prisoner \n     transport companies as an alternative to their own personnel \n     or the United States Marshals Service when transporting \n     violent prisoners.\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\n       (2) The transport process can last for days if not weeks, \n     as violent prisoners are dropped off and picked up at a \n     network of hubs across the country.\n       (3) Escapes by violent prisoners during transport by \n     private prisoner transport companies have occurred.\n       (4) Oversight by the Attorney General is required to \n     address these problems.\n       (5) While most governmental entities may prefer to use, and \n     will continue to use, fully trained and sworn law enforcement \n     officers when transporting violent prisoners, fiscal or \n     logistical concerns may make the use of highly specialized \n     private prisoner transport companies an option. Nothing in \n     this Act should be construed to mean that governmental \n     entities should contract with private prisoner transport \n     companies to move violent prisoners; however when a \n     government entity opts to use a private prisoner transport \n     company to move violent prisoners, then the company should be \n     subject to regulation in order to enhance public safety.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Crime of violence.--The term ``crime of violence'' has \n     the same meaning as in section 924(c)(3) of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n       (2) Private prisoner transport company.--The term ``private \n     prisoner transport company'' means any entity, other than the \n     United States, a State, or an inferior political subdivision \n     of a State, which engages in the business of the transporting \n     for compensation, individuals committed to the custody of any \n     State or of an inferior political subdivision of a State, or \n     any attempt thereof.\n       (3) Violent prisoner.--The term ``violent prisoner'' means \n     any individual in the custody of a State or an inferior \n     political subdivision of a State who has previously been \n     convicted of or is currently charged with a crime of violence \n     or any similar statute of a State or the inferior political \n     subdivisions of a State, or any attempt thereof.\n\n     SEC. 4. FEDERAL REGULATION OF PRISONER TRANSPORT COMPANIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in consultation \n     with the American Correctional Association and the private \n     prisoner transport industry, shall promulgate regulations \n     relating to the transportation of violent prisoners in or \n     affecting interstate commerce.\n       (b) Standards and Requirements.--The regulations shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) Minimum standards for background checks and \n     preemployment drug testing for potential employees, including \n     requiring criminal background checks, to disqualify persons \n     with a felony conviction or domestic violence conviction as \n     defined by section 921 of title 18, United States Code, for \n     eligibility for employment. Preemployment drug testing will \n     be in accordance with applicable State laws.\n       (2) Minimum standards for the length and type of training \n     that employees must undergo before they can transport \n     prisoners not to exceed 100 hours of preservice training \n     focusing on the transportation of prisoners. Training shall \n     be in the areas of use of restraints, searches, use of force, \n     including use of appropriate weapons and firearms, CPR, map \n     reading, and defensive driving.\n       (3) Restrictions on the number of hours that employees can \n     be on duty during a given time period. Such restriction shall \n     not be more stringent than current applicable rules and \n     regulations concerning hours of service promulgated under the \n     Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act.\n       (4) Minimum standards for the number of personnel that must \n     supervise violent prisoners. Such standards shall provide the \n     transport entity with appropriate discretion, and, absent \n     more restrictive requirements contracted for by the procuring \n     government entity, shall not exceed a requirement of 1 agent \n     for every 6 violent prisoners.\n       (5) Minimum standards for employee uniforms and \n     identification that require wearing of a uniform with a badge \n     or insignia identifying the employee as a transportation \n     officer.\n       (6) Standards establishing categories of violent prisoners \n     required to wear brightly colored clothing clearly \n     identifying them as prisoners, when appropriate.\n       (7) Minimum requirements for the restraints that must be \n     used when transporting violent prisoners, to include leg \n     shackles and double-locked handcuffs, when appropriate.\n       (8) A requirement that when transporting violent prisoners, \n     private prisoner transport companies notify local law \n     enforcement officials 24 hours in advance of any scheduled \n     stops in their jurisdiction.\n       (9) A requirement that in the event of an escape by a \n     violent prisoner, private prisoner transport company \n     officials shall immediately notify appropriate law \n     enforcement officials in the jurisdiction where the escape \n     occurs, and the governmental entity that contracted with the \n     private prisoner transport company for the transport of the \n     escaped violent prisoner.\n       (10) Minimum standards for the safety of violent prisoners \n     in accordance with applicable Federal and State law.\n       (c) Federal Standards.--Except for the requirements of \n     subsection (b)(6), the regulations promulgated under this Act \n     shall not provide stricter standards with respect to private \n     prisoner transport companies than are applicable, without \n     exception, to the United States Marshals Service, Federal \n     Bureau of Prisons, and the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service when transporting violent prisoners under comparable \n     circumstances.\n\n     SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Penalty.--Any person who is found in violation of the \n     regulations established by this Act shall--\n       (1) be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in \n     an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each violation and, in \n     addition, to the United States for the costs of prosecution; \n     and\n       (2) make restitution to any entity of the United States, of \n     a State, or of an inferior political subdivision of a State, \n     which expends funds for the purpose of apprehending any \n     violent prisoner who escapes from a prisoner transport \n     company as the result, in whole or in part, of a violation of \n     regulations promulgated pursuant to section 4(a).\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor S. 1898, the Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act, \nalso known as ``Jeanna's bill.'' I worked with Senator Dorgan in \ndeveloping this legislation, which passed the Judiciary Committee in \nSeptember with unanimous bipartisan support. I praise Senator Dorgan's \nleadership, and am proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  Kyle Bell was sentenced to life in prison for the brutal murder of \n11-year old Jeanna North. On October 13, 1999, Bell escaped, while \nbeing transferred interstate by a private prisoner transport company. \nHe picked the locks on his handcuffs and leg irons, and slipped off the \nbus while it was stopped for gas in New Mexico. He was wearing his own \nstreet clothes and shoes. The guards did not notice that Bell was \nmissing until nine hours later, and then delayed in notifying New \nMexico authorities.\n  Kyle Bell's escape is not an isolated case. In recent years, there \nhave been several escapes by violent criminals when vans operated by \nprivate prisoner transport companies broke down or guards fell asleep \non duty. There have also been an alarming number of traffic accidents \nin which prisoners were seriously injured or killed because drivers \nwere tired, inattentive or poorly trained.\n  Privatization of prisons and prisoner transportation services may be \ncost efficient, but public safety must come first. Jeanna's bill, \nS.1898, requires the Attorney General to establish some basic, common-\nsense guidelines for private companies that transport violent criminals \nacross State lines, including:\n  minimum standards for pre-employment background checks;\n  minimum standards for training employees;\n  minimum standards for the identification, restraint, and safety of \nviolent prisoners; and\n  a requirement that private prisoner transport companies notify local \nlaw enforcement in advance of any stops in their jurisdiction.\n  A violation is punishable by a $10,000 fine, plus restitution for the \ncost of re-capturing any violent prisoner who escapes as the result of \nsuch violation. This should create a healthy incentive for companies to \nabide by the regulations and operate responsibly.\n  As Senator Dorgan has pointed out, a company hauling hazardous waste, \ncattle, or even circus animals has to meet certain minimum standards. \nYet there are no requirements for hauling violent criminals around the \ncountry.\n  Jeanna's bill has been endorsed by a wide range of law enforcement \nand victims' rights groups, including the National Sheriff's \nAssociation, the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nFraternal Order of Police, the California Correctional Peace Officers \nAssociation, the New York Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent \nAssociation, the National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children, \nthe KlassKids Foundation, and many others. It will go a long way toward \npreventing more violent criminals from escaping. I am pleased that the \nSenate is finally passing this important legislation, and urge the \nHouse of Representatives to do the same.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1898), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11012-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11012-S11013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AMENDING THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Res. 153\n\n       Whereas on October 15, 2000, Aleksandr Lukashenko and his \n     authoritarian regime conducted an illegitimate and \n     undemocratic parliamentary election in an effort to further \n     strengthen the power and control his authoritarian regime \n     exercises over the people of the Republic of Belarus;\n       Whereas during the time preceding this election the regime \n     of Aleksandr Lukashenko attempted to intimidate the \n     democratic opposition by beating, harassing, arresting, and \n     sentencing its members for supporting a boycott of the \n     October 15 election even though Belarus does not contain a \n     legal ban on efforts to boycott elections;\n       Whereas the democratic opposition in Belarus was denied \n     fair and equal access to state-controlled television and \n     radio and was instead slandered by the state-controlled \n     media;\n       Whereas on September 13, 2000, Belarusian police seized \n     100,000 copies of a special edition of the Belarusian Free \n     Trade Union newspaper, Rabochy, dedicated to the democratic \n     opposition's efforts to promote a boycott of the October 15 \n     election;\n       Whereas Aleksandr Lukashenko and his regime denied the \n     democratic opposition in Belarus seats on the Central \n     Election Commission, thereby violating his own pledge to \n     provide the democratic opposition a role in this Commission;\n       Whereas Aleksandr Lukashenko and his regime denied the vast \n     majority of independent candidates opposed to his regime the \n     right to register as candidates in this election;\n       Whereas Aleksandr Lukashenko and his regime dismissed \n     recommendations presented by the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for making the election law \n     in Belarus consistent with OSCE standards;\n       Whereas in Grodno, police loyal to Aleksandr Lukashenko \n     summoned voters to participate in this illegitimate election \n     for parliament;\n       Whereas the last genuinely free and fair parliamentary \n     election in Belarus took place in 1995 and from it emerged \n     the 13th Supreme Soviet whose democratically and \n     constitutionally derived authorities and powers have been \n     undercut by the authoritarian regime of Aleksandr Lukashenko; \n     and\n       Whereas on October 11, the Lukashenko regime froze the bank \n     accounts and seized the equipment of the independent \n     publishing company, Magic, where most of the independent \n     newspapers in Minsk are published: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 783) to limit access to body armor by violent \n     felons and to facilitate the donation of Federal surplus body \n     armor to State and local law enforcement agencies.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary with an \namendment, as follows:\n  (Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the part printed \nin italic.)\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``James Guelff Body Armor Act \n     of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are \n     facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly \n     weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;\n       (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n     interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;\n       (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise \n     affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls \n     over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to \n     control this traffic within their own borders through the \n     exercise of their police power;\n       (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco \n     Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers \n     of body armor and a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, \n     California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects \n     outfitted in body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to \n     community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor \n     during the commission of a violent crime;\n       (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line \n     of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been \n     saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 \n     times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;\n       (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent \n     of State and local police are not issued body armor;\n       (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local \n     police departments access to body armor that is no longer \n     needed by Federal agencies; and\n       (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce \n     that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Body armor.--The term ``body armor'' means any product \n     sold or offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce, \n     as personal protective body covering intended to protect \n     against gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be \n     worn alone or is sold as a complement to another product or \n     garment.\n       (2) Law enforcement agency.--The term ``law enforcement \n     agency'' means an agency of the United States, a State, or a \n     political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a \n     government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, \n     detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of \n     criminal law.\n       (3) Law enforcement officer.--The term ``law enforcement \n     officer'' means any officer, agent, or employee of the United \n     States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, \n     authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or \n     supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or \n     prosecution of any violation of criminal law.\n\n     SEC. 4. AMENDMENT OF SENTENCING GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO \n                   BODY ARMOR.\n\n       (a) Sentencing Enhancement.--The United States Sentencing \n     Commission shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to \n     provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement, increasing the \n     offense level not less than 2 levels, for any offense in \n     which the defendant used body armor.\n       (b) Applicability.--No amendment made to the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines pursuant to this section shall apply if \n     the Federal offense in which the body armor is used \n     constitutes a violation of, attempted violation of, or \n     conspiracy to violate the civil rights of any person by a law \n     enforcement officer acting under color of the authority of \n     such law enforcement officer.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROHIBITION OF PURCHASE, USE, OR POSSESSION OF BODY \n                   ARMOR BY VIOLENT FELONS.\n\n       (a) Definition of Body Armor.--Section 921(a) of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(35) The term `body armor' means any product sold or \n     offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce, as \n     personal protective body covering intended to protect against \n     gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be worn \n     alone or is sold as a complement to another product or \n     garment.''.\n       (b) Prohibition.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 931.

If that \n     defendant has no supervisor, prior written certification is \n     acceptable from any other employee of the business.''.\n       (2) Clerical amendment.--The analysis for chapter 44 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n``931. Prohibition on purchase, ownership, or possession of body armor \n              by violent felons.''.\n\n       (c) Penalties.--Section 924(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) Whoever knowingly violates section 931 shall be fined \n     under this title, imprisoned not more than 3 years, or \n     both.''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

First, I want to pay tribute to a man that has literally \nbeen like a father, brother, and uncle to me, and a close confidant for \na quarter of a century. I affectionately call him ``the coach.'' \nStanley Israelite has been with me in my office from the very first day \nin January of 1975 when I was sworn into the House of Representatives, \nuntil just months ago when, at age 75, he retired from the service of \nthe U.S. Senate and service to me as a Member of the House and the \nSenate.\n  There are many words to describe Stanley Israelite and the many roles \nin my life and the lives of countless others in Connecticut and the \ncountry that he has served as a friend, counselor, trusted advisor, and \nfaithful public servant. While these words can describe what he has \nbeen, there are really no words to describe what he has meant, \nparticularly to me and to literally hundreds of others who have been \nblessed to know him and have been affected by the work he has performed \non their behalf. It is equally the case that there are no words to \nexpress my true feelings of deep gratitude for Stanley's service and my \npersonal sadness that he is retiring from the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, in a recent edition of the New London Day, a local \npaper in Connecticut, the headline read ``Israelite Enjoys Retirement \nfor Day, Then Joins NCDC''--the Norwich Community Development \nCorporation. That one headline fairly well sums up Stanley's remarkable \nlife of service. For almost 75 years, he has led a life of tireless \ndevotion to the things that endure in this life: faith, family, \ncompassion for the less fortunate, integrity, and great humility.\n  While many think of him as a quintessential public servant, Stanley \nIsraelite's roots actually lie in the world of small business. His \nfirst occupation, after serving in the U.S. military, was helping to \nrun his father's jewelry store in Norwich, Connecticut. He would later \nserve as an officer of the Norwich Chamber of Commerce and then became \ndirector of it. In fact, he was director when he joined me as a \nfreshman member of the House. Subsequently, he was elected as a member \nof the City Council in his beloved hometown of Norwich, Connecticut, \nand was chosen to serve as commissioner to the Norwich Department of \nPublic Utilities.\n  In his ``spare time,'' he was corporator of the William W. Backus \nHospital in Norwich, the former Norwich Savings Society, and the \nNorwich Free Academy, one of the oldest, if not the oldest, public high \nschools in America.\n  In the 1970s, he served as head of the Norwich Community Development \nCorporation. In that role, he oversaw the establishment of the Norwich \nIndustrial Park. I know a lot of industrial parks built today are \nrather commonplace, but this was one of the first and one of the most \nunique in the State of Connecticut and across the country. This \nfacility embodies Stanley's vision of a thriving economic community in \nsoutheastern Connecticut, and he created it while maintaining the \nwonderful topography and environmental integrity of that part of the \ncity of Norwich.\n  It represents, in many ways--in stone, metal, glass, and the \nenvironment that surrounds it--the deep commitment of this remarkable \nman to make life better for those around him. As one former State \nSenator recently said of Stanley's work on the Norwich Industrial Park, \n``It's high time we name the park after him.'' I second that thought.\n  For the past 25 years, I have had the great privilege of knowing \nStanley as a member of my staff. He served as my State director and \nsenior advisor for a quarter century. But what truly distinguished \nStanley was not the title that he held in my office, but his rock-solid \nsense of purpose. Stanley was with me on the very first day that I was \nsworn in as a new Member of Congress. Every single day, 7 days a week, \nI had at least one conversation with Stanley Israelite. I never made an \nimportant decision--very few decisions at all--without discussing them \nwith Stanley and getting his solid advice as to how we ought to \nproceed. Early in my very first term, I remember being out with Stanley \nfor dinner one night. In talking about the job and how the job ought to \nbe done, he listened to me patiently, as he oftentimes did, go on at \nsome length about the work and the projects we wanted to be involved \nin, the major issues affecting Electric Boat and all these important \ninstitutions in my congressional district. After I went on for some \ntime, I turned to Stanley and asked him what he thought. I can almost \nhear him exactly. He said, ``I am going to tell you one thing about \nthis job.'' He paused and he just said, ``Never forget the people.''\n  With those words, Stanley Israelite embarked on a 25-year career with \nme, on a path and a journey that has been a joy every single day. I am \nconstantly reminded by Stanley and by his words and deeds that our job \nis to never forget the people. For 25 years, he has been a champion of \nthose who too often are ignored, the underdogs, the ill, the elderly, \nthe frail--those who didn't have anybody to speak for them. For \nStanley, every person does count. No matter is too small for his \nattention. For him, a constituent's problem became his problem. Words \nlike ``I can't help you,'' ``try another office,'' ``later,'' or \n``no,'' simply were not in Stanley's vocabulary.\n  In November of 1995, U.S. News and World Report published what they \ncall their ``Portraits of 12 Indispensable Americans.'' I am proud to \ntell you today that one of those 12 indispensable Americans was the man \nI speak about this evening, Stanley Israelite.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that profile of Stanley Israelite \ncontained in the publication of U.S. News and World Report be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              The Senator's Aide--Hounding the Bureaucrats\n\n                           (By James Popkin)\n\n       Lots of people's problems with their government aren't \n     ideological, they're logistical. That's why many rely on the \n     congressional aides like Stanley Israelite to help them fight \n     their battles with government agencies.\n       At 70, Stanley Israelite is fighting a crusade to prove the \n     cynics wrong. Since 1975, when the gravely voiced former \n     Brooklynite first went to work for then Rep. Christopher Dodd \n     (now a senator), Israelite has helped thousands of \n     Connecticut citizens replace lost passports, track down late \n     tax refunds, ship dearly departeds to grieving families \n     overseas and even bail the occasional misbehaving Connecticut \n     teenager out of Mexican jails.\n       All successful members of Congress have staffers like \n     Israelite who can goose reluctant bureaucrats into action. \n     Although Dodd happens to be a Democrat, effective constituent \n     service is a congressional specialty that cuts across \n     political lines. It's first and foremost a matter of good \n     politics: Good service results in happy voters. But what \n     distinguishes Israelite is his gusto for the job. And his \n     not-so-artful technique. ``When I call an agency because \n     somebody is waiting for her Social Security check or a guy is \n     waiting for an FHA loan and the agency gives me some song and \n     dance, I try to let them know I'm not gonna take any of their \n     crap,'' he\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\n     says. ``At times, I tell them I've discussed this problem \n     with the senator. Sometimes, it isn't true.''\n       A former jewelry store owner and Chamber of Commerce honcho \n     from Norwich, Conn., Israelite is Dodd's pipeline to many of \n     the state's small-business owners. Harry Jackson, a life-long \n     Republican who is the City Council president in Norwich, \n     recalls how difficult it was to get a meeting with officials \n     from the Environmental Protection Agency when the city wanted \n     to build a new firehouse on federal land. ``Stan got us in \n     there after just one phone call,'' says Jackson, who \n     ultimately built the firehouse.\n       ``Things happened.'' Don Daren says Israelite was a life-\n     saver in 1981, when a state-based paper distributor was \n     trying to secure a $900,000 umbrella loan from the \n     Connecticut Development Authority. Daren, who owns the Arrow \n     Paper Supply & Food Co., says it was going to take forever \n     for the CDA to process his loan papers so he could buy a new \n     warehouse. ``Stanley told them [CDA officials] my problem, \n     and things happened right away,'' says Daren, whose business \n     has grown from 36 workers then to nearly 200 today. ``He has \n     his own constituency. People like Stanley.''\n       Ideally, says veteran Hartford Courant political columnist \n     Don Noel, senators like Dodd would use their clout on Capitol \n     Hill to fix bureaucracies and make them more consumer \n     friendly--eliminating the need for taxpayer-financed \n     ombudsmen like Israelite. But since that goal seems \n     unattainable, Noel figures that Israelite plays a vital role. \n     ``If you have something you need the senator to do for you, \n     if anyone can do it, Stanley can,'' he says.\n       Israelite admits that he is motivated by a desire to help \n     re-elect Dodd. But he adds: ``Part of what drives me is \n     knowing that there's someplace where somebody can go when \n     they are not getting anyplace.''\n\n  One of the great honors of my life has been to have Stanley by my \nside during very important moments--almost every important moment in \nthe past 25 years. Many times when I received the applause as the \nelected official, the Congressman or the Senator, I knew the person who \ntruly deserved the applause was Stan Israelite.\n  No tribute to Stanley would be complete without mentioning his \nwonderful family: his beloved and recently departed wife Pauline, who \nwas as great and close a friend as Stanley; his son Michael and \ndaughter-in-law Donna; his son John; his daughter Abby and son-in-law \nBill Dolliver; his daughter Mindy and son-in-law Bill Wilkie; his \nsiblings; and, not least, six wonderful grandchildren. To them I extend \nmy heartfelt gratitude for sharing this remarkable man with me and so \nmany others for a quarter century.\n  There are few words to describe Stanley that would adequately \ndescribe what he has done. No words will describe what he meant to \ncountless individuals. For me, there is sadness that he has retired \nfrom my office in the Senate, but there is great comfort in knowing he \nwill continue to work on behalf of the people of our State and his \ncommunity, and will continue to be a close friend and incredibly \nimportant part of my life. So today, there is no need for goodbyes but \nonly these words: Thank you, Coach.\n  When he departed, he said, ``I am leaving the Senate, but not Chris \nDodd.'' I can say this to Stanley: You may have left my office, but you \nwill never be very far away when I need you for that sound counsel and \ngood advice you gave me for a quarter century. I thank this wonderful \nman for his service to me, to our State, and to the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11016-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to talk about three colleagues that \nare retiring. There are five, actually, but I will get to them later. I \ndon't want to do it all at once tonight. I will speak about three of \nthem: Senators Richard Bryan, Bob Kerrey, and Frank Lautenberg. Later I \nwill talk about Connie Mack and Senator Pat Moynihan, who have also \nmade decisions to retire from the Senate. They will be casting their \nlast votes as Members of the Senate in the next three days. I want to \ntake a few minutes in these remaining hours to pay tribute to these \nthree individuals who will be leaving the Congress at the end of this \nsession.\n  All three of these individuals have served with great distinction in \nthis body. All have made a mark on our Nation for which this country \nwill be grateful for generations to come. All will be missed by those \nof us who will remain in this body, not to mention by the people of \ntheir respective States and people across this country.\n  Let me first speak, if I may, about my good friend Dick Bryan of \nNevada. Few, if any, of our colleagues have come to this institution \nhaving already achieved as much distinction in public service as Dick \nBryan.\n  Long before he set foot on the floor of this U.S. Senate, he had \naccomplished a great deal for the people of his beloved State of \nNevada. He is the first person in the history of that State to have \nserved as Attorney General, Governor, and then U.S. Senator.\n  Senator Bryan did not come to the Senate to sit on passed laurels and \nachievements. He did what he has done in every position of public trust \nhe has ever held, even going back to his term as the president of his \neighth great class at Park Elementary School; he went to work on behalf \nof the people he was elected to represent.\n  He went to work for consumers. As the former chairman of the Consumer \nAffairs Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, Senator Bryan \nsuccessfully fought to have airbags installed in all automobiles sold \nin the United States. Some viewed this as a highly risky cause to \nchampion as a politician--promoting airbags. It is thought that a \nSenator should avoid at all costs having his or her name associated \nwith something like airbags.\n  But Senator Bryan was not deterred. And today, thanks to him, \nhundreds of lives are saved every year by a feature that is now \nstandard issue in American automobiles. Every day, when tens of \nmillions of Americans drive to work, school, or the store, they can \nthank Dick Bryan for making sure that their trip will be a safer one \nthan it otherwise would have been.\n  Senator Bryan also worked with a large coalition of children's \nadvocates to enact new protections for Internet privacy. He led the \nfight to strengthen the laws governing the credit reporting industry, \nwhich is so crucial to the ability of virtually every American to \nobtain a home, a car, and a loan for any other modern necessity. And he \ntook the lead in crafting legislation to reduce telemarketing fraud, \nwhich preys on so many elderly and other vulnerable citizens.\n  Aside from his record as a consumer advocate, Dick Bryan is perhaps \nbest known for his work on behalf of his state and its residents. We \nare all familiar with the tenacity with which he and his colleague \nSenator Reid have worked to prevent the Nevada Test Site at Yucca \nMountain from being designated as an interim storage facility for the \nnation's nuclear waste. I have myself known the unique pleasure of \nbeing visited by Senator Bryan and Senator Reid about this matter.\n  I have also admired Senator Bryan's efforts to protect Nevada's \nlands, particularly in the southern part of the state. Because of his \nefforts, all proceeds from the sale of lands in that part of the state \nmust be spent within the state. That's a plan that no other state \nenjoys, and it is a tribute to Dick Bryan's legislative skills.\n  I would be remiss if I failed to mention the important work that \nSenator Bryan has performed as a member of the Senate Ethics Committee \nand the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  These are important and sensitive committees on which to serve. It is \na reflection of the high esteem in which he is held by his colleagues \nthat he served on these committees--and did so, I might add, with \ndiscretion and with distinction.\n  In sum, Mr. President, Richard Bryan has spent his two terms in the \nSenate working hard and working effectively--for consumers, for his \nconstituents, for a stronger intelligence-gathering function by the \nUnited States, and for a stronger United States Senate. He has been an \noutstanding leader and a good friend. We wish him, his wife Bonnie, \ntheir children and grandchildren well as they begin the next phase of \ntheir life together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11016-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11016-S11017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KERREY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in a few short days, Senator Kerrey will \nalso be among our five colleagues bringing to an end their tenure in \nhere in the Senate. I think all of us understand his decision and \nrespect it, but I think we regret it.\n  Like Senator Bryan, Senator Kerrey is a former governor of his state. \nLike him, he has served in the Senate for two terms. And like Senator\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\nBryan, Senator Kerrey has left a lasting mark on this institution, on \nhis state, and on our country.\n  The outlines of this remarkable man's resume are known to many of us. \nBob Kerrey served with distinction in the Navy, and today is the only \nMember of Congress to have earned a Medal of Honor for his heroism in \ncombat duty during the Vietnam war. He became a successful businessman \nin Omaha.\n  He was elected Governor of Nebraska in 1982. It was a time when few \nDemocrats were running for--much less winning--state-wide offices, \nparticularly in his part of the country. And it was a time when our \nentire country was mired in a recession, particularly in Nebraska and \nother farm states, which were suffering through the worst economic \nconditions since the Great Depression.\n  As Governor, Bob Kerrey met the challenge of eliminating a serious \nbudget deficit. In fact, he balanced his state's budget every year, \nhelping to turn that deficit into a surplus. He also initiated \ninnovative reforms in welfare, education, job training, and \nenvironmental protection.\n  In the opinion of his constituents and many others, Bob Kerrey was \nproving himself to be an outstanding public servant. He established \nhimself as someone willing to make tough decisions.\n  He showed that he has an ability to see ``around the corner'' and \nthink ``outside the box'' by initiating thoughtful, creative, and \neffective policies for the benefit of the people of his beloved state \nof Nebraska.\n  But it can be said that public service has always needed Bob Kerrey \nmore than Bob Kerrey has needed public service. He has never been one \nto assume that his gifts of leadership and his curiosity about life's \nmeaning and purpose can only be satisfied by holding elected office. \nDespite his impressive record as Governor, and despite his strong \npublic approval ratings, he declined to run for re-election and took \nleave of public life. He headed to southern California, where he taught \na course on the Vietnam war to college students--readily admitting that \none of the chief reasons for accepting that position was to wait out \nthe worst months of the Nebraska winter on a warm beach.\n  Two years later, the people of Nebraska sent him to the United States \nSenate--to the good fortune not only of his constituents, but of his \nnew colleagues and the American people. As a member of the Finance \nCommittee, Agriculture Committee, Appropriations Committee, and Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, he worked diligently to strengthen family \nfarmers, small businesses, and our nation's vital intelligence-\ngathering agencies.\n  He also dedicated himself to perhaps the most important and \nintractable domestic policy question facing our nation: entitlement \nreform. He chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax \nReform--which has produced what many regard as the definitive analysis \nof the entitlement system. He served on the National Commission on the \nFuture of Medicare, proposing thoughtful ideas for health care reform. \nHe also co-chaired the National Commission on Restructuring the \nInternal Revenue Service, where he developed some of the most sweeping \nreforms of IRS operations ever instituted.\n  Not all of Senator Kerrey's ideas on entitlement reform have been \nadopted or even embraced. But each and every one of them has merited \nthe careful consideration of our colleagues and of the country as a \nwhole.\n  That in itself is the great tribute to the work of this fine Senator.\n  Like a sentry on the watch, his words of caution and warning will \nreverberate through the Halls of Congress long after his departure. He \nhas persistently shone a light on the looming and inescapable \ndemographic fact that retirees are growing in numbers that will soon \noverwhelm our present ability to sustain them under the umbrella of \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  He has done so not with the shrill self-righteousness that some bring \nto a cause about which they feel great passion. He has done so with \nconviction, humor, and humility. For his words of warning, and for the \nway in which he has uttered them, this body and our nation owe him a \ndebt of gratitude.\n  Now he prepares to move on to academia, where he will become \npresident of New School University in New York City. I come from a \nfamily of educators, and when Bob told me of his decision, my first \nreaction was: are you sure that you want to do this? If you think \nsitting through a markup or a hearing can be tedious, just wait until \nthat first faculty meeting. And wait until you get a visit from an \norange-haired undergraduate seeking special credit for his graffiti \nart. That will put your patience and problem-solving skills to the \ntest.\n  But Bob will not be deterred. And I suspect that, as he has done \nthroughout his career, he will shape his office and place more than it \nwill shape him. He will bring his rare gifts of leadership to the \nhigher education students and faculty with whom he will come in touch. \nI know I am joined by all of my colleagues in wishing him well, and I \nlook forward to many more years of his friendship and his leadership. I \ndon't believe America is through with Bob Kerrey yet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11017-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11017-S11018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to another of our \nretiring colleagues, Senator Lautenberg.\n  Frank Lautenberg is a remarkable man in a great many respects. He has \nlived the American dream, and devoted his life in public service to \nmaking the American dream alive and available to each and every \nAmerican--regardless of race, creed, or station in life. He has made a \nlasting and indelible mark on the laws of our nation--and in the \nprocess made our nation a better place for all.\n  The son of immigrants, Frank was born in Paterson, New Jersey. His \nfamily moved some twelve times during his boyhood in search of work. \nHis father spent most of his time laboring in the silk mills of \nPaterson.\n  Frank served in World War Two in the European theater. He attended \nColumbia University on the G.I. bill. After graduating from Columbia, \nhe and two boyhood friends began a business. As chairman and CEO, it \ngrew to become one of the largest computer services companies in the \nworld.\n  Frank became a very successful man financially. The time came when he \ndecided to give something back to the country that had given him and \nhis family so very much. For the past 18 years in the Senate, that is \nexactly what Frank Lautenberg has done.\n  Frank is one of those rare people who rises to a high place in life \nand never forgets where he came from. He did not pull up the ladder of \nopportunity once he had climbed it. He fought to keep it in place and \nmake it stronger for those who came after him. He has always, I think, \nseen a bit of himself in the faces of the children and working people \nwhom he has served.\n  It so happens that one of America's finest poets, William Carlos \nWilliams also called Paterson, NJ his home. Williams was a doctor. He \nmade house calls, carrying his black medical bag up and down the stairs \nof Paterson's tenements. He wrote poems at night, or scratched them out \nduring brief intervals of his busy days tending to the sick and scared. \nHe wrote once that there are ``No ideas but in things''. Frank \nLautenberg must intuitively graps the meaning of Williams poetry. For \nhim, the noble ideas that have motivated his public service have taken \nshape in the things he had done--in the resources he has brought home \nto the people of his state, and in the laws he has written on behalf of \nall Americans.\n  In his eighteen years as a United States Senator, Frank Lautenberg \nhas amassed a remarkable record of public achievement. There are few \nareas of environmental, transportation, budget, and anti-crime policy \nthat have not benefited from his careful mind and strong hand.\n  On the environment, Frank helped write landmark legislation to \ncleanse our air, provide safer drinking water, and clean up more toxic \nwaste sites. He authored measure to make America's beaches cleaner, and \nto ban the ocean dumping of sewage.\n  He has shaped our nation's transportation policy. Frank understands \nas few others do that our nation can only grow and prosper to the \ndegree that it is able to move people, goods, and services safely and \nefficiently. Along with\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\nSenator Moynihan and others, his leadership has been instrumental in \nensuring some modicum of balance in our funding for mass transit as \nopposed to roads and highways. He has been a leader in the ongoing \neffort to support Amtrak and the important cause of commuter and \nintercity passenger rail service, which can do so much to reduce \ntraffic congestion and keep our air clean.\n  And no one has done more to promote transportation safety, on the \nroad as well as in the air. Frank Lautenberg authored the law to \nestablish 21 as the legal drinking age, and to ban smoking on \nairplanes. And he is responsible more than anyone else for the landmark \nprovision in this year's transportation appropriations bill lowering \nthe legal standard for intoxication to .08 percent blood alcohol \ncontent. The drinking age law alone as saved an estimated 12,000 lives \nsince its enactment in 1984. It's estimated that his ``.08'' measure \nwill save an additional 600 lives each year in this country.\n  Frank Lautenberg also understood that we must do more to protect law-\nabiding citizens from the scourge of gun violence. He authored the bill \nto close the gun-show loophole. He has fought for child-proof handguns. \nAnd his support for measures like the Brady bill was instrumental in \nbringing about a nationwide reduction in gun violence over the past 7 \nyears.\n  Lastly, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, Frank has played a \nvaluable role in bringing about an end to budget deficits and putting \nour nation on the path to paying off our national debt. He has also \nworked to strengthen the solvency of Medicare and Social Security.\n  I said a while ago that Frank Lautenberg proved to be a very \nsuccessful businessman. He accumulated great financial wealth. No one \nwould have faulted him if he just retired, having made that achievement \nand contribution for the private sector.\n  I think all of us, regardless of party and political persuasion, \nadmire people who want to give something back and who are willing to \njump into this arena of public life, running the risks that we all do \nwhen we place our name on ballots all cross this country. The fact that \nFrank Lautenberg decided at the end of his private life to become a \npublic citizen and make a significant contribution to his country \nstands as a wonderful model for others who have done well to follow and \nwhen they want to give something back.\n  Not everyone runs for public office, nor should they, but there are \nways in which people can make contributions every day to improve the \nquality of life for people. Frank Lautenberg is a living embodiment of \nthat concept and that principle.\n  The colleagues I have talked about, the wonderful colleagues who have \nserved so admirably and so well, Dick Bryan, Bob Kerrey, Frank \nLautenberg, and my friend, Stan Israelite, are examples of public \nservants who I will miss terribly every day. These are good Americans \nwho have made a difference in the lives of all of us as citizens in \nthis country.\n  I will find time to talk about my good friends, Connie Mack and Pat \nMoynihan, but I see my colleagues on the floor. I thank them for their \nindulgence. I talked a little longer than I anticipated. I thank the \nSenators for their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, many on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee have been quite distressed over some of the uncertainties, \nsome of the things that happened in conjunction with the tragedy of the \nU.S.S. Cole. Even though it is a delicate thing to talk about, there \nare people still around who believe that the President took some \nactions, such as sending the cruise missiles into Afghanistan and the \ncruise missiles into Sudan, without consultation with the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, without consultation with the Intelligence Committee, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, \nsomething that was done and nobody knew it was going to happen. There \nare a lot of people who believe that might have been politically \nmotivated.\n  I think it is very appropriate tonight to urge the President that if \nsomething should happen that we would have to take some kind of action \nin the next few days, in that there are only 13 days until a national \nelection, make sure there are no suspicions out there. I want to get on \nrecord urging the President to work closely on any proposed action that \ncould take place as a result of the U.S.S. Cole tragedy, to work \nclosely on the matter, in full consultation with all members of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, with the top service commanders in chief, as \nwell as the members of both the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \nHouse Armed Services Committee, and the Intelligence Committees.

As the 106th \nCongress winds down this week, I look back with mixed feelings at the \nactions that have been taken over the last 2 years toward bringing our \nfinancial house in order. While for the first time we are not spending \nthe Social Security surplus or the Medicare Part A surplus, I believe \nwe could have done a much better job in reining in Federal spending.\n  Indeed, one fact that does not seem to draw too much attention is the \nfact that Washington increased overall nondefense domestic \ndiscretionary spending in fiscal year 2000 to $328 billion. That is a \n9.3-percent boost over the previous fiscal year, and the largest \nsingle-year increase in nondefense discretionary spending since 1980. \nAnd I fear we will have another big increase in fiscal year 2001.\n  However, there is actually some good news to celebrate since the \nbeginning of this Congress. As my colleagues may recall, President \nClinton said in his State of the Union Address in 1999 that he wanted \nto save 62 percent of the surplus and spend the other 38 percent. Well, \nat the time, the entire surplus was the Social Security surplus.\n  It was Members on this side of the aisle in both the House and the \nSenate who exposed the President's plan as just another spending \ngimmick. We were also the ones who got busy advocating and fighting for \na lockbox for Social Security and Medicare. For all intents and \npurposes, we were successful in fiscal year 2000 in doing so, and we \nwill do the same in fiscal year 2001.\n  Now the Vice President is out there on the campaign trail bending the \ntruth and taking credit for lockboxing Social Security and Medicare. \nEveryone should be aware that it was the Clinton-Gore administration \nthat sent a veto threat to the Senate regarding the Social Security \nlockbox amendment that the Senate considered in April of 1999.\n  Let me recite the direct quote from the veto threat:\n\n       If the Abraham-Domenici amendment or similar legislation is \n     passed by the Congress, the President's senior advisors will \n     recommend to the President that he will veto this bill.\n\n  I suspect that senior advisors would include the Vice President.\n  Although Congress has agreed by consensus not to use the Social \nSecurity and Medicare surplus for more spending, Congress still has not \nbeen able to pass lockbox legislation. I am fearful, if things get \ntight in the future and we have a blip in the economy, Congress will \nrevert to its old ways. So I am hoping next year that on a bipartisan \nbasis we can pass lockbox legislation for the Social Security and \nMedicare surplus.\n  Probably the best news from fiscal year 2000 is that despite all the \nsupplemental spending we did this past summer, we still achieved an $87 \nbillion on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2000. That is a lot more than \nthe $1 billion on-budget surplus we had at the end of fiscal year 1999. \nWithout question, though, the American people are responsible for this \nsurplus, and their success continues to generate better than expected \nrevenues. However, Congress would have spent considerably\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\nmore money, had it not been for a handful of us in the House and Senate \nwho were willing to take the heat for condemning massive spending \nincreases and budget gimmickry. Because this $87 billion on-budget \nsurplus had not been spent, and not used for tax cuts, it is going to \ngo to reduce the national debt.\n  In my view and in the view of many experts, using our on-budget \nsurplus to pay down the national debt is the best way to ensure fiscal \ndiscipline and continue our economic prosperity. We need to continue \nthat economic prosperity if we are going to deal with the problems of \nSocial Security and Medicare in the future. We cannot be lulled by the \nbooming economy and the fact that we have been able to utilize the $87 \nbillion fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus for debt reduction.\n  In addition, the way things are going right now in Washington, we may \nnot even see a fiscal year 2001 on-budget surplus. That is because the \nprojected $102 billion surplus is evaporating very quickly. With all \nthe years of experience that I have had in public service, I have to \nsay that I have never seen anything more fiscally irresponsible than \nthe spending spree I have seen occur in Washington this year--but, in \nparticular, these past weeks. The lack of willingness on the part of \nCongress to make the hard choices and restrain the urge to bring home \nthe bacon is blowing a hole in the fiscal year 2001 surplus and a \ngigantic hole in the projected 10-year budget surplus.\n  I think back to 1997 when Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act, \nhelping to put an end to the era of annual deficits. The Balanced \nBudget Act set spending targets for each fiscal year and was meant to \nteach Congress to prioritize its spending choices. Under the Balanced \nBudget Act, if Congress wanted to spend money, it had to find an offset \nto cover the additional spending. Fair enough, and it worked. It helped \nto balance the budget.\n  Today, with the surplus we have achieved and the surplus that \neveryone thinks we are going to have in the future, the discipline is \ngone. It is just an out-of-control feeding frenzy. Add the fact that \nthe normal legislative process has gone out the window, and we are in a \nfree fall. Right now, only a handful of individuals--the President and \nmy colleagues who are on the Appropriations Committee--are making the \ndecisions that will impact how much the Federal Government spends for \nthe coming fiscal year. Once the decisions are made, they are packaged \ntogether, sent to the floor of the Senate and the House, and voted on: \nNo debate, no amendments. In some circumstances, Members have not even \nseen the bills they are voting on.\n  Basically, it is a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. Since these bills \ncontain the bacon, most Members go along and simply vote for them. For \nthose Members who do, they will run home, bragging about how they got \nthis or that for their districts or for their State, failing to \nunderstand that their constituents know there is no such thing as a \nfree lunch. Make no mistake, the American people will fast appreciate \nthe spending spectacle that is going on here in Congress. If you think \nthey were mad in 1998 when Congress went on a similar spree--and I \nremember that because I was campaigning for the Senate in 1998 and I \ncaught all kinds of flak from people because of what Congress had \ndone--wait until they get wind of what is happening right now. And they \nwill. We will definitely feel their wrath. But more important, we will \nexperience their disappointment in letting them down.\n\n  This Senator is not going along with the ``pork-a-thon.'' I have \nvoted against most of the appropriations bills that have come before \nthe Senate, not because I am opposed to the Federal Government spending \nmoney on what is necessary, but because Congress has been unwilling to \nprioritize spending and unwilling to make the hard choices within the \nframework of the 2001 budget resolution.\n  In case my colleagues are not aware, let me explain briefly how big \nthe increases are in the various appropriations bills.\n  The fiscal year 2001 Interior appropriations bill spends $18.8 \nbillion, a 26-percent increase over fiscal year 2000; the \nTransportation appropriations bill, spends $16.8 billion in \ndiscretionary spending, a 23-percent increase over fiscal year 2000; \nthe VA-HUD appropriations bill spends $82.5 billion, a 14-percent \nincrease; the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill spends $15.6 billion, \na 13-percent increase; the Energy and Water appropriations bill spends \n$24 billion, a 12-percent increase; the Agriculture appropriations bill \nspends $15 billion in discretionary spending, an 8-percent increase, \nand that is not including agriculture emergency spending.\n  For fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2001, nearly $23.25 billion in \nagriculture emergency spending has been provided by the Government--\n$23.25 billion in emergency spending. That is more than double the \napproximately $10.75 billion in emergency spending for the entire 10 \nyear period before. In other words, in 3 years, we have doubled the \nemergency spending for agriculture over what we spent in the 10 \nprevious fiscal years.\n  In April, the Senate spent over 50 hours debating and amending a \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 2001. An agreement was reached on an \noverall spending amount of $600.3 billion in budget authority. I worked \nwith Senators like Phil Gramm to add new points of order to bring more \ndiscipline to the process. But in light of recent events, I wonder what \nwas the 50 hours of effort over? I find myself asking, Why should we \nhave a budget resolution if we are just going to ignore it? Why even \nhave a budget process if we are just going to operate as if the rules \ndid not exist? Congress and the White House are spending money like \ndrunken sailors, and we need to get on the wagon before it is too late \nand we spend it all.\n  CBO's projections over the next 10 years estimate that Federal \nspending will grow with the rate of inflation, but this does not \nreflect reality. In fiscal year 2000 alone, we increased discretionary \nspending by 8.3 percent, a rate much higher than the actual inflation \nrate. When you compare that with the spending increases of 14 percent, \n23 percent, and 26 percent in just fiscal year 2001 alone, then you can \nsee the kind of trouble we are getting ourselves into.\n  Add up all the numbers, include the appropriations bills that have \npassed and those that are anticipated to pass; include as much as $265 \nbillion worth of tax reductions for the next 10 years; and, of course, \nwe cannot forget there are going to be additional interest costs that \nwill be generated by Congress simultaneously increasing spending and \nlowering taxes. Just add it all up. When you do, you will find that \nCongress and the Clinton-Gore administration will have reduced the 10-\nyear projected budget surplus by more than $600 billion. In a worst \ncase scenario, the Concord Coalition estimates that Congress' \naccelerated pace of spending could wipe out up to $1.46 trillion of the \nnon-Social Security surplus projected for the next 10 years--over a \ntrillion dollars is what they project. What a terrible thing we are \ndoing to the next administration and to the citizens of this Nation.\n  After the 106th Congress' drunken spending spree is over, the \nAmerican people and the future President will be waking up to a \ntremendous hangover.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11019-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF 1967 AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, we have an interesting number of issues \nbefore this body. We have talked on various occasions, not the least of \nwhich has been today, about what we have not done: A real Patients' \nBill of Rights; a prescription drug coverage through Medicare; a \nminimum wage increase; tax-deductibility for college-level education, \nincluding lifelong learning; education funds to modernize our schools, \nto have afterschool programs, to have more teachers; commonsense gun \nsafety legislation; long-term tax credits for families caring for \nelderly parents; and affordable housing. These issues--any one of \nthem--could have been completed with the intercession of the Governor \nof Texas who is running for President.\n  The campaign, that will be completed in 12 or 13 days, is a campaign \nof ideas. What I would like to do tonight is spread across the Record \nof this Senate some of the ideas of George W. Bush, the Governor of the \nState of Texas. I say this because I think we should understand there \nare a number of policies that are being advocated by the Vice President \nand by the Governor of Texas.\n  So what I want to do today is quote verbatim, statements that have \nbeen made by George W. Bush. I will not be able to complete all of his \nstatements tonight, but I am going to spend some time reading direct \nquotes of George W. Bush. Maybe I will return tomorrow or the day after \nto complete the statements of the Governor of the State of Texas.\n  The first quote comes from October 23, 2000. That was last Monday. \nHere is the direct quote:\n\n       I don't want nations feeling like that they can bully \n     ourselves and our allies. I want to have a ballistic defense \n     system so that we can make the world more peaceful, and at \n     the same time I want to reduce our own nuclear capacities to \n     the level commiserate with keeping the peace.\n\n  October 18, 2000, another direct quote:\n\n       Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take \n     dream.\n\n  He also said, on that same occasion, in LaCrosse, WI:\n\n       If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency-room \n     care, we're going to have gag orders.\n\n  He also said, and I quote:\n\n       Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used \n     to know it.\n\n  Another direct quote:\n\n       It's one thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.\n\n  Direct quote:\n\n       I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can \n     have a gun.\n\n  This is the Governor of the State of Texas, the man running for \nPresident of the United States, who has said these things.\n  The next direct quote:\n\n       Mr. Vice President, in all due respect, it is--I'm not sure \n     80 percent of the people get the death tax. I know this: 100 \n     percent will get it if I'm the president.\n  Next direct quote:\n\n       Quotas are bad for America. It's not the way America is all \n     about.\n\n  Direct quote.\n  October 18, in St. Louis, the same day that he said, ``Families is \nwhere our nation finds hopes, where wings take dream,'' he said:\n\n       If affirmative action means what I just described, what I'm \n     for, then I'm for it.\n\n  In Greensboro, NC, on October 10 of this year, he said:\n\n       Our priorities is our faith.\n\n  October 11 of the year 2000:\n\n       I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial \n     profiling, which is illiterate children.\n\n  The direct quote from Gov. George W. Bush: ``I mean, there needs to \nbe a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate \nchildren.''\n  Greensboro, NC, the day before--that is, October 10--when he was \ncommenting on the Vice President's tax plan:\n\n       It's going to require numerous IRA agents.\n\n  The Governor of the State of Texas said, on October 4, in \nReynoldsburg, OH:\n\n       I think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot \n     easier to answer questions. I can't answer your question.\n\n  This was in response to a question about whether he wished he could \ntake back any of his answers in the first debate. The direct quote is: \n``I think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot easier to \nanswer questions. I can't answer your question.''\n  I do not think that takes any discussion to figure out what he just \nsaid, because I do not think he knows what he just said.\n  In Boston, on October 3 of the year 2000, he said:\n\n       I would have my secretary of treasury be in touch with the \n     financial centers, not only here but at home.\n\n  Saginaw, MI, September 29, 2000:\n\n       I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.\n\n  Quote: ``I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.''\n  Redwood, CA, September 27, 2000:\n\n       I will have a foreign-handed foreign policy.\n\n  Again, these are direct quotes from the Governor of the State of \nTexas, the man who has been nominated to be President of the United \nStates.\n  Los Angeles, September 27:\n\n       One of the common denominators I have found is that \n     expectations rise above that which is expected.\n\n  Beaverton, OR, September 25, this year:\n\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\n\n       It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil. \n     More and more of our imports come from overseas.\n\n  Direct quote, MSNBC, September 20, 2000:\n\n       Well, that's going to be up to the pundits and the people \n     to make up their mind. I'll tell you what is a president for \n     him, for example, talking about my record in the state of \n     Texas. I mean, he's willing to say anything in order to \n     convince people that I haven't had a good record in Texas.\n\n  September 9, on the Oprah show:\n\n       I am a person who recognizes the fallacy of humans.\n\n  Interview with Paula Zahn, September 18, 2000:\n\n       A tax cut is really one of the anecdotes to coming out of \n     an economic illness.\n\n  I have read these over several times. I still am stunned by what has \nbeen said by the man running for President of the United States.\n  Orange, CA, September 15, 2000:\n\n       The woman who knew that I had dyslexia--I never interviewed \n     her.\n\n  Westminster, CA, September 13:\n\n       The best way to relieve families from time is to let them \n     keep some of their own money.\n\n  The same interview:\n\n       They have miscalculated me as a leader.\n\n  Orlando, FL, September 12, 2000:\n\n       I don't think we need to be subliminable about the \n     differences between our views on prescription drugs.\n\n  This is a campaign of ideas, Mr. President, a discussion of policies, \na discussion of having a vision of what this country needs, someone who \ncan discuss them in a logical manner.\n  Pittsburgh, PA, September 8:\n\n       This is what I'm good at. I like meeting people, my fellow \n     citizens, I like interfacing with them.\n\n  Westland, MI, September 8:\n\n       That's Washington. That's the place where you find people \n     getting ready to jump out of the foxholes before the first \n     shot is fired.\n\n  Detroit, September 7, 2000:\n\n       Listen, Al Gore is a very tough opponent. He is the \n     incumbent. He represents the incumbency. And a challenger is \n     somebody who generally comes from the pack and wins, if \n     you're going to win. And that's where I'm coming from.\n\n  Houston, TX, September 6:\n\n       We'll let our friends be the peacemakers and the great \n     country called America will be the pacemakers.\n\n  Scranton, PA, September 6:\n\n       We don't believe in planners and deciders making decisions \n     on behalf of Americans.\n\n  Allentown, PA, September 5:\n\n       I regret that a private comment I made to the vice \n     presidential candidate made it through the public airways.\n\n  New York Times, September 2:\n\n       The point is, this is a way to help inoculate me about what \n     has come and is coming.\n\n  CNN online chat:\n\n       As governor of Texas, I have set high standards for our \n     public schools, and I have met these standards.\n\n  Same interview:\n\n       Well, I think if you say you're going to do something and \n     don't do it, that is trustworthiness.\n\n  Des Moines, IA, August 21:\n\n       I don't know whether I'm going to win or not. I think I am. \n     I do know I am ready for the job. And, if not, that's just \n     the way it goes.\n\n  Same, Des Moines, IA:\n\n       This campaign not only hears the voices of entrepreneurs \n     and the farmers and the entrepreneurs, we hear the voices of \n     those struggling to get ahead.\n\n  Des Moines, IA, August 21:\n\n       We cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation \n     hostile or hold our allies hostile.\n       I have a different vision of leadership. A leadership is \n     something who brings people together.\n\n  That is from Bartlett, TN, August 18.\n  August 11, Associated Press:\n\n       I think he needs to stand up and say if he thought the \n     president were wrong on policy and issues, he ought to say \n     where.\n\n  Salinas, CA, August 10:\n\n       I want you to know that farmers are not going to be \n     secondary thoughts to a Bush administration. They will be in \n     the forethought of our thinking.\n\n  Today Show interview, August 1:\n\n       And if he continues that, I'm going to tell the nation what \n     I think about him as a human being and as a person.\n\n  Washington Post, July 15. This was a comment to New Jersey's \nSecretary of State, the Honorable DeForest Soaries, Jr.:\n\n       You might want to comment on that, Honorable.\n\n  Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 23, 2000:\n\n       This case has had full analyzation and has been looked at a \n     lot.

It would have been very \neasy to editorialize on every one of them. I chose not to do that. I \nchose, though, to spread across the record of this Senate statements \nmade by Governor George W. Bush which should lead some to believe that \nif this man is going to be heavily involved in policy not only of this \nNation, but this world, that they should be aware of some of the \nstatements he has made. We want this to be a Government where people \nare clear on the issues, understand the issues. We have difficult, very \ncomplex problems not only domestically, but internationally.

I ask the Senator to yield to me for a second.\n  Mr. REID. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was given as much time as he may \nconsume.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield the Senator some time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for mentioning some of those quotes. \nI didn't hear them all because I was on my way to the floor from my \noffice.\n  Mr. REID. I was only able to get to a few of them. I only spent about \n40 minutes talking on the direct quotes from the Governor of Texas. \nThere will be more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada can only yield for a \nquestion at this point in time.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding he was asking me a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I appreciate the Senator's comments and reading \nthose quotes. I wonder, did the Senator listen to the third and final \ndebate?\n  Mr. REID. I didn't miss a single word of that debate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to ask the Senator, did he hear the quote by about \nGovernor Bush--there was a question asked about agriculture. Vice \nPresident Gore answered the question and it came to Governor Bush. He \nstarted talking about using food as a weapon. He made this quote--he \nsaid:\n\n       We have got to stop using food. It hurts the farmers.\n\n  Does the Senator remember that quote?\n  Mr. REID. I listened with amazement. In responding to my friend from \nIowa, following the second debate, the Vice President, during that \ndebate, said that there was a young lady in Florida that wasn't able to \nget a desk. The Republican spin doctors came back the next day and said \nthat wasn't true, she was only out of a desk for a day. In fact, she \nmissed 7 days because of not having room in that classroom, for \nwhatever reason. I was so amazed that the press picked up on what the \nVice President said, which to me indicated that was just one of the \nminor problems that we have in education.\n  I heard a day or two after the debate from Governor Bush. He said \nthis. I heard it. He said: Well, I did fine in the debate because the \nexpectations were so low of me that all I had to do was show up and say \nmy name is George W. Bush and win the debate.\n  I say to my friend from Iowa, that is about how the American press \nhas treated it. All he had to do was show up and tell his name, because \nif they looked into some of his statements--for one, the statement that \nthe Senator from Iowa asked me about regarding food--it seems to me for \nour farmers who are suffering so much in our country today that is \nsomething the press might want to pick up on.\n  Does the Senator have another question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the right to do \nthat. Under the previous order, the Senate will recess until tomorrow \nmorning at 9:30.\n  Mr. REID. I did not hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNevada was allowed time to speak, and after he spoke, the Senate is to \nbe in recess until tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. I want to complete my statement. I will finish that in a \nhurry. This is a parliamentary inquiry to the Chair: We are going to \ncome in at 9:30 tomorrow morning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And we are to pick up the older Americans legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I asked for 15 minutes at the end of the \ntime. For some reason it got mixed up and I was not included on the \nlist. It is my intention to ask unanimous consent that I be recognized \nto speak for 15 minutes before the Senate goes out on recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11022-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11022-S11024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SHORTAGE OF AIRLINE PASSENGER SPACE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the most serious issues facing our \nnational air transport system is the shortage of space--both in the air \nand on the ground at key airports. We've seen this most clearly this \npast summer in the backups at Chicago O'Hare and in much of the \nairspace in the Northeast.\n  Americans have developed a tremendous appetite for air travel for \nboth leisure and business needs. In the last few years, with our \neconomy so strong, the result has been an increasing number of packed \nplanes all year round, especially during the peak summer travel season.\n  But for many Americans trying to enjoy some vacation time, this \nsummer was a season of discontent filled with bad weather, aging air \ntraffic control systems and airline-employee difficulties. Countless \nAmericans spent hours sitting on the tarmac at O'Hare waiting to take \noff, or sitting in the airport lounge, waiting for their planes to \narrive. Thousands of Americans found themselves delayed, stranded and \ndisappointed. A once-reliable system has become increasingly \nunreliable.\n  Some of these events are unavoidable. Clearly, there are times when \nbad weather requires us to delay or cancel flights. But when an airport \nis near capacity, even the tiniest alteration in landing and takeoff \ntiming can quickly turn into considerable delays.\n  We've been seeing the warning signs for years. The National Civil \nAviation Review Commission, chaired by the current Secretary of \nCommerce, Norm Mineta, warned us three years ago about our looming air \ntravel crisis.\n  In fact, the very first sentence of the Commission's report reads as \nfollows:\n\n       Without prompt action, the United States' aviation system \n     is headed toward gridlock shortly after the turn of the \n     century. If this gridlock is allowed to happen, it will \n     result in a deterioration of aviation safety, harm the \n     efficiency and growth of our domestic economy, and hurt our \n     position in the global marketplace.\n\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, the future is now. As we have turned the corner into \nthe 21st Century, the predicted air traffic control crisis is clearly \nupon us.\n  I believe FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has done a terrific job. \nHowever, there are a number of steps that the FAA and the airlines must \ntake--in both the short and long run--to modernize the air traffic \ncontrol system and reduce congestion, particularly as it affects the \nheavily traveled northeast air corridors between New York, Boston, and \nWashington, DC, and Chicago and other key Midwestern airports.\n  In the short term, the FAA needs to make better use of existing \ncapacity. This means better communication between the FAA and airlines \nwhen bad weather ties up key airports and decisions must be made about \nreducing or rerouting air traffic. Right now, airlines have no \ncoordinated plans on bad weather days, and they're left to guess \nwhether their competitors will cancel or slow their flights or not.\n  Now I recognize that airlines can't simply pick up the phone and talk \nto each other about capacity decisions. Such discussions would run \nafoul of our nation's antitrust laws. But Congress and FAA should \nconsider whether they should grant some form of very limited immunity \nso that airlines can discuss with the FAA the most efficient way to \ncope with bad weather.\n  Another short term solution involves alternative routings. I \nunderstand that the airlines, working cooperatively with FAA, have \nbegun flying many routes at lower altitudes. This practice is costly \nsince flying at lower altitude burns more fuel--but it should help \nincrease airspace capacity. FAA also needs to explore the possibility \nof accessing airspace previously reserved for military use. Much of \nthis military airspace can be made available to commercial operations \non a short-term basis during severe weather.\n  The FAA must also add additional air traffic controllers. And FAA \nmust make sure that these controllers have the most modern, up-to-date \ntools available to do their jobs.\n  The FAA needs to take full advantage of GPS technology to allow more \ndirect routings between airports. FAA also needs to develop technology \nto allow pilots and air traffic controllers to communicate more \neffectively with each other. One such technology is advanced data links \nwhich could reduce controllers' workload and improve their ability to \ncreate and communicate alternative routines in severe weather. It would \nbe far more accurate and efficient for many air traffic control \ncommands to be given to pilots in written form. The airlines and the \nFAA are currently undergoing tests along those lines, but I believe \nthey must move forward more quickly.\n  Finally, we in Congress must continue to increase FAA research and \noperating budgets. We need to expand programs that examine the problems \nof aging aircraft. And we need to invest more in technologies that will \ngive both pilots and air traffic controllers the very best equipment \nfor making safe decisions. We've got to fully fund NASA aviation \nprograms like the one designed to better detect wake-vortex trailing \nbehind aircraft. Such technology can allow the FAA to narrow the \ndecades old 7-mile separation standard and free up more airspace.\n  But these actions alone will not be sufficient. Our current system \ncan barely handle the roughly 600 million passengers that currently \ntravel each year. Yet, it is projected that the system will need to \nhandle an expected 1 billion annual passengers within the next decade. \nIndeed, our demand for air travel seems ready to overrun our over-\nburdened system. In some cases, we do need to add additional runway \ncapacity.\n  Let's look specifically at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. \nO'Hare is a place that I--and hundreds of thousands of fellow Iowans \nwho land or connect through there every year--know well. On a blue-sky \nday, it's one of the best, most efficient airports in America. However, \nwhen the rain clouds or thunderstorms roll in, O'Hare can become one \ngigantic travel obstruction.\n  When O'Hare backs up, the result is a monumental ripple effect on the \nentire air traffic control system from Los Angeles to Boston. Because \nof its central location and population base, Chicago O'Hare has \ndeveloped into the first or second largest hub airport in this country. \nIt is the only hub that has two major airlines which maintain competing \nhub operations. This is good for the citizens of Chicago and Illinois, \nand it is also good for the people of Iowa and surrounding states that \nuse O'Hare to connect to distant destinations.\n\n  We in Iowa can connect to our final destinations through such hubs as \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, Cincinnati, St. Louis or Denver. However, the \nlargest share of Iowans choose to go through O'Hare because it is the \nlargest and most convenient hub for our citizens. O'Hare also provides \nfar more international connections than those other airports. In fact, \nwell over 50 airlines operate there. In the past 12 months, more than \n360,000 of my fellow Iowans have flown through O'Hare.\n  So the problems at O'Hare are not just a Chicago issue, they are a \nMidwestern issue, and they are a national issue.\n  This situation calls for immediate action. I strongly believe that \nthe most important step we can take to begin to alleviate our national \nairline crisis is to provide additional facilities for planes to land \nand take off at Chicago's O'Hare airport. I believe O'Hare should \nlogically have additional parallel runways to provide expanded \ncapacity.\n  As we move into this new century, we need to ensure that the critical \npathways of our air transport system are not encumbered by local \ndisagreements, which constrain the needs of interstate commerce. In \naddition, if we want to foster increased competition between airlines \nand see continued service to O'Hare from the smaller commercial \nairports like Burlington and Waterloo in Iowa, and if we want to expand \nservices to cities like Sioux City, then we must provide additional \ntake off and landing space for new airlines.\n  Some have suggested building a new airport south of Chicago to \nrelieve the problems at O'Hare. I feel that this is a poor policy \nchoice. This proposed new airport has yet to attract any airline \ntenants who would pay for it. Furthermore, this proposed airport would \ndrain customers away from Chicago's Midway Airport, which is the 9th \nbusiest airport in America and provides point to point flights to over \n50 cities. In addition, in order to build this new airport, we would \nhave to take 24,000 acres of farmland out of production. Building \nanother airport in Chicago does not solve our current problems at \nO'Hare.\n  The solution is new runways at O'Hare. O'Hare certainly has the space \nfor them. We know that building new runways is far more cost-effective \nthan spending billions of dollars on a new airport. And new runways \nwould mean an immediate reduction in delays at O'Hare. These new \nrunways would allow simultaneous landings during all weather periods--\nsomething the current configuration does not allow.\n  Normally, in order for a runway to be built, approval must be granted \nby the operator of the airport--the City of Chicago in the case of \nO'Hare--and the FAA. However, under Illinois law, the Governor of \nIllinois, through his Department of Transportation, must also approve \nsuch a plan. Speaking as a friendly neighbor from Iowa, I am sending a \nletter to both Mayor Richard M. Daley and Governor George H. Ryan \nasking that they approve new runways in the interest of improving our \nentire national air transport system.\n  While I am not privy to all of the local concerns surrounding O'Hare, \nI know that all airports confront noise mitigation problems. I also \nknow that Chicago O'Hare has the best-funded and most extensive sound \nmitigation program of any airport in the country. I applaud the Mayor \nfor that far-sighted undertaking. As a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I offer my assistance to the Mayor and my distinguished \ncolleagues from Illinois to ensure that appropriate Federal dollars are \nchanneled into that effort.\n  I would say to Governor Ryan, who, I understand, favors a new \nairport, that I do not see much in the way of Federal assistance for \nnew airport construction in the foreseeable future. Airports today are \nbuilt and/or rehabilitated by airport tenants and their passengers. I \nbelieve that the most efficient way to minimize our tax dollars is to \nmaximize our current facilities and continue to upgrade our air traffic \ncontrol system.\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed overwhelmingly and the President \nsigned, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the \n21st Century, commonly known as Air21. As many of my colleagues know, I \nworked closely with Senators Grassley, McCain, Hollings, Rockefeller \nand Durbin to draft the provision in the Air21 legislation that phases \nout the artificial slot-constraints at O'Hare by July 1, 2002. The \nintent of our effort was to increase small and mid-sized communities' \naccess to the national air transportation system via O'Hare and to \nprovide for increased competition at that premier connecting hub. This \nincreased access is critical for business wishing to settle and grow in \nsmall and mid-sized communities.\n  While we succeeded in eliminating the barrier posed by slots, it is \nclear to me that O'Hare's runway, gate, and terminal space constraints \ncontinued to keep small and mid-sized communities from fully realizing \nthe benefits of the Air21 legislation. I was extremely pleased to hear \nabout the substantial progress in Chicago's World Gateway program. This \nprogram calls for $3.2 billion in infrastructure investments over the \nnext several years at O'Hare--including 20 new gates and 2 new \nterminals. My understanding is that the two major carriers at O'Hare--\nUnited Airlines and American Airlines--have reached agreement with the \nCity on this. I congratulate Mayor Daley on his work in bringing that \nagreement to closure. I also applaud American and United for their far-\nsighted investment in O'Hare. I only request that every effort be made \nto accelerate that program and to assure that space is allocated to \nsmaller aircraft that serve smaller cities so that small town America \ngets a fair shake.\n  Without new runways, we will still be constrained by weather and air \ntraffic control problems. It is time to remove this barrier to small \nand mid-sized community access to O'Hare. And it is time to expand our \ncurrent national air traffic system in an effective, cost-efficient, \ncost-efficient way. We have neither the time nor the money nor the \npolitical will to build a new airport. Instead, we need to maximize the \nresources we already have. In the end, we may have to find a federal \nsolution to this national problem.\n  New runways would make O'Hare and our entire national air transport \nsystem run more smoothly. I am certain that the hundreds of thousands \nof Iowans and others across the country who travel through O'Hare each \nyear would appreciate this improvement. As would all those whose travel \nplans to other hubs and destinations are upset because aircraft are \ntied up at O'Hare. There is no more efficient, effective solution to \naircraft delays in the Midwest and much of the Northeast than providing \nadditional runway capacity at O'Hare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11024-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few brief remarks about \none of our colleagues and a good friend of mine who is retiring this \nyear.\n  Senator Lautenberg is a perfect example of the American dream come \ntrue. He grew up the son of immigrants, joined the Army Signal Corps in \nEurope during World War II, and then attended Columbia University on \nthe G.I. bill. After graduation, Senator Lautenberg helped found a \npayroll services company called Automatic Data Processing. He soon \nbecame the firm's CEO, and, with 33,000 employees, his company is now \none of the largest computing services companies in the world.\n  But Senator Lautenberg knew that the American dream isn't just about \nmaking it to the top. It's about giving back once you get there. That's \nwhy he ran for the United States Senate, and that's why, during his \neighteen years in this Chamber, he's fought hard to make our country \nbetter for all Americans. He has fought hard to leave the ladder of \nopportunity down for others to climb. He's fought to improve \ntransportation. His legislation and leadership has built and modernized \nhighways and bridges and Amtrak rails across this country, and he's \nworked hard to make sure our planes and trains and cars are safe.\n  Frank Lautenberg has fought to clean up our environment. Over the \ncourse of his career, he's worked on legislation to improve the \nSuperfund program, redevelop Brownfields, force industry to cut down on \npollution, clean up our beaches and protect our air and water. And he's \nfought to balance our budget. Senator Lautenberg focuses his sharp, \nbusiness mind on the work of the Budget Committee, where he is ranking \nmember and he helped move us from record deficits to record surpluses.\n  And Senator Lautenberg has taken on special interests like few \nothers. He took on the gun lobby when he authored the domestic violence \ngun ban and other laws to fight gun violence. And he's one of the \nstrongest supporters of the Brady bill in this Congress. He took on the \nliquor lobby when he became the lead sponsor of the bill that raised \nthe drinking age to twenty-one. And he sponsored the recent provision \nin the transportation appropriations bill to lower the blood alcohol \ncontent standard to .08--a provision that's going to save hundreds of \nlives each year. And he's taken on big tobacco. When you fly on a \ncommercial flight now, and you can actually take a breath without \nchoking on smoke from other passengers, you can thank Senator Frank \nLautenberg, because he wrote the law that bans smoking on airplanes.\n  You know, after he got that bill passed, I was flying out to Iowa, \nand several flight attendants came up to me and said, ``Senator, can \nyou please thank Senator Lautenberg for us. We can finally work now \nwithout all that smoke.'' I hear that to this very day, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey always gets first class service \neven when he sits in coach. I still can't quite believe that Senator \nLautenberg is leaving us. But I hope that wherever he goes, he'll find \na new way to use his energy, intelligence, and talent to serve the \nAmerican people. Our country can't afford to lose someone of his \ncaliber.\n\n  My wife Ruth and I have been privileged to be friends of Frank since \nwe first came to the Senate in 1985. We have been privileged to travel \non many trips, on many congressional delegations with Senator \nLautenberg, as he confronted our enemies abroad and spoke with our \nfriends abroad, to strengthen our U.S. position both in our economic \nendeavors with other countries and in our military position overseas.\n  We will miss him from this body, but I of course will not miss him as \na friend. I sincerely hope that whatever Frank Lautenberg does in the \nfuture, he will make himself available for further public service. \nSomeone of his caliber and of his talent, of his compassion, and of his \ninterest in making sure we leave the ladder of opportunity down for all \nAmericans to climb, someone such as that we can't afford to lose from \npublic life.\n  So, Frank, we wish you Godspeed, the best in all your endeavors, the \nbest of health and happiness in your future life. But please, if duty \ncalls for public service, I know you will answer.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for affording me the opportunity to \nmake these comments this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/25/senate-section/article/S11024-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
