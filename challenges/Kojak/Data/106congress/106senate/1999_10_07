COMPTON\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the inspiring prayer which Senators just \nheard was delivered by the remarkable Dr. John C. Compton, whose church \nis the home church for Dot Helms and me when the Senate is in session.\n  The congregation at First Baptist Alexandria includes many good folks \nfrom North Carolina, with relatives in our State. Dr. Compton has been \nsenior pastor at First Baptist Alexandria since June 1997, and what an \nenormous impact he has had. His powerful sermons are always meaningful \nand helpful. Young adults are flocking to the various services and \nother events at his church. Dr. Compton's messages to all who hear him \nare straight from the Bible. He dares to address with candor the moral \nand spiritual breakdown so evident in America today. That is because \nhis message, without exception, emphasizes the hope available to all \nwho will follow and embrace the precepts and faith of our Founding \nFathers.\n  John and Teresa Compton have two daughters, Sarah and Rachel. Dr. \nCompton's father, deceased, and his mother served as missionaries in \nBrazil for a quarter of a century beginning in 1950.\n  Numerous staff members from Capitol Hill attend First Baptist \nAlexandria, including several from my own office. A warm welcome is \nextended to the Senate's guest Chaplain for today, Dr. John C. Compton. \nAnd for my part, Mr. President, I am genuinely grateful for what this \nremarkable minister has meant to Dot Helms and me and countless others.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12147-6", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I have been \nasked to announce that we will proceed now to the consideration of the \nbill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. The pending \namendment is one offered by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nMr. Abraham.\n  We are culling the list, and we have it now in reasonable shape so \nthat I do believe that if we are able to have a\n\n[[Page S12148]]\n\ncouple of very contentious amendments not acted upon and proceed \npromptly, we can complete action on this bill today.\n  The leader has asked me to announce that following completion of the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill, it is the intention of the leader to \nconsider the Agriculture appropriations conference report, and the \nSenate may also consider any other conference reports available for \naction.\n  When we move beyond Senator Abraham's amendment, the next amendment \nto be offered is by Senator Bingaman. It is hoped that we could get \nreasonably short time agreements.\n  I would ask if we may proceed now, as we had on so many matters \nyesterday, with a 30-minute time agreement equally divided on this \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object for just \na moment, could we look at it for a second, the second degree?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Here is a copy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. While the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from \nNevada are taking a look at it, Mr. President, this would be a good \ntime for me to say that we hope that anyone who wishes to offer \namendments will come to the floor promptly so that we can inventory the \namendments and try to establish time agreements. We are going to have \nto move very expeditiously without quorum calls if we do have any \nrealistic chance of finishing the bill today.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the time agreement is fine on our side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Thirty minutes equally divided, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thirty minutes equally divided on the second degree.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The same agreement we had yesterday with respect to 30 \nminutes on second degrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time on the second-\ndegree amendment will be 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, is \nrecognized to speak on amendment No. 1828.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, before I speak, may I clarify, I believe \nI am speaking on the second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree amendment has not been \noffered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2269 To Amendment No. 1828\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for any program for the \n    distribution of sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic \n                     injection of any illegal drug)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2269.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], for himself, Mr. \n     Coverdell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. Smith of New \n     Hampshire, proposes an amendment numbered 2269 to amendment \n     No. 1828.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds \n     appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any \n     program of distributing sterile needles or syringes for the \n     hypodermic injection of any illegal drug. This provision \n     shall become effective one day after the date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Coverdell in \noffering this amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill. Our amendment would prohibit the expenditure of \ntaxpayer dollars on programs that provide free hypodermic needles to \ndrug addicts.\n  In the past, President Clinton, through his Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Donna Shalala, has tried to lift the ongoing ban on \nfederal funds for needle exchange programs. His reasoning? Such \nprograms could reduce the rate of HIV infection among intravenous (IV) \ndrug users without increasing the use of drugs like heroin.\n  Unfortunately, the evidence we have to date suggests that each of \nthese suspicions is wrong. We now know beyond a reasonable doubt that \nneedle exchange programs actually increase both the rate of HIV \ninfection and the use of IV drugs.\n  What is more, they send the wrong message to our children. And they \nhurt our communities.\n  This administration has claimed a great deal of credit for the recent \ndrop in some categories of drug use.\n  I don't want to downplay the progress that has been made over the \nlast year.\n  But we must keep in mind that the improvements were small, and that \nthis administration has a lot of work to do before it can bring us back \nto the levels of drug use achieved in 1992, the year before President \nClinton took office.\n  The percentage of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders who had used an illicit \ndrug during the previous 30 days dropped between 1997 and 1998, by 0.8 \nfor 8th graders, 1.5 for 10th graders and 0.6 for 12th graders \npercentage points.\n  But levels of drug use remain substantially higher than in 1992--in \nsome instances almost twice as high.\n  In 1992, 6.8 percent of 8th graders, 11 percent of 10th graders, and \n14.4 percent of 12th graders reported having used an illicit drug \nwithin the past 30 days.\n  By 1998, even with recent dips, those figures ranged from 12.1 \npercent for 8th graders to 21.5 percent for 10th graders to 25.6 \npercent--more than one in four 12th graders.\n  Now is not the time, Mr. President, to let our guard down in the war \non drugs. As we continue to fight our difficult battle with drug abuse, \nthe last thing we need is for Washington to send the message that drug \nuse is okay.\n  Let me very quickly review some of the overwhelming evidence that has \nmade it crystal clear that needle exchange programs are inherently ill-\nconsidered and doomed to failure.\n  First, we now know that needle exchange programs encourage drug use: \nDeaths from drug overdoses have increased over five times since 1988.\n  In addition, we now have clinical studies, including one conducted in \nVancouver and published in the Journal of AIDS. That study showed that \ndeaths from drug overdoses have increased over five times in that city \nsince needle exchanges began in 1988. Vancouver now has the highest \ndeath rate from heroin in North America.\n  Such terrible statistics should not surprise us given the lack of \nbasic, commonsense logic in needle exchange programs.\n  Mr. President, giving an addict a clean needle is equivalent to \ngiving an alcoholic a clean glass.\n  And once we lose sight of this logic, we have already lost the war on \ndrugs. We have, in effect, handed our streets over to people who do not \nbelieve that we should win that war.\n  Let me cite just one example of the recklessness with which so many \nof these programs are run. The New York Times magazine in 1997 reported \nthat one New York City needle exchange program gave out 60 syringes to \na single person, little pans to ``cook'' the heroin, instructions on \nhow to inject the drug, and a card exempting the user from arrest for \npossession of drug paraphernalia.\n  But needle exchange programs do not have to be run recklessly in \norder to encourage drug use.\n  Dr. Janet Lapey with Drug Watch International recently quoted pro-\nneedle activist Donald Grove, who pointed out that ``most needle \nexchange programs . . . Serve as sites of informal organizing and \ncoming together. A user might be able to do the networking needed to \nfind drugs in the half an hour he spends at the street-based needle \nexchange site--networking that might otherwise have taken half a day.''\n  It's just common sense, Mr. President. If you give an addict more \nneedles, he will use them, drug use will increase, and so will the \ndying.\n  And that includes deaths from HIV/AIDS. We now know that needle \nexchange programs actually increase the spread of this dread disease.\n  For example, a Montreal study was published in the American Journal \nof Epidemiology. It found that intravenous drug users in a needle \nexchange program were more than twice as likely to become infected with \nHIV as addicts not using such a program.\n\n[[Page S12149]]\n\n  And the figures from the Vancouver study are astounding. When the \nVancouver needle exchange program started in 1988, 1 to 2 percent of \ndrug addicts in that city had HIV. Now 23 percent of drug addicts in \nVancouver have HIV.\n  To put it succinctly, Mr. President, we now know that needle exchange \nprograms are bad for drug users. They promote this deadly habit and \nthey promote the spread of HIV.\n  But we know more, Mr. President. We also know that needle exchange \nprograms send the wrong message to our kids:\n  Let me quote President Clinton's own drug czar, General Barry \nMcCaffrey, who said ``the problem is not dirty needles, the problem is \nheroin addiction. . . . The focus should be on bringing help to this \nsuffering population--not giving them more effective means to continue \ntheir addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this dreadful scourge \non mankind.''\n  Mr. President, needle exchange programs undermine our drug fighting \nefforts, and they undermine the very rule of law we all depend on for \nour safety and freedom.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to prohibit taxpayer \ndollars from being spent on needle exchange programs.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of anyone seeking \nrecognition, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be charged \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate bill language, as it currently \nreads, is as follows: Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, \nno funds appropriated under this act shall be used to carry out any \nprogram of distributing sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic \ninjection of any illegal drug unless the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices determines that such programs are effective in preventing the \nspread of HIV and do not encourage the illegal use of drugs.\n  The amendment, which is now pending, would strike the discretion of \nthe Secretary to make a determination that such a program would be \neffective in preventing the spread of HIV and would not encourage the \nuse of illegal drugs.\n  This issue on needle exchange is a highly emotional issue. There is \nno doubt the reuse of needles by drug addicts does result in the \ninfection of more people with HIV/AIDS. The Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services has never used this waiver language to make a \ndetermination that such programs are effective in preventing the spread \nof HIV and do not encourage the use of illegal drugs. There is dispute \non whether clean needles would, in fact, prevent the spread of HIV and \nwhether clean needles would--in fact, could--be used without the \nencouragement of the use of illegal drugs.\n  It is the view of the subcommittee and the full committee, which \npassed this in its present form, that question ought to be left open to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has never used this \nexception and is not likely to use it promiscuously but only if there \nwas a very sound scientific base for doing so. My own preference is to \ncontinue the discretion of the Secretary to be able to make this \nwaiver, if the facts and figures show that such a needle exchange would \nnot encourage the use of illegal drugs, that such a legal exchange \nwould prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  There is some concern within the community that is interested in \nhaving needle exchange that raising this issue again may lead to some \nbroader prohibition, which might even reach private groups. I think \nthat is highly unlikely. But those are concerns that we are trying to \nresolve in deciding what step to take with response to the Abraham \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, with the support of this side, I yield \nmyself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just support the remarks of my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. I understand all the \nemotion that surrounds this issue, but I think it would be a profound \nmistake on our part to now pass an amendment that would take away an \nimportant discretion from the Secretary of Health and Human Services as \nto whether or not the needle exchange program is badly needed and would \nbe effective in some of our local communities. I think to have an \nacross-the-board prohibition without taking a really close look at this \nquestion could have tragic consequences.\n  So I say to my colleagues I think if we no longer enable the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to have some discretion and to \nknow when Federal funds would make a huge difference, and to make sure \nthis is all being done in an above-board manner, then I think we are \npassing a prohibition which, in personal terms, will translate into \nmore of our citizens--many of them inner city, many poor, and too many \nof them children--becoming HIV infected and dying from AIDS. I rise to \nsupport the comments of my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after consulting with the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Harkin, and listening to the comments of the \nSenator from Minnesota, it is the judgment of the managers that \nprudence would warrant accepting the Abraham amendment on a voice vote, \nif that is acceptable to the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the offer. I think we would \nbe prepared to accept a voice vote. My colleague from Georgia is here \nand had planned to speak briefly on the amendment. So I defer to him if \nhe wishes to have up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Georgia speaks, I \nwant to propound a unanimous consent request. We have Senator Bingaman \npresent now. His amendment will be the next one offered. I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 40 minutes equally divided on the \nBingaman amendment, subject to the same terms and conditions on the \nother time agreements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will just be a moment and yield to \nthe Senator from Michigan so he might call for a voice vote on his \namendment.\n  I want to just quote the administration's own drug czar, General \nMcCaffrey. He said:\n\n       As public servants, citizens, and parents, we owe our \n     children an unambiguous no use message. And if they should \n     become ensnared in drugs, we must offer them a way out, not a \n     means to continue addictive behavior.\n       The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin \n     addiction . . . the focus should be on bringing help to this \n     suffering population--not giving them more effective means to \n     continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this \n     dreadful scourge on mankind.\n\n  James Curtis, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University \nMedical School and Director of Psychiatry at Harlem Hospital, said:\n\n       [Needle exchange programs] should be recognized as reckless \n     experimentation on human beings, the unproven hypothesis \n     being that it prevents AIDS.\n       Addicts are actively encouraged to continue to inject \n     themselves with illegal drugs, and are exempted from arrest \n     in areas surrounding the needle exchange program.\n\n  I can go on and on with expert people involved in the drug war. This \nis a good amendment. I am pleased that the other side has decided to \nadopt it. I\n\n[[Page S12150]]\n\ncompliment the Senator from Michigan for bringing it to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe we had a previous \nacknowledgment of moving to a voice vote.\n  Before we do, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his leadership on \nthis issue. Again, our goal is to send a clear message to the children \nof this country that the Federal Government will not be supporting, in \nany way, programs that would seem to lead to increases in the uses of \ndrugs, as well as HIV, as it appears in studies.\n  At this point, I am prepared to yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. REID. The minority yields back our time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As does the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the second-degree amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2269) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the first-degree amendment, \nas amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1828), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1861\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure accountability in programs for disadvantaged \n                               students)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1861.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 52, line 8, after ``section 1124A'', insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That $200 million of funds \n     available under section 1124 and 1124A shall be available to \n     carry out the purposes of section 1116(c) of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first let me yield myself 6 minutes off \nof my time at this point.\n  I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Jack Reed \nfrom Rhode Island and John Kerry from Massachusetts, and I believe they \nwill both be here, I hope, to speak on behalf of the amendment as well.\n  This amendment is intended to ensure greater accountability in our \neducational system and in the expenditure of title I funds. Let me make \nit very clear to my colleagues at the very beginning of this debate, \nthis amendment does not add money to the bill. Instead, it tries to \nensure that a small portion of the title I funds that we are going to \nappropriate in this bill are spent to achieve greater accountability \nand improvement in the schools that are failing, about which we are all \nso concerned.\n  I think we can all agree that greater accountability in our schools \nis an imperative. It is particularly important to have this \naccountability where high concentrations of disadvantaged students are \nin order to ensure that all students have some semblance of equal \neducational opportunity. Although most States have adopted statewide \nstandards, they have not directed adequate resources to schools that \nare failing to meet those new standards. Dedicated funds are necessary \nin order to develop improved strategies in those schools and create \nrewards and penalties that will hold schools accountable for continuous \nimprovement in their students.\n  The Federal Government directs over $8 billion, nearly $9 billion, in \nFederal funding to provide critical support for disadvantaged students \nunder title I. But the accountability provisions in title I have not \nbeen adequately implemented due to insufficient resources. Title I \nauthorizes State school support teams to provide support for schoolwide \nprograms and to provide assistance to schools in need of improvement \nthrough activities such as professional development or identifying \nresources for changing the instruction in the school or the \norganization of the school.\n  In 1998, however, only eight States reported that school support \nteams have been able to serve the majority of the schools identified as \nneeding improvement. Less than half of the schools identified as being \nin need of improvement in the 1997-1998 school year reported that this \ndesignation of being a school needing improvement led to additional \nprofessional development or assistance.\n  Schools and school districts need additional support and resources to \naddress weaknesses soon after those weaknesses are identified. They \nneed that support to promote a progressively intensive range of \ninterventions, continuously assess the results of those interventions \nand implement incentives and strategies for improvement.\n  The bill before the Senate does not identify specific funds for \naccountability enforcement efforts. I believe we need to ensure that a \nsignificant funding stream is provided to guarantee these \naccountability provisions are enforced.\n  This amendment seeks to ensure that 2.5 percent of the funds \nappropriated to LEAs under title I--that is $200 million in this year's \nbill--is directed toward this objective. This money is to be used to \nensure that States and local school districts have the necessary \nresources available to implement the corrective action provisions of \ntitle I by providing immediate and intensive interventions to turn \naround low-performing or failing schools.\n  The type of intervention that the State and the school district could \nprovide using these funds includes a variety of things. Let me mention \na few:\n  One would be purchasing necessary materials such as updated textbooks \nand curriculum technology.\n  The second would be to provide intensive, ongoing teacher training. \nInadequate training of teachers has been a problem in many of the \nfailing schools.\n  A third would be providing access to distance learning where they \ndon't have the teachers on site who can provide that instruction.\n  Fourth, extending the learning time for students through afterschool \nor Saturday programs or summer school programs so students can catch up \nto the grade level at which they should be performing.\n  Next, providing rewards to low-performing schools that show \nsignificant improvements, including cash awards or other incentives \nsuch as release time for teachers.\n  Sixth, intensive technical assistance from teams of experts outside \nthe schools to help develop and implement school improvement plans in \nfailing schools. The teams would determine the causes of low \nperformance--for example, low expectations, an outdated curriculum, \npoorly trained teachers or unsafe conditions--and provide assistance in \nimplementing research-based models for improvement.\n  One example of the type of research-based school improvement model \nthat needs to be introduced in failing schools and can be introduced in \nfailing schools with the resources we are earmarking in this amendment \nis the Success for All Program. This program is a proven early grade \nreading program in place now in over 1,500 schools around the country, \nsome in my own State of New Mexico. At the end of the first grade, \nSuccess for All Program schools have average reading scores almost 3 \nmonths ahead of those in matching controlled schools. By the end of the \nfifth grade, students read more than 1 year ahead of their control \ngroup peers. This program can reduce the need for special education \nplacements by more than 50 percent and virtually eliminate retention of \nstudents in the grade they have just completed.\n  This Success for All Program incorporates small classes, regular \nassessments, team learning, and parental involvement into a \ncomprehensive reading program based on phonics and contextual learning \ntechniques. In order to implement this program, however, schools need \nresources, particularly in the first year. The estimated costs is about \n$62,000 for 500 students in that first year; that decreases \nsubstantially\n\n[[Page S12151]]\n\nto about $5,000 per year in the third year the program is in place. \nThey must provide the initial training for the school's principal, the \nfacilitators, the teachers, and 23 days of onsite training and \ncurriculum materials.\n  This is the kind of program of which we need to see more. It is the \nkind of program for which the funds we would earmark in this amendment \nwould be made available. In my view, this is the type of thing the \nAmerican people want to see. Instead of just sending another big check, \nlet's try to attract some attention to the strategies we know will work \nso the failing schools can move up and the students who attend these \nschools can get a good education.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Reed. I reserve the remainder of my time \nand yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment sponsored by \nmy colleague from New Mexico. I commend him for his commitment and \ndedication.\n  During the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, I was a member of the other body. There I proposed an \naccountability amendment in committee which strengthened our oversight \nand accountability for title I and other elementary and secondary \nschool programs. When we came to the conference, it was Senator Jeff \nBingaman of New Mexico who was leading the fight on the Senate side to \nensure accountability was part and parcel of the 1994 reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I am pleased to work \nwith him today on this very important amendment.\n  What we propose to do is to provide $200 million so the States can \nmove from talking about accountability and intervening in low-\nperforming schools to actually taking the steps to do just that. There \nare scarce Federal dollars that we provide for elementary and secondary \neducation programs, the principal program being title I. Although we \nallocate $8 billion a year for title I, there still appears to be \ninsufficient resources to ensure that accountability reforms and \noversight are effectively taking place in our schools.\n  This amendment provides for those resources. It ensures we get the \nbest value for the money we invest in title I. It allows schools to not \nonly provide piecemeal services to students but to look and seek out \nways to reform the way they educate the students in their classrooms.\n  We will continue as the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act approaches to stress this issue of \naccountability. But today we have an opportune moment to invest in \naccountability and school reform. What we find is that the States, \neither through lack of financial resources, lack of focus, or due to \nother commitments and priorities, are not intervening in low-performing \nand failing schools as they should. They are not directing the kind of \nschool improvement teams, for example, that have been authorized under \ntitle I. This amendment gives them not only the incentive but the \nresources to do that. In effect, what we are trying to do is make title \nI not just a way to distribute money to low-income schools but to \nstimulate the reform and improvement of these schools.\n  It should be noted that the amendment targets the lowest performing \nschools to try to lift up those schools which are consistently failing \ntheir students. We all know if the schools are not working, these young \npeople are not going to get the education they need and require to be \nproductive citizens and workers and to contribute to our community and \nto our country. That is at the heart of all of our efforts on both \nsides of the aisle in the Senate.\n  It is vitally important to turn around the lowest performing and \nfailing schools. The 1994 reauthorization focused attention in the \nStates on accountability, improvement, and reform. The States have \ntaken steps to adopt accountability systems. But today we are here to \ngive States and school districts the tools to ensure the job of turning \naround failing schools can be done effectively and completely. I urge \npassage of this amendment.\n\n  Once again, I commend the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership \nand look forward to working with him as we undertake the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the \nmonths ahead.\n  I yield whatever time I have.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator has 8 minutes 10 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Bingaman, Senator \nReed, and Senator Wellstone for this particular proposal. Effectively, \nwhat they are saying is we want to improve low-performing schools and \nwe want to do it now--not wait until next year. It is reasonable to ask \nwhether this kind of effort can be productive and whether it can be \nuseful. I want to raise my voice and say: Absolutely.\n  I had the opportunity to visit the Harriet Tubman Elementary School \nin New York City, one of the lowest-performing schools in the city, \nwhere 99 percent of the children come from low-income families. After \nbeing assigned to the Chancellor's District--a special school district \ncreated for the lowest-performing schools--school leaders, parents, and \nteachers devised a plan for comprehensive change. The school adopted a \ncomprehensive reform program including an intensive reading program.\n  By 1997-98, it had been removed from the state's list of low-\nperforming schools and reading scores had improved; the percentage of \nstudents performing at or above grade level on the citywide assessment \nhad risen from 30 percent in 1996, to 46 percent.\n  We have instance after instance where that has happened. At Hawthorne \nElementary school in Texas, 96 percent of the students qualify for free \nlunch and 28 percent of the students have limited English language \nskills.\n  In 1992-93, Hawthorne implemented a rigorous curriculum to challenge \nstudents in the early grades. In 1994 only 24 percent of students in \nthe school passed all portions of the Texas Assessment of Academic \nSkills. In 1998, almost 63 percent of students passed this test, with \nthe largest gains over the period being made by African American \nstudents.\n  The States themselves have been reluctant to use scarce resources \nwhen we have not had adequate funding for the Title I program. The \nBingaman amendment sets aside a specific amount of resources that will \nbe out there and available to help those particular schools. This makes \na great deal of sense.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the Bingaman-Reed-Wellstone \namendment. These students have spent enough time in low-performing \nschools, and deserve much better. The time is now to take action to fix \nthese schools. The nation's children deserve no less.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Chair will observe if neither side yields time, the time will be \ntaken from both sides and equally charged.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I probably will not even take 2 \nminutes.\n  I rise to support the Bingaman amendment. I appreciate what my \ncolleague from New Mexico said earlier in his remarks, which was that \nthe focus on accountability is terribly important. We also have to make \nsure we invest the resources that will enable each child to have the \nsame opportunity to succeed. I think that is extremely important as \nwell. The two go together.\n  But I do believe this is very helpful to States. It is very helpful \nto low-income children. I think it is terribly important that States \ndevise and put into effect strategies that make sure we have the \nhighest quality title I programs, which are, after all, all about \nexpanding opportunities for low-income children, dealing with the \nlearning gap, enabling a child to do well in school and therefore well \nin his or her life.\n  I applaud his emphasis on accountability and rise to indicate my \nsupport.\n\n[[Page S12152]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment before us today provides a \nchance not just to make this spending bill better and stronger, not \njust to move forward by completing another stage of the budget process \nthe American people are already unsure we can complete, but to take \nthis spending bill and use it as a real vehicle for reform of our \npublic schools. Today we can make the single largest investment in \naccountability ever at the Federal level--today we can help serve as a \ncatalyst for the innovative and, I think, critical reform efforts \ntaking shape around this country. The amendment would reserve $200 \nmillion of title I funds for disadvantaged children to provide \nassistance and support to low-performing schools. This amendment will \ncompel school districts to take strong corrective actions to improve \nconsistently low-performing schools. Passage of this amendment signals \nour commitment to the public schools. Our commitment to their success. \nAnd our commitment to ensuring failing schools turn around.\n  For too long in this Nation we have tolerated low standards and low \nexpectations for our poor children. The standards movement has begun to \nturn the tide on low expectations and we must build on that momentum \nand demand accountability from schools that fail our children. We have \nthis opportunity at a time when the American people are telling us \nthat--for their families, for their futures--in every poll of public \nopinion, in every survey of national priorities--one issue matters \nmost--and it's education. Good news for all of us who care about \neducation, who care about our kids. But the bad news is, the American \npeople aren't so sure we know how to meet their needs anymore. They \naren't even so sure we know how to listen.\n  Every morning, more and more parents--rich, middle class, and even \nthe poor--are driving their sons and daughters to parochial and private \nschools where they believe there will be more discipline, more \nstandards, and more opportunity. Families are enrolling their children \nin charter schools, paying for private schools when they can afford \nthem, or even resorting to home schooling--the largest growth area in \nAmerican education.\n  This amendment comes at an important time for our schools, you might \nsay it comes at an even more important time for this Congress. We have \nto break out of the ideological bind we've put ourselves in--we can't \njust talk about education--it's more than an issue for an election--\nwe've got to do something about it. Parents in this country believe \nthat public schools are in crisis and despite a decade of talk about \nreform, they give them no higher grade than a decade ago. 67 percent \nare dissatisfied with the way public education is working; 66 percent \nuse the word crisis to describe what's going on in our schools today. \nBut the American people--at times more than we seem to be in the \nSenate--are firmly committed to fixing our public schools--fixing our \nschools--not talking about fixing them, not using kids as pawns in a \npolitical chess game.\n  It boils down to one fundamental, overriding concern: Americans want \naccountability for performance and consequences for failure in the \npublic school system. Americans support a variety of innovative \napproaches to improving education--it's actually Washington that is \nmore afraid of change than the citizens who sent us here. And it is \ntime for us to be a catalyst for change--to help facilitate more \ninnovation, not less--to improve the state of education in America: to \naddress the problem of reading scores that show that of 2.6 million \ngraduating high school students, one-third are below basic reading \nlevel, one-third are at basic, only one-third are proficient and only \n100,000 are at a world class reading level.\n  The time to lay down the marker of accountability for student \nperformance is now. That's why today's discussion is so important--\nbecause we have the opportunity today to do it--to stop talking past \neach other--and to deliver on the most important principle of real \neducation reform--accountability.\n\n  When schools begin to fail, when there is social promotion, when kids \nare being left behind, we need to hold those schools accountable for \ntaking those best practices and turning around low performing schools \nnot 5 years from now, not some time in the future, not after another \nstudy, but today--now. And if we can commit ourselves to that kind of \naccountability then we will have taken an incredible leap forward, not \njust building public confidence in public education, but in making all \nour schools better. It is past time that we coalesce around an approach \nto reform grounded in four simple concepts: high standards; teaching to \nthose standards; giving every student the opportunity to meet those \nstandards; and building strict accountability into the system to make \nthose standards meaningful.\n  Mr. President, 49 States have embraced or will soon embrace \nmeaningful standards; there should be no partisan divide over this \nissue--and now is the time for us all to embrace the policies which \nempower our teachers to teach to standards and give every student the \nreal opportunity to meet high standards. Now is the time for us to \nembrace the accountability that has worked so well for real leaders \nlike Gov. Tom Carper in Delaware, and Mayor Daley in Chicago--now is \nthe time for us to say not just that we hope schools will meet high \nstandards, but that we'll work with them--holding them accountable--to \nget them there. It's time for us to say that we're willing--in our \ntitle I spending--to hold schools accountable for meeting those high \nbenchmarks--to reach out to low performing schools and give them the \nintensive help they need to turn things around and help raise student \nperformance. It boils down to real accountability--to acknowledging \nthat though the Federal role in education, in terms of pure spending, \nhas been relatively small, it does provide the leverage--if we are \nwilling to embrace it--to empower schools in need of reform to turn \nthemselves around rapidly--to cut through layers of bureaucracy--to \naccess new resources--to shake up staff--and, if need be, to \nreconstitute itself--to become a new school in a fundamental sense--or \nto turn itself into, essentially, a charter school within the public \nschool system. We know that title I itself, with the early \naccountability reforms already in place have raised accountability--but \nI would say that in this amendment we could do so much more--and we \nshould.\n  Consider the impact more accountability would make--the ability we \nwould have to truly adhere to high standards throughout the system: to \nraise teacher quality; reform certification; provide mentoring and \nongoing education; embrace merit pay; higher salaries; and end teacher \ntenure as we know it.\n  Consider the ability to hold schools accountable for our childrens' \nneeds--to say that we will not allow schools to be the dumping ground \nfor adult problems--and to acknowledge that we need to fill those hours \nafter school with meaningful study--curriculum--and mentoring.\n  Consider the ability to hold students accountable for discipline and \nviolence: to allow schools to write discipline codes and create second \nchance schools: to eliminate the crime that turns too many hallways and \nclassrooms into arenas of violence.\n  We need to do these things now--to be willing to challenge the status \nquo--to do more for our schools, to help every student achieve, to \nguarantee reform when they don't--and--in no small measure--to renew \nthe promise of public education for the 21st century.\n  This will not happen overnight, but it will happen. I look forward to \njoining with all of my colleagues in that effort: to pass this \namendment, to make accountability the foundation of reform, and to face \nthe challenge of fixing our public schools together.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent two letters be \nprinted in the Record at this point, one from Michael Davis, who is the \nsuperintendent of public instruction from my home State of New Mexico, \nand the other from Gordon Ambach, who is the head of the Council of \nChief State School Officers. The first letter from Mr. Davis is in \nsupport of the amendment. The second letter supports providing \nadditional funds to States to implement the accountability provisions \nof title I. Mr. Ambach had not seen the amendment yet when he wrote \nthat letter.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12153]]\n\n\n                                              State of New Mexico,\n\n\n                                      Department of Education,\n\n                                    Santa Fe, NM, October 6, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I write to applaud your efforts to \n     secure a dedicated source of funding for States and local \n     school districts to implement the accountability provisions \n     of Title I. As you know, we have been working hard in New \n     Mexico to raise standards and implement a rigorous \n     accountability system. We will be unable to successfully \n     implement high standards and accountability, however, unless \n     we are able to provide local districts with additional \n     resources to help them address weaknesses in their \n     educational programs and to turn around failing schools. I \n     believe that your amendment seeking to direct $200 million \n     for this purpose will go a long way towards ensuring proper \n     enforcement of the accountability provisions under Title I.\n       Thank you for your efforts. Please let me know if I can be \n     of assistance to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael J. Davis,\n     State Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                       Council of Chief State School Officers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 1999.\n     Member, House Education and the Workforce Committee,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n\nRE: Provisions for Program Improvement in Reauthorization of ESEA Title \n                    I--The need for greater funding\n\n       Dear Representative: Title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act (ESEA) now includes very important \n     provisions for the identification in each state of those \n     schools with lowest levels of student achievement and most in \n     need to program improvement. This provision earmarks funds \n     for the state education agency (SEA) to assist local \n     education authorities and these schools with their strategies \n     to improve achievement. This state role is authorized on the \n     assumption that if the district and school had the capacity \n     internally to improve; improvement would have occurred and be \n     reflected by increased achievement scores. Unfortunately, the \n     analysis of Title I school by school test scores reveals that \n     nearly 7,000 schools have continuing low performance over the \n     years and need ``external'' program improvement help. The \n     problem is that the federal appropriation for program \n     improvement is far too small to serve 7,000 schools \n     effectively.\n       An increase in the state education agency (SEA) set-aside \n     for program improvement is urgently needed to help the 7,000 \n     lowest performing schools in the nation build capacity, \n     improve student achievement and meet new accountability \n     requirements for student progress. As your Committee develops \n     a bill to reauthorize Title I for introduction and markup, we \n     urge a substantial increase in the funds set-aside for \n     improving programs in schools where students are not making \n     adequate progress toward achieving state standards. The \n     current \\1/2\\ of 1% of each state's total Title I allocation \n     which may be set-aside for program improvement provides only \n     $40 million of the $8 billion program for SEAs to fulfill the \n     required activities for schools identified as needing \n     improvement. An increase to 2.5% by FY2001 and 3.5% by FY \n     2004 as proposed by the Administration is critical to provide \n     $200 million to $300 million to serve the 7,000 schools with \n     support teams, mentors, distinguished educators, additional \n     comprehensive school reform efforts, professional development \n     and other forms of technical assistance called for in the \n     bill.\n       Increased program improvement funding is the right strategy \n     for these reasons:\n       (1) All program improvement funds are used directly to \n     raise quality in the classrooms of the lowest performing \n     Title I schools. Under the Administration proposal for ESEA \n     reauthorization, 70% of the funds authorized for program \n     improvement must be allocated by the SEA to the LEA to carry \n     out its program improvement activities in failing schools \n     according to its local plan approved by the SEA. The \n     remaining 30% of the program improvement funds will be \n     used by the SEA for direct support and assistance to the \n     classrooms of such schools. This state service assures \n     that both the state and local districts are partners in \n     bringing external resources to help teachers and leaders \n     in those schools. All of the uses of funds for program \n     improvement are defined as the ``Dollars to the \n     Classroom'' bill of the same title. All of these funds \n     support improvement in the classrooms which most need the \n     help.\n       (2) The current $40 million which is available under the \n     .5% set-aside is woefully inadequate for SEAs and districts \n     to serve and improve low-performing schools. This amount is \n     grossly insufficient to fulfill the requirements and needs of \n     the almost 7,000 schools already identified as needing \n     improvement. The average amount available now per school is \n     only $5,715 per year. New provisions expected in the \n     reauthorization for school support teams, distinguished \n     educators and mentors, technical assistance to adopt and \n     implement research-based models for improved instruction, and \n     professional development for teachers and school leaders in \n     methods which assure student success require more resources \n     per school. The need will increase substantially for schools \n     identified as needing improvement as states and districts \n     continue to implement challenging standards and assessments \n     for all students. Proposed accountability requirements to \n     assure all students are continually learning the skills \n     necessary to achieve on grade level and comparability of \n     teacher quality in each school will add to the challenges for \n     schools in need of improvement and must be met with increased \n     external support.\n       (3) Although Title I is the single largest federal \n     elementary and secondary program, Title I has the smallest \n     proportion of funds devoted to administration, support and \n     assistance, and quality control monitoring of any of the \n     major federal programs. The Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA) has 25%, and the Perkins Vocational-\n     Technical Education Act has 15% with an additional 10% \n     directed by the state to rural and urban areas through \n     competitive grants. Only 1% of the Title I total is \n     authorized for states to operate and support all eligible \n     schools in a program which expends $8 billion in federal \n     taxpayers' funds to serve 11 million students in 45,000 \n     schools in 90% of the nation's school districts. The amount \n     of funds devoted to state and locally assisted program \n     improvement in the lowest-performing schools is an additional \n     0.5%. State capacity for helping title I districts and \n     schools is significantly underfunded and therefore underused. \n     Congress should rely on state level assistance for Title I, \n     as it does for IDEA, Perkins Vocational-Technical Education, \n     Technology Challenge Grants, and other federal programs. \n     Leveraging substantial, sustained gains in student \n     achievement in these schools requires a far stronger \n     investment in state assistance than in the current law.\n       We hope these comments are helpful as you develop this \n     critical piece of legislation. We urge you to act on them. \n     Please feel free to call us at (202) 336-7009 if you have any \n     questions or find we can be of further assistance.\n           Respectfully Submitted,\n                                                 Gordon M. Ambach,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me read a few sentences from the \nletter from Michael Davis. He is a very capable, respected, State \nschool superintendent from my State. He writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I write to applaud your efforts to \n     secure a dedicated source of funding for States and local \n     school districts to implement the accountability provisions \n     of Title I. As you know, we have been working hard in New \n     Mexico to raise standards and implement a rigorous \n     accountability system. We will be unable to successfully \n     implement high standards and accountability, however, unless \n     we are able to provide local districts with additional \n     resources to help them address weaknesses in their \n     educational programs and to turn around failing schools. I \n     believe that your amendment seeking to direct $200 million \n     for this purpose will go a long way towards ensuring proper \n     enforcement of the accountability provisions under Title I.\n\n  Then, in the letter from the executive director, Mr. Ambach, of the \nCouncil of Chief State School Officers, the point that is made strongly \nis that the current $40 million that is available under the 0.5-percent \nset-aside for States is woefully inadequate for local school districts \nto serve and improve low-performing schools. I think those two letters \nspeak very strongly in favor of what we are trying to do.\n  I very much appreciate the support of Senator Kennedy, Senator \nWellstone, Senator Reed, and Senator Kerrey.\n  Let me say a few other things before my time is up. How much time \nremains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment, as I have said before, \nshould not be a partisan issue. I know many of the amendments that have \nbeen brought to the Senate floor in recent days and weeks and even \nmonths have been voted along partisan lines. This amendment should not \nbe. The need for accountability is not a partisan issue.\n  Just yesterday, Governor Bush from Texas talked about his plan for \nimproving accountability in title I schools. Under his plan, school \ndistricts and schools would have to show improvement in test \nperformance. If schools improved, they would be rewarded with \nadditional funds. If schools did not improve in 5 years, those funds \nwould be taken and given to parents or students in vouchers of $1,500 \neach.\n  The problem with this proposal is it provides the stick, a very big \nstick with dire consequences for schools that do not perform, but it \ndoes not provide resources to help those schools avoid that failure. \nThis proposal says if you can figure out how to turn your school around \nwith the meager resources you have, fine; if you cannot, then we will \nlet the clock run out and then take the money away, so your odds \nagainst succeeding become insurmountable.\n\n[[Page S12154]]\n\n  What this amendment will do is provide that assistance to those \nschools immediately when the failing nature of that school is \nrecognized. I think this is an extremely important amendment. It is \nsomething we ought to do. I hope this is considered by each Senator as \na good-faith effort to better use the funds we are spending in this \nbill.\n  Once again, I remind all my colleagues, this amendment does not add \nmoney to the bill. This is not a question of whether we are going to \nspend more or less on education. It is a question of how effectively we \ncan spend the funds we are going to spend.\n  Mr. President, I gather my time is up. I yield the floor at this time \nand wait for the response, if there is any opposition to the amendment, \nwhich I certainly hope there is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Without objection, the Chair, acting in my capacity as an individual \nSenator from Kansas, notes the absence of a quorum, and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Bingaman amendment will provide \n$200 million from the funds the committee provided for basic and \nconcentration grants to support State and local accountability efforts \nto identify school failure and provide progressively more interventions \nto turn around the performance of the local school. Under the current \nlaw, States may now reserve 0.5 percent for such activity. This \namendment would set aside $200 million, or 2.5 percent, specifically \nfor State and local accountability efforts. States would not, \ntherefore, be given the choice of whether or not to spend funds for \naccountability purposes which resemble very much a mandate. This \namendment would take education funds away from States to educate low-\nincome students. Most States already have adopted statewide \naccountability systems that include State assessments to measure \nwhether students are meeting State standards, report cards that \nsummarize performance of individual schools, and rating systems that \ndetermine whether a school's performance is adequate.\n  The authorizing committees have not had the opportunity to carefully \nexamine the issue of whether to increase the amount set aside for \naccountability. Hearings should be held where States can express their \nviews, and this issue should be addressed during the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President. how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 12 minutes 42 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, may I ask if the Senator will yield for \na question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I was informed that the Governors \nAssociation supports this amendment, and that the States would want the \ninitial ability to use these funds. Does the Senator have information \nto the contrary? I know he raised a concern about requiring States to \ndo something different. My information is that this is the authority \nthey would want.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am advised by the committee staff that we don't have \nthe same information the Senator has just expressed, so I cannot \ncomment one way or the other.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I might just respond that we will try to \nget that information to the Senator from Georgia before the vote occurs \nat 11:30.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Very good. I appreciate the comment of the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Would it be in order for me to call up my amendment in \norder to move on? I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment numbered 1842.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to setting aside the \namendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just to be clear to colleagues, I thought we were \nfinished and were trying to move along. I am willing to wait, if \nSenator Bingaman wishes to continue.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We may wish to continue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Very well.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder whether I could ask unanimous consent for 3 \nminutes as in morning business to make a statement while we are in \ndeliberations. I ask unanimous consent to be able to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I do not object to yielding 3 minutes \nof time as in morning business, and that following that we go back to \nthis.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. I am trying to make the best use of our \ntime, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12154-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12154-S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MERGERS IN THE MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we are in the midst of an unprecedented \nwave of mergers and concentration in the media and the communications \nindustries. We are talking about the flow of information in democracy \nand whether a few are going to control this. But instead of doing \nanything about it, to protect American consumers or to safeguard the \nflow of information that our democracy depends upon, I am troubled by \nefforts underway to undermine protections that are already on the \nbooks.\n  I cite that the CBS-Viacom merger announced last month would be the \nbiggest media deal ever. Today, the FCC announced its approval of a \nmerger between SBC and Ameritech. On Tuesday, Clear Channel \nCommunications announced that it is buying AMFM to create a huge radio \nconglomerate with 830 stations that will dominate American radio.\n  I am amazed so few people are concerned about these developments. The \nreason I rise to speak about this is that when FCC Chairman Bill \nKennard is so bold as to point out that the MCI-Sprint deal would \nundermine competition, he is simply doing his job. I want to say on the \nfloor of the Senate, he should not be punished for doing his job.\n  Last year, when the FCC approved the merger of Worldcom and MCI, \nChairman Kennard said the industry was one merger away from undue \nconcentration. Now this merger would be the one that pushes us over the \ntop.\n  So when Antitrust Division Chief Joel Klein of the Justice Department \nbrings some very difficult cases to enforce our country's antitrust \nlaws, he is simply doing his job. When FCC Chairman Bill Kennard raises \nthese kinds of questions, he is simply doing his job.\n  We cannot expect these agencies to enforce our laws, to do their job, \nif we take away their budgets or their statutory authority every time \nthey do it. We need to strengthen our review of these mergers. We need \nto strength our antitrust laws, on which I think we have to do much \nbetter. And we need to give the Justice Department, the FTC, and the \nFCC the resources they need to enforce the law.\n  So more than anything else, I rise to support Bill Kennard's \nconcerns, to tell him he is doing his job, and urge my colleagues to \nunderstand that he has an important responsibility to protect the \nconsumers. The flow of information in our democracy is the most \nimportant thing we have. He certainly\n\n[[Page S12155]]\n\nshould not be punished for doing his job and doing his job well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment, and I call up amendment No. 1842.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1842.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       Sec.   . It is the sense of the Senate that it is important \n     that Congress determine the economic status of former \n     recipients of assistance under the temporary assistance to \n     needy families program funded under part A of title IV of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me first explain this amendment to \ncolleagues and then marshal my evidence for it.\n  I believe we will have a good, strong vote on the floor of the Senate \nfor this amendment. I have introduced a similar amendment in the past, \nwhich lost by one vote, but I have now changed the amendment which I \nthink will make it more acceptable to colleagues.\n  In the 1996 welfare law we passed, we set aside $1 billion for high-\nperformance bonuses to go to States, and currently this money goes to \nStates. The way it works is, it uses a formula that takes into account \nthe State's effectiveness in enabling TANF recipients to find jobs, \nwhich is terribly important. The whole goal of the welfare bill was to \nmove families from welfare dependency to becoming economically \nindependent.\n  This amendment would add three more criteria. We have had, in the \nlast year or two, a dramatic decline in food stamp participation, about \na 25-percent decline. This should be of concern to all of us because \nthe Food Stamp Program has been the most important safety net program \nfor poor children in our country. Indeed, it was President Nixon, a \nRepublican President, who, in 1972, federalized this program and said: \nOne thing we are going to do as a national community is make sure \nchildren aren't going hungry in our country. We are going to make sure \nwe have a program with national standards and that those families who \nare eligible to participate are, indeed, able to obtain this \nassistance.\n  In addition, what we want to find out is the proportion of families \nleaving TANF who were covered by Medicaid or health insurance. Families \nUSA, which is an organization that has tremendous credibility with all \nof us, issued a disturbing report a few months ago. To summarize it, \nbecause of the welfare bill, there are about 670,000 Americans who no \nlonger have any health care coverage.\n  Maybe that is worth repeating. Because of the welfare bill, there are \nabout 670,000 Americans who no longer have any coverage. Since about \ntwo-thirds of welfare recipients have always been children--this was, \nafter all, mainly for mothers and children--we want to make sure these \nchildren and these families still have health care coverage.\n  We want to also make sure we get some information about the number of \nchildren in these working families who receive some form of affordable \nchild care. In other words, again, what we want to find out is, as \nfamilies move from welfare to work, which is the goal--and I think work \nwith dignity is terribly important--we also want to make sure the \nchildren are OK.\n  Again, I will use but one of many examples. It will take me some time \nto develop my argument, but one very gripping example, I say to the \nChair, is when I was in east LA, I was meeting with a group of Head \nStart mothers. As we were discussing the Head Start Program and their \nchildren, one of the mothers was telling me she had been a welfare \nmother and was emphasizing that she was working. Indeed, she was quite \nproud of working. In the middle of our discussion, all of a sudden she \nbecame upset and started to cry.\n  I asked her: If I am poking my nose into your business, pay no \nattention to me, but can you tell me why you are so upset? She said: \nThe one problem with my working is when my second grader goes home--she \nlived in a housing project; later I visited that housing project--it is \na pretty dangerous area. It used to be I could walk my second grader to \nschool, and then I could walk her home, make sure she was OK. I was \nthere with her. Now I am always frightened, especially after school. I \ntell her to go home, and I tell her to lock the door. I tell her not to \ntake any phone calls because no one is there.\n  It makes us wonder how many children are in apartments where they \nhave locked the door and can't take any phone calls and can't go \noutside to play, even when it is a beautiful day. I think we do need to \nknow how the children are faring and what is going on. Again, this is a \nmatter of doing some good policy evaluation.\n  Finally, for those States that have adopted the family violence \noption, which we were able to do with the help of my wife Sheila and \nSenator Patty Murray, we want to know how well they are doing in \nproviding the services for victims of domestic violence. This is \nimportant. The family violence option essentially said we are not \nsaying these mothers should be exempt. What we are saying is there \nshould be an opportunity for States to be able to say to the Federal \nGovernment--it would be up to States, and they would not be penalized \nfor that--look, this woman has been battered and beaten over and over \nagain and we are not going to get her to work as quickly as we are \nother mothers; there are additional support services she needs. When \nshe goes to work, this guy is there threatening her. Because of these \nkinds of circumstances, please give us more flexibility.\n  We want to find out how these States are dealing with that. \nOtherwise, what happens is if you don't have that kind of flexibility, \nthen a mother finds herself sanctioned if she doesn't take the job; but \nshe can't really take the job and, therefore, the only thing she ends \nup doing is going back into a very dangerous home. She has left, she \nhas tried to get away, and she is trying to be safe. If you cut off her \nassistance, then she has no other choice but to go back into a very \ndangerous home.\n  That should not happen in America. By the way, colleagues, I know it \nis an incredible statistic, but October is the month we focus on \nviolence in homes. I wish it didn't happen. About the most conservative \nstatistic is that every 13 seconds a woman is battered in her home in \nour country. I can't even grasp the meaning of that. A home should be a \nsafe place.\n\n[[Page S12156]]\n\n  As I have said before--and I hope my colleagues, Senator Hollings and \nSenator Judd Gregg, will help me keep this in conference committee--\nabout 5 million children see this violence. So we talk about the fact \nchildren should not see the violence in movies and on television. A lot \nof them see the violence right in their homes. It has a devastating \nimpact on their own lives. We need to make sure these kids don't fall \nbetween the cracks and that we provide some services.\n  I am going to start out in a moment with some examples. I am talking \nabout nothing more than good policy evaluation. Let me wear my teacher \nhat. All I am saying--and we can disagree or agree about the bill, on \nshould we have passed it or not, and some things are working well but \nsome have questions; I have questions--let's at least do some good \nthorough policy evaluation. We are saying that the States just merge \ntheir tapes --they have the data--and present it to Health and Human \nServices. We have a report. We know what is going on in these areas.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment because, otherwise, I would \nhave been subject to a rule XVI point of order. I hoped I would not \nhave had to do a sense of the Senate because, under normal \ncircumstances, we would have had the House bill over here. If the House \nbill had been over here, then I could have introduced this amendment, \nand I would not have been subject to any rule XVI challenge. Since that \nhas not happened, what I am doing is bringing this amendment out, \ngetting, I hope, a good, strong vote, and if the House does, in fact, \nmove forward with some work and gets the Labor-Health and Human \nServices Appropriation bill passed, then I will bring this amendment \nback as a regular amendment. I say to colleagues, all the time I spend \ntoday will have been well spent, and we can have 5 minutes of debate \nand then vote on it. In a way, I am trying to move us forward in an \nexpeditious manner.\n\n  When we are talking about families that are worried about whether \nthey can put food on the table or worried about whether they can pay \nthe rent at the end of the month, I don't think they much care whether \nor not my amendment is subject to rule XVI; I don't think they much \ncare whether or not this is an amendment on an appropriations bill; I \ndon't think they much care about why the House hasn't sent an \nappropriations bill over to the Senate. What they care about are more \npressing issues.\n  What I am concerned about is that there is, indeed, a segment of our \npopulation who are very poor, the majority of whom are children, who \nare, indeed, falling between the cracks. Let me also say at the very \nbeginning that I think this is the question: Since the welfare bill \npassed, we have reduced the rolls by about 4.5 million people, the \nmajority of them children. That has been about a 50-percent reduction \nin the welfare population. The question is whether or not the reduction \nof the welfare rolls has led to a reduction of poverty because the goal \nof the legislation was to move these families to some kind of economic \nself-sufficiency and certainly not to put them in a more precarious \nsituation.\n  I think we ought to have the data. I think we ought to do the policy \nevaluation. I have said it before on the floor of the Senate, and I \nthink it is worth saying again: One of my favorite sociologists, Gunnar \nMyrdal, a Swedish sociologist, once said, ``Ignorance is never random; \nsometimes we don't know what we don't want to know.'' I think we ought \nnot to be ignorant about this. We ought to have the data.\n  My appeal is to do the policy evaluation. This amendment will not \ncost additional money. It can be absorbed into the existing amount of \nmoney, according to CBO. There is no reason why we should not want to \nknow--especially since, in many States, the drop-dead date certain is \napproaching where everyone will have used up the number of years they \ncan receive an AFDC benefit and will be cut off assistance. Before we \ndo that with the rest of the population, let's at least have some kind \nof policy evaluation. Let's understand what is happening to these \nfamilies.\n  By the way, I think among those families that are still on welfare, \nwe are talking about a fair number of children who had children and who \nneed, therefore, to get a high school diploma or are in need of job \ntraining. We are talking about single parents with severely disabled \nchildren. We are talking about a fair number of single parents who are \nwomen who struggle with substance abuse. I am being blunt about it. \nThis is an issue I know well from work I have done all of my adult life \nin local communities. We are talking about women who have been victims \nof domestic violence. We need to be careful about what we are doing. \nSometimes we forget it, but this is about the lives of people in the \ncountry and, in particular, poor women and children. I think we ought \nto have an honest policy evaluation.\n  I want to put this in a very personal context now. Before I do this, \nI wish to start out with some art work that will speak to this part of \nmy presentation. We had a group of high school students from \nMinneapolis here--it was incredible--who were working with the Harriet \nTubman Center, which is a very special shelter. These high school \nkids--I think 300 or 400 of them submitted their art, and these 11 or \n12 students were the ones who had the best art, but all of it was \nexceptional--came to Washington, DC, 2 days ago. This display is now in \nthe Russell Building Rotunda for a week. Every year, for the last 6 or \n7 years, Sheila and I have brought different works from around the \ncountry--sometimes from Minnesota and sometimes from other States--to \nthe Nation's Capitol. I want to show a little bit of these students' \nwork.\n  So often the focus on students is so negative. These are inner-city \nhigh school students. It was a wonderful diversity, with all sorts of \nnationalities, cultures, histories, different colors, a great group of \nstudents. I was so pleased they came to Washington. This work I think \nspeaks for itself. I will read from the top:\n\n       Is a corner in your home the only place your child felt \n     safe today? Why is it always my fault? Stop it. Speak up. \n     Seeing or hearing violence among family members hurts \n     children in many ways. They do not have to be hit to feel the \n     pain of violence.\n\n  I am going to hold this up for a moment so it can be seen by people \nwho are watching this presentation. My colleagues can see this in the \nRussell Rotunda.\n  Next picture. I will hold it up. It says:\n\n       In the time it takes you to tie your shoe, a woman is \n     beaten. . ..Go ahead, now tie your other one! Speak up! \n     Domestic violence causes almost 100,000 days of \n     hospitalization, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 \n     trips to the doctor every single year.\n  I will just hold this up for a moment so it can be seen. This is \npretty marvelous work. This is art from the heart. This is art from the \nheart of high school students. I say that to the pages; they are high \nschool students.\n  The next work:\n\n       If we hear the violence and see the violence, why is it so \n     hard to speak of the violence?\n       Is being a passer-by keeping a secret? ``Speak up.''\n\n  Ninety-two percent of women who are physically abused by their \npartners do not discuss these incidents with a physician. Fifty-seven \npercent do not discuss the incidents with anyone.\n  Finally, this is really powerful. I will show it this way, too.\n\n       So . . . how do your kids behave on a date? Love isn't \n     supposed to hurt.\n\n  Two high school kids.\n  On average, 100 out of 300 school students are or have been in an \nabusive dating relationship. Only 4 out of 10 of these relationships \nend when the violence and abuse begin. One out of three high school \nstudents is or has been in an abusive dating relationship.\n  I say to my colleague from Nevada this is marvelous artwork done by \nhigh school students in inner-city Minneapolis. Twelve of them came to \nWashington, DC. I thank my colleague, Senator Reid from Nevada, for \nhaving the courtesy and graciousness to acknowledge this work.\n  I want to tell you about a conversation I had. Maureen, who works \nwith Interchange Food Pantry in Milwaukee, WI, told me about a phone \ncall she received on Monday of this week--Monday this week. On Monday, \nMaureen received a phone call. It was a woman who was well known at the \nfood pantry, a woman who has a file about an inch and a half thick \ndocumenting the domestic violence she has endured at the hands of an \nabusive husband.\n\n[[Page S12157]]\n\n  Yesterday, this woman--we are talking about this week, right now. I \nwant everyone to understand that this debate is about people's lives.\n  Yesterday, this woman ran out of her home with her 3-year-old child \nin her arms, fleeing her abusive husband. She went to school, and she \npicked up her three other young children. She went to a laundromat. She \ncalled Maureen. She was looking for help, and she didn't know where \nelse to turn.\n  The people at the food pantry tried to place this woman in a domestic \nviolence shelter. But homelessness right now seems to have reached \nepidemic proportions in Milwaukee. So many women are becoming homeless \nthat all of the battered women's shelters are full to overflowing, and \ndesperate women are presenting themselves as victims of domestic \nviolence so they can be placed in shelters. The shelters don't have any \nroom because there are so many homeless women and children. Some of \nthese women are basically pretending as if they are victims. Plenty of \nthem are. Because they are so battered, they try to find shelter. What \nthis means is there is no place left to go for homeless women and women \nwho are victims of domestic violence.\n  She couldn't find a shelter at this food pantry. They could find no \nshelter to place this woman. On the phone, they couldn't find anything \nfor her.\n  This is 1999 in America. The economy is booming. We don't have this \nkind of discussion on the floor of the Senate enough.\n  All that food pantry was able to do was to give her some food \nvouchers and a bus ticket so they could go spend the night with her \nmother. But her mother lives in senior housing. She is not supposed to \nhave overnight guests, and she could actually end up losing her house \nif they get caught.\n\n  So this woman, who has a 15-year history of abuse, is going to have \nto return to her home. That is where she is going. She will have to go \nback to this abusive, violent, dangerous situation for herself and for \nher children because she lacks the economic independence to do anything \nelse.\n  No one should be forced to risk their life or the lives of their \nchildren because they are poor. This woman's story is a welfare \nnightmare. She is doing all she can. Her children are clean, and they \nare well cared for. But she is not making it economically. Her husband \nisn't willing to work. Therefore, the family has been sanctioned by the \nwelfare department on and off. She has been forced to rely on the food \npantry for help.\n  So she sells her plasma as often as possible--about three times a \nweek. She doesn't have a high school degree. But the welfare agency, \ninstead of making sure she gets her GED and the training she needs to \nget some kind of a living-wage job, has put her into a training program \nso she can become a housekeeper in a hotel. Their idea of getting this \nwoman to a life of economic independence is to place her as a \nhousekeeper in a hotel.\n  She has been in an abusive, dangerous situation for 15 years. Her \ncaseworker is aware of her situation. But there is no help. There is no \neffort to make her economically independent so she can leave the \nmarriage, and she is now being forced back into this home. She does not \nhave the economic wherewithal to leave her home.\n  This woman has tried. She went to the welfare office. She asked to be \nplaced in a job. They put her to work in a light manufacturing job, a \njob for which she had no training whatsoever. Making the situation even \nworse, they placed her in a job that was way out in the suburbs with a \n45-minute commute each way on a bus.\n  Listen to this. This is why I think we need to know what is going on \nin the country. She had to get up at 4:30 in the morning, drop her kid \noff at child care--child care is hard to find at 4:30 in the morning--\ntravel to her job, put in a full day's work, and ride all the way home, \npick up her kids, and go back home to face her abusive husband. When \nshe went to the welfare worker and explained the situation, she was \ntold that if she quit this job, she would be sanctioned and she would \nlose her benefits.\n  This woman's life and the lives of her children are not going to get \nbetter until she can get out of her situation. But under the current \nwelfare program--at least the way it is working in one State, in one \ncommunity--this isn't going to happen.\n  Let me give a few examples from some of the studies that have been \ndone. Then let me go into the overall debate.\n  Applying for cash assistance has become difficult in many places. In \none Alabama county, a professor found that intake workers gave public \nassistance applications to only 6 out of 27 undergraduate students who \nrequested them despite State policy that says anyone who asks for an \napplication should get one.\n  This was from a Children's Defense Fund study. The study cited was by \nthe professor who was doing fieldwork research on the application \nprocess in two Alabama counties.\n  Before I actually give the examples, let me go to the debate. There \nare those who argue that we don't need to do any policy evaluation \nbecause we have cut the rolls in half. But the goal was never cutting \nthe rolls in half. The goal was to reduce poverty.\n  Let me cite some disturbing evidence: The reduction in the roles is \nnot bringing a reduction in poverty. We want to know, what kind of jobs \ndo the mothers have? What kind of wages? Are the families still \nreceiving medical coverage? Is there affordable child care? Are \nchildren still participating in the Food Stamp Program? This is what we \nneed to know.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask consent that following the vote \nwhich is to occur momentarily, Senator Wellstone be recognized for an \nadditional 45 minutes, and following the use of or yielding back of \ntime, Senator Coverdell be recognized to move to table amendment No. \n1842, no second-degree amendment be in order prior to the vote, and the \nvote would occur at 1:50.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I agree with the request and I am \npleased to work within this framework. I have a judge I have to meet; \nhe is going to be appearing before an important committee. I do not get \ndone with that until a little bit after 2 o'clock. Could we say 2:15 \ninstead of 1:50?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I wonder if it could be 1:45? What I am dealing with \nis a total sequence of time. There are other amendments. I wonder if we \nvoted at 1:45, would it give the Senator time to get to his \nintroduction? It would be very helpful if we could do that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will figure out how to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1861\n\n  Who yields time on the Bingaman amendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time is there at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me sum up what the amendment does. \nIt is an amendment to set aside $200 million of title I funds to be \ntargeted at helping schools that are failing. We give a lot of speeches \nabout how we need to help failing schools. This is a chance to vote to \nhelp failing schools. The amendment does not add money to the bill. The \namendment says we are serious about accountability. We are giving the \nStates some funds, earmarking some funds so they also can be serious \nabout accountability in the expenditure of title I funds.\n  I have a letter from the National Governors' Association. I ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              National Governors' Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     703 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the nation's Governors, \n     I write to express our\n\n[[Page S12158]]\n\n     strong support for your amendment to provide states with \n     additional funds to help turn around schools that are failing \n     to provide a quality education for Title I students.\n       As you know, under current law, states are permitted to \n     reserve one-half of one percent of their Title I monies to \n     administer the Title I program and provide schools with \n     additional assistance. However, this small setaside does not \n     provide the states with sufficient funds to improve the \n     quality of Title I schools. A recent study by the U.S. \n     Department of Education noted that the ``capacity of state \n     school support teams to assist schools in need of improvement \n     of Title I is a major concern.'' The programs authorized to \n     fund such improvement efforts have not been funded. As a \n     result, states have been unable to provide such services. \n     According to ``Promising Results, Continuing Challenges: The \n     Final Report of the National Assessment of Title I,'' in \n     1998, only eight states reported that school support teams \n     had been able to serve the majority of schools identified as \n     needing improvement. In twenty-four states, Title I directors \n     reported more schools in need of school support teams than \n     Title I could assist.\n       Earlier this year, the National Governors' Association \n     (NGA) adopted an education policy that recognizes the \n     important role of the states in providing technical \n     assistance to local school districts to help them implement \n     federal education programs. In addition, the policy calls for \n     full implementation of the current Title I accountability \n     provisions, including the requirements that states intervene \n     in low performing schools. However, the policy calls on the \n     federal government to provide states with sufficient funds to \n     enable states to provide school districts with the tools to \n     meet federal program requirements. Your amendment would \n     provide such funding. Therefore, NGA supports your amendment \n     and will urge other Senators to support the adoption of it.\n       We look forward to working with you towards the enactment \n     of this and other provisions that will help states improve \n     the quality of services provided to Title I students.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Raymond C. Scheppach.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me read a few sentences from it. This is addressed \nto me, Senator Bingaman.\n\n       On behalf of the nation's Governors, I write to express our \n     strong support for your amendment to provide states with \n     additional funds to help turn around schools that are failing \n     to provide a quality education for Title I students.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Earlier this year, the National Governors' Association \n     (NGA) adopted an education policy that recognizes the \n     important role of the states in providing technical \n     assistance to local school districts to help them implement \n     federal education programs.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       . . . the policy calls on the federal government to provide \n     states with sufficient funds to enable states to provide \n     school districts with the tools to meet federal program \n     requirements. Your amendment would provide such funding. \n     Therefore, NGA supports your amendment and will urge other \n     Senators to support the adoption of it.\n\n  This is a good amendment. The States support it. It will help \ndramatically in improving our schools. We should not postpone this. We \nshould not kick this down the road and say we will deal with it \nsometime in the future. We should do it today.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the amendment would take money that \ncurrently goes directly to school districts and give it to States for \naccountability purposes. The authorizing committee, chaired by Senator \nJeffords of Vermont, wants to have an opportunity to take a careful \nlook at this issue during reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. While the letter from the National Governors' \nAssociation states that the association supports the amendment, the \nfact remains that funds would still be taken from local school \ndistricts. While this may be a decision the authorizing committee may \nultimately make, it needs to be decided at the authorizing committee \nlevel. This is a significant decision, to take money directly from \nclassrooms, and should be carefully reviewed.\n  I yield the remainder of the majority's time, if any remains, and I \nmove to table the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1861.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) is \nabsent because of family illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 317 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Dodd\n     McCain\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1842\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding of the previous \nunanimous consent that we now are ready to hear Senator Wellstone from \nMinnesota for up to 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, since I had a chance to speak on this amendment, I can \nbe brief and probably will not need to take anywhere near the full \namount of time.\n  Let me remind Senators what the vote on this amendment will be: To \nexpress the sense of the Senate regarding the importance of determining \nthe economic status of former recipients of temporary assistance to \nneedy families. I am hoping not one Senator votes against this.\n  Again, the purpose of this amendment is to express the sense of the \nSenate that we want to know, what is the economic status of welfare \nmothers no longer on welfare? What is happening with this legislation? \nIt is called policy evaluation.\n  It is a sense of the Senate because otherwise I would be subject to \nrule XVI. If the House had done their work and had sent over the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill, I could do this \namendment and I wouldn't have to do a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I \ncertainly hope there is not a motion to table this. I can't imagine why \nit would be controversial.\n  The Senate goes on record that we need to determine the economic \nstatus of these former recipients. We need to know how this legislation \nis working. We need to know whether or not these mothers, who have been \nsanctioned, actually have jobs. We need to know whether the jobs pay a \nliving wage. We need to know whether these families have been cut off \nmedical assistance when they are still eligible. We need to know \nwhether or not families have been cut from food stamp assistance even \nwhen they are eligible, and we need to know what the child care \nsituation is. We need to know the status of 2-year-olds and 3-year-\nolds.\n\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment has the support of some 120 \ndifferent organizations: from Catholic Charities USA; Center for \nCommunity Change; Food Research and Action Center; National Center on \nPoverty Law; National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; NETWORK, a \nNational Catholic Social Justice Lobby; YWCA of America--the list goes \non and on--Children's Defense Fund; Women for Reform Judaism. There is \na long list of organizations to which I think all of us give\n\n[[Page S12159]]\n\nsome credibility as important justice organizations.\n  Again, I had a chance to speak about this amendment earlier. I will \njust summarize. Yes, the welfare rolls have been reduced by about half. \nThere are 4.5 million fewer Americans receiving any assistance. But the \ngoal wasn't to basically reduce the welfare rolls; the goal was to \nreduce poverty. There are still some 34-, 35 million poor Americans. \nUnfortunately, some 6.5 million children live in households with \nincomes less than half of the official poverty level. Among one \nsubgroup of our population, the poorest of poor people, poverty has \ngone up.\n  Today, about 20 percent of all the children in our country and about \na third of the children of color under the age of 6 are growing up \npoor. Still today the largest poverty-stricken group of Americans are \nchildren. Still today we have a set of social arrangements that allow \nchildren to be the most poverty-stricken group in our country. I cite \nas evidence, again, some disturbing studies. Families USA says we have \nabout 670,000 fewer people who no longer receive medical coverage \nbecause of the welfare bill; 670,000 citizens no longer receiving any \nmedical assistance because of the welfare bill. We have the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture telling us there has been about a 20- to 25-\npercent drop in food stamp participation, which has been the most \nimportant safety net program for children.\n  In addition, we have any number of different studies--NETWORK, \nCatholic Justice Organization being but one--which point out that most \nof the jobs these mothers are getting pay about $7 an hour. But if they \ndon't have any health care coverage, they are worse off. There are too \nmany examples I can give. Again, I want to make sure we have the data \nabout children, 2 and 3 years old, who are not receiving adequate child \ncare.\n  The question I am asking is embodied in the wording of this \namendment: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the importance \nof determining the economic status of these former recipients.\n  What has happened to these women and children? How are they doing? Is \nthis welfare bill working? We should do some honest policy evaluation. \nToday, at about quarter to 2, we will have a vote on an amendment every \nSenator should support. How can a Senator argue that it isn't important \nto know the economic status of these women and children? I don't see \nthe case against it. I hope we get a strong vote, and then that will \ngive us some momentum for finally moving forward with some legislation \nthat eventually will have some teeth that will, in fact, call for this \nkind of policy evaluation.\n  I say to colleagues I could give many State-by-State examples of ways \nin which I don't think this is working quite the way we want it to. I \nwon't. I could say to Democrats and Republicans that, in some cases, in \nsome communities, there is success; in other cases, in other \ncommunities, what is going on it is rather brutal.\n  I can certainly say to all of my colleagues, in very good faith, we \nneed to understand the drop in food stamp participation; they are so \nimportant to meeting the nutritional needs of children. We need to \nunderstand why so many people have been dropped from medical \nassistance. We need to know whether there is decent child care for \nthese children, and we need to know whether or not these families are \nmoving toward economic independence.\n  It is extremely important that we do this policy evaluation. That is \nall this amendment calls for. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It \nis to get Senators on record with a good, strong vote that we ``express \nthe sense of the Senate regarding the importance of determining the \neconomic status of former recipients of temporary assistance in needy \nfamilies.''\n  Mr. President, I don't know that more needs to be said about this \namendment. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will allow the majority to go to another \namendment and we will reserve the time of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A vote is set for 1:50 on the Wellstone \namendment.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1825\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the promulgation or issuing \n           of any standard relating to ergonomic protection)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1825.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The Department of Labor, through the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration (referred to in this section \n     as ``OSHA'') plans to propose regulations during 1999 to \n     regulate ergonomics in the workplace. A draft of OSHA's \n     ergonomics regulation became available on February 19, 1999.\n       (2) A July 1997 report by the National Institute for \n     Occupational Safety and Health that reviewed epidemiological \n     studies that have been conducted of ``work related \n     musculoskeletal disorders of the neck, upper extremity, and \n     low back'' showed that there is insufficient evidence to \n     assess the level of risk to workers from repetitive motions. \n     Such evidence would be necessary to write an efficient and \n     effective regulation.\n       (3) An August 1998 workshop on ``work related \n     musculoskeletal injuries'' held by the National Academy of \n     Sciences reviewed existing research on musculoskeletal \n     disorders. The workshop showed that there is insufficient \n     evidence to assess the level of risk to workers from \n     repetitive motions.\n       (4) In October 1998, Congress and the President agreed that \n     the National Academy of Sciences should conduct a \n     comprehensive study of the medical and scientific evidence \n     regarding musculoskeletal disorders. The study is intended to \n     evaluate the basic questions about diagnosis and causes of \n     such disorders.\n       (5) To complete that study, Public Law 105-277 appropriated \n     $890,000 for the National Academy of Sciences to complete a \n     peer-reviewed scientific study of the available evidence \n     examining a cause and effect relationship between repetitive \n     tasks in the workplace and musculoskeletal disorders or \n     repetitive stress injuries.\n       (6) The National Academy of Sciences currently estimates \n     that this study will be completed late in 2000 or early in \n     2001.\n       (7) Given the uncertainty and dispute about these basic \n     questions, and Congress' intention that they be addressed in \n     a comprehensive study by the National Academy of Sciences, it \n     is premature for OSHA to propose a regulation on ergonomics \n     as being necessary or appropriate to improve workers' health \n     and safety until such study is completed.\n       (b) Prohibition.--None of the funds made available in this \n     Act may be used by the Secretary of Labor or the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration to promulgate or issue, or \n     to continue the rulemaking process of promulgating or \n     issuing, any standard or regulation regarding ergonomics \n     prior to September 29, 2000.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2270 to Amendment No. 1825\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the promulgation or issuing \n    of any standard, regulation, or guideline relating to ergonomic \n                              protection)\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, the perfecting amendment corrects an error \nin the date in the language we provided in the original amendment.\n  This is an amendment with respect to ergonomics. The issue of \nprotecting employees against workplace injuries is critically \nimportant. We all can and must agree to that. However, we are concerned \nabout the proposed actions of OSHA. Small businesses and concerned \nemployers know that ensuring safe workplaces is critical to their \nemployees and to their businesses. It is in their best interest to \nprotect employees from workplace injury, but they can only accomplish \nthat goal without regulations that are unduly harsh. They need to \nproceed on a basis that is carefully thought out, makes sense, and is \nbased on sound science.\n  Since the 1990s, OSHA has been trying to develop a rule that would \ntell employers what they are supposed to do to protect employees from \nergonomic injuries. But the agency still has no answers to fundamental \nquestions that need to be answered before a regulation can be issued or \nwill be effective. These questions are basic: How much lifting is too \nmuch? How many repetitions are too many? How can an employer determine \nwhat part of an injury is due to workplace factors? And, perhaps most \nimportant: What can an employer do to prevent injuries or to cure an \ninjury that has happened?\n  After all the effort and time OSHA has spent on developing their \nproposal, there is not a single threshold or recommendation contained \nin it. Instead, it basically says to employers. ``We know there's a \nproblem, and we can't figure it out. So we expect you to figure it out \nfor us, and we will inspire you with fines and penalties if you \ndon't.''\n  That doesn't make much sense.\n  As I said before, employers--particularly small businesses--know how \nmuch they can lose in lost time and lost employees through ergonomic \ninjuries. They want help and good guidance. They don't want to say: \nTake your best guess and we will fine you if you are wrong. That is no \nway to do business.\n  The amendment I propose today delays the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration's (OSHA) proposed standard on ergonomic \nprotection until the essential scientific research to support this \nstandard has been completed. Sound science to support a sound safety \nstandard.\n  Some opponents have tried to deflect attention from the flaws and \nlack of scientific basic for OSHA's proposal by mischaracterizing this \namendment as ``anti-women.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. \nTo use the words of several women construction business owners \nrepresenting the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC): \n``Safety has no gender.''\n  We all want to promote safe and healthy workplaces. To date, \nvoluntary efforts by the business community have led to a 17 percent \ndecline in repetitive stress injuries over the past 3 years, according \nto the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This includes a 29 percent decline \nin carpal tunnel syndrome cases and a 28 percent decline in tendinitis \ncases--two of the most commonly cited ergonomic injuries. Such injuries \nmake up just 4 percent of all workplace injuries and illnesses.\n  There are too many. We need to do better. But we need to do so based \non sound science so employers, and particularly small businesses, will \nknow what reasonable standards they should meet so they can protect \ntheir employees, which they, I believe, not only want to do but which \nis in their economic self-interest to do.\n  Despite this decline in ergonomic injuries, OSHA is on a rampage to \nimpose new mandates with no clear thresholds or guidance to address the \ncauses of these injuries. This irresponsible behavior helps no \nemployee--woman or man.\n  Some proponents of OSHA's ergonomics standard have argued that \nbecause many large companies have been able to spend significant \nresources of time and money to solve ergonomic problems in their \nworkplaces, all employers should now be required to do this. The \nproblem with using these examples as the basis of a regulation is that \neach one of these companies approached the problem differently, and was \nable to address the problem in a way that made sense for them in their \nworkplace and in their business with their employees. It does not \nfollow from these examples that OSHA should seek to impose on all \nemployers a regulation that will have to fit a wide variety of \ncompanies. There is a vast difference between Ford Motor Company being \nable to implement an ergonomics program and a small business being able \nto hire the necessary consultants, purchase the necessary equipment, \nand possibly redesign its processes to address ergonomic questions.\n  OSHA'a ergonomics rule is different from all other OSHA regulations \nthat establish a threshold for exposure to a specific hazard and then \ntell the employer that if an employee exceeds that threshold, certain \nmeasures must be taken, or exposure must be reduced.\n  Because of this vagueness of OSHA's proposed standard, and the impact \nit would have on small businesses which would be forced to comply with \nit, I introduced the Sensible Ergonomics Needs Scientific Evidence \nAct--the SENSE Act--S. 1070 on May 18 of this year.\n  The amendment I offer today is fundamentally the same as that bill. \nIt is simple and direct--it tells OSHA that it may not proceed with \npublishing a proposed rule on ergonomics until after fiscal year 2000. \nWhy?\n  Because by that time National Academy of Sciences is expected to have \ncompleted a study that Congress and the President agreed upon last \nyear. This study is intended to determine whether there is sufficient \nevidence to answer those questions I just laid out and to support a \nregulation on ergonomics.\n  We agreed to pay $890,000 for a study. As I said, Congress agreed, \nand the President signed it. If we are to disregard that, we waste the \nmoney, and we don't get the benefit of the investigation that has been \ngoing on during this period of time and is expected to make a sound \nbasis for proceeding in a scientific manner to do something about \nworkplace ergonomic injuries. But if OSHA publishes its proposal first, \nthat is a classic example of what I have described as the bureaucracy's \ndesire for, ready, fire, and aim. You need to figure out what you need \nto accomplish, and how you can do it before you start out and do it.\n  My amendment would not preclude OSHA from continuing its study of \nthis issue, and I urgently call on the agency\n\n[[Page S12161]]\n\nto redouble its efforts, especially in light of the report of the SBA \nChief Counsel for Advocacy, which I received last week.\n  That report is very critical of OSHA's estimates outlined in the \nagency's Preliminary Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the proposed \nergonomics standard. In fact, the report concludes that ``OSHA's \nestimates of the benefits of the proposed standard may be significantly \noverstated.'' In other words, this standard may not help employees--\nwomen and men--as much as OSHA would have us believe.\n  Equally troubling is the report's conclusion that the cost of the \nergonomics standard to all businesses could be as much as 15 times more \nthan what OSHA estimates. Moreover, the report emphasizes that the cost \nof the ergonomics standard could be as much as 10 times higher for \nsmall businesses than for large companies.\n  So for what a large company would have to do for employees, if it had \nto pay $1,000 per employee, a small business might have to pay $10,000 \nper employee. Those are some pretty significant margins of error. If \nthis rule goes forward, small business, once again, is left holding the \nbag.\n  The report also points out that ``a small business is not simply a \nlarge business with fewer employees. Many factors affect how a standard \nmay impact a small business much differently than a large business.'' \nIt goes on to discuss the fact that small businesses often have higher \nemployee turnover rates meaning that any training requirement will have \na more significant impact on the small firm than the large one.\n  For women business owners, the cost issue is particularly worrisome. \nAs AGC's women construction business owners put it: ``Women-owned \ncompanies are the fastest growing sector of our economy. Unfortunately, \nburdensome regulations are a barrier to women starting their own \nbusinesses. Often, these regulations discourage women from starting a \nnew business or expanding an existing one.''\n  Mr. President, one thing is very clear--this is an extremely \ncomplicated issue. And we must have more reliable cost and benefit \nestimates--not to mention sound science and thorough medical evidence--\nbefore we push the Nation's small businesses into another maze of \nredtape.\n  If there are regulations which are burdensome but which are necessary \non the basis of sound science to protect against ergonomic injuries, \nthen let OSHA set them out. Let everybody abide by those standards. But \nwhen we don't even know what best medical and scientific evidence \nprovides, why are we going forward down a blind alley with nothing but \na huge cost at the other end?\n  Employees have a right to expect regulations will achieve realistic \nbenefits to them--not exaggerated lofty goals that miss the mark and \nhelp no one.\n  Let me be clear about something. When you talk to workers who are in \nbusinesses or in jobs where they do lifting and work, they are very \nmuch concerned about their medical care.\n  They are very much concerned about their pension. They are also \nconcerned about their job.\n  We are talking about something that could be a job killer. If we are \ntelling this employee--because we have issued a standard without \nscientific basis--the cost may be so great that your employer can't \nafford to continue to hire you, what favor have we done that employee? \nIf she is put out of work because the unknown requirements of a very \nexpensive regulation are too much for the employer to bear, that woman \ncould lose her job and lose the means of livelihood in the name of \nlessening ergonomic injuries, without any proof that they do so.\n  Let me stress again, we all agree in protecting employees from \nworkplace injuries, it is extremely important. That is something we \nmust do, we must assure. Employers want employees to be safe. If your \nmother, father, sister, or brother is working in a job with lifting or \nrepetitive motions, the employers want them to be safe. However, small \nfirms cannot accomplish the goal of worker protection through ill-\nconceived and poorly supported proposals such as OSHA's ergonomic \nstandard which has such potential burden for small business. If the \nburdens are too high, the business may not survive.\n  As I indicated earlier, this has been a concern that women-owned \nbusinesses have shared. If a business folds, there are no employees to \nprotect. Where is the sense in that? OSHA is doing everything in its \npower to get its proposal published soon. The House passed legislation \non this issue, the Workplace Preservation Act, H.R. 987, by a vote of \n217-209. I think it is time for the Senate to add its voice to the call \nfor OSHA to act responsibly, to act dispassionately, but to act in good \nscience.\n  To summarize: We don't have the science; we don't have the medical \nevidence; we don't have accurate cost figures; we don't know the \nbenefits to employees; and we don't know what works in preventing \ninjuries. Moreover, OSHA doesn't know those either. All we have is a \npotentially burdensome standard that small businesses, whether owned by \na woman or a man, can ill afford.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to make certain that \nOSHA's ergonomic standard is based on sound science and ensure that we \nare protecting men and women in the workplace. I hope we can get a \nreasonable time agreement so views on both sides can be expressed and \nwe can proceed to a vote on this very important amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek to propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest for a time limit. I have already had some informal indications \nthat Members on the other side of the aisle intend to speak at some \nlength. I will propound a request for consent when the manager returns \nto the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. For a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to propound a question. Does the Senator from \nPennsylvania not understand, the complexity of this issue virtually \nprohibits a time agreement? We will continue the debate until it is \nfully explored.\n  I think the Senator from Pennsylvania and Senator from Missouri are \nforewarned: Bringing an issue of this complexity to the floor invites a \nlengthy debate regarding worker safety, and we will object to a time \nlimit.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This Senator does not understand how this matter--for \nthat matter, any matter--is so complicated as not to be subject to a \ntime agreement. We are all here under time limitations. I only have 5 \nyears 3 months left on my term, for example. We all have some time \nlimitations.\n  I think it is possible to have a time agreement. However, if the \nother side intends to talk at length--I do not want to inject the word \n``filibuster'' into the discussion, but if the other side wishes to \ntalk at length and is unwilling to enter into a time agreement, I do \nunderstand that; I do not understand that any matter is so complicated \nas to preclude a time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will speak since I have the floor and I am manager of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been the subject of very contentious \ndebate for years. Last year in the conference committee in the House \nand Senate, we debated at great length; the year before, we debated at \ngreat length. There is no doubt about emotions running high.\n  The subject of ergonomics is an effort to have some way to stop \nrepetitious motions which cause physical injury to workers. Many of the \nbig companies have adopted procedures which will protect their \nemployees because it is cost effective to do so in the long run. Small \nbusinesses face a little different situation, which I understand. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Small Business Committee has offered this \namendment. I understand the point he is making.\n  I point out that there have been many studies on the issue. In 1998, \na peer review of the National Academy of Sciences involving 85 of the \nworld's leading ergonomic experts found ``research clearly \ndemonstrates'' that specific interventions can reduce or prevent \nmusculoskeletal disorders. The 6-month study answered the same seven \nquestions the National Academy of Sciences is now reviewing.\n  A 1997 review by NIOSH of 600 studies produced the same result and \nfound that ergonomic solutions were being successfully applied in many \nwork settings. During last year's negotiations,\n\n[[Page S12162]]\n\nCongress and the administration agreed, by funding the study, they did \nnot intend to delay OSHA's ruling. House Appropriations Chairman \nLivingston and ranking member Obey--I think, on the record--made it \nclear that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jack \nLew, also concurred. We have had a letter from the Secretary of Labor \nwith a veto threat. That is not unusual.\n\n  However, I believe there is a balance which can be obtained to \nprotect workers and not to unduly burden businesses, including small \nbusinesses. That is why, as chairman of the subcommittee involved in \nthe conference for several years, I have tried to work this out so we \ncan find a way not to overburden small business and at the same time to \nprotect workers from these musculoskeletal problems.\n  Right now, the Office of Management and Budget has the regulation and \nwe do not know what form it will finally take. But someday we have to \ncome to grips with the issue and stop studying it. Studies are very \nimportant to find out what the facts are, and then we must act on the \nfacts. When studies are used to interminably delay, it doesn't become a \nstudy; it is a filibuster by study on one side, as it is filibuster by \nan assertion that it is too complicated, too intricate, to be able to \ncome to grips with it and decide.\n  We are sent here to try to decide the issues. It is my hope we can \ndebate the facts, try to understand what the underlying issues are, and \nthen try to find a consensus on public policy. At some date, we will \nhave to go ahead and act one way or another on the protection of the \nworkers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by the \nmanager of the bill, and I also understand the Senate lingo that means \nif we offer this amendment, you will filibuster. That disappoints me \ngreatly.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be a cosponsor of the Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank and compliment the Senator from Missouri for \noffering this amendment. It is needed. This amendment is needed because \nthe administration is getting ready to promulgate some regulations in \nthe near future that will cost hundreds of millions, if not billions, \nof dollars for American industry. When I say American industry, I am \ntalking about small business, as well as, big business. I am talking \nabout an unbelievably complex set of regulations and there is no \ntelling how much it will cost to implement these regulations.\n\n  These regulations consist of how many motions you should make. That \nif you do more than a certain amount, then maybe that is not safe; or \nif you lift something, it cannot be lifted more than this number of \ntimes, or it will be too heavy or too stressful. OSHA and the \nDepartment of Labor try to make these very regulations and at the same \ntime they say they honestly do not know what they are doing, so in many \ncases they will wait until laborers complain and then they will try to \ncome up with regulations to alleviate their pain. These methods are not \nsuccessful.\n  We have in fact already addressed this issue. The Senate houses the \nCongressional Research Service, a nonpartisan group, to research \ncomplex issues. There is a CRS study that was updated August 31, 1999. \nI will read from a copy of this report that addresses further ergonomic \nregulation:\n\n       Due to the wide variety of circumstances, however, any \n     comprehensive standard would probably have to be complex and \n     costly, while scientific understanding of the problem is not \n     complete.\n       It would be costly, it would be complex, and, frankly, it \n     would not be understandable. It would not be workable.\n       The state of scientific knowledge about ergonomics--and \n     especially the role of non-work and psychological factors in \n     producing observed syndromes--has become a key issue in the \n     debate over how OSHA should proceed.\n       Even if the problem were fully understood, the wide variety \n     of circumstances will bedevil efforts to frame simple cost-\n     effective rules. What are called ``ergonomic'' injuries are \n     actually a range of distinct problems, much as ``cancer'' is \n     not one but a family of diseases.\n\n  Throughout the summary of this report, the point is that, due to a \nlot of circumstances, any comprehensive rules would have to be complex \nand costly while scientific understanding of the problem is not \ncomplete.\n  What about a scientific study? Why don't we ask the scientists? If \nCongress' research arm says this is going to be costly, we do not have \nthe scientific basis to do it, why don't we have scientific basis? Why \ndon't we ask the experts to take a look at it and see if there is \nsomething they can come up with that would be workable?\n  Well, we did do that. Last year, Congress passed and almost every \nMember of this body, or the majority of the Members of both Houses of \nCongress, passed a bill that funded $900,000 for the National Academy \nof Sciences to complete a study and review the scientific literature as \nmandated by Congress and the President on ergonomics. They have not \ncompleted that study. They should complete the study in about a year, \nJanuary 2001; in 13 or 14 months.\n  We are spending almost a million dollars on the study to ask the \nscientists to do an in-depth review. Yet many people say they want OSHA \nto go forth and come up with these complex rules in spite of the \nunfinished study. They are saying that they trust OSHA to come up with \nrules and regulations without this study, without the basis for making \nsuch rules? You talk about repetitive motions--OSHA often tells \ncompanies that they may possibly be doing something wrong and a company \ncould ask OSHA whether or not they are in violation of certain \nstandards and OSHA would reply: ``We don't know.''\n  These standards are almost impossible to define. What is repetitive \nmotion? Standing at a machine on the job for 8 hours a day--that is \nergonomic--is that too much? I grew up in a machine shop. I grew up in \nNickles Machine Corporation. We lifted and moved a lot of heavy \nequipment. There is no way in the world some Federal bureaucrat knows \nwhat is the proper amount of weight that individuals should be moving \naround. There is no way to create a uniform standard that applies to \neach individual.\n\n  Are they going to come in and supervise and say: You should not be \nstanding there for that period of time? Maybe you should not be working \nat your computer for this amount of time. Maybe you should not be \nengaged in moving heavy objects.\n  We are going to have the heavy hand of the Federal Government, \nFederal bureaucrats running all across the country trying to make those \nkinds of determinations, saying: If you do not comply with our infinite \nwisdom, we are going to fine you. We are going to close you down. \nAmazing. It is amazing that we would do such a thing.\n  The proposed regulations by OSHA are not workable. They are \nunbelievably complex. Anybody who has looked at them from a standpoint \nof real-life experience in the workforce agrees that this is not \nworkable. So what have we done if we succeed with this amendment? We \nhave passed restrictions keeping this administration from going forward \non this enormously complex, expensive, regulatory scheme.\n  Last year, we said let's have this study, let's let this study go \nforward; let's look at real scientific facts before we implement a \nstandard that could cost billions of dollars, and no telling how many \njobs would be lost as a result. Let's let that happen. I regret that \nthis was not already included in the committee bill.\n  I think most people will acknowledge we have a majority vote on this. \nWe have the votes to do this. We have Democrats and Republicans who \nwill support this amendment. We have a majority; we have a majority \nvote in the House as well. Now we have this implied senatorial \ndiscussion: If you have this amendment, due to its complexity, we will \ndiscuss it for a long time; i.e. we will filibuster this amendment. We \nwill not let this bill pass. We don't care if we bring down the largest \nappropriations bill, that deals with Education, Labor, Health and a \nmultitude of Governmental agencies--we don't care if we bring down the \nwhole thing.\n  Why? Because organized labor wants this rule to go forward. I guess \nif the leadership of AFL/CIO wants this rule to go forward, we should \nabsolutely let it go forward. That is what a few people are saying, \nalthough masked with niceties, in senatorial discussion: If\n\n[[Page S12163]]\n\nyou insist on a vote on this amendment, we are going to talk for a long \ntime and not let this bill pass.\n  As I said, we passed related legislation in 1998. We authorized the \nstudy I previously mentioned, to look deeper into the problems \nemployees and industry face. Let's let the study work. Let's find out \nwhat the scientists have to say. Let's listen to the experts.\n  We had a couple of congressional hearings regarding this very issue. \nThe following was concluded from a hearing in 1997:\n\n       Any attempt to construct an ergonomic standard as a remedy \n     for regional musculoskeletal injuries in the workplace is not \n     just premature, it is likely to be counterproductive in its \n     application and enforcement.\n\n  It is likely to be counterproductive. Does this give unions a chance \nto file complaints for harassment purposes? Has anybody thought of \nthat? Of course they have. Does this increase people's leverage? ``If \nyou work with us, maybe, a little bit, we will not be quite as vigorous \nin our complaints.'' Is this what we really want?\n  Another statement was made by Dr. Stephen Atcheson and others with \nthe American Medical Association:\n\n       The debate concerning whether certain occupations actually \n     cause repetitive motion disorders is now well over a century \n     old and far from settled.\n\n  This is complex business. You are talking about movements and actions \nin the workforce, and there are an unlimited number of movements and \nactions. Now we are going to have that regulated by the Federal \nGovernment? We are going to turn loose the Department of Labor, OSHA, \nto come up with regulations that have the force and the power to fine \nand assess and have bureaucrats telling people how to operate their \nbusinesses? As if people running those businesses could care less about \ntheir employees?\n  The whole premise of this regulation is Government knows best; \nemployers certainly don't care about their employees--which I do not \nbelieve. I have been an employer. You show me an employer who doesn't \ncare about his employees, and I will show you somebody who is going out \nof business in a very short period of time and probably deservedly so. \nIt is this presumption-- the Government knows best; we need Government \nas the caretaker for business operations--that I think is absurd. And \nwe trust some bureaucrat in OSHA, who probably knows nothing about a \nparticular operation, to come in and say: Here is how you should run \nyour business. We know better than the people that have been managing \nthat plant, working in that plant for years. There is no telling how \nmuch it will cost. No telling how many jobs will be lost, the costs \nthat could be imposed, the costs that could result from unfair, \nunworkable regulations.\n  I compliment my colleague from Missouri, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Bond amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to be brief because other \ncolleagues are going to speak, and then I will come back later as we go \nforward in this debate.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side, what Senator Durbin from \nIllinois said is right on the mark. As ranking minority member on the \nLabor Committee, now called HELP, which has jurisdiction over OSHA and \noccupational health and safety issues which are very important to \nworking people, I have a lot to say about this amendment. What I will \nsay, as this debate goes forward, will be substantive, and it will be \nimportant in determining how all of us vote. This is an incredibly \nimportant issue.\n  I will start out for a few brief minutes right now and then turn it \nover to other colleagues. I will come back later as this debate \ndevelops.\n  This Bond amendment will basically stop OSHA from doing its job, \nwhich is the mission of the mandate of keeping American workers from \ngetting injured at work. It basically stops OSHA from doing its job, \nand OSHA's job is to prevent workers from being injured at work.\n  This amendment will shut down the normal rulemaking process and stop \nOSHA from doing anything at all about ergonomic job hazards that are \nseriously injuring over 600,000 workers every year. That is a statistic \nmy colleagues do not like to talk about. I have heard the arguments \nabout bureaucrats and big government and all of the rest, but we ought \nnot be too generous with the suffering of others. We are talking about \n600,000 workers who are seriously injured every year. That is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  Ergonomic injuries are serious injuries from repetitive motions, \noverexertion, and physical stress. They include carpal tunnel syndrome, \nback injuries, and tendonitis. The amendment before us will stop OSHA \nfrom issuing a standard to prevent these injuries until the National \nAcademy of Sciences completes a new study which will take somewhere \nbetween 18 to 24 months. This amendment will stop OSHA from issuing not \nonly a regulation, but even voluntary guidelines or standards. This \namendment is an extreme amendment, extremely harsh in its impact on \nworking people.\n  Last week, Secretary of Labor Herman wrote that she would recommend a \nveto of S. 1650 if this amendment is adopted. By the way, I also say to \nmy colleagues, the reason Senator Durbin was right in what he said \nearlier--that this debate will take some time--is because it is \nimportant to put a focus on the people and their lives and who is going \nto be affected by this.\n  With all due respect, quite often--and this particular case is a \nperfect example--when we talk about OSHA or NIOSH, when we talk about \noccupational health and safety, we are talking about a group of \nAmericans who are rarely in the Senate or the House. These are not in \nthe main, our sons or daughters. These are not in the main, our \nbrothers or sisters or our parents. In fact, I think if they were, this \namendment would not even be before the Senate. I do not want to lose \nsight of about whom we are talking.\n  There are four points I want to make as this debate develops. I will \nnot develop any of these points right now, but I will mention them.\n  First, I want to spend some time later on talking about the people, \nreal people who are affected by this debate. As we speak, there are \nworkers who are injured needlessly because of the continuing efforts by \nthis Congress, as represented by the Bond amendment, to keep OSHA from \ndoing its job. These are real people with real health problems who are \nhurt at the workplace with disabling injuries. I want to spend a lot of \ntime talking about who these people are. I want to present stories. I \nwant to talk about these people in the most personal terms possible so \nwe know what is at stake.\n  Second, I want to make the case that something can be done to stop \npeople from being injured in this way, from stopping these physically \ndisabling injuries, from stopping the pain. There is no need to wait \nanother 2 years for another study. We do not need another study to show \nthat ergonomic hazards cause injuries and these injuries can be \nprevented. We already know it. There are already reams of scientific \nevidence to prove it, and one more review of the scientific literature \nis not going to change anything. Later on in this debate, I will talk \nabout the studies that have already taken place and what their \nconclusions are, all of which say we need to go forward right now.\n  Third, I want to dispel the mistaken impression among some Senators \nthat a deal was worked out last year whereby OSHA would delay this \nrulemaking until the National Academy of Sciences completes its second \nstudy. Actually, that appears to be just the opposite of what happened.\n  According to the parties involved in those negotiations, there was an \nunderstanding that this new NAS study would not prevent OSHA from going \nforward. There was a clear understanding that this new NAS study would \nnot prevent OSHA from going forward.\n  Finally, I want to make it clear that the issue is not the substance \nof OSHA's proposal. There is already a process in place for addressing \nany criticisms or any modifications that Senators and others may have. \nIt is the same rulemaking process that is used for any other \nregulation: Interested parties are encouraged to comment and suggest \nchanges. Criticisms or quibbles with OSHA's current proposal should not \nbe used as an excuse to stop OSHA from doing anything whatsoever, and \nthat is exactly what is happening. This\n\n[[Page S12164]]\n\nergonomic standard has been delayed for far too long.\n\n  It was first proposed in 1990 by then-Secretary of Labor Elizabeth \nDole. I will go back through that history as well, but I will conclude \nright now by saying that this amendment just shuts down the normal \nrulemaking process. It stops OSHA from doing its job. It does not speak \nto the 600,000 workers right now who are being injured and who are \nstruggling because, in fact, we do not have ergonomic job standards. \nThese injuries are serious injuries. They are disabling injuries. \nSurely, we can take action right now.\n  This is all about working people. It is all about making sure there \nis some safety at the workplace. It is all about our responsibility to \nmove forward with a standard that will provide some protection. It is \nall about making sure OSHA is not gutted. It is all about making sure \nthis amendment, which I view as a direct threat to many hard-working \npeople, does not go forward.\n  Yes, we are here to debate this. My colleague, Senator Durbin, is \nready to speak. Senator Harkin is going to speak. Senator Kennedy will \nbe here. And later on in the debate, I will come back and lay out story \nafter story of families that will be affected by this amendment. I will \ntalk about what this means in personal terms. I will talk about all the \nstudies that have already taken place and what the science clearly \nsuggests to us. We will have a major debate on this. I have no doubt \nthe vast majority of people in this country expect the Senate to be on \nthe side of providing some decent protection for hard-working \nAmericans. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bond \namendment, and I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my understanding there are a \nnumber of colleagues on both sides of the aisle who want to speak on \nthe amendment. I ask unanimous consent that we limit the debate to 1 \nhour on this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will speak for a moment about why I \nthink this amendment is so important.\n  When I travel through Arkansas and with the opportunities I have had \nto be in other parts of the country where we have had hearings on \nworkforce protections, one of the complaints I hear so frequently from \nmy constituents is that regulatory agencies in general exceed the \nauthority that has been delegated by the Congress. One of the \nfrustrations I hear expressed from so many small businesspeople and \nothers is: If you in the Senate and the House are the ones elected by \nus to represent us, why do these regulatory agencies seem to go off on \ntheir own, contrary to what you have expressed in legislation?\n  It is a question that is always difficult to answer. Frankly, too \noften we have allowed, whether it be OSHA or the IRS, regulatory \nagencies to exceed their statutory authority, and we have done an \ninsufficient job in reining in what they are doing.\n  In this particular case, I think we see exactly that. OSHA is an \nagency to which we have delegated power. It seems to be determined to \nextend its regulatory power in a negative way through the imminent \nimplementation of this ergonomic standard, regardless of that \nstandard's effectiveness in protecting workers or its cost to American \nindustry.\n  So, yes, there is an issue of safety; yes, there is an issue of cost; \nand, yes, there is an issue of what is the scientific basis for what \nOSHA is propounding to do.\n  So often what we find regulatory agencies doing ends up having \nunintended consequences which the Congress must go back and try to \nrectify at some later date or which results in a reversal of the \nrulemaking process in these various agencies.\n  We have already heard, in evidence presented on the floor of the \nSenate today, that there is concern that a premature ergonomic standard \ncould have counterproductive consequences.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you are concerned about the health and \nwelfare of the American workplace, if you are concerned about the \nsafety of the American worker, then let's be sure that when OSHA \nimplements a rule, they do so with a sound scientific basis for what \nthey are doing.\n  Now, I don't know. If we can't count on the nonpartisan, highly \nrespected Congressional Research Service, then who do we look to? That \nis why we pay them. That is why we have established them. They are \nwell-respected. This is what they said. Senator Nickles earlier quoted \npart of the CRS report. Let me quote an additional part of what they \nsaid. They said:\n\n       . . . because of the wide variety of tasks, equipment, \n     stresses and injuries involved, any comprehensive standard \n     would probably have to be complex and costly.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       . . . ergonomics is a difficult issue because, while there \n     is substantial evidence of a problem, it is very complex and \n     only partially understood.\n\n  I think it is not prudent to move forward with a rule when the CRS \nhas concluded the issue is complex and we do not understand it. It is \nonly partially understood. How can you implement a rule that is in the \nbest interest of the American worker, much less the American economy, \nif we do not understand what the problem is and we can only acknowledge \nit is partially understood and it is complex?\n  As an example, the CRS cites that while a whole ``host of new \nproducts and services have become popular--such as back braces and \nnewly designed keyboards--there is little in the way of scientific \nevidence about whether they do any good.''\n  What the opponents of this amendment are suggesting is that though we \ndo not understand the issue, though it is acknowledged to be complex, \nthough the CRS says we have a host of new products and services out \nthere but there is no scientific evidence as to whether they do any \ngood or not, we should nonetheless give the green light for OSHA to \nmove ahead in a rulemaking process without substantial scientific basis \nfor that rule.\n  Proponents of the ergonomics standard claim this issue has been \nadequately studied, if not overstudied--and that is what my friend and \ncolleague from Minnesota was just saying--but it is simply not the \ncase.\n  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, \nafter conducting an extensive review of the literature, stated that \nthere are ``huge, fundamental gaps in our understanding'' which ``make \nit clear how little we really know about ergonomics.''\n  So those who would say, well, we have studied it--we have studied it \nand studied it--we have studied it enough, so let's go ahead with the \nrule, they are ignoring the basic conclusion, the overwhelming \nconclusion of the evidence and the literature on this issue, which \nconcludes we simply do not understand ergonomics.\n  There are ``huge, fundamental gaps in our understanding.''\n  To my colleagues, I say it is for that reason that the Congress \nwisely, I believe, last year, in the omnibus appropriations bill, \nappropriated $890,000 so that we could fill those huge, fundamental \ngaps in our understanding concerning the issue of ergonomics--$890,000 \nfor a more thorough review of literature by the National Academy of \nSciences, a thorough study by the NAS, which, if there is a more \nrespected group than the CRS, certainly in the area of science, it \nwould be the NAS.\n  We want a rule, but we want a rule to be based upon good science, not \nsomething that is moved forward without adequate study and without \nadequate scientific basis, that could have negative impacts upon \nworkers, and certainly will have negative impacts upon the workplace \nand the economics of the workplace.\n  Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that we authorized, we spent, we \nappropriated $890,000, OSHA has refused to wait for the results of that \nstudy. They already released a discussion draft of the ergonomic \nstandard in February of this year.\n  I simply find it inexplicable why OSHA cannot wait for this \ndefinitive study to be completed. To me, it does not seem prudent to \nrush to judgment. To me, it does not seem prudent to rush to implement \na rule without knowing exactly what the consequence\n\n[[Page S12165]]\n\nof that rule would be, how much it would help workers, or how much it \nmight hurt workers, or exactly how much of a burden it would be to \nbusinesses. We do not know the answers to those questions. We need to \nknow the answers before we allow OSHA to move forward with the rule.\n\n  Finally, I do not know that I can justify to my constituents in \nArkansas, and to the average Arkansas worker who makes a median income \nof $27,000, how the Federal Government effectively wasted $890,000 of \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars by not even waiting for the completion of \nthis study.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to adopt the Bond amendment and make \nOSHA await the outcome of the NAS study so they can devise an \nergonomics standard that will be effective in protecting American \nworkers without unnecessarily burdening American businesses.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I rise in opposition to the amendment of my friend from \nMissouri and the Chairman of the Small Business Committee. I heard not \nall but most of the opening comments by the offerer of the amendment, \nSenator Bond. What I heard mostly was the concerns expressed by Senator \nBond regarding its impact on small businesses.\n  While I happen to serve on the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond \nis the chairman of that committee. It goes without saying that Senator \nBond has had a long and intense interest in the impact of rules and \nregulations on small businesses. I think I can say without fear of \ncontradiction that Senator Bond has done a very good job in protecting \nand defending the rights of small businesses. Quite frankly, I believe \nI have, too, and others on the committee. I can understand Senator \nBond's concern, legitimate concern about what would happen with the \nsmall businesses.\n  In that regard, I support his thrust in terms of making sure that we \ndo not impact unduly on small businesses and that we fulfill our \nobligation to ensure that small businesses get the support whatever it \nmight be, to help change and redesign a workplace that would be \ninjurious to workers suffering from ergonomic types of illnesses.\n  To say that it would have an impact on small businesses does not mean \nwe can't do anything about it because I think we have an obligation to \nprotect the health and the safety and the welfare of the workers of \nthis country. Whether they work for IBM or General Motors or whether \nthey work for a small concern that employs five people, I believe we \nhave an obligation to be concerned about their health and their safety.\n  Obviously, we also have an obligation to be concerned about the small \nbusinesses in this country. That is why I say, to the extent we can, we \nbetter be prepared to help small businesses to cut down on the \nillnesses and injuries to workers from musculoskeletal disorders and \nthe results of ergonomic illnesses.\n  So again, I hope this is not just the reason someone might vote \nagainst this, because of the impact on small businesses; think about \nthe impact on the workers, what is happening to workers out there.\n  I would also like to point out that if a small business has no \nworkers with work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), is not in \nmanufacturing and does not have workers with significant handling \nduties, that small business doesn't have to do a thing. Millions of \nsmall businesses (drycleaners, banks, advertising agencies, shoe \nrepair) will have no obligation to comply unless a worker gets \nhurt. Then let us have a meeting of the minds to do both. Let's protect \nour workers, and then meet our obligation to help small businesses. It \nseems to me this is the way to go.\n\n  I know the Senator from Illinois has been waiting to speak, but let \nme also comment upon the fact that Senator Bond had said something \nabout women-owned businesses, that women-owned businesses will be at \nrisk. Quite frankly, women are at risk.\n  Here is a study done on ergonomics, called A Women's Issue, from the \nDepartment of Labor. The title says: Who is at Risk? Women experienced \n33 percent of all serious workplace injuries--those who required time \noff of work--in 1997, but they suffered 63 percent of repetitive motion \ninjuries, including 91 percent of injuries resulting from repetitive \ntyping or keying and 61 percent from repetitive placing. Women \nexperienced 62 percent of work-related cases of tendonitis and 70 \npercent of carpal tunnel syndrome cases. So this is a women's issue. It \nis women who are suffering more from repetitive injury diseases and \nillnesses than men are. We should keep that in mind.\n  Secondly, we hear about doing a study and that we shouldn't \npromulgate or have these rules prior to the study being done. Well, \nfirst of all, for the record, there is no new study being done. The \nstudy being done by the National Academy of Sciences, which is referred \nto often, is just a study or a review of existing literature. They are \nnot conducting any new research. All of the literature being reviewed \nby the National Academy of Sciences is already available to OSHA. The \nstudy the NAS is doing is a review of all the existing studies. We have \nstudied this issue to death. There have been more than 2,000 ergonomic \nstudies, and there have been 600 epidemiological studies done on \nergonomics. We have more than enough information to move ahead in \nprotecting workers. The study we keep hearing about is simply a study \nof all the studies. Let us keep that in mind.\n  We have been a long time in this rulemaking process. We have had over \n8 years of study. I think it is well to note, too, the first Secretary \nof Labor who committed the agency to issuing an ergonomic standard. It \nwas then-Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who committed the agency to \nissuing an ergonomic standard. We have been studying it ever since.\n  Also, keep in mind, no rule has been issued, not even a proposed \nrule. Again, that is all we are talking about, letting OSHA go ahead \nwith a proposed rule. That is not the end of it. Once the proposal is \nissued, the public, people on all sides of the debate will have ample \nopportunity to comment on the proposal.\n  Lastly, this really does kind of break the agreement we had last \nyear. Our word is our bond around this place. If we don't keep our \nword, this place disintegrates. Last year, we had an agreement made \nwith the House Members, Congressman Livingston, who at that time was \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, and David Obey, who was the \nranking member. They signed a letter dated October 19, 1998. What they \nsaid was: We understand that OSHA intends to issue a proposed rule on \nergonomics late in the summer of 1999. We are writing to make clear \nthat by funding the NAS study, it is in no way our intent to block or \ndelay issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule on ergonomics. It was signed \nby Chairman Livingston and ranking member Obey.\n\n  I happen to be a member of the Appropriations Committee. Obviously, \nwe are on an appropriations bill. I was involved in the discussions on \nthat last year. The agreement was made to go ahead and let the National \nAcademy of Sciences do a review--that is all it is; it is not a new \nstudy--of the studies that have already been done.\n  Let's keep that in mind; this is not a new study. During that time, \nOSHA was not prevented from going ahead and issuing a proposed rule--\nnot a final rule, a proposed rule, which I have pointed out, then, \nallows everyone to have their input and allows us in Congress to see \nit. Again, people talked about this study, and we had this agreement. \nWe should live up to the agreement.\n  They talk about the cost. Here is a whole packet--I will have them \nhere if anybody wants to read them--of ergonomic changes made by \ncompanies, both large and small, to help reduce the significance and \nthe number of injuries. These are what companies on their own did.\n  One caught my eye. This is from Sun Microsystems. They make computer \nequipment and systems in California. Problem: In 1993, the average \nwork-related musculoskeletal disorder disability claim was $45,000 to \n$55,000. The solution: Sun Microsystems purchased ergonomic chairs and \nprovided education and work station assessments to all who requested \nthem. The company also encouraged workers to adopt proper posture while \nworking with computers. The impact: The average \nrepetitive-strain-injury-related claim dropped from $45,000 to $55,000 \nin 1993 to $3,500 in 1997.\n\n[[Page S12166]]\n\n  Does it work? Yes, it does. It works well. We ought to get on with \nit. Let OSHA issue their proposed rule. These delays hurt workers. More \nthan 600,000 workers lose work each year because of ergonomic-related \ninjuries. These are our cashiers, nurses, cleaning staff, assembly \nworkers in manufacturing and processing plants, computer users, \nclerical staff, truck drivers, and meat cutters.\n  This amendment should be defeated because the workers of this country \ndeserve to have their health and their safety protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond.\n  During the course of this debate, we will hear many terms, which \nsound technical in nature, about the issue at hand. It has been \ndescribed as ergonomics, musculoskeletal disorders. I think we ought to \ntry to get this down to the real-world level of what this debate \nconcerns.\n  I have before me a study from the Centers for Disease Control and the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services relative to this \nparticular problem. They state, early in the study, the term \n``musculoskeletal disorders'' refers to conditions that involve the \nnerves, tendons, muscles, and supporting structures of the body.\n  Another definition says: Ergonomic injuries have many names. They are \ncalled musculoskeletal disorders, repetitive stress injuries, \ncumulative trauma disorders, or just simply strains and sprains. These \ninjuries occur when there is a mismatch between the physical \nrequirements of a job and the physical capacity of a worker.\n  I wanted to make sure we said that at the outset, so those who are \nfollowing this debate will understand that what is at issue is not a \nhighly technical, scientific issue but something that every one of us \nwho do manual chores at home or at the workplace understands. If you \nsit there and have to peel a bag of potatoes, when it is all over your \nhand is a little sore. What if you had to peel a bag of potatoes every \nhalf hour, 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week, 12 months a year? How would \nyour hands react to it? That is what we are talking about--ergonomics; \nmusculoskeletal disorders.\n  I note that the Republican majority wants to limit this debate. They \nhave asked on two occasions that we agree to a limitation. I hope they \nwill reflect on the fact that we are talking about injuries that occur \nto 600,000 workers a year. It is only fair to those workers, when we \nconsider this amendment by Senator Bond of Missouri, that this debate \nreflect the gravity of the issue. I will not make a unanimous consent \nrequest at this time, but I think it is reasonable that we allot in \nthis debate perhaps 1 minute for every 250 workers who were injured \neach year by one of these conditions.\n  That is 1 minute of debate for every 250 workers. By my calculation, \nthat comes out to about 24,000 minutes, and it turns out to be a 40-\nhour work week. Wouldn't it be interesting if the Members of the Senate \nhad to stand in their workplaces 4 and 5 hours at a time debating this \namendment and then talk about the aches and pains they suffer. Imagine \nthe worker who puts up with that every single day.\n  Each of us in the Senate brings our own personal experiences to this \njob. I am sure there are many colleagues in support of this amendment \nwho have been engaged in manual labor. I oppose this amendment. I have \nhad the experience, in my youth, of some pretty tough jobs. My folks \nwere pretty adamant that I take on tough jobs so I would want to go \nback to school and finish my college and law school education.\n  Well, it worked. I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, and spent several \nsummers working in the stockyards, sometimes working the graveyard \nshift, from midnight until 8 in the morning, and other times during the \nday. I did all sorts of manual labor, such as moving livestock, \ncleaning up in areas that needed to be cleaned up. It was a lot of \nhard, tough work. At the end of each summer, I was darn glad to go back \nto school.\n  But there were two jobs I had that educated me more than others about \nthe workplace, and dangers, and why this debate is not about some dry \nconcept but about real people who get up every single morning, pull \nthemselves out of bed, brush their teeth, and head off to work to earn \na paycheck to pay for their families' needs and maybe to realize the \nAmerican dream.\n  One job I had was on a railroad. It was considered a clerical job. It \ninvolved a lot of moving back and forth, sometimes in the middle of the \nnight, in Brooklyn, IL, between trains that stopped. I was a bill clerk \nwalking up and down with a lantern, trying to keep track of these \ntrains. One night, in the middle of the night, I climbed a ladder on \nthe side of one of these gondolas to see if it was empty or full. As I \nstarted to jump down from that ladder, my college graduation ring \ncaught on a burr on the ladder, causing a pretty serious injury and a \nscar I still carry. That was a minor injury. I was back at work in a \nfew days. Some workers aren't so lucky.\n\n  But the job I had really educated me about this issue, so I \nunderstand it personally. I hope my colleagues can come to understand \nit. It is a fact that I worked four straight summers in a \nslaughterhouse, the Hunter Packing Company of East St. Louis, \nprocessing hogs and pork products. We were unionized, the Amalgamated \nMeat Cutters and Butcher Workers of Greater North America, and we had a \ncontract. Thanks to that contract, I think I received $3.50 an hour, \nwhich, in the early 1960s, was a great wage for a college student. I \ncould finish that summer and take $1,500 back to school and do my best \nto pay my bills. My kids, and a lot of college students today, laugh \nwhen they consider that amount of money, but that was a large amount of \nmoney in my youth. When you came to the slaughterhouse as a college \nstudent, you expected the worst jobs, and you took them if you wanted \nto make the salary you needed. So I worked all over this \nslaughterhouse.\n  The union had entered into an agreement with the company, Hunter \nPacking Company, which said: You will work an 8-hour day, but we define \nan 8-hour day in terms of the number of hogs that are processed. If I \nrecall correctly, our contract said we would process 240 hogs an hour, \nwhich meant slaughtering or processing on 2 different floors, 2 \ndifferent responsibilities.\n  Some people who worked there said: Wait a minute, if 240 hogs equals \nan hour, and we are supposed to work 8-hour days, and at the end of the \nday we are supposed to have processed or slaughtered 1,920 hogs, if we \ncan speed up the line that carries these hogs, or speed up the conveyor \nbelt that carries the meat products, we might be able to get out in 7 \nhours.\n  So it was a race every day to get to 1,920 hogs. Hundreds of men and \nwomen who were standing on these processing lines were receiving that \npiece of the animal or piece of meat to process it, knowing another one \nwas right behind it, just as fast as they could move--repetitive \naction, day in and day out.\n  I saw injuries in that workplace because of the repetition and the \nspeed. I can remember working on what we called the ``kill floor,'' \nwhere the first processing of a hog took place. I worked next to an \nelderly African American gentleman, a nice guy. He joked with me all \nthe time because I was this green college student doing everything \nwrong. One day, I looked over as he slumped and fell to the floor; he \npassed out.\n  I can recall another day when I was working on a line where they were \nputting hams on a table to be boned and then stuck into a can so we \ncould enjoy them at home. These men were--it was all men at that time--\npaid by the ham. The faster they could bone the hams, the more money \nthey made. The knives they used were the sharpest they could possibly \nget their hands on. They covered the other hand with a metal mesh \nglove, and they would set out to bone the ham as quickly as they could. \nThere were hams flying in every direction and hands flying in every \ndirection. The next thing you know, there were injuries and cuts.\n  Of course, if your hand is cut and you work as a piece worker, you \nreally don't make much money until it heals. You can't go back too soon \ninto an environment with a lot of meat juices and water because it \nwon't heal. I\n\n[[Page S12167]]\n\nwould see these men with bandaged hands standing over to the side \nwaiting for another chance to make a living for their family.\n  These images are as graphic in my mind today, in 1999, standing on \nthe floor of the Senate, as they were in my experience as a kid in that \npacking house. As I looked around at the men and women who got up every \nsingle day and went to work--hard work, dirty work, but respectable \nwork--and brought home a good paycheck for a hard day's work, I saw \ntime and time again these injuries on the job.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, says to \nthe Federal Government--in this case, it says to the Secretary of \nLabor--not to study and not to come up with regulations that would \nprotect workers in the workplace from repetitive injuries.\n  It is a common question in legislatures and on Capitol Hill: Who \nwants this amendment? Who is pushing for this amendment? Who would want \nto leave millions of American workers vulnerable in the workplace from \nrepetitive stress injuries when we know that over 600,000 workers a \nyear are injured? Who is it who wants to stop or slow down this \nprocess?\n  Well, I am virtually certain it is some business interest. I don't \nknow which one, because the curious thing is that every business that \ncomes to talk to this Senator, or others, is quick to say: We care \nabout our workers. We put things in place to protect our workers. We \ndon't need the Federal Government to come in because safety in the \nworkplace is No. 1 at our plant.\n\n  I hear that over and over again. I don't dispute it. When I talk to \nyou a little later on about some of the companies that have responded \nto this particular challenge, you are going to find big names, Fortune \n500 names, such as Caterpillar Tractor Company of Illinois, a big \nemployer in my State. I am proud of what this company makes and exports \naround the world. You will hear about what they have done to deal with \nthe problem. Chrysler Motor Company in Belvidere, IL. I have been \nthere. We will talk about what they did.\n  Finally, you are going to say, if the Fortune 500 companies and the \nones that talk to you are the good guys, the companies that are really \ntrying to protect workers and understand how expensive and serious it \nis to have injuries in the workplace, who in the world is pushing for \nthis amendment that would eliminate holding every business in America \nresponsible for safety in the workplace?\n  My conclusion is that some bad actors out there in the business \ncommunity who are not living up to the same standard as these companies \nare the ones behind this amendment. And the sad reality is, the larger \ncompanies, through the organizations that represent them in Washington, \nhave joined ranks with the bad actors.\n  They are playing down the lowest common denominator. They are trying \nin a way to protect their competitors that aren't living up to the same \ngood standards for their workers. I think that is shameful. I think it \nis disgraceful.\n  This Bond amendment--make no mistake--I want to read to you what it \ndoes--says after a lot of preparatory language:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act may be used by \n     the Secretary of Labor, or the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration, to promulgate, or to issue, or to continue \n     the rulemaking process of promulgating or issuing any \n     standard regulation or guideline regarding ergonomics prior \n     to September 30, 2000.\n\n  In other words, turn out the lights downtown on establishing \nstandards that you send down to businesses to protect workers.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for \na question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New York for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  As I go around my State of New York, I meet all kinds of people who \nare unable to use their hands anymore because of the kinds of jobs they \nhave had. We have had, for instance, in New York City, workers from a \nvariety of jobs come together to talk about the need for some kind of \nstandard. Many have been disabled by workplace injuries and have had to \nlimit the amount of hours they work. One woman, for instance, an editor \nfor a local TV station, says she can't use her hands for cooking, for \nopening doors, or for carrying anything.\n  I ask my colleague from Illinois, how would this amendment affect \npeople in that position?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Bond amendment, offered by the Senator from Missouri, \nwould basically say to those workers: Your Government can't establish a \nstandard to protect you in the workplace. It stops the Government from \nestablishing a standard for workers.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if the Senator might yield for another \nquestion, I guess there is some talk about whether we need to study \nfurther; that they are not yet ready to have standards. Yet it is my \nunderstanding that scientific and medical journals have had over 2,000 \narticles about the need for some kinds of standard, about what the \nproblems are, and that it is pretty clear cut that in many new kinds of \nindustries the problems that have developed at the workplace are so \nreal that we have far more than enough information to develop \nstandards.\n  Would the Senator care to comment on whether or not the argument that \nwe are not ready to have standards in ergonomics washes?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from New York, he is correct. Over \n2,000 studies have established a causal relationship between certain \nwork patterns and certain injuries.\n  I also say to the Senator from New York that this large volume I \nreferred to earlier from the Centers for Disease Control, which is not \na political organization--it is an organization dedicated to public \nhealth in America--concluded after one of their more recent studies as \nfollows:\n\n       A substantial body of credible epidemiological research \n     provides strong evidence of an association between \n     musculoskeletal disorders and certain work-related physical \n     factors when there are high levels of exposure, and \n     especially in combination with exposure to more than one \n     physical factor; that is to say, repetitive lifting of heavy \n     objects in extreme or awkward postures.\n\n  So the Senator from New York is correct. The evidence is in. There is \nneed for standard of protection.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I respect his \nexpertise on this issue. I know he has been involved in it for a long \ntime.\n  It is my understanding that in 1990 the Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth \nDole--not a member of our party, now a candidate for President--said \nthat OSHA must take all the needed steps to develop an ergonomics \nstandard. That was virtually 10 years ago. There has been lots of \nplanning since. Am I correct in assuming that even at the beginning of \nthe decade it was pretty clear we needed some kind of standard, and \nthat we have delayed and delayed to the harm of thousands, tens of \nhundreds, and hundreds of thousands of workers?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from New York is accurate. At the conclusion \nof my remarks, I will ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record a \nnews release from the U.S. Department of Labor that is dated Thursday, \nAugust 30, 1990, a release from then-Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth \nDole, that says as follows in the opening paragraphs:\n\n       Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole----\n\n  The same person who is now a Republican candidate for President, I \nmight add----\n\n     * * * today launched a major initiative to reduce repetitive \n     motion trauma, one of the Nation's most debilitating across-\n     the-board worker safety and health illnesses of the 1990s.\n\n  She goes on with a quote that says:\n\n       These painful and sometimes crippling illnesses now make up \n     48 percent of all recordable industrial workplace illnesses. \n     We must do our utmost to protect workers from these hazards, \n     not only in the red meat industry, but all U.S. industries.\n\n  That was Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Republican administration, 1990.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis news release in its entirety from the Department of Labor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12168]]\n\nSecretary Dole Announces Ergonomics Guidelines to Protect Workers from \n           Repetitive Motion Illnesses/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\n\n       Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole today launched a major \n     initiative to reduce repetitive motion trauma, once of the \n     nation's most debilitating across-the-board worker safety and \n     health illnesses of the 1990's.\n       ``These painful and sometime crippling illnesses now make \n     up 48 percent of all recordable industrial workplace \n     illnesses. We must do our utmost to protect workers from \n     these hazards, not only in the red meat industry but all U.S. \n     industries,'' Secretary Dole said.\n       ``We are publishing these guidelines now because we want to \n     eliminate as many illnesses as possible, as quickly as \n     possible.\n       ``The Department is committed to taking the most effective \n     steps necessary to address the problem of ergonomic hazards \n     on an industry-wide basis. Thus, I intend to begin the \n     rulemaking process by asking the public for information about \n     ergonomic hazards across all industry. This could be \n     accomplished through a Request for Information or an Advanced \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking consistent with the \n     Administration's Regulatory Program.\n       ``We are emphasizing the need for employers to fit the job \n     to the employee rather than the employee to the job,'' \n     Secretary Dole said. ``This involves such measures as \n     designing flexible work stations which can be adjusted to \n     suit individuals and relying on tools developed to minimize \n     physical stress and eliminate crippling injuries. It begins \n     with organizing work processes with the physical needs of the \n     workers in mind.''\n       Repetitive motion trauma, also referred to as cumulative \n     trauma disorders (CTD's), are disorders of the \n     musculoskeletal and nervous systems resulting from the \n     repeated exertion, or awkward positioning, of the hand, arm, \n     back, leg or other muscles over extended periods daily.\n       They include lower back injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, \n     (a nerve disorder of the hand and wrist), and various tendon \n     disorders, among others.\n       ``We are initially focussing on the red meat industry \n     because its problems are well-documented and very severe,'' \n     Secretary dole said.\n       The guidelines for the red meat industry, being issued in \n     the form of a booklet by the Labor Department's Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), were developed to \n     assist employers in the industry in developing ergonomic \n     hazard abatement programs.\n       ``The message in the guidelines is simple: repetitive \n     motion illnesses can be minimized through proper workplace \n     engineering and job design and by effective employee training \n     and education,'' Secretary Dole said. ``The guidelines list \n     the keys for success: commitment by top management, a written \n     ergonomics program, employee involvement and regular program \n     review and evaluation.\n       ``We will be closely monitoring and assessing the success \n     of the Red Meat Guidelines in addressing ergonomic hazards to \n     give us more information on which to proceed as we deal with \n     these issues on an industry-wide basis.\n       ``We owe a debt of thanks to the United Food and Commercial \n     Workers, AFL-CIO; the American Meat Institute, and the \n     National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for \n     their expert assistance in developing these guidelines. Their \n     willingness to join with us in finding and implementing \n     solutions to ergonomic problems has been most encouraging.''\n       Assistant Secretary of Labor Gerard F. Scannel, who heads \n     OSHA, said his agency would begin an inspection program early \n     next year in the red meat industry as another phase of the \n     special emphasis program initiated by the issuance of the \n     guidelines.\n       He said the special emphasis program for the meat industry \n     has been designed to ensure that the well-recognized \n     ergonomic hazards in the industry are being adequately \n     addressed and that ergonomic programs are in place in all \n     major meatpacking plants.\n       Each red meat plant in the U.S. will be sent a copy of the \n     meatpacking guidelines. As part of the special emphasis \n     program, employers will be offered the opportunity to enter \n     into agreements with OSHA to abate their ergonomic hazards.\n       Though those who sign such an agreement will be subject to \n     monitoring visits and OSHA inspections in response to \n     complaints, they will not be cited or penalized on ergonomic \n     issues if the monitoring visits show a comprehensive effort \n     and satisfactory progress in abating such hazards.\n       Scannell said that while the guidelines are advisory, \n     ``compliance with them could demonstrate to an OSHA \n     inspection team that an employer is committed to addressing \n     ergonomic hazards.''\n       Scannell said the guidelines include a list of questions \n     and answers about common problems to provide more specific \n     assistance to small businesses.\n       ``Ergonomics Program Management Guidelines for Meatpacking \n     Plants,'' the official title of the booklet, builds on the \n     cooperative approach of OSHA's safety and health program \n     management guidelines issued in January 1989. Although strict \n     adherence to today's guidelines is not mandatory, OSHA \n     believes following them can produce significant reductions in \n     repetitive motion illnesses.\n       The recommended program begins with analysis of the \n     worksite to identify potential ergonomic problems. Ergonomic \n     solutions may include: engineering controls such as proper \n     work stations, work methods and tool designs, work practice \n     controls such as proper cutting techniques, new employee \n     training, monitoring adjustments and modifications, personal \n     protective equipment such as assuring proper fit of gloves \n     and appropriate protection against cold and administrative \n     controls such as reducing the duration, frequency and \n     severity of motions; slowing production rates; limiting \n     overtime; providing adequate rest pauses; increasing the \n     number of workers assigned to a particular task; rotating \n     workers among jobs with different stressors; ensuring \n     availability of relief workers; and maintaining equipment and \n     tools in top condition.\n       Further, meatpackers need to develop an effective training \n     program to explain to employees the importance of working in \n     ways that limit stress and strain, and the need to report \n     symptoms of CTDs early so that preventive treatment can \n     forestall permanent damage.\n       Employers must also instruct employees in the proper \n     techniques for their individual jobs. Annual retraining is \n     necessary to assure that employees continue to do their jobs \n     correctly.\n       An effective ergonomics program also includes medical \n     management with trained health care providers to work with \n     those implementing the ergonomics program and to treat \n     employees. The guidelines describe helpful steps including \n     periodic workplace walkthroughs, symptoms surveys and lists \n     of light-duty jobs for employees recovering from repetitive \n     motion injuries.\n       They stress the importance of a good health surveillance \n     program; the need to encourage early reporting of symptoms; \n     appropriate protocols for health care providers; and \n     evaluation, treatment and follow-up for repetitive motion \n     illnesses.\n       Finally, the booklet offers suggestions for recordkeeping \n     and monitoring injury and illness trends.\n       The guidelines also include a glossary of terms and a list \n     of references. Employers may contact OSHA regional offices \n     with questions about ergonomics, recordkeeping or other \n     safety and health issues by consulting the directory at the \n     end of the booklet.\n       Single copies of ``Ergonomics Program Management Guidelines \n     for Meatpacking Plants'' are available free from OSHA \n     Publications, Room N3101, Frances Perkins Building, 200 \n     Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, D.C. 20210 by sending a \n     self-addressed mailing label.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to state my opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  When people say government is not responsive to people's problems or \nthat it gets nothing done--they are talking about this amendment which \nbars OSHA from issuing a standard on ergonomics.\n  We know the facts. Ergonomics is no longer the mystery it once was. \nOver 2,000 articles related to this appear in scientific and medical \njournals.\n  We do not need new studies. How many studies do we need before \neveryone recognizes the obvious--ergonomic injury is real?\n  The 600,000 workers who experience severe back pain or hand and wrist \npain have been studied ad nauseam.\n  So let's move forward and develop a standard. It will ultimately save \nbusinesses money and it will protect workers, because a standard will \nkeep people in the workplace.\n  The Department of Labor has worked on formulating a standard since \nformer-Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in 1990 that OSHA must take all \nthe needed steps to develop an ergonomics standard. That's 10 years of \nplanning. We don't need another year of delay.\n  This shouldn't be a partisan issue. We need not pit business versus \nlabor. All sides will benefit.\n  If not now, I predict eventually we will develop an ergonomics \nstandard. Because as this economy becomes more dependent on the \ncomputer, and more top level managers spend much of their day in front \nof a screen--they will develop the same injuries that are reserved now \nonly for secretaries.\n  And that will be impetus to develop a standard for them and for those \nin construction and factories that develop repetitive motion stress.\n  Last April in New York City, workers from a variety of jobs came \ntogether to talk about the need for an ergonomics standard. Some have \nbeen permanently disabled by workplace injuries. Some have had to limit \nthe hours they work.\n  One woman, an editor at a local television station, said can't use \nher hands ``not for cooking, opening doors, carrying anything.''\n  Passing this amendment means we believe these people are faking it. \nNo wonder people are so frustrated by government.\n  Let's defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. President, will the Senator also answer another question?\n\n[[Page S12169]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This is one other problem that I have heard from my \nconstituents in New York. Workers who have labored long and hard who \nshow up at the job day in, day out develop certain types of problems, \nand because there are no standards, all too often when they go to their \nsupervisor, when they go to their boss, when they go to somebody of \nsome authority in the company in which they work--it could be a large \ncompany, it could be a small company--and complain of these problems, \nthey are told they are faking because these injuries are different. \nMany of them are the kinds of injuries we are used to where, God \nforbid, you see blood or bone or some bruise. These are injuries that \nhurt and affect their ability to work just as much, but they can't be \nseen in the same way.\n  Has the Senator from Illinois come across the same type of problem, \nand wouldn't the promulgation and maintenance of standards help these \npeople prove they have a real problem?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from New York identifies the real \nproblem here in defining the issue because in many cases we are talking \nabout what is characterized as a ``soft tissue injury.'' In other \nwords, examination by an x ray or an MRI may not disclose any problem \nand yet there is a very serious and real problem.\n  I used to find in my life experience people suffering neck and back \ninjuries. You couldn't point to objective evidence of why this person \nwas crippling up or why this person had a problem. In fact, the problem \nwas very real.\n  What we are trying to do is establish a standard so the worker is not \naccused of malingering and the worker is not accused of faking it, but \nthe worker has a recourse when there is a very real and serious injury \nto at least get time off and at least go for some medical attention.\n  The Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, with this amendment wants to \nstop this process, wants to say that this Government will not establish \nthat standard of protection for American workers. The net result of it, \nof course, is that 600,000 victims of these injuries each year will not \nhave the protection to which the Senator from New York has alluded.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me go on to say that the objective of \ncontinuing to study this matter is one of the oldest strategies on \nCapitol Hill. It is the way many people who object to a certain thing \noccurring delay the inevitable and prolong the process of review.\n  I have been involved for years in the battle against the tobacco \ncompanies. I can't think of a product in America that has been studied \nmore than tobacco. It shouldn't be. It is the No. 1 preventable cause \nof death in America today.\n  When the tobacco companies ruled the roost on Capitol Hill, they \nwould postpone health standards and warning labels, and banning smoking \non airplanes, for example, by saying: We just need another study. If we \ncan get another study, then maybe we will arrive at the truth about \nwhat to deal with, what to do in dealing with tobacco products.\n  This is another good illustration. I listened to the Senator from \nMissouri. He said in his conclusion supporting this amendment, which I \nrise in opposition to: ``It is time for OSHA to act compassionately.''\n  I understand the virtue of compassion, and I hope I have some in my \nlife. But there is no compassion for millions of American workers if we \ndo not set out to establish a standard of protection when it comes to \nthese types of injuries.\n\n  To postpone this for another year--which is what this amendment would \ndo--is to put their health and safety at risk. For what? So that bad \ncompanies that care less about their worker injuries don't have to \nimprove the workplace? That is what it is all about. That is the bottom \nline on this debate.\n  As I said earlier, major companies already recognize the problem and \nrespond to it. Go into many of your discount stores and one sees \nworkers wearing back brace belts. I have seen them at Wal-Mart and \nother stores. Their employers understand reaching over and pulling \ngroceries hour after hour can cause some back strain, so they have done \nsomething about it. Voluntarily, on their own, they have done \nsomething. They don't want the workers to be off work and an expense to \nthe company. They want them to continue on the job with good morale and \nthey provide them some protection.\n  When I went to the Belvidere Chrysler plant where they make the Neon \nautomobile in my State of Illinois, I was pleasantly surprised to see \nall the changes that had taken place on the assembly line. In the old \ndays, a worker would turn around and pick up a piece of an automobile, \nmove around, and put it on the automobile to fix it in place. That has \nchanged. There are all sorts of cranes and devices so parts can be \nmoved without strain or stress to the employee. That was done not just \nto protect the employee but to protect the bottom line of the company.\n  Frankly, worker injuries cost the companies in terms of time lost and \nin terms of productivity as the experienced workers leave the line and \nsomeone new takes their place. That is being done by conscientious \ncompanies. OSHA needs to develop a standard for those that are not \nconscientious. The Bond amendment is not compassionate. The Bond \namendment stops the Department of Labor from establishing that standard \nof protection.\n  As I mentioned earlier, over 6 million workers have been injured in \nthe course of keeping records on this particular type of injury, \n600,000 each year. Over 2,000 studies on these hazards have detailed \nhow the hazards in the workplace harm people and put them out of work, \nand the devastating impact they have had on the American workforce.\n  Yet the Bond amendment delays, stops it, says to the workers who go \nto work every single day, put your life and your earning capacity at \nrisk in the workplace. And we in Congress, each year, for the sake of a \nhandful of companies that refuse to act responsibly in dealing with \ntheir workers, will stop you from any standard of protection.\n  The following disorders in 1997 accounted for more than 600,000 \nworkplace injuries. One is fairly common. In fact, some people who work \nin my office have dealt with this problem because of the nature of \nworking on a keyboard. This type of musculoskeletal disorder is called \ncarpal tunnel syndrome. It accounts for $20 billion annually in \nworkers' compensation costs. As I am speaking now, there is a court \nreporter standing in front of me working away at her machine; she does \nthat every single day. If she is not careful, she can develop problems, \nas people in ordinary clerical situations do on a regular basis.\n  I don't think these people are malingerers. I don't think these \npeople are faking. Ever seen the scars from the surgery? That strikes \nme as a great length to go to to fake an injury. I think these people \nare in real pain and seeking real relief.\n  One of the things I have noticed, some of the keyboards have been \nchanged now so there is less stress on the hands of workers who use \nthem. Companies have decided in redesigning the keyboard that they will \naddress that problem directly. It could be that the development of a \nstandard by the Department of Labor will move our country in that \ndirection and reduce the $20 billion paid out every year by American \nbusinesses for workers' compensation cases involving those with carpal \ntunnel syndrome.\n  Who is affected the most by the Bond amendment? Which workers will be \nhurt the most by the Bond amendment? Women across America. Women \nworkers suffer a much higher rate of carpal tunnel syndrome. According \nto the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 86 percent of repetitive motion \ninjury increases were suffered by women; 78 percent of tendinitis \nincreases were suffered by women. Yet women make up 46 percent of the \nworkforce.\n  What kind of jobs are these women in? We have talked about clerical \njobs, obviously. But there are nurses, nurse's aides, cashiers, \nassemblers, maids, laborers, custodians, and, yes, many of these jobs \nemploy minority workers. It is estimated between 25 and 50 percent of \nthe workforce are Hispanic and African American workers in those \nparticular jobs.\n  A 6-month study by the National Academy of Sciences in 1998 stated,\n\n[[Page S12170]]\n\n``The positive relationship between the occurrence of musculoskeletal \ndisorders and the conduct of work is clear.''\n  We heard the Senator from Arkansas, we heard the Senator from \nMissouri--I am sure we hear others--stand up and defy this scientific \nconclusion. Despite 2,000 studies and this clear language, some would \nlead Members to believe that it is still a mystery how 600,000 workers \ncould complain of this type of injury in America every single year. We \nknow better. We know better from our life experience. That is why this \namendment is so bad, why this amendment, in delaying protection for \nthose workers, ignores the obvious, the injuries and the scientific \nconclusion that leads us to at least a standard of care to protect \nthose same workers.\n\n  A few minutes ago, I made reference to the press release from the \nDepartment of Labor, 1990, at a time when the Secretary was Elizabeth \nDole. Elizabeth Dole is a person I came to know and respect when she \nwas Secretary of Transportation and appeared before my subcommittee in \nthe House of Representatives. There was a time when we spoke of worker \nprotection issues as bipartisan issues. Sadly, with a very few \nexceptions, that is not the case anymore.\n  If we are talking about increasing the minimum wage, which \nhistorically was a bipartisan issue--both Democrats and Republicans \nunderstanding that people who went to work every day deserve a living \nwage--that has changed. It has changed for the worse.\n  This amendment, if it comes to a vote, will evidence that this has \nbecome a very partisan matter. Those offering the amendment on the \nRepublican side of the aisle will generally, if not exclusively, vote \nin support of the amendment; those on the Democratic side of the aisle \nwill generally vote against it. We have broken down on partisan lines.\n  The sad reality is the workers we are talking about and the workers \nwho were injured do not break down on partisan lines. The workers who \ncome off that job with neck and back injuries and carpal tunnel \nsyndromes are Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and nonvoters. They \ndeserve better than to let this issue break down to the partisan battle \nwhich it has.\n  Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole said in August of 1990:\n\n       We must do our utmost to protect workers from these hazards \n     in all U.S. industries.\n\n  She said at that time, 9 years ago:\n\n       We are publishing these guidelines now because we want to \n     eliminate as many illnesses as possible as quickly as \n     possible.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       The Department [of Labor] is committed to taking the most \n     effective steps necessary to address the problem of ergonomic \n     hazards on an industry-wide basis.\n\n  That was 9 years ago. Here we are today, without those standards of \nprotection, and an effort underway by Senator Bond of Missouri to, once \nagain, delay the establishment of these standards.\n  Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in 1990:\n\n       We are emphasizing the need for employers to fit the job to \n     the employee, rather than the employee to the job. This \n     involves such measures as designing flexible workstations \n     which can be adjusted to suit individuals and relying on \n     tools developed to minimize physical distress and eliminate \n     crippling injuries. It begins by organizing work processes \n     with the physical needs of the workers in mind.\n\n  That is basically what I have seen applied to businesses in my home \nState of Illinois, by companies that care. This entire news release has \nnow been agreed to be part of the Record. Those who review this debate \nwill see that Secretary Dole was on the right track--a Republican \nSecretary of Labor.\n  Why, today, the Republican Party, through the amendment of Senator \nBond of Missouri, wants to take a different venue, a different tack, \nand to eliminate this responsibility, I cannot explain.\n  This press release is from a different Labor Secretary, not our \ncurrent Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman, who said if the Bond \namendment is adopted, she will veto this entire important bill; it is \nfrom Secretary Elizabeth Dole. But it is from Secretary Elizabeth Dole. \nSecretaries Dole, Reich, and Herman have support this issue, but they \nare not alone. Other endorsements establishing the standard of \nprotection for American workers come from the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, the National \nAcademy of Sciences, the American Public Health Association, and the \nNational Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health.\n  I received a letter from the American Public Health Association, \nwhich I would like to make part of this record as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                           Health Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1999.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are deeply concerned about S. 1070, \n     legislation that would not only block OSHA from issuing an \n     ergonomics standard, but even from issuing voluntary \n     guidelines to protect working men and women from ergonomic \n     hazards, the biggest safety and health problem facing workers \n     today.\n       We strongly support OSHA's efforts to promulgate a standard \n     to protect workers from ergonomic injuries and illnesses. \n     These disorders are real, they are serious and they account \n     for nearly a third of all serious job related injuries (more \n     than 600,000 workers a year); moreover, they are preventable. \n     One type, carpal tunnel syndrome, alone results in workers \n     losing more time from their jobs than any other type of \n     injury, including amputations. The workers' compensation \n     costs of ergonomic injuries are estimated at $20 billion \n     annually, the overall costs at $60 billion.\n       For women workers, OSHA's efforts are particularly \n     important, because nearly half of all injuries and illnesses \n     among women workers result from ergonomic hazards. Though \n     these hazards are present in a variety of jobs, many of the \n     occupations predominantly occupied by women are among the \n     hardest hit by ergonomic injuries.\n       Workplace musculoskeletal disorders can be prevented. There \n     is a clear and adequate foundation of scientific and \n     practical evidence, including a 1998 congressionally \n     requested National Academy of Sciences study demonstrating \n     that these disorders are work-related and that ergonomic \n     solutions in the workplace can prevent injuries. These \n     workplace solutions can protect workers, decrease workers' \n     compensation costs, and produce gains in productivity and \n     workplace innovation.\n       We recognize that there is another National Academy of \n     Sciences study pending, and that this is the reason for the \n     legislation. We also recognize that useful information will \n     come out of that study that can be applied to improve \n     protections for workers. However, sufficient data already \n     exists to protect workers. Failure to act on adequate data in \n     this regard is irresponsible.\n       After almost a decade of work, OSHA is finally moving \n     forward with a proposed ergonomics standard to prevent work-\n     related musculoskeletal disorders. Upon official publication, \n     this proposal will allow a public debate on ergonomics before \n     a final rule is issued. We are aware of the differing views \n     surrounding this proposal. However, such debate is not unique \n     to ergonomics. Such differences in views have existed in \n     almost all of OSHA's major rulemaking, including other \n     serious workplace hazards such as asbestos, benzene and lead.\n       The rulemaking process--the proper forum for debate over \n     regulatory proposals--will provide the opportunity for all \n     parties to present their views, opinions and evidence.\n       We urge you to resist efforts to block OSHA from working on \n     the development and adoption of an ergonomics standard by \n     voting ``no'' on S. 1070 or any other effort to prevent OSHA \n     from protecting workers from ergonomic hazards.

Mr. President, this letter is dated September 27, 1999. \nIt comes from a long list of organizations that comprise the American \nPublic Health Association.\n  Reading the introductory paragraphs will make it clear where they \nstand, in opposition to the Bond amendment:\n\n       We are deeply concerned about S. 1070, legislation that \n     would not only block OSHA from issuing an ergonomics \n     standard, but even from issuing voluntary guidelines to \n     protect working men and women from ergonomic hazards, the \n     biggest safety and health problem facing workers today.\n       We strongly support OSHA's efforts to promulgate a standard \n     to protect workers from ergonomic injuries and illnesses. \n     These disorders are real, they are serious and they account \n     for nearly a third of all serious job related injuries (more \n     than 600,000 workers a year); moreover, they are preventable. \n     One type, carpal tunnel syndrome, alone results in workers \n     losing more time from their jobs than any other type of \n     injury, including amputations. The worker's compensation \n     costs of ergonomic injuries are estimated at $20 billion \n     annually, the overall costs at $60 billion.\n       For women workers, OSHA's efforts are particularly \n     important, because nearly half of all injuries and illnesses \n     among women workers result from ergonomic hazards. Though \n     these hazards are present in a variety of jobs, many of the \n     occupations predominantly occupied by women are among the \n     hardest hit by ergonomic injuries.\n\n  Why is it when it comes to this floor and the battle is worth \nfighting, if the well-heeled special interest groups with the strongest \nlobbies can come in, whether it is an oil company trying to avoid \npaying its fair share of royalties to drill for oil on public lands or \nother large companies, we take the time and end up giving the special \nfavors, but when it comes to women in the workplace, minorities in the \nworkplace, time and time again this Senate, this Congress, will cut a \ncorner and say, ultimately: Perhaps we ought to give the benefit of the \ndoubt to the employer, perhaps we ought to ignore the 600,000 who are \ninjured?\n  As one who spent a small part of my life in the workplace, that \nstandard is upside down. If the Senate in Washington, DC, is not here \nto protect those who are voiceless, then we have lost our bearings \ncompletely. This issue goes to the heart of that debate.\n  The General Accounting Office has found employers can reduce costs \nand injuries associated with musculoskeletal disorders and improve not \nonly employee health but productivity and product quality.\n  When workers know their employer cares enough about them to make the \nworkplace safer for them, it is a clear and strong message to them that \nincreases employee morale. The time has come for the other side of the \naisle to make good on its promise to the American people. The leader in \nthe candidacy for the Presidency on the Republican side, Gov. George W. \nBush of Texas, claims he is a compassionate conservative. During the \ncourse of this campaign, we will try to figure out what that means.\n  Today, we can ask ourselves if we are seeing an exhibition of \ncompassionate conservatism from the Republican side of the aisle. I \nthink not. With this amendment, I think we see an effort to turn our \nbacks on people who need compassion, understanding, and protection.\n  Last year, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Robert \nLivingston of Louisiana, and his ranking Democratic member, David Obey \nof Wisconsin, made it clear in a letter to the Secretary of Labor:\n\n       . . . by funding the National Academy of Sciences study [on \n     this issue], it is no way our intent to block or delay \n     issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule on ergonomics.\n\n  The reason I raise that is so those who are following the debate \nunderstand that this attempt at delay is nothing new. I have the \nletter. The letter makes it clear that both the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last year made \nit clear they wanted to go forward with the rule or a standard of \nprotection on these types of injuries.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Alexis Herman,\n     Secretary of Labor,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: Congress has chosen not to include \n     language in the Fiscal Year 1999 Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act that would prohibit OSHA from using funds to issue or \n     promulgate a proposed or final rule on ergonomics. As you are \n     well aware, the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act did contain such a prohibitiion, though OSHA was free to \n     continue the work required to develop such a rule.\n       Congress has also chosen to provide $890,000 for the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to fund a review by \n     the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of the scientific \n     literature regarding work-related musculoskeletal disorders. \n     We understand that OSHA intends to issue a proposed rule on \n     ergonomics late in the summer of 1999. We are writing to make \n     clear that by funding the NAS study, it is in no way our \n     intent to block or delay issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule \n     on ergonomics.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Livingston,\n       Chairman.\n     David Obey,\n       Ranking Member.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Here we have the Bond amendment which says the deal is \noff. For the sake of some companies which do not protect their workers \nin the workplace and do not care to spend the money to do it, we are \nbasically going to say we will establish no standards for workplaces \nacross America. Senator Gregg, my colleague, proposed the new National \nAcademy of Sciences study last September in committee. Then he stated, \n``. . . the study does not in any way limit OSHA'' in moving forward \nwith the ergonomic standard.\n  By the way, this study asks exactly the same seven questions the \nprevious study asked. Even Chairman Stevens of Alaska stated, ``There \nis no moratorium under this agreement.''\n  So we are told the Department is supposed to go forward in \nestablishing these standards. Along comes the Bond amendment. I remind \nmy colleagues, the Bond amendment stops the Department of Labor in its \ntracks. It prohibits that department, OSHA, from promulgating or \ncontinuing the rulemaking process, issuing any standard, regulation, or \nguidelines regarding ergonomics for a year.\n  So the deal has been changed. The losers in this bargain are the \nworkers across America who expect us to care and expect us to respond. \nI think it is time to bring an end to this charade. We have a real \nproblem. We need real solutions. Workers across this country need real \nprotection. The Bond amendment removes the possibility of establishing \nthis standard of protection.\n  A few weeks ago I was visited by Madeleine Sherod. Madeleine is a \nvictim of these injuries, a mother of five children who are now all \ngrown. She has worked for an Illinois paint company for 20 years.\n  When she started, she literally lifted and moved work stations from \none area of the plant to another. This job consisted of lifting several \ndifferent sizes and weights of boxes. After several months of this type \nof work she transferred to the shipping department where she performed \nthe duties of a warehouse worker. Her job consisted of driving a \nmaterial handling truck and lifting cartons of paint that were packaged \nin various sizes and weights (5 gallon pails weighing approximately 20 \nlbs-90 lbs). She performed this job for at least 13 years. She later \ntransferred to a job where she now operates several different pieces of \nmachinery. She must keep the equipment operating efficiently--if the \nmachinery breaks down then manual labor must be performed.\n  Her first injury occurred about 15 years ago. She was diagnosed with \ncarpal tunnel syndrome and had surgery to relieve the pain. As a mother \nof 5 children her ability to perform the normal tasks as a parent was \nan everyday struggle. She was unable to comb her three daughters hair, \nwash dishes, sweep floors, or many other day-to-day tasks that working \nmoms must perform.\n\n[[Page S12172]]\n\n  Her second injury occurred about 7 years ago. Madeleine was diagnosed \nwith tendinitis and this time had tenon release surgery. Even today she \nhas to wear a wrist brace to help strengthen her wrist. Being extra \ncautious has become part of her everyday life when it comes to the use \nof her wrist.\n  She recently found a lump on her left wrist, and is preparing herself \nfor yet another surgery.\n  The company has not been able to make any adjustments for her at this \ntime. They say that there really is nothing they can do to change the \nwork that is preformed in the shipping department to curtail repetitive \nuse of the hands, knees and back.\n  And here's the clincher: the majority of the women who have worked \nfor this company for more than 10 year have had similar surgeries for \ntheir injuries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, we have an order \nto vote on the Wellstone amendment at 1:50.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will suspend.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1842\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nWellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1842.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \npending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Amendment No. 2270, in the \nsecond degree, offered by Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support an amendment that I \nfeel to be extremely important to the small business owners of Montana. \nThat amendment is the Sensible Ergonomics Needs Scientific Evidence \nAct, the SENSE Act. This amendment makes the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration, OSHA, to do the sensible thing--wait for a \nscientific report before OSHA can impose any new ergonomics regulations \non small business.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS, the overall injury \nand illness rate is currently at its lowest level. Date shows that \nmusculoskeletal disorders have declined by 17 percent over the past 3 \nyears. But OSHA continues to aggressively move forward with an \nergonomics regulation and ignoring the intent of Congress.\n  I have been hearing from small business owners of across the State of \nMontana. Businesses that range from construction companies to florists \nthat fall under OSHA's mandated ergo-\nnomics regulations are telling me something has to be done. They are \nbeing forced to comply with ridiculous rules and regulations that OSHA \ncannot prove to be harmful to employees.\n  Before OSHA can move forward with any new regulations a few things \nneed to be proven. First, OSHA needs to objectively define the medical \nconditions that should be addressed, not a broad category of all soft \ntissue and bone pains and injuries that might have resulted. Second, \nthey need to identify the particular exposures in magnitude and nature \nwhich cause the defined medical conditions. Last they need to prescribe \nthe changes necessary to prevent their recurrence. Right now OSHA \ncannot prove any of these things.\n  We need to make sure that OSHA is not running free and loose. They \ncannot have free rein to enact new rules and regulations without having \nsignificant scientific evidence to back up their new mandate. This \namendment, to put it simply, will delay moving forward with any \nergonomics rule or guideline until completion of an independent study \nof the medical and scientific evidence linking on-the-job activities \nand repetitive stress injuries.\n  This is a very complicated issue, and we need to make sure that there \nis sound science and through medical evidence to protect our small \nbusiness and employees from misguided rules and regulations. The SENSE \nAct does not prohibit OSHA from continuing to research ergonomics or \nfrom exercising its enforcement authority, it just puts the small \nbusiness owner on a level playing field. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. It is \nour responsibility as the Nation's leader to reduce the hazards that \nAmerica's workers face--not putting roadblocks in the way of increased \nworkers safety. Ergonomic injuries are the single largest occupational \nhealth crisis faced by men and women in our workforce today. We should \nlet the OSHA issue an ergonomics standard.\n  Ergonomic injuries hurt America's workers. Each year, more than \n600,000 private sector workers in America are forced to miss time from \nwork because of musculoskeletal disorders, MSDs. These injuries hurt \nour America's companies because these disorders can cause workers to \nmiss three full weeks of work or more. Employers pay over $20 billion \nannually in worker's compensation benefits due to MSDs and up to $60 \nbillion in lost productivity, disability benefits, and other associated \ncosts.\n  The impact of MSDs on women workers is especially serious. While \nwomen make up 46 percent of the total workforce and only make up 33 \npercent of total injured workers, they receive 63 percent of all lost \nwork time ergonomic injuries and 69 percent of lost work time carpal \ntunnel syndrome.\n  In addition, women in the health care, retail and textile industries \nare particularly hard hit by MSDs and carpal tunnel syndrome. In fact \nwomen suffer over 90 percent of the MSDs among nurses, nurse aides, \nhealth care aides, and sewing machine operators. Women also account for \n91 percent of the carpal tunnel cases that occur among cashiers.\n  Despite all the overwhelming financial and physical impacts of MSDs \nand the disproportionate impact they have on our Nation's women, there \nhave been several efforts over the years to prevent the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration, OSHA from issuing an ergonomics \nstandard.\n  Let's be clear, this amendment is intended to delay OSHA's ergonomic \nstandard until yet another scientific study is performed on ergonomic \ninjuries. We have examined the merits of this rule over and over again. \nContrary to what those on the other side of this issue say, the science \nsupports an ergonomics standard. We also had a bipartisan agreement \nthat the current National Academy of Sciences, NAS, study would--in no \nway--impede implementation by OSHA.\n  NAS has already studied this issue. The new study would address the \nexact same issues that were dealt with in the previous study. They are \nalso using the same science. No new science. It is mind boggling.\n  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, \nstudied ergonomics and conclude that there is ``clear and compelling \nevidence''\n\n[[Page S12173]]\n\nthat MSDs are caused by work and can be reduced and prevented through \nworkplace interventions. The American College of Occupational and \nEnvironmental Medicine, the world's largest occupational medical \nsociety, agreed with NIOSH and saw no reason to delay implementation. \nThe studies and science are conclusive in the Senator's mind.\n  Further--and possibly most persuasive--last year, the administration \nand leaders in Congress on this side of the aisle only agreed to a new \nstudy because those on the other side said that this new study would \nnot delay the issuance by OSHA of a rule on ergonomics. Now they are \nnot standing by their word.\n  We cannot afford to delay an important standard which will greatly \nimprove workplace safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. We should allow OSHA \nto issue an ergonomics standard. It will be an important first step in \nprotecting our Nation's workers from crippling injuries.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to spend some time this afternoon \nspeaking to my colleagues to vote against the amendment before us \ntoday, the amendment that would prohibit the Department of Labor or the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration from issuing any standard \nor regulation addressing ergonomic concerns in the workplace for one \nyear.\n  Mr. President, this prohibition would come just as OSHA prepares, in \nthe next few weeks, to publish its proposed rule on ergonomics for \npublic comment. This would be a blow to American workers and a real \nstep backwards for the kind of cooperative approach to business and the \nworkplace that we need in this country.\n  Mr. President, let's be clear about the issue before us, the question \nof ergonomics and which workplace injuries will continue to occur if \nthis amendment becomes law.\n  Ergonomics is the science of fitting workplace conditions and job \ndemands to the capabilities of the working population. The study of \nergonomics is large in scope, but generally, the term refers to the \nassessment of those work-related factors that may pose a risk of \nmusculoskeletal disorders. It is well-settled that effective and \nsuccessful ergonomics programs assure high productivity, avoidance of \nillness and injury risks, and increased satisfaction among the \nworkforce.\n  Many businesses and trade associations have already implemented \nsafety and health programs in the workplace and have seen productivity \nrise as fewer hours on the job are lost. According to Assistant \nSecretary of Labor Charles N. Jeffress in his testimony before the \nHouse Committee on Small Business, programs implemented by individual \nemployers reduce total job-related injuries and illnesses by an average \nof 45 percent and lost work time injuries and illnesses by an average \nof 75 percent.\n  Ergonomic disorders include sprains and strains, which affect the \nmuscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, or spinal \ndiscs; repetitive stress injuries, that are typically not the result of \nany instantaneous or acute event but are usually chronic in nature, and \nbrought on as a result of a poorly designed work environment (these \ninjuries are common causes of muscoskeletal problems such as chronic \nand disabling lower-back pain); and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n  And let's be clear that this, Mr. President, is a real problem for \nAmerican businesses and workers. Industry experts have estimated that \ninjuries and illnesses caused by ergonomic hazards are the biggest job \nsafety problem in the workplace today, as each year more than 600 \nthousand workers suffer from back injuries, tendinitis, and other \nergonomic disorders. In fact, OSHA, estimates that injuries related to \ncarpal tunnel syndrome alone result in more workers losing their jobs \nthan any other injury. The worker compensation cost of all ergonomics \ninjuries is estimated at over 20 billion dollars annually.\n  What is most troubling, Mr. President, is that these types of \ninjuries are preventable. There is something that can be done to \nprotect the American worker. It should be noted that in drafting its \nproposed rule--a rule Mr. President, that is scheduled to be issued in \njust a few weeks--OSHA worked extensively with a number of \nstakeholders, including representatives from industry, labor, safety \nand health organizations, State governments, trade associations, and \ninsurance companies. OSHA has drafted an interactive, flexible rule \nthat allows managers and labor to work in unison to create a safer \nworkplace environment. OSHA even placed on its Website a preliminary \nversion of the draft proposed rule, in order to facilitate comments \nfrom the public. Mr. President, this is not a ``command and control'' \nregulatory action.\n  As noted by Assistant Secretary Jeffress: ``An employer [should] work \ncredibly with employees to find workplace hazards and fix them . . . \nthe rule creates no new obligations for employers to control hazards \nthat they have not already been required to control under the General \nDuty Clause under Section 5 of the Occupational Safety Act or existing \nOSHA standards.''\n  In other words, Mr. President, this rule is simply an interactive \napproach between employee and manager to protect the assets of the \ncompany in ways that are either already being done, or should be done \nunder existing rules. This new rule is a guide and a tool, not an \ninflexible mandate.\n\n  According to the Department of Labor, thirty-two states have some \nform of safety and health program. Four States (Alaska, California, \nHawaii, and Washington) have mandated comprehensive programs that have \ncore elements similar to those in OSHA's draft proposal. In these four \nstates, injury and illness rates fell by nearly 18 percent over the \nfive years after implementation, in comparison with national rates over \nthe same period.\n  I'd like to share with my colleagues two examples from my home state \nof Massachusetts that show how business and labor can benefit from \nsuccessful ergonomics programs. Crane & Company, a paper company \nlocated in Dalton, Massachusetts signed an agreement with OSHA to \nestablish comprehensive ergonomics programs at each of their plants. \nAccording to the company's own report, within three years of starting \nthis program, the company's musculoskeletal injury rate was almost cut \nin half.\n  Lunt Silversmiths, a flatware manufacturer in Greenfield, was \ntroubled by high worker's compensation costs. One OSHA log revealed \nthat back injuries were the number one problem in three departments. By \nimplementing basic ergonomic controls, lost workdays dropped from more \nthat 300 in 1992 to 72 in 1997, and total worker's compensation costs \nfor the company dropped from $192,500 in 1992 to $27,000 in 1997.\n  That's the difference this common sense approach can make. And, Mr. \nPresident, in spite of the arguments for the Bond amendment, there bulk \nof the science and the research proves that an ergonomic standard is \nneeded in the American workplace.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, the same group directed in this \namendment to complete a study on this issue, already has compiled a \nreport entitled Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders. And the report \ntells us that workers exposed to ergonomic hazards have a higher level \nof pain, injury and disability, that there is a biological basis for \nthese injuries, and that there exist today interventions to prevent \nthese injuries.\n  In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \ncompleted a critical review of epidemiologic evidence for work-related \nmusculoskeletal disorders of the neck, upper extremity, and lower back. \nThis critical review of 600 studies culled from a bibliographic \ndatabase of more than 2,000 found that there is substantial evidence \nfor a causal relationship between physical work factors and \nmusculoskeletal disorders.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, we are not talking about a new \nphenomenon, or the latest fad. In 1990, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth \nDole, in response to evidence showing that repetitive stress disorders \n(such as carpal tunnel syndrome) were the fastest growing category of \noccupational illnesses, committed the agency to begin working on an \nergonomics standard. This rulemaking has been almost ten years in the \nmaking. Now is the time to put something in place for the American \nworker.\n  This rule has been delayed for far too long. In 1996, the Senate and \nthe House\n\n[[Page S12174]]\n\nagreed to language in an appropriations conference report that would \nprevent OSHA from developing an ergonomics standard in FY 1997. In \n1997, Congress prevented OSHA from spending any of its FY 1998 budget \non promulgating an ergonomics standard. Last year, money in the FY 1999 \nbudget was set aside for the new NAS study cited in this amendment, and \nthe then-Chairman and Ranking Members of the House Appropriations \nCommittee sent a letter to Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, stating \nthat this study ``was not intended to block or delay OSHA from moving \nforward with its ergonomics standard.''\n  Mr. President, we should wait no longer for this standard to be \nproposed, and workers should not have to wait until a new study is \ncompleted to be directed from preventable injuries. The time to protect \nthe American workplace is now.\n  People on the other side of this issue may argue that this is an \nexpensive rule, or that the science is inadequate. This is simply not \ntrue. The changes envisioned by the rule will increase productivity and \nsave costs. The studies have been numerous. Preventing OSHA from even \nworking on an ergonomic standard, much less issuing one, at the \neleventh hour is not the right approach for American workers.\n  This standard is a win-win for workers and management: the better \nthat workers are protected, the more time they spend on the job. The \nmore time they spend on the job, the more productive the workplace. And \nit is obvious, but it bears restating, the more productive the \nworkplace, the more productive this country. Workers want to be at \nwork, and their bosses want them at work.\n  We ought to be capable--as a Senate--to put that common sense \napproach and this simple ergonomics standard into place and we all be \nable to vote against the Bond amendment and help out workers and our \nbusinesses move forward together.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri. This amendment would needlessly \ndelay OSHA from implementing regulations to prevent one of the leading \ncauses of work place injuries, musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).\n  Each year, more than 600,000 American workers suffer work related \nMSDs and it is costing businesses $15 to $20 billion in workers' \ncompensation costs alone. It is estimated that one out of every three \ndollars spent on worker's compensation is related to repetitive motion \ninjuries.\n  Many of the jobs that are disproportionately subject to ergonomic \ninjuries are held by women. In fact, while women experience 33 percent \nof all serious workplace injuries, they suffer 61 percent of repetitive \nmotion injuries. This includes:\n  91 percent of all injuries related to repetitive typing;\n  61 percent of repetitive placing injuries;\n  62 percent of work related cases of tendinitis; and\n  70 percent of carpal tunnel syndrome cases.\n  The supporters of this amendment argue that OSHA should delay \nergonomic protection until the National Academy of Sciences completes a \nsecond review of existing studies. This comes despite the fact that \nthere is already substantial scientific evidence linking MSDs to the \nworkplace.\n  The first study completed by the National Academy of Sciences found \nthat ``research clearly demonstrates that specific interventions can \nreduce the reported rates of musculoskeletal disorders for workers who \nperform high-risk tasks.'' That peer reviewed study was conducted just \nlast year.\n  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reviewed \nmore than 2,000 studies of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. They \nconcluded that ``compelling scientific evidence shows a consistent \nrelationship between musculoskeletal disorders and certain work related \nfactors.''\n  In a letter to the Department of Labor, William Grieves, president of \nthe American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, notes \nthat ``there is an adequate scientific foundation for OSHA to proceed \nwith a proposal and, therefore, no reason for OSHA to delay the \nrulemaking process while the National Academy of Science panel conducts \nits review.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         American College of Occupational and Environmental \n           Medicine,\n                                                February 15, 1999.\n     Charles N. Jeffress,\n     Assistant Secretary of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health, \n         U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Jeffress: The American College of Occupational and \n     Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) urges you to move forward with \n     a proposed Ergonomics Program Standard.\n       The College represents over 7,000 physicians and is the \n     world's largest occupational medical society concerned with \n     the health of the workforce. Although the College and its \n     members may not agree with all aspects of the draft proposal, \n     we support the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administrations's (OSHA) efforts to promulgate a standard. An \n     ergonomics program standard that ensures worker protection \n     and provides certainty to employers is preferable to the \n     uncertainties of the general duty clause. As physicians, the \n     College's members will vigorously participate during \n     rulemaking to ensure that a final standard is protective of \n     workers, represents the best medical practices and is \n     supported by the science of musculoskeletal diseases.\n       It is incumbent on OSHA to carefully consider the science \n     and to give all due consideration to the results that will \n     come from the National Academy of Science panel's review of \n     the scientific literature regarding musculoskeletal \n     disorders. However, there is an adequate scientific \n     foundation for OSHA to proceed with a proposal and, \n     therefore, no reason for OSHA to delay the rulemaking process \n     while the National Academy of Science panel conducts its \n     review.\n       The College looks forward to its active participation in \n     this rulemaking. In the interim, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me or Dr. Eugene Handley, Executive Director.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William Greaves,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. All of these studies have found links between \nrepetitive motion injuries and workplace factors and suggest that OSHA \nmust be permitted to go forward with sensible regulations to insure a \nsafe workplace.\n  Ergonomic programs have proven to be effective in reducing repetitive \nmotion injuries in the workplace. Many businesses which have \nvoluntarily instituted an ergonomic program have found the long term \nbenefits to far outweigh the short term costs.\n  Red Wing Shoes in Minnesota found that their workers' compensation \ncosts dropped 75 percent in the 4 years after they began an ergonomic \nprogram.\n  Fieldcrest-Cannon in Columbus, Georgia, saw the number of workers' \nsuffering from repetitive motion injuries drop from 121 in 1993 to 21 \nin 1996.\n  By redesigning its workstations, OshKosh B'Gosh reduced workers' \ncompensation costs by one-third.\n  Mr. President, I certainly agree that decisions on government \nregulations should be based on sound science. In this case, there is \nalready a substantial body of scientific evidence which concludes that \nthere is a relationship between MSDs and the workplace and that \nergonomic programs can significantly reduce these injuries.\n  During this decade, more than 6.1 million workers have suffered from \nserious workplace injuries as a result of ergonomic hazards. As we move \ninto the next century, American workers must be given adequate \nprotection from these preventable injuries. Congress must allow OSHA to \nmove forward with sensible ergonomic regulations. I urge my colleagues \nto vote to defeat this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bond \nAmendment. It's bad for American workers and bad for our economy.\n  OSHA must move forward with an ergonomics standard. Each year, more \nthan 600,000 individuals in our private sector work force miss time due \nto ergonomic injuries, or musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). These \ninjuries cost our economy over $80 billion annually, including \napproximately $60 billion on lost productivity costs. Nearly $1 out of \nevery $3 in worker's compensation payments result from MSDs.\n  More importantly, these injuries cause terrible pain and suffering--\nas well as increased health care costs. OSHA's ergonomics standard is \nsupported by overwhelming scientific evidence. The National Academy of \nSciences (NAS) study concluded that workplace interventions can reduce \nthe incidence of MSDs. When this study\n\n[[Page S12175]]\n\nwas funded in 1998, the Appropriations Committee and the Administration \nagreed that funding this study was not a mechanism for delaying the \nOSHA standard. We must honor our agreement and let OSHA do it's work on \nbehalf of working men and women in our country.\n  Mr. President, ergonomics is also a women's issue. Women account for \nnearly 75% of lost work time due to carpal tunnel syndrome and 62% of \nlost time due to tendinitis. Many of the women affected by MSDs are in \nthe health care industry, including nurses, nurse aides and health care \naides. Women in the retail industry are also disproportionately \naffected by ergonomic injuries.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to help improve workplace safety by \njoining me in opposing this amendment. As a great nation, it is our \nduty to protect our most valuable resource--our working men and women.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, we \nhave been debating for the last hour or so--although we did have a \ndiscussion on the Wellstone amendment--the issue of the Bond amendment \ndealing with ergonomics. We have been debating it for a significant \nperiod of time. I personally am ready to vote on the amendment. I know \nthere has been some discussion on both sides, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that we have 30 additional minutes equally divided on the Bond \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I think most things have been said \non this amendment that need to be said. I don't know if Members want \nmore debate. I will make an additional request, and that is that we \nhave 2 hours of debate on the Bond amendment equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I say to my \nfriend from Oklahoma, this deserves some attention. We have 600,000 \npeople a year who are injured as a result of these accidents. We had \nover 2,000 studies. The time is here to go forward with some rules and \nregulations to protect American workers. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will make one additional try. I ask \nunanimous consent that we have 4 hours equally divided on this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I have been on the floor--\nthis is the fifth or sixth day--trying to work with the majority to \nmove this bill along. We have worked with the Members on the minority. \nWe have moved a significant number of amendments, probably 65 or 70. We \nare to a point now where this bill could be completed but for this one \ncontentious issue. From the very beginning, we have said this is an \nissue that deserves a lot of attention. We say, again, we are willing \nto work with the majority on this bill, but if this matter is here, we \nare going to have to discuss it. The American people, 600,000 a year, \nare injured with these accidents. It deserves more than 2 hours or 4 \nhours. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a minimum \nwage amendment be in order and that we have 1 hour of debate on that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in light of the fact that we are not \ngoing to get a time agreement on ergonomics, on the Bond amendment, in \na moment I will move to table, as manager. First, I would like to move \nahead on sequencing after the vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, be recognized at the conclusion of the vote and then, following \nSenator Byrd's statement, we move to the amendment to be offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, so we will be on notice that \nthat will be the next order of business.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection to the \nrequest?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is it the \nintention to withdraw the amendment, then, if it is not tabled?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let's have the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it the intention to withdraw the amendment if it is \nnot tabled?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond to the Senator from Massachusetts, it \nis not my amendment, but it is my hope, as manager of the bill, that \nthat would happen. But that is up to the offeror of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, unless such is clear, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to table the Bond amendment No. \n1825 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, was the unanimous consent request agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was objected to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the vote, I be recognized for not to exceed 30 minutes to \nspeak on another matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator will have 30 minutes \nfollowing the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) is \nabsent because of family illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 2, nays 97, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 319 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--2\n\n     Jeffords\n     Specter\n       \n\n                                NAYS--97\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Dodd\n       \n  The motion to table was rejected.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in view of the time that has been spent \ndiscussing this very important issue, and also the fact there have been \nseveral attempts to find ways to limit the debate, and now in view of \nthe vote on the motion to table which was unanimous against tabling it, \nputting the Senate back to exactly the position we were in before, I \nthink the thing to do at this time is to withdraw this amendment and \nmove forward.\n  I think that is a mistake. I want to say to one and all, this issue \nwill be joined further, and we will find a way for the content of this \namendment to be in some legislation and passed through the Congress \nthis year.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it has become clear to me that my amendment, \nwhich would force OSHA to do their job correctly instead of hastily, is \na bigger concern to those on the other side than the wide range of \nbenefits that the underlying Labor/HHS appropriations bill provides. \nThis disappoints me tremendously.\n  However, because the Labor/HHS appropriations bill will provide \nfunding for so many programs that will help causes I support, I will \nnot allow my amendment to prevent passage of this bill.\n  By allowing OSHA to go forward at this moment, we are saying that it \nis\n\n[[Page S12176]]\n\nacceptable for an agency charged with protecting employees to \npromulgate a regulation that has insufficient scientific and medical \nsupport. We are saying that it is acceptable for OSHA to tell employers \nthat we don't have the answers, but we expect you to come up with them, \nand we will fine you if you don't. We are saying that it is acceptable \nfor an agency that should be focusing on helping employers protect \ntheir employees from hazards, instead to tell them that they have no \nidea how to help them do this, but it would be OK for them to be cited \njust the same.\n  The heart of this issue is that although there have indeed been many \nstudies conducted, they have not managed to answer the critical \nquestions that employers need to know to be able to protect their \nemployees: ``How much lifting is too much?'', How many repetitions are \ntoo many?'', and ``What interventions can an employer implement to \nprotect his or her employees?'' This is what we mean by saying that \nthere is not sufficient sound science to support this regulation.\n  This regulation, whenever it comes out and takes effect, will be the \nmost far reaching regulation ever issued by OSHA. It will be one of the \nmost far reaching regulations from any agency and will ultimately \neffect every business in this country. To say that we will allow OSHA \nto proceed with a regulation of this nature, that we know is horribly \nflawed and without adequate scientific and medical support, borders on \na dereliction of our duty.\n  Many speakers opposed to my amendment have focused on the number of \nworkers who are believed to be suffering from ergonomics injuries. One \nof the great uncertainties about this issue is that we don't even know \nwhat it means to be in that group. That number includes many people who \nsuffer from common problems like back pain which may or may not have \nany connection to the workplace. What constitutes a musculoskeletal \ndisorder is one of those questions around which there is still no \nconsensus within the medical and scientific communities.\n  Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA has jurisdiction \nonly over workplace safety questions. If the condition which represents \na hazard is not part of the workplace, OSHA has no authority to compel \nan employer to address the problem. With ergonomics, there is no way \nfor an employer to be able to tell when a condition has arisen because \nof exposures at the workplace or because of activities or conditions \nthat have nothing to do with the workplace. Many factors such as age, \nphysical condition, diet, weight, and even family history can influence \nwhether someone is vulnerable to an ergonomic injury. We still don't \nknow why two workers doing the same work for the same amount of time \nwill have different experiences with injuries. It is simply beyond an \nemployer's role and ability to ask them to determine how much of an \ninjury may have been caused by factors outside their control. I do not \nbelieve that we should be telling employers that they should intrude \ninto their employee's private lives to the degree that would be \nnecessary to eliminate all possibility of suffering an ergonomic \ninjury.\n  I will continue to seek opportunities to come back to this issue \nbecause I believe so strongly that without sound science on this issue, \nOSHA's regulation on ergonomics will force many small businesses to \nchoose between complying and staying in business. Under this decision \neveryone loses. However, in the interest of moving the Labor/HHS \nappropriations bill, I will allow my amendment to be withdrawn.\n\n\n                      amendment no. 1825 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that amendment 1825 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1825) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12176-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12176-S12178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate tomorrow is scheduled to begin \ndebate on one of the most important and solemn matters that can come \nbefore this body--a resolution of ratification of a Treaty of the \nUnited States. The Treaty scheduled to come before us on Friday is the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, commonly referred to as the \nCTBT.\n  Consideration of a Treaty of this stature is not--and it should never \nbe--business as usual. A Treaty is the supreme law of this land along \nwith the Constitution and the Laws that are made by Congress pursuant \nto that Constitution. Article VI of the Constitution so states: ``This \nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in \nPursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under \nthe Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the \nLand; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing \nin the Constitution of Laws of any State to the Contrary \nnotwithstanding.''\n  Mr. President, consideration of a Treaty is not business as usual.\n  And yet, Mr. President, I regret to say that the Senate is prepared \nto begin consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty under a \ncommon, garden-variety, unanimous consent agreement, the type of \nagreement that the Senate has come to rely upon to churn through the \nnuts-and-bolts legislation with which we must routinely deal, as well \nas to thread a course through the more contentious political minefields \nwith which we are frequently confronted.\n  In fact, unanimous consent agreements have become so ubiquitous that \nsilence from a Senator's office is often automatically assumed to be \nacquiescence. So it was the case when this unanimous consent request \ncame to my office. I was not in the office at the time. We are very \nbusy doing other things, working on appropriations bills, and so on. \nAnd so at the point when this unanimous consent agreement proposal \nreached my office, I was out of the office. When I came back to the \noffice a little while later, the request was brought to my attention. \nBut by the time it was brought to my attention, it was too late. I \nnotified the Democratic Cloakroom that I would object to the unanimous \nconsent agreement, but I was informed that the agreement had already \nbeen entered into.\n  I make this point not to criticize the well-intentioned objective of \nthis unanimous consent agreement, which was to seek consensus on the \nhandling of a controversial matter. I do not criticize the two leaders \nwho devised the agreement. I criticize no one. I do, however, point out \nthe unfortunate repercussions of the agreement as it affects the \nSenate's ability to consider the ratification of a treaty.\n  In short, unanimous consent is a useful tool, and it is a practical \ntool of the Senate. I suppose I may have, during the times I was \nmajority leader of the Senate, constructed as many or more unanimous \nconsent agreements than perhaps anybody else; I certainly have had my \nshare of them, but it is not an all-purpose tool.\n  The unanimous consent agreement under which the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty is to be considered reads as follows, and I now read from \nthe Executive Calendar of the Senate dated Thursday, October 7, 1999.\n\n       Ordered, That on Friday, October 8, 1999, at 9:30 a.m., the \n     Senate proceed to executive session for consideration of the \n     Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty; that the treaty be \n     advanced through the various parliamentary stages, up to and \n     including the presentation of the resolution of ratification; \n     that it be in order for the Majority Leader and the \n     Democratic Leader to each offer one relevant amendment; that \n     amendments must be filed at the desk 24 hours before being \n     called up; and that there be a time limitation of four hours \n     equally divided on each amendment.\n       Ordered further, That there be fourteen hours of debate on \n     the resolution of ratification equally divided between the \n     two Leaders, or their designees; that no other amendments, \n     reservations, conditions, declaration, statements, \n     understandings or motions be in order.\n       Ordered further, That following the use or yielding back of \n     time and the disposition of the amendments, the Senate \n     proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution of \n     ratification, as amended, if amended, all without any \n     intervening action or debate.\n\n  So if one reads the agreement, it is obvious that the treaty itself \nwill not be before the Senate for consideration. I allude to the words \nin the unanimous consent request, namely:\n\n       . . . that the treaty be advanced through the various \n     parliamentary stages, up to and including the presentation of \n     the resolution of ratification.\n\n\n[[Page S12177]]\n\n\n  So the Senate will not have any opportunity to amend the treaty, \nitself, but it is the resolution of ratification that will be before \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, the foregoing unanimous consent agreement may be \nexpedient and there may be some who would even consider it to be a \nsavvy way to dispose of a highly controversial and politically divisive \nissue in the least amount of time with the least amount of notoriety. \nThe politics of this issue are of no interest to me. I am not \ninterested in the politics of the issue. I have not been contacted by \nthe administration in any way, shape, form, or manner. Nobody in the \nadministration has talked with me about this. I am not interested in \nthe politics of it. Not at all. There has been some politics, of \ncourse, abroad, about this agreement, but I am not a part of that. I \ndid join in a letter to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nurging that there be hearings, but I have not been pressing for a vote \non the treaty.\n  The politics of the issue do not interest me. But the propriety of \nthis unanimous consent agreement does. Simply put, it is the wrong \nthing to do on a matter as important and as weighty as an arms control \ntreaty.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee began a series of hearings on the \nCTBT just this week, and I commend the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee, Senator Warner, and the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Carl Levin, for their efforts and commitment to bring this \nmatter before the Senate and to have hearings conducted thereon.\n  The first hearing, on Tuesday, was a highly classified and highly \ninformative briefing by representatives of the CIA and the Department \nof Energy. I wish that all of my colleagues had the opportunity to hear \nthe testimony given at that hearing, and to question the witnesses. \nUnfortunately, only the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nwere privy to that information. I should say the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Biden, was \npresent also.\n  The second hearing, yesterday, brought before the Committee Defense \nSecretary Bill Cohen; General Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff; Dr. James Schlesinger, the former Secretary of Defense \nand Energy; and General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs. Again, their testimony was very illuminating. I wonder \nhow many of my colleagues, outside of the Armed Services Committee, and \nMr. Biden, had the opportunity to follow that hearing--which lasted \nalmost five hours--given the crush of other important business on the \nSenate floor?\n  My coilleagues simply haven't had the opportunity to do it, other \nthan those of us on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I wonder how many of my colleagues have had an opportunity, since the \nvote on the CTBT was scheduled last week, to analyze, question, and \ndigest the testimony and the opinions of the distinguished officials \nthat the Committee heard from yesterday? I wonder, for example, how \nmany of my colleagues heard from Secretary Cohen that a new National \nIntelligence Estimate that will have a major bearing on the \nconsideration of this Treaty is due to be completed early next year? It \nis my judgment that the Senate should have that assessment in hand \nbefore it considers imposing a permanent ban--a permanent ban--on \nnuclear testing.\n  The Armed Services Committee held its third, and I believe final, \nhearing on the CTBT this morning. The witnesses included Energy \nSecretary Bill Richardson, as well as the current directors of the \nnuclear weapons laboratories, and a selection of arms control experts, \nincluding a former director of one of the labs. Again, it was an \nextraordinarily informative hearing.\n  I was there for most of it. Unfortunately, I was scheduled to go \nelsewhere near the close of the hearing. But it was an extraordinarily \ninformative hearing. The laboratory directors were candid and \nforthcoming in their observations. They raised a number of important \nissues. I wonder how many of our colleagues here, outside the \nmembership of the Armed Services Committee, heard those.\n  I have attended every hearing and every briefing available this week \nin order to prepare myself for tomorrow's debate. But I did not prepare \nmyself before this agreement was entered into. When the agreement came \nto my office and I objected and found that I objected too late, then I \nbestirred myself to learn more about this treaty. I have listened to \nwitnesses, and I have questioned witnesses. I still have many \nquestions--more now than when I started.\n  I wonder how many of my colleagues--particularly those who have not \nhad the same entree that members of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nhave had to this week's hearings--have questions about this treaty. \nWith the exception of Senator Biden--and, incidentally, Senator Biden \nis very knowledgeable about the treaty. He has studied it thoroughly \nand is very conversant with the details of the treaty. Perhaps some of \nthe other members of the Foreign Relations Committee have done \nlikewise. But other than that committee and the Committee on Armed \nServices, I daresay that few Senators have had an opportunity to engage \nthemselves in a study of the treaty and even fewer, perhaps, have had \nthe opportunity to hear witnesses and to question those witnesses.\n  But, with the exception of Senator Biden, not even the members of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee have had the opportunity to hear and \nquestion the witnesses who appeared before the Armed Services Committee \nthis week. I wonder how many of my colleagues will participate in the \ndebate tomorrow and how many will participate in the debate next \nTuesday. These days are bookends around the holiday weekend when no \nvotes are scheduled after this evening until 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at the \nearliest. I am confident that many Senators have important commitments \nin their home States that may conflict with this debate. Does anyone in \nthis Chamber seriously believe we can give the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty the consideration it deserves in the amount of time that has \nbeen set aside to debate it?\n  Beyond the question of time, Mr. President, is an even more \ndisturbing question: The propriety of considering a major treaty under \nthe straitjacket of procedural constraints in which only two \namendments, one by each leader, will be in order. I have questions \nsince I have read this treaty. I have reservations. Perhaps they will \nbe put to rest by the debate. Or, it may be, as I continue to study the \ntreaty and listen to the debate, that I would want to offer an \namendment myself. I might want to offer an understanding or a \ncondition.\n  I might want to offer a reservation. I have done so on other \ntreaties. It may be that some of my colleagues would wish to do \nlikewise. We do not have that opportunity under this unanimous-consent \nagreement, with the exception of our two fine leaders. I know that they \nwill go the extra mile, as they always do, to accommodate the concerns \nof the Members. But they, too, are in a cul-de-sac--only one way in, \none way out. They are limited to one amendment each. Without exception, \nthe other 98 Members of the Senate are effectively shut out from \nexpressing, in any meaningful and binding way, reservations or concerns \nabout this treaty.\n  Mr. President, that is not the way to conduct the business of \nweighing a resolution dealing with the supreme law of the land. We \nmight do that on an agriculture bill. We might do it on a bill making \nappropriations for the Department of the Interior. But this is a treaty \nwe are talking about. A law can be repealed a year later but not a \ntreaty.\n  For the good of the Nation, this unanimous consent agreement ought to \nbe abandoned, and there are ways to do it. It is a unanimous-consent \nagreement, I understand that, and ordinarily a unanimous-consent \nagreement can only be vitiated by unanimous-consent, or it can be \nmodified by unanimous consent. But there are ways to avoid this vote. I \nurge my colleagues to put politics aside in this instance, at least, \nand to seek a consensus position on considering a comprehensive test \nban treaty that upholds the dignity of the United States Senate and \naccords the right to United States Senators to debate and to amend.\n  One need only read Madison's notes concerning the debates at the \nConvention to understand the importance of treaties in the minds of the \nframers.\n\n[[Page S12178]]\n\n We are talking here not about an appropriations bill; we are not \ntalking about a simple authorization bill; we are talking about \nsomething that affects the checks and balances, the separation of \npowers that constitutes the cornerstone of our constitutional system in \nthis Republic. This is one of those checks and balances; this involves \nthe separation of powers. The Senate, under the Constitution, has a \nvoice in the approval of treaties. The President makes the treaty, by \nand with the consent of the United States Senate.\n\n  I was here when we considered the Test Ban Treaty of 1963. I was on \nthe Armed Services Committee at that time. I listened to Dr. Edward \nTeller, an eminent scientist who opposed that treaty. I voted against \nthat treaty in 1963. I opposed it largely on the basis of the testimony \nof Dr. Edward Teller.\n  We need to listen to the scientists. We need to listen to others in \norder that we might make an appropriate judgment. Who knows how this \nwill affect the security interests of the United States in the future. \nThis is a permanent treaty. It is in perpetuity, so it is not similar \nto a bill. As I say, we can repeal a law. But not this treaty. This \ntreaty is in perpetuity--permanent. Maybe that is all right, but we \nneed more time to study and consider it.\n  We are told that the polls show the people of the Nation are \noverwhelmingly in favor of this treaty. I can trust the judgment of the \npeople generally, but the people have not had the opportunity to study \nthe fine print in this treaty. Most Senators have not. This is not a \nresponsibility of the House of Representatives. This is the \nresponsibility solely of the Senate under the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It is a great burden, a great responsibility, a very \nhigh duty, and we must know what we are doing.\n  I have heard dire warnings as to what a rejection of the treaty might \nmean. One way to have it rejected fast, I am afraid, is to go through \nwith this vote. But then how can we make up for it if we find we have \nmade a mistake? If we find that we are wrong, it may be too late then. \nWe had better stop, look, and listen and understand where we are going. \nWe need more hearings.\n  I hope we will put politics aside in this instance and seek a \nconsensus position on considering a comprehensive test ban treaty that \nupholds the dignity of the United States Senate. I am an \ninstitutionalist. I have an institutional memory. I have been in this \nbody for 41 years, and I have taken its rules seriously. I believe the \nframers knew what they were doing when they vested the responsibility \nin the Senate to approve or to reject treaties. We ought not take that \nresponsibility lightly. The very idea of the unanimous-consent request \nsays Senators cannot offer reservations; they cannot offer conditions; \nthey cannot offer amendments; they cannot offer understandings.\n  Let us so act that we reflect the importance of the treaty. Reject it \nif you will or approve it if you will, but let's do it with our eyes \nopen. Let's not put on blinders. Let's not bind our hands and feet and \nmouths and ears and minds with a unanimous-consent agreement that will \nnot allow unfettered debate or amendments.\n  Let the Senate be the institution the framers intended it to be.\n  I have not said how I shall vote on the treaty. I want to understand \nmore about it. But I want other Senators to have an opportunity to \nunderstand it as well.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senators for listening, and for their patience \nin indulging these remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, first let me commend the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for those very thoughtful remarks on the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I share his concern about the timing of the vote. I think the Senate \nis not yet ready to vote. My view is that there should have been \nhearings a long time ago. I attended part of the hearings--closed-door \nhearings--in S-407 on Tuesday of this week. They lasted about 5 hours.\n  I concur with the Senator from West Virginia that it is a very \ncomplex subject. I had studied the matter and had decided to support \nit. But I do think more time is necessary for the Senate as a whole--\nnot just to have a day of debate on Friday and a day of debate on \nTuesday and to vote on it. I think the Senate ought to ratify, but only \nafter adequate consideration has been given to it. While the United \nStates has been criticized for not taking up the treaty, if we were to \nreject it out of hand on what appears to be a partisan vote, it would \nbe very disastrous for our foreign policy.\n  So I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his customary very \nerudite remarks on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for his enlightened \nremarks. And, as always, he approaches a matter with an open mind, \ndevoid of politics, and with only the interest of doing good, not harm; \nand that is his response in this instance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12178-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12178-S12185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are now prepared to move on to our \nnext amendment. I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 minutes \nequally divided prior to a motion to table on the amendment to be \noffered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, \nrelative to Davis-Bacon, and no amendments be in order prior to a vote \nin relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1844\n\n (Purpose: To limit the applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act in areas \n                     designated as disaster areas)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. \n1844 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Smith) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1844.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . No funds appropriated under this Act may be used to \n     enforce the provisions of the Act of March 3, 1931 (commonly \n     known as the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a et seq.)) in any \n     area that has been declared a disaster area by the President \n     under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is a very simple, \nstraightforward amendment that would prohibit enforcing Davis-Bacon \nprevailing wage requirements in areas designated by the President as \nnatural disaster areas. Section 6 of the Federal Davis-Bacon Act allows \nthe President to suspend this act in the event of a national emergency.\n  I think all of us would agree, especially those Senators in North \nCarolina and in Virginia as well, that we did have a national emergency \nwith Hurricane Floyd.\n  Pursuant to this authority, President Bush suspended Davis-Bacon in \n1992 to help speed up and lower the cost of rebuilding the communities \nravaged by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki.\n  So Hurricane Floyd has dealt this tremendous blow to the residents of \nthe eastern seaboard, from Florida to North Carolina, even as far as \nNew York. FEMA has called this one of the biggest multistate disasters \nin U.S. history. Many States believe cleanup costs from Hurricane Floyd \nwill far exceed the costs of either Hurricanes Fran or Hugo. So \nrelaxing the Davis-Bacon provisions in these hard-hit States will lower \ntremendously the cost of rebuilding these communities and help create \njob opportunities for those in need of work.\n  Many people come to these communities and volunteer their time to \nhelp their friends and relatives and neighbors in need, and others cut \ntheir costs of services to help these unfortunate\n\n[[Page S12179]]\n\nvictims of the hurricanes. Davis-Bacon's prevailing wage requirements \nwill increase the cost of construction, forcing the taxpayers to pay \nmore and receive less in return. Not only that, it will cost the \nvictims more. So that is why there is a provision, a waiver provision, \nthe President may exercise to bring these costs down in times of \ndisasters.\n  Government estimates, economic studies, and those involved in the \nconstruction industry believe Davis-Bacon actually inflates the cost of \na construction project by an estimated 5 to 38 percent. For people who \nare the victims of these hurricanes--where there is Federal help--to \nhave to pay more in these construction projects and for it to cost the \ntaxpayers that much more money is outrageous. CBO estimates that Davis-\nBacon adds $9.6 billion over 10 years to the cost of all Federal \nconstruction projects.\n  The historic floodwaters of Floyd have resulted in hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in property damage and created a huge swath of \nhuman misery that will last for months. The Davis-Bacon Act should be \nsuspended to aid disaster relief in the areas designated as natural \ndisasters. It is reasonable. That is why there is a provision for a \nwaiver. It is unfortunate President Clinton has decided not to waive \nit, or at least has not waived it to this point.\n  On September 21, 1999, the Wall Street Journal, in an editorial \nentitled ``Hurricane Davis-Bacon,'' stated:\n\n       Folks whose electricity shorted out when floodwaters hit \n     their circuit box or shopkeepers sweeping the mud and debris \n     out from once-vibrant businesses need no reminders about the \n     costs imposed by Hurricane Floyd. But as they go about their \n     repairs they may find that the destructive powers of Mother \n     Nature are nothing compared with those of Washington.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Start with the Davis-Bacon Act, which effectively requires \n     that workers on federally subsidized construction projects \n     receive union wages--even though only about a quarter of the \n     construction industry is unionized. Davis-Bacon looms large \n     in the wake of Floyd because so much disaster relief comes \n     from the federal government. It was for precisely this reason \n     in 1992 that President George Bush ordered the relaxation of \n     Davis-Bacon rules to hasten repairs in Florida, Louisiana and \n     Hawaii after hurricanes devastated those states.\n\n  Continuing to quote from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The happy result was twofold: Not only did the work get \n     done faster, between 5,000 and 11,000 new construction jobs, \n     mostly to semi-skilled minority workers, were created. Alas, \n     the jobs didn't last long. Within days of becoming President \n     in 1993, Bill Clinton revoked the Bush waivers on Davis-Bacon \n     as a payback for organized labor's support. Mr. Clinton's \n     continued defense is particularly galling to many minority \n     workers, conscious of the law's origins in the Jim Crow \n     attitudes of the 1930s. ``People can't see the jobs and \n     buildings that aren't created because of Davis-Bacon, but \n     it is a major factor in the low-income housing crisis,'' \n     says Elzie Higginbottom, a low-income housing builder from \n     Chicago's South Side.\n\n       Clearly the priority after any natural disaster must be \n     getting help to the people who need it. But as we help the \n     victims of Floyd pump water out of their basements and get \n     their lives back on track, let's be careful not to contribute \n     to the structural damage with . . . Davis-Bacon that only \n     raise costs and make it that much harder to do the work that \n     needs to be done.\n\n  I think that editorial sums it up about as well as it can be summed \nup. The bottom line is, this act, which, ironically, discriminated \nagainst minorities--and that was the purpose of the act when it was \nfirst originated--will cost taxpayers millions of dollars and take \nadvantage of an unfortunate situation where people have suffered \nthrough a disaster.\n  I ask, what would be the problem of the President granting a waiver \nof Davis-Bacon? As I said before--and I think the Wall Street Journal \nsaid it better than I--the answer is, because the President owes a lot \nto organized labor, he is not about to do it. I think it is outrageous \nbecause the intent was clear.\n  I will read from a letter from 80 organizations in support of my \namendment. The list includes a number of outstanding national \norganizations. It also includes several State organizations \nrepresenting some of the States that have been hit hardest by Hurricane \nFloyd and other disasters. It is the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-\nBacon Act.\n\n       It is unfair to further burden the local communities \n     devastated by Hurricane Floyd and other disasters with the \n     inflated costs of Davis-Bacon.\n\n  Mr. President, I think Senators will recognize some of the \norganizations--I will not read them all; there are 80--the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, the American Trucking Association, \nAssociated Builders and Contractors, Citizens Against Government Waste, \nCitizens for a Sound Economy, Free Enterprise Institute, National \nAssociation of Home Builders, National Association of Manufacturers, \nNational Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, National Federation of \nIndependent Business, National League of Cities, National School Boards \nAssociation, National Tax Limitation Committee, National Taxpayers \nUnion, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to name a few of the 80.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Coalition to Repeal the\n\n\n                                              Davis-Bacon Act,\n\n                                                  October 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon \n     Act urges you to support the amendment by Senator Bob Smith \n     (R-NH) to relax the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act for disaster \n     stricken areas across the country, during the debate on the \n     Fiscal Year 2000 Labor/Health and Human Services and \n     Education Appropriations legislation.\n       Hurricane Floyd has devastated states along the eastern \n     seaboard, from Florida to North Carolina to New York, which \n     now face major reconstruction demands. It is clearly one of \n     the largest multi-state disasters in U.S. history. Relaxing \n     Davis-Bacon in these hard hit states will lower the cost of \n     rebuilding these communities and will help create job \n     opportunities for those in need of work.\n       Section 6 of the Davis-Bacon Act [40 U.S.C. 276a-5], allows \n     the suspension of the Act in the event of a ``national \n     emergency.'' Pursuant to this, President George Bush relaxed \n     Davis-Bacon rules in 1992 to hasten repairs in Florida, \n     Louisiana and Hawaii and lower the cost of rebuilding the \n     communities ravaged by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. As a \n     result, the work was completed faster and between 5,000 and \n     11,000 new construction jobs were created, mostly to semi-\n     skilled minority workers.\n       It is unfair to further burden the local communities \n     devastated by Hurricane Floyd and other disasters with the \n     inflated costs of Davis-Bacon. The Davis-Bacon Act has been \n     demonstrated to inflate construction costs by 5 to 38 percent \n     above what the project would have cost in the private sector. \n     Lifting Davis-Bacon restrictions would reduce unnecessary \n     federal spending and guarantee more construction for the \n     dollar as communities try to rebuild in the wake of \n     devastating disasters. Forcing disaster stricken communities \n     to be saddled with Davis-Bacon will just raise their costs \n     and make it harder to do the work that needs to be done.\n       The September 21, 1999, editorial in The Wall Street \n     Journal, ``Hurricane Davis-Bacon'' summarized, ``Clearly the \n     priority after any natural disaster must be getting help to \n     the people who need it. But as we help the victims of Floyd \n     pump the water out of their basements and get their lives \n     back on track, let's be careful not to contribute to the \n     structural damage with . . .

Mr. President, I am going to reserve the \nremainder of my time. It is my understanding that each side has 15 \nminutes on this debate; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. How much do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will yield the floor at the moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time does the Senator from Massachusetts want?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we get started with this debate on the \nquestion of Davis-Bacon, it is kind of interesting. Over the course of \nrecent days, we see a series of actions that have been directed at \nworking families. The problem that most working families in our Nation \nface is that they have not participated in the great economic surge we \nhave seen over recent times. Nonetheless, there is a continued effort \nto undermine their wages.\n  Let's start with the continuing denial by the majority to permit us a \nvote on the minimum wage. Then everyone in the country saw the actions \nof the Republican leadership recently, diverting the earned-income tax \ncredit in order to be used for balancing the budget. We have had recent \ndebates on the floor of the Senate about undermining the National Labor \nRelations Board, which tries to work out legitimate disputes on the \nbasis of laws that have been in effect for years. There was also action \ntaken on the floor of the Senate which cut back on the total number of \nOSHA inspections to protect workers in their workplaces in this \ncountry.\n  Beyond that, there have been the efforts to pass what is called comp \ntime, which would have eliminated the 40-hour workweek and abolished \novertime. All of that has been happening over the last 2 years.\n  I don't know why the other side has it in for, in this instance, \nconstruction workers. But the attacks seem to be fairly uniform, if we \nlook over the facts of the record in terms of working families. That is \ntrue with regard to pensions as well. We will have another time to \ndebate and discuss this. But those are the facts.\n  Rather than speculate on what is in an editorial or what is in a \nparticular report, the best way to look at this is, first, the average \nwage of a construction worker in this country is $28,000 a year. Maybe \nthat is too much for some Members of this body, but that is the average \nin terms of a construction worker. Yet the Senator from New Hampshire, \nin this amendment, says, in some parts of this country that isn't \nnecessary for a worker to be able to bring up a family. It seems to me \nthat $28,000, which is the average construction wage, is not an \nexcessive wage in this country.\n  Secondly, if you read the Davis-Bacon Act you will see that the \nPresident already has discretion to suspend the Davis-Bacon Act if he \nbelieves there is a national emergency and its in the national \ninterest. Presidents have in fact exercised this authority: President \nBush waived the Davis-Bacon Act in 1992 after Hurricanes Andrew and \nIniki. So the President has some flexibility if there are particular \nemergencies, but that is effectively being denied with the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Thirdly, if you look at various studies on Davis Bacon, including one \nby the University of Utah looking at 9 States that have repealed State \nDavis-Bacon laws, you see two very important facts: No. 1, there is a \ndramatic reduction in terms of training programs for construction \nworkers; and, No. 2, the quality of the work by construction workers \ndeteriorates, so the cost of doing business, rather than going down, \nactually goes up. Isn't that interesting? Now, with the amendment, we \nare trying to effectively undermine the wages construction workers \nwould receive in these circumstances.\n  And what do we find in the States that have actually repealed State \nDavis-Bacon? They may get a little bump in the first few months in \nterms of some bidding, but what happens is, with the dramatic reduction \nin training programs and dramatic reduction in skill, the costs of \nvarious contracts go up. We will have a chance to go through that.\n  That is the issue: Whether at this time we are going to say men and \nwomen who are earning $28,000 a year are to see their wages cut. Many \nof them lost their homes, too; many of the workers who would be \naffected by this amendment live in areas where there has been \ndevastation; many of these people have been wiped out completely and \nnow, not only are they trying to get back on their feet, but as a \nresult of this amendment, they will be denied at least the reasonable \ncompensation which they had received at other times. Of course, this \nhas implications in terms of the payment of taxes. This has important \nimplications in terms of health care costs because in most of these \ncontracts where you have Davis-Bacon, they have health care insurance.\n\n  You are going to find additional kinds of burdens on local \ncommunities. This hasn't been talked about. Workers will see \ninsufficient payments into their pension funds, which is going to mean \nthat retirement programs for these various workers are going to be \ncompromised, all under the guise that somehow we are helping the areas \nwhere many of our fellow citizens have suffered and suffered \nextensively as a result of these extraordinary acts of nature.\n  I am all set to support whatever is necessary to help those families \nin any of these areas--and no one can watch what has happened to people \nin North Carolina and along those flood zones and not be moved--but let \nus do it right. Let us do it correctly, and let us not take it out on \nconstruction workers who, in many instances, have been devastated. Let \nus make sure they are going to get a reasonable day's pay for a \nreasonable day's work.\n  If I may have 30 more seconds, I want to include in the Record that \nafter Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, the GAO tried to assess the savings \nfrom suspending Davis-Bacon, but the GAO report was unable to conclude \nthere were any savings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time does the Senator from Minnesota want?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Five minutes.\n\n[[Page S12181]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. We only have 15 minutes. How much time remains, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 26 seconds remain.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will use 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I find this amendment to be very \ntroubling, and I hope colleagues will support our effort to table it. \nThis amendment plays off hard-working people who are trying to make a \ndecent wage against people in communities that are faced with disaster.\n  In 1999, so far, there have been 72 disaster declarations in 36 \nStates, including Minnesota. The Smith amendment would suspend the \nDavis-Bacon application to all contracts in these areas for the entire \nyear.\n  I think what people in Minnesota and in our country are saying to us \nis, when there is a disaster in our community and we need the help, \nplease help us. I think what people in Minnesota and in the country are \nsaying to us is that the prevailing wage is important, a living wage is \nimportant, a family wage is important, so please don't go cutting our \nwages.\n  There is absolutely no reason in the world to play off construction \nworkers and the need to make a decent wage and support your family with \nwhether or not we are going to be able to provide disaster relief to \ncommunities. This is a false choice. It is, in many ways, an outrageous \nchoice. This amendment should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I find some of the remarks \nof my colleagues very interesting. To say this is a partisan attack \nagainst working people is so outrageous and so untrue that it barely \ndeserves a response. People who don't belong to unions also have \nfamilies. They also need to feed those families. Let's understand what \nis happening, if we can tone down the rhetoric a little bit. Nonunion \nworkers who want to stand side by side with the volunteers, who perhaps \nare putting sandbags up to stop the floodwaters from coming into \nsomebody's home, are asking to work at a lesser wage than the union \nworker to help these people out. And they can't do it under the Davis-\nBacon provision.\n  That is what we are talking about. There is no concern expressed on \nthe other side about the nonunion worker's family; it is only the union \nworker's family. We have people who are volunteering for no money, no \npay, to stand and help these victims of floods and other disasters, and \nthen we have nonunion people who are saying, look, maybe I am off from \nschool, or maybe I am taking off a few days from my own job to help my \nfriends, and I am willing to work for $5, $6, or $7 an hour, something \nless than the prevailing union wage. They can't do it. That is what we \nare talking about. This is the issue.\n  This is nothing more than a payback for the huge contributions that \ncome in from the labor unions, pure and simple. That is all it is. \nThere is no excuse for this. The provisions in the law are very clear. \nThe President could easily waive Davis-Bacon under the law, if he \nwished, but he doesn't want to do that. That is what we are hearing \nfrom the other side--lack of concern for the working man, unless he is \na union man. If he is a union man, we have to protect him. If he is a \nnonunion man, who cares, we don't care about his family.\n  Mr. President, I will submit for the Record a September 30 letter to \nPresident Clinton, interestingly, signed by 20 Members of Congress, \nincluding 7 from flood-damaged North Carolina. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record, along with an editorial from the \nWashington Times.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1999.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States of America,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge you to relax \n     Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements to facilitate \n     repairs in states hardest hit by Hurricane Floyd. As you \n     know, Hurricane Floyd has dealt a devastating blow to \n     residents along the eastern seaboard from Florida to North \n     Carolina to New York. The Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA) has called this one the biggest multi-state disasters \n     in U.S. history. Many states believe that clean-up costs from \n     Hurricane Floyd will far exceed the cost of either Hurricane \n     Fran or Hugo.\n       In North Carolina some 1,000 roads and 40 bridges remain \n     closed, as are sixteen school systems. Thousands remain \n     without electricity and an estimated 30,000 homes were \n     damaged or destroyed by the storm and flooding with 1,600 \n     beyond repair. Agricultural impacts are estimated at more \n     than $1 billion in North Carolina with more than 110,000 hogs \n     and 1,000,000 chickens and turkeys killed by the storms. \n     Water systems in nine counties are contaminated and many \n     wastewater treatment plants are wholly or partly out of \n     operation. FEMA estimates that nearly 7,100 homes are \n     reported to be either destroyed or heavily damaged in South \n     Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and other states. And while \n     nearly a week has gone by since Floyd's arrival, it is \n     anticipated that even more damage will be uncovered as the \n     flood waters retreat.\n       As you may recall, President George Bush suspended to the \n     Davis-Bacon Act in 1992 to help speed up and lower the cost \n     of rebuilding the communities ravaged by Hurricanes Andrew \n     and Iniki. President Bush took this action pursuant to \n     Section 6 of the Act [40 U.S.C. 276a-5] which allows the \n     President to suspend the Act in the event of a ``national \n     emergency.''\n       The economic effects of this hurricane are significant. \n     Many businesses have been damaged or destroyed. Thousands of \n     individuals have either lost their livelihoods or can not \n     make it to work because of impassable roads. It may be months \n     or years before these communities are rebuilt and a record \n     amount of federal assistance will be needed to do so.\n       Relaxing Davis-Bacon in these hard hit states will lower \n     the cost of rebuilding these communities and will help create \n     job opportunities for those in need of work. Davis-Bacon \n     prevailing wage requirements increase the cost of \n     construction--forcing taxpayers to pay more and receive less \n     in return. Government estimates, economic studies, and those \n     involved in the construction industry believe that the Davis-\n     Bacon Act inflates the cost of a construction project by an \n     estimated 5 to 38 percent. The Congressional Budget Office \n     estimates that Davis-Bacon adds about $9.6 billion (over 10 \n     years) to the cost of all federal construction projects.\n       The historic floodwaters of Floyd has resulted in hundreds \n     of millions of dollars in property damage and created a huge \n     swath of human misery that will last for months. We urge you \n     to suspend the application of Davis-Bacon for disaster relief \n     in the areas affected by Hurricane Floyd.\n           Sincerely,\n         Bill Goodling, Bill Barrett, Vernon J. Ellers, Sue \n           Myrick, Charles H. Taylor, ------ ------, Matt Salmon, \n           ------ ------, Tillie K. Fowler, Pete Hoekstra, Cass \n           Ballenger, Richard Burr, Walter B. Jones, Howard Coble, \n           Joe Knollenberg, Ron Paul, Tom Tancredo, Bob Schaffer, \n           Robin Hayes, Nathan Deal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, October 1999]\n\n                        Flood Relief for Unions\n\n       Bailing out after Hurricane Floyd was bad enough. What the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency called one of the biggest \n     disasters in history destroyed or damaged more than 30,000 \n     homes and closed some 1,000 roads, 40 bridges and 16 school \n     systems in North Carolina alone. But now the victims of \n     Hurricane Floyd must also deal with a man-made problem: North \n     Carolina residents and those of other states may have to \n     endure union attempts to gouge them out of their flood \n     relief. The Davis-Bacon Act dictates that persons working on \n     federally subsidized projects receive the so-called \n     prevailing wage. In practice, of course, that means the \n     prevailing union wage, which is invariably higher than \n     whatever wage employer and employee might agree to without \n     government interference. Big Labor's friends in Congress \n     passed Davis-Bacon to price out of the market low-wage \n     competition and thereby protect the union cartel on federal \n     projects.\n       So effective has this union-only requirement been that by \n     some government estimates Davis-Bacon arbitrarily boosts the \n     price of construction projects as much as 38 percent. Since \n     taxpayers rather than lawmakers must absorb the cost of this \n     shakedown, Congress has seen little need for reform.\n       But applying Davis-Bacon to flood-relief work necessarily \n     means shifting flood relief from persons in desperate need of \n     help to paychecks for organized labor. Some lawmakers have \n     now written to President Clinton asking him to relax Davis-\n     Bacon for flood relief so hurricane victims, not unions, are \n     its beneficiaries. ``The economic benefits of this hurricane \n     are significant,'' said lawmakers in their Sept. 30 letter. \n     ``Many businesses have been damaged or destroyed. Thousands \n     of individuals have either lost their livelihoods or cannot \n     make it to work because of impassable roads. It may be months \n     or years before these communities are rebuilt and a record \n     amount of federal assistance will be needed to do so. \n     Relaxing Davis-Bacon in these hard-hit states will lower the \n     cost of rebuilding these communities and will help create job \n     opportunities for those in need of work.'' Among the \n     signatories are North Carolina lawmakers Sue\n\n[[Page S12182]]\n\n     Myrick, Charles Taylor, Cass Ballenger, Walter Jones, Howard \n     Coble, Robin Hayes and Richard Burr.\n       There is a precedent for relaxing Davis-Bacon. President \n     George Bush suspended the law in 1992 to speed relief work in \n     communities rebuilding after hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. The \n     statute provides that the president may suspend the law in \n     the event of a national emergency.\n       On the off chance that Mr. Clinton may be more sensitive to \n     the pleas of campaign supporters in organized labor than he \n     is to those of persons in need of flood aid, Sen. Bob Smith \n     has said he would offer an amendment to the Department of \n     Labor appropriations bill forbidding the department from \n     using federal funds to enforce Davis-Bacon in places the \n     president has designated as natural disaster areas, including \n     North Carolina and other hard-hit states. A vote could come \n     as early as today. Says Mr. Smith, ``The historic floodwaters \n     of Floyd have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     property damage and created a huge swath of human misery that \n     will last for months,'' says Mr. Smith. ``The Davis-Bacon Act \n     should be suspended to aid disaster relief.\n       It should not be a difficult vote, nor should it be a \n     difficult decision for Mr. Clinton, to agree to protect flood \n     victims from union gouging. With the national spotlight \n     focused on the anguish of those in North Carolina and \n     elsewhere, do the Clinton administration and its supporters \n     want to argue that Big Labor's bottom line is the only line \n     that matters? It's time to show some compassion. It's time to \n     suspend Davis-Bacon.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am opposed to the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The Davis-Bacon Act was passed in 1931, and it was enacted in order \nto see to it that the Federal projects would not pay lower than the \nprevailing wage rate in a given area. That is not necessarily a union \nrate, but may be a nonunion rate as well. The Federal Government has \nmoved in this direction in order to assure the quality of the work that \nwould be done. In order to have quality work done and to see to it that \npeople in a local area receive the work, the Federal Government has \nestablished this standard.\n  Federal contracts are awarded on a low bid proposition, to who makes \nthe lowest bid. If an out-of-area contractor were to come forward and \nmake a lower bid, that would deprive people in the area of that \nemployment and would not provide the kind of quality work that would be \nassured.\n  Robert Reischauer, head of the CBO, testified a few years ago that \nthe payment of the prevailing wage rate is designed to help the Federal \nGovernment get the kind of quality necessary. This was the quote of the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, Robert Reischauer, when he \ntestified before Congress on May 4, 1993.\n\n       Higher rates do not necessarily increase costs. If these \n     differences in wages were offset by hiring more skilled and \n     productive workers, no additional construction costs would be \n     involved.\n\n  It is also important to note that Davis-Bacon creates a financial \nincentive for contractors to fund and support apprenticeship training \nby allowing them to pay employees in registered apprenticeship programs \nless than the prevailing wage rate otherwise required.\n  When we have had votes on this matter--and I have looked for a \ncontested vote--as recently as 1996, there was bipartisan support to \nuphold Davis-Bacon. There is also a concern that if this exception were \nto be enacted on disaster areas, there would be a problem in finding \nskilled workers to come into the disaster areas and do the work. \nThirty-seven States are involved in disaster areas, including my State \nof Pennsylvania; and if the prevailing wage rate were to be disrupted \nfor the purposes of their Federal contracts, it would not be possible \nto get the same skilled laborers from the immediate area to come in and \nperform the necessary services.\n  As I say, Davis-Bacon has been enacted since 1931. It has a very \nimportant purpose--for the Federal Government to get quality work, \nincluding the considerations advanced by others on paying a fair wage. \nIt has been challenged from time to time, and while I respect the \narguments made by Senator Smith, it seems to me that this amendment \nought to be rejected.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 3 minutes \n21 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to Senator Reid of \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what this amendment would do is a number of \nthings that are not good for working men and women. It would be an \nautomatic suspension of the Davis-Bacon enforcement in areas where \nthere have been disasters. It would mean hundreds of thousands of \nconstruction workers who typically go to these areas to work would lose \nthe wage protections currently afforded them under the law. The \nPresident of the United States already has the authority to waive \nDavis-Bacon in the event of a national emergency.\n  So far this year disasters have been declared in 36 States, including \nNevada.\n  This amendment is ill timed, ill advised, especially in light of the \ndisasters that we had to deal with throughout the country.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is interesting that in \nthose 36 disasters that the Senator from Nevada spoke of, the President \nhas not decided to waive Davis-Bacon.\n  The history on it is remarkable. We have had bipartisan votes on this \nfloor on Davis-Bacon in the past in terms of some disasters. Presidents \nRoosevelt and Nixon also suspended Davis-Bacon to alleviate \nadministrative confusion and delay, and to control inflation.\n  There is a long--as I mentioned earlier, President Bush--history of \nbipartisan waivers and relaxation of the Davis-Bacon provisions.\n  There is also an interesting editorial in the Detroit News. I ask \nunanimous consent to have it printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I will read a brief \nexcerpt from that editorial, called ``End of Payoff.'' It says:\n\n       Here in Michigan, former deputy state treasurer and \n     Hillsdale College economics professor Gary Wolfram has \n     estimated that the prevailing wage law costs State taxpayers \n     $70 million to $100 million more than they would necessarily \n     have to pay each year for State and local public works \n     projects.\n\n  I am having a hard time understanding how it helps working men and \nwomen to increase their taxes to pay to clean up disaster areas. If \nsomebody could explain that to me, I might exchange my position.\n  For the life of me, I don't understand how it makes sense to charge \nthe taxpayers more money to clean up in unfortunate situations where we \nhave disasters. It makes no sense to me.\n  I conclude by saying that the Davis-Bacon Act is a Depression-era \nwage subsidy law. Its intent was demonstrated in the Congressional \nRecord, which was to preserve northern construction jobs for white \nunion men, and to prevent them from being taken by less expensive \nsouthern black labor.\n  That was the original intent of that law, and its impact on taxpayers \nwastes valuable Federal tax dollars. It is a discriminatory law that \nlimits equal access to work opportunities.\n  Finally, no one should take unfair advantage of people who are the \nvictims of disasters.\n  As I said to you earlier, volunteers give their time, and nonunion \npeople would like to come and help. They are going to be denied the \nright. They are not going to be able to work for the taxpayers or the \nFederal Government at a wage less than the prevailing union wage. It is \ngoing to cost the taxpayers.\n  Those people who would like to help and who also have families to \nfeed are going to be denied work. They are going to be told: Go home. \nYou can't work because we have to pay a wage higher than for which you \nare willing to work.\n  That is un-American. In America, it is an agreement between the \nemployer and the employee. If an employee wants to work for less, then \nthe employee has the right to do it.\n  I urge support of my amendment and oppose the motion to table.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                             End the Payoff\n\n       For close to 35 years, Michigan taxpayers have been paying \n     more than they should for public works projects because of a \n     political\n\n[[Page S12183]]\n\n     payoff known as Public Act 166 of 1965, commonly called the \n     ``prevailing wage'' law. State Rep. Wayne Kuipers has \n     proposed an elegant solution to this problem. Rep. Kuipers \n     has a bill that simply states that Public Act 166 of 1965 \n     ``is repealed.''\n       Rep. Kuipers' bill, HB 4193, should be promptly enacted. \n     The prevailing wage law requires that all state and local \n     governments pay union wages on their public works projects, \n     regardless of whether they can get the work done using less \n     costly nonunion labor. It is an act of pure economic \n     protectionism for one special interest.\n       In fact, it is a clone of the federal Davis-Bacon Act, \n     adopted by Congress in the 1930s for the odious purpose of \n     freezing lower-wage minority bidders out of federal public \n     works contracts. The U.S. General Accounting Office has long \n     advocated the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act.\n       Here in Michigan, former deputy state treasurer and \n     Hillsdale College economics professor Gary Wolfram has \n     estimated that the prevailing wage law costs state taxpayers \n     $70 million to $100 million more than they would necessarily \n     have to pay each year for state and local public works \n     projects.\n       The law was held in abeyance between 1994 and 1997. A \n     federal judge in Midland threw out the prevailing wage act, \n     but in 1997 a federal appellate court panel reinstated it. \n     During the interregnum, several school districts sold \n     construction bonds. When the law was upheld, they were left \n     with shortages because their bonds did not account for the \n     prevailing wage requirement.\n       The Legislature, instead of repealing the act, voted to \n     make up the difference for the affected school districts at a \n     cost of $20 million over 10 years. As we noted at the time, \n     this amounted to a $20 million bribe to organized labor \n     interests.\n       The Michigan Supreme Court, in a particularly benighted and \n     anti-taxpayer ruling last year, extended the prevailing wage \n     law to the construction of a student activity center, funded \n     by student fees and other nonstate appropriations, at Western \n     Michigan University. The court's majority acknowledged that \n     it was overturning a trial judge and two rulings by the state \n     Court of Appeals as well as a longstanding state Labor \n     Department interpretation, to reach this ruling.\n       Unions contend that the premium pay supported by the \n     prevailing wage is the result of their better-trained workers \n     and the superior quality of their work. Rep. Kuipers, R-\n     Holland, a former contractor has a different opinion: Let the \n     unions prove their case by competing for public construction \n     dollars without the artificial support of the prevailing wage \n     act.\n       The bill is in the House Employment Relations Committee. \n     Surely, this measure is one of the reasons for a Republican-\n     controlled Legislature.\n\n\n                                our view\n\n       The prevailing wage act imposes unnecessary costs on \n     taxpayers and should be repealed.\n\n\n                             opposing view\n\n       The act guarantees high-quality workmanship on public works \n     projects.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief reply, I think \nthat Davis-Bacon is American. It has been American since 1931, almost \nas long as I have been in America; right about the same time. It has \nworked very well.\n  There is merit to what the Senator from New Hampshire has argued in \nsome respects. But to say that it is not American, this has been the \nFederal law for a very long time.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the remainder of time to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, prevailing wage means just that. That is \nin a given area. The fact is that the average, as I mentioned, \nconstruction worker who will be affected by this earns $28,000 a year. \nThat is what it comes down to.\n  I refer to that University of Utah study which showed that injuries \nwent up and the cost of the buildings went up because there was a \ndeterioration in productivity and the skills that were necessary for \ncompletion.\n  It doesn't make any sense to bring this up as an amendment on this \nparticular bill.\n  Let's bring it back to committee. If the Senator has an argument to \nmake, let's follow the regular legislative process. Let us table this \namendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, it \nis not anticipated that this side of the aisle will use very much time. \nSo Senators should be prepared to vote perhaps even in advance of 5 \no'clock.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I will be pleased to use his \nadditional time if he wants me to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will shortly outline my amendment, \nwhich is a very important amendment dealing with community block grant \nmental health services. I want to start out, however, in a very \npersonal way.\n  Mr. President, the Governor of Minnesota, Governor Ventura, in an \ninterview with Playboy magazine said that he did not read books by \nErnest Hemingway because the writer killed himself. And he want on to \nsay:\n\n       I've seen too many people fight for their lives. I have no \n     respect for anyone who would kill himself. If you're a \n     feeble, weak-minded person to begin with, I don't have time \n     for you.\n\n  At Harvard University yesterday Governor Ventura was asked about his \nremarks, that suicide was for the feeble, weak-minded. And he said:\n\n       I do upwards of 25 interviews a week . . . over 1,000 \n     interviews a year. I'm human. You got good days; you got bad \n     days.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       I don't have sympathy, is what my feelings are on suicide. \n     . . . To me it's something that doesn't have to happen if \n     people take a positive attitude on life like I do.\n\n  Today the Surgeon General, David Satcher, gave a very eloquent \nspeech. Today is the ninth annual National Depression Screening Day. He \npointed out that suicide is the ninth leading cause of mortality in the \nUnited States, responsible for 31,000 deaths.\n  Mr. President, 85 Americans die every day having taken their lives. \nSuicide is the fourth leading cause of death for children ages 10 to \n14.\n  I want to respond to these remarks by Governor Ventura because I have \ndevoted so much of my work as a Senator in the mental health area, with \nSenator Domenici, my colleague from New Mexico, who is a Republican, \nand Senator Reid from Nevada.\n  First of all, let me acknowledge the work of Al and Mary Kluesner. \nThe Kluesners are wonderful people. Al and Mary Kluesner started an \norganization 10 years ago called SA/VE. This is an organization made up \nof family members. Many of them are parents who have lost their \nchildren. Al and Mary Kluesner have lost two children to suicide.\n  The Governor of Minnesota and all Americans need to understand that \nsuicide is directly linked to mental illness. The form of mental \nillness we are talking about is severe depression. When people struggle \nwith severe depression, they lose hope.\n  I want the Governor of Minnesota to understand that this mental \nillness is not a moral failing. I want Governor Ventura to understand \nthat all these families that have gone through so much pain need \nsupport. They do not need ridicule.\n  Today is the ninth annual National Depression Screening Day. This is \nwhen communities set up free confidential screening opportunities for \npeople to talk privately with mental health professionals, receive \neducational material about the symptoms and treatment for depression \nand, when appropriate obtain referrals for care.\n  Clinical depression is one of the most common illnesses. It affects \nmore than 19 million Americans a year. These educational programs are \nto be commended. But if we do not have the resources to fund proper \ntreatment for mental health illnesses, then all of this research and \nall of this education and all of this information may be for nothing.\n  The clinical care that is needed may never reach those who need it \nthe most.\n  Why? Because they cannot afford it.\n  Why? Because we do not have fairness--parity--in mental health \ncoverage.\n  Why? Because we drastically underfund public programs for mental \nhealth care, such as the mental health block grant program.\n  Why? Because of problems with mental health services provided through \nthe Medicaid programs, which represent 19 percent of nationwide mental \nhealth care.\n  Why? Because it seems we would rather incarcerate children with \nmental illness than to provide community treatment programs that are so \ndesperately needed.\n  Why? Because we do not provide coverage for medication in so many \nhealth care programs.\n  Untreated mental illness so often leads to tragedy such as suicide. \nWe know from today's congressional briefing on depression and the \nelderly an outstanding fact: The highest suicide rate--often the result \nof undiagnosed and untreated depression--is for white men over 85 years \nold--65.3 per 100,000 persons.\n  Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people ages \n15 to 24.\n  We need to increase funding for mental health services, not decrease \nit.\n  This amendment, which I will summarize in a moment----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I have heard with--I do not know if the word is ``horror'' \nbut certainly with disgust the statements made by the Governor of \nMinnesota. The Senator knows--because we have spoken--that 31,000 \npeople each year kill themselves. The Senator knows that; isn't that \ntrue?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it true that during the time we are going to be \ndebating this very important matter, there will be four people in our \ncountry during this hour's period of time who will kill themselves?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And for the Governor of the State of Minnesota to say--I am \nsorry to report--that these people in effect deserve to die because \nthey have problems, is not understandable. The Senator understands. We \nhave held hearings in the Senate dealing with suicide. We have heard \nfrom academics, we have heard from people from the entertainment \nindustry, we have heard from people from all walks of life because \nsuicide does not discriminate among people; it does not affect only one \nage group; it does not affect one economic group more than others; it \naffects everyone.\n  It is true, is it not, I say to my friend, that the vast majority of \nsuicides could be avoided if that person had some counseling and many \ntimes a little bit of medication? Isn't that true?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My colleague from Nevada is absolutely correct. That \nis why I had to respond to these comments by Governor Ventura from \nMinnesota. This is an illness. This is an illness that affects many \nAmericans. This is an illness that has led to such pain for so many \nfamilies.\n  I mentioned Al and Mary Kluesner from Minnesota who started an \norganization. Sheila and I have been to their gatherings, I say to my \ncolleague, for the last 3 years. Hundreds of people come, including \nparents who have lost their children to suicide. They do not need \nridicule. We need to understand this is not a moral failing. This is an \nillness. Suicide is the result of this illness. With treatment, we can \nprevent these deaths.\n\n[[Page S12185]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I will make one last statement, if I could.\n  The illness that leads people to commit suicide, it is no different \nthan someone that has tuberculosis, someone who has cancer; isn't that \ntrue?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Nevada, he \nis absolutely correct. The research over especially this last decade--\nwhich has focused on brain diseases--over and over and over again \npoints out that these diseases are comparable to physical illnesses. \nThey are diagnosable and they are treatable, but the big challenge for \nus is to overcome the stigma, to overcome the discrimination. That is \nwhy I am so outraged by these remarks by Governor Ventura.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I very much appreciate, admire, and respect \nthe Senator from Minnesota, who is on the floor now talking about these \nissues. We need to talk more about them.\n  We don't know why people kill themselves. We have some understanding, \nbut we need to study this. Thank goodness the Centers for Disease \nControl is now studying suicide. The Federal Government, for the first \ntime, has directed research to determine why 31,000 Americans, young \nand old, kill themselves every year.\n  Again, I appreciate very much the Senator from Minnesota having the \ncourage to talk about an issue some people refuse to acknowledge.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  I point out to the Senator from Nevada, this is the fourth leading \ncause of death among children, ages 10 to 14, suicide, among white \nmales. There are other populations as well. The rate of suicide among \nAfrican American males, ages 15 to 19, has increased 105 percent \nbetween 1980 and 1996.\n  Senator Specter and Senator Harkin have done a yeoman's job of \ngetting more support for these mental health services. What I am trying \nto do is take this mental health performance partnership block grant \nprogram, which supports comprehensive community-based treatment for \nadults with serious mental illnesses and children with serious \nemotional disturbances, back to the level of funding the President \nrequested. This is administered through the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration, SAMHSA.\n  I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, if I could have 5 more \nminutes to summarize this, we want to go to a voice vote, and this \namendment will be accepted. I will be honored.\n  Let me simply talk about the services that are so important. This is \nfunding for communities for programs that include treatment, \nrehabilitation, case management, outreach for homeless individuals, \nchildren's mental health services, and community-based treatment \nservices that have everything in the world to do with providing \ntreatment to people and enabling people to live lives with as much \nindependence and dignity as possible.\n  Right now the mental health block grant is funded at $310 million. \nThat is a small amount compared to the tremendous need. This amendment \nwould add $50 million. With this amendment, we could provide support \nfor some important community services that would make a tremendous \namount of difference.\n  I went over some of the gaps earlier. My colleague from Pennsylvania, \nwho is managing this bill on the Republican side, said there is an \nindication to accept this amendment. I will be very pleased. I know \ncolleagues want to move this along.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues, I \nappreciate the support for this. I know Senator Specter is committed to \nthis. I know Senator Harkin is as well. I would like to have this \namendment approved. I would like to see the additional resources. This \nis an extremely important program. We have to do a lot better in this \narea. We can do it at the community level, but for those adults--and we \nare, in particular, talking about adults with serious mental illnesses \nand children with serious emotional disturbances--all too often, they \nwind up out on the streets or they wind up in prison or they wind up \nnot receiving the care. So much of this illness is diagnosable. So much \nof it is treatable. There are so many ways we can help people.\n  I think accepting this amendment and making sure we can keep this \nlevel of funding as we go to the conference committee would be \nextremely important.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have been reviewing this amendment for \nadditional funding for the mental health block grant. It is obviously a \ngood program, beyond any question. The key issue is how far we can \nstretch in this bill. I have talked to the Senator from Minnesota and \ntold him that after consulting with some of my colleagues on this side \nof the aisle, we would be prepared to accept it on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment No. 2271.\n  The amendment (No. 2271) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment No. 1880.\n  The amendment (No. 1880) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12185-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12185-S12188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      APPOINTING JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Constitution provides that the \nPresident ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate, shall appoint * * * Judges of the Supreme Court, and all \nother Officers of the United States * * *'' Thus, the President has the \npower to nominate persons to serve as federal judges and the Senate has \nthe power to render advice and consent on these nominations. And the \nConstitution requires that the President's power to nominate be \nexercised ``with'' the Senate's power to advise and consent in order \nfor a final appointment to be made. To the extent such cooperation \noccurs, the appointment process will be fair, orderly, and timely. To \nthe extent such cooperation does not occur, the appointment process \nwill break down.\n  When I assumed the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, I inherited a \nprocess rocked by public strife and private in-fighting. I was \ndetermined to lower the temperatures on both sides of the Committee and \nto preside over a process that did not allow personal attacks on a \nnominee's character. To accomplish this I turned to the Constitution \nitself and its requirement that the President and the Senate work \n``with'' each other in the appointment process and the Constitution's \nlimits on the power of federal judges.\n  And it has worked. When the President has consulted with the \nCommittee and with home-state Senators, a nominee has moved through the \nprocess smoothly. Under my Chairmanship, the Committee has focused its \nreview on each nominee's, integrity, temperament, competence, and \nrespect for the rule of law. To date Republicans have confirmed 325 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees to the federal bench.\n  When there have been problems with a nominee, or a potential nominee, \nthe President's consultation with the Committee has enabled us to \naddress those problems privately. For example, a senator on the \nCommittee recently asked me to examine a potential nominee, and when \nthere were problems with that nominee, that Senator and I were able to \ndeal with the problem privately and I expect another candidate will be \nforthcoming soon. Thus, the process has worked without damaging a \ncandidate's reputation or his family.\n  When the President works with the Senate the process will adequately \nstaff the federal Judiciary. Indeed, after last year's extraordinary \nnumber of confirmations, the vacancy rate in the federal Judiciary was \nreduced to a very low 5.9%. The Chief Justice in his most recent report \non the state of the federal Judiciary congratulated the President and \nthe Senate, stating ``I am pleased to report on the progress\n\n[[Page S12186]]\n\nmade in 1998 by the Senate and the President in the appointment and \nconfirmation of judges to the federal bench ....''\n  As of today, the Judiciary Committee has held 5 hearings for judicial \nnominees and have reported 30 nominees to the floor of the Senate. \nThere are currently just 62 vacancies, yielding a vacancy rate of only \n7.4%. This is 1 vacancy less than existed at the end of the 103rd \nCongress when Democrats controlled the Judiciary Committee. Further, \nshould the Senate confirm the 8 nominees that are currently on the \nfloor and the 4 nominees for which we held a hearing today, the number \nof vacancies will fall to 51, yielding a vacancy rate of just 6%. This \nwill be the lowest vacancy rate for any first session of Congress since \nthe expansion of the judiciary in 1990. Moreover, it is virtually \nequivalent to the vacancy rate at the end of the last Congress, which \nwas the lowest vacancy rate for any session of Congress since the \nexpansion of the judiciary in 1990. When the President works with us \nand respects the constitutional advice and consent duties of the \nSenate, the process has, in fact, worked smoothly.\n\n  When the President fails to work with the Senate, however, the \nprocess does not work smoothly. This was the unfortunate case with \nJudge Ronnie White. The record shows that Judge White is a fine man. \nHowever, he has written some questionable opinions on death penalty \ncases. The record resulted in both Missouri Senators opposing his \nnomination on the floor. This record resulted in local and national law \nenforcement agencies opposing his nomination as well. Here are just \nsome of the letters expressing concern or opposition to Judge White's \nnomination:\n  The Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs oppose the nomination; the \nNational Sheriff's Association opposed the nomination; the Mercer \nCounty, Missouri prosecutor opposed the nomination; the Missouri \nSheriffs' Association expressed deep concern over one of Judge White's \ndissents in a death penalty case involving the murder of one sheriff, \ntwo deputies, and the wife of another sheriff, and asked the Senate to \nconsider that dissent in voting on Judge White's nomination. Indeed, 77 \nof 114 of Missouri's sheriffs asked for serious consideration of Judge \nWhite's record. The sheriff of Moniteau County, Missouri, whose wife \nwas murdered by the criminal for whom Judge White would have reversed \nthe death sentence wrote in opposition to the nomination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, October 4, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: I am writing to ask you to join the \n     National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) in opposing the \n     nomination of Mr. Ronnie White to the Federal Judiciary. NSA \n     strongly urges the United States to defeat this appointment.\n       As you know, Judge White is a controversial judge in \n     Missouri while serving in the Missouri Supreme Court. He \n     issued many opinions that are offensive to law enforcement; \n     one on drug interdiction and several involving the death \n     penalty. Judge White feels that drug interdiction by law \n     enforcement is too intimidating. He is more concerned with \n     his personal view of drug interdiction practices than with \n     the legitimate law enforcement effort to prevent the \n     trafficking of illegal drugs. Drug interdiction is a \n     cornerstone in the fight against crime, and this reckless \n     opinion undermines the rule of law.\n       Additionally, judge White wrote an outrageous dissenting \n     opinion in a death penalty case. In 1991 Pam Jones, the wife \n     of Sheriff Kenny Jones of Miniteau, Missouri, was gunned down \n     with three other law enforcement officials while hosting a \n     church service at home. The assailant, who was targeting the \n     Sheriff, was tried and convicted of murder in the first \n     degree. He was subsequently sentenced to death for the four \n     murders. During the appeals process, the case came before the \n     Missouri Supreme Court where six of the seven judges affirmed \n     the conviction and the sentence. Judge White was the court's \n     lone dissenter urging a lower legal standard to allow this \n     brutal cop killer a second chance at acquittal. In our view, \n     this opinion alone disqualifies Judge White from service in \n     the Federal courts. He is irresponsible in his thinking, and \n     his views against law enforcement are dangerous. Please read \n     Judge White's dissenting opinion in this case.\n       We urge you in the strongest possible terms to actively \n     oppose the nomination of Judge White. He is clearly an \n     opponent of law enforcement and does not deserve an \n     appointment to the Federal Judiciary. His views and opinions \n     are highly insulting to law enforcement, and we look forward \n     to working with you to defeat this nomination.\n           Respectfully,\n                                         Patrick J. Sullivan, Jr.,\n           Sheriff, Chairman, Congressional Affairs Committee and \n     Member, Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, NSA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Sheriff's Department,\n\n\n                                              Moniteau County,\n\n                                  California, MO, August 11, 1999.\n       Dear Fellow Sheriff: I am writing to you about Judge Ronnie \n     White of the Missouri Supreme Court, who has been nominated \n     to be a federal district judge. As Sheriffs' we go to work \n     for the people of Missouri every day. Our lives are on the \n     line. Every law enforcement, and every law-abiding citizen, \n     needs judges who will enforce the law without fear or favor. \n     As law enforcement officers, we need judges who will back us \n     up, and not go looking for outrageous technicalities so a \n     criminal can get off. We don't need a judge like Ronnie White \n     on the federal court bench.\n       In addition to being Sheriff of Moniteau County, I am a \n     victim of violent crime. So are my children. In December \n     1991, James Johnson murdered my wife, Pam, the mother of my \n     children. He shot Pam by ambush, firing through the window of \n     our home during a church function she was hosting. Johnson \n     also killed Sheriff Charles Smith of Cooper County. Deputy \n     Les Roark of Moniteau County and Deputy Sandra Wilson of \n     Miller County. He was convicted and sentenced to death. When \n     the case was appealed and reached the Missouri Supreme Court, \n     Judge White voted to overturn the death sentence of this man \n     who murdered my wife and three good law officers. He was the \n     only judge to vote this way.\n       Please read Judge White's opinion. It is a slap in the face \n     to crime victims and law enforcement officers. If he cared \n     about protecting crime victims and enforcing the law, he \n     wouldn't have voted to let Johnson off death row.\n       The Johnson case isn't the only anti-death penalty ruling \n     by Judge White. He has voted against capital punishment more \n     than any other judge on the court. I believe there is a \n     pattern here.\n       To me, Ronnie White is clearly the wrong person to entrust \n     with the tremendous power of a federal judge who serves for \n     life. Please write to our U.S. Senators, Christopher S. Bond \n     and John Ashcroft, and ask them to oppose the White \n     nomination. Ask them to persuade other Senators to do \n     likewise. Effective law enforcement saves lives. The \n     deterrent value of capital punishment saves lives. As a \n     federal judge, Ronnie White would hurt law enforcement and he \n     would oppose effective death penalty enforcement.\n       You can write to Senator Bond and Senator Ashcroft at U.S. \n     Senate, Washington, DC 20510. Please speak up before it's too \n     late.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kenny Jones,\n     Moniteau County Sheriff.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Missouri Federation of\n\n\n                                                Police Chiefs,\n\n                                 St. Louis, MO, September 2, 1999.\n     Senators John Ashcroft, and Christopher Bond,\n     Kansas City, MO.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft and Senator Bond: We have just \n     learned of the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to be a \n     federal district judge.\n       After reading Sheriff Kenny Jones' letter and seeing Judge \n     White's record, we were absolutely shocked that someone like \n     this would even be nominated to such an important position.\n       We want to go on record with your offices as being opposed \n     to his nomination and hope you will vote against him. A copy \n     of Sheriff Jones' letter is attached.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bryan Kunze,\n     Vice President, MFPC.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Missouri Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                           Jefferson City, MO, September 27, 1999.\n     Sen. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Attached please find a copy of the \n     dissenting opinion rendered by Missouri Supreme Court Judge \n     Ronnie White in the case State of Missouri, Respondent, v. \n     James R. Johnson, Appellant.\n       Also, please find attached a copy of a petition signed by \n     92 law enforcement officers in Missouri, including 77 \n     Missouri sheriffs.\n       In December 1991, James Johnson murdered Pam Jones, wife of \n     Moniteau County Sheriff Kenny Jones. He shot Pam by ambush, \n     firing through the window of her home during a church \n     function she was hosting. Johnson also killed Sheriff Charles \n     Smith of Cooper County, Deputy Les Roark of Moniteau County \n     and Deputy Sandra Wilson of Miller County. He was convicted \n     and sentenced to death. When the case was appealed and \n     reached the Missouri Supreme Court, Judge White voted to \n     overturn the death sentence of this man who murdered Mrs. \n     Jones and three good law officers.\n       As per attached, the Missouri sheriffs strongly encourage \n     you to consider this dissenting opinion in the nomination of \n     Judge\n\n[[Page S12187]]\n\n     Ronnie White to be a U.S. District Court Judge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              James L. Vermeersch,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n       We, the undersigned, understand that Judge Ronnie White of \n     the Missouri Supreme Court, has been nominated to be a United \n     States District Court Judge.\n       We need judges who can balance the duty of the law \n     enforcement officer to enforce the law with the preservation \n     of the Constitutional rights of the accused.\n       In 1993, one James Johnson was convicted and sentenced to \n     death for the ambush and murder of Pam Jones, the wife of the \n     Moniteau County Sheriff Kenny Jones and three other law \n     enforcement officers. Judge White rendered the only \n     dissenting opinion to reverse this conviction.\n       We respectfully request that consideration be given to this \n     dissenting opinion as a factor in the appointment to fill \n     this position of U.S. District Judge.\n       Position Agency:\n       Sheriff, Mississippi County; Sheriff, Pulaski County; Dade \n     County Sheriff; Sheriff of Vernon County.; Barry County \n     Sheriff; Barry County Deputy Sheriff; Franklin County \n     Sheriff; Sheriff, Mercer County.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Mercer County\n\n\n                                         Prosecuting Attorney,\n\n                                 Princeton, MO, September 3, 1999.\n     Hon. John D. Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC 20510\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: As Missouri Prosecutors, we work to \n     enforce the laws of our cities, counties, and the state of \n     Missouri on a daily basis. We are aware of significant \n     concern among law enforcement officials regarding the \n     nomination of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to \n     the federal bench. We share this concern.\n       Judge White's record is unmistakably anti-law enforcement, \n     and we believe his nomination should be defeated. His rulings \n     and dissenting opinions on capital cases and on Fourth \n     Amendment issues should be disqualifying factors when \n     considering his nomination.\n       Judge White has evidenced clear bias against the death \n     penalty from his seat on the Missouri Supreme Court. He has \n     voted against the death penalty more than any other judge \n     has. In capital cases, he has dissented more than any other \n     judge. Further, he has filed more lone dissents in capital \n     cases than any other judge. Without question Judge White has \n     displayed an anti-capital punishment bias that is second to \n     none on the Missouri Supreme Court.\n       One of the most terrible examples of this bias came in \n     State v. Johnson, when Judge White filed a lone dissent, \n     supporting reversal of the capital sentence imposed on Jim \n     Johnson. Johnson was sentenced to death for the murders of \n     Cooper County Sheriff Charles Smith, Moniteau County Deputy \n     Les Roark, Miller County Deputy Sandra Wilson, and Pam Jones, \n     the wife of Moniteau County Sheriff Kenny Jones. Except for \n     Judge White's dissent, the ruling against this brutal cop \n     killer was unanimous. Judge White was the lone member of the \n     Court to vote to give Johnson a new trial and a second chance \n     to go free.\n       In State v. Damask,  and State v. Alvarez, the Supreme \n     Court ruled 6-1 that drug checkpoints on main highways in \n     Franklin and Texas Counties were constitutional. Judge White, \n     again, disagreed alone. Judge White voted to throw out \n     evidence against accused drug traffickers who were arrested \n     at checkpoints on Interstate 44 and U.S. 60.\n       Another troubling concern, while not in itself sufficient \n     reason to disqualify, is Judge White's lack of significant \n     experience in trial courts. Certainly the nomination would be \n     less flawed if he had significant experience as either a \n     criminal litigator or trial judge. He has neither.\n       On the Missouri Supreme Court, the other six members of the \n     Court routinely override Judge White's outlandish dissenting \n     opinions. In Missouri, we are fortunate to have a Supreme \n     Court that is sympathetic to law enforcement, and prone to \n     interpreting the law as it is written. However, if Judge \n     White is placed on the federal bench, he will be a one-person \n     majority. His flawed opinions will be the only ones that \n     count, and barring an appeal to higher courts, he will be \n     accountable to no one.\n       People in the law enforcement community are rightly \n     concerned by Judge White's votes in cases like Johnson and \n     Damask. We urge you to show your support for the hard work of \n     Sheriffs, police officers, prosecutors, and other law \n     enforcement officials, and help defeat the nomination of \n     Judge White to the federal bench.\n                                                     Jay Hemenway,\n     Mercer County Prosecuting Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Texas County Prosecuting Attorney,\n\n                                     Houston, MO, October 4, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Ashcroft, It is my understanding that the \n     nomination of Ronnie White to the United States Federal Court \n     is coming up for a vote soon in the United States Senate. I \n     have serious concerns about this nomination.\n       Judge White's voting record has given law enforcement \n     officials cause for alarm. While on the Supreme Court he has \n     consistently voted against use of the death penalty, even in \n     the most brutal and clear-cut cases. In fact, White has voted \n     against use of the death penalty more than any other judge on \n     the Court.\n       White's was also the lone dissenting vote on the case \n     allowing drug checkpoints of major highways in our state. \n     There are other causes of concern, but I think it is best \n     summed up as follows: The Judiciary exists to interpret the \n     law, not make it. Judge White's opinions as a member of the \n     Missouri Supreme Court have caused me to fear more judicial \n     activism and pro-criminal jurisprudence that would run \n     contrary to the will of our founding fathers and to the good \n     of our country.\n       Please examine Judge White's record closely, Senator. This \n     is an enormously important decision with the most serious of \n     implications. Thank you for taking the time and making the \n     effort to cast a wise vote on the nomination.\n           Most sincerely,\n                                                      Doug Gaston.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, had the White House worked with these home-\nState Senators and with other Senators to achieve broad support for the \nnominee, perhaps Judge White would not have been defeated. I don't \nknow. I might add, had both home-State Senators been opposed to Judge \nWhite in committee, Judge White would never have come to the floor \nunder our rules. I have to say, that would be true whether they are \nDemocrat Senators or Republican Senators. That has just been the way \nthe Judiciary Committee has operated. Had the President diligently \nworked with Senators to determine that there would not be broad support \nfor the candidate, he could have found an alternative, consensus \ncandidate. But the President did not. Thus, Judge White's nomination \nfailed on the floor of the Senate.\n  To compound the problem, the President and some of my colleagues in \nthis body made the grave error of suggesting that race was the reason \nthat Senate Republicans voted against Judge White. This transparently \npolitical accusation has, as the administration is well aware, no basis \nin fact. The Judiciary Committee, under my chairmanship, has not kept \nformal statistics on the race of any of these nominees, nor would we \nhave informed Democrat or Republican members that Judge White is an \nAfrican American. Many of my Republican colleagues were literally \nunaware of Judge White's race, and that is the way it has been. We just \nhaven't made notice of anybody's race as we have confirmed these 325 \njudges that President Clinton has nominated.\n  Instead, they were aware of his record in death penalty cases. I \nadmit that that awareness happened at a relatively late time in this \nmatter. It caught me by surprise as well--the opposition at least. They \nwere aware of the opposition of State and national law enforcement \ncommunities that arose after his committee hearing. They were aware of \nthe opposition of both home-State Senators that was announced after his \nhearing. Indeed, I even had a Democratic Senator inform me that had \nthat Senator known of the recent law enforcement opposition to Judge \nWhite's nomination, that Senator would have opposed the nomination as \nwell. Senator Bond did support this judge at the hearing but later \nchanged his position on this as he became more and more aware of the \nopposition by law enforcement. It was not race that defeated Judge \nWhite; it was his record and the opposition of the elected leaders of \nhis State.\n  These same Republican Senators who opposed Judge White overwhelmingly \nsupported the nomination of Charles Wilson, an African American, to the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Florida. While Senate Republicans \nwere mostly unaware of Judge Wilson's race, Members were informed of \nhis outstanding record as a Federal Magistrate and U.S. Attorney, the \nstrong Florida support for Mr. Wilson, and the support of both home-\nState Senators--1 Republican and 1 Democrat--for Mr. Wilson. Most \nmembers were not informed of his race. But these home-State Senators \nwere for Mr. Wilson. And there was broad support in the Senate for Mr. \nWilson's candidacy. It was not race that confirmed Mr. Wilson; it was \nhis record and the support of the elected leaders of his State.\n  The same is true for other minority nominations. To mention a few, \nVictor Marrero, Carlos Murguia, Adalberto Jordan--nominees whose \nrecords show they were qualified and respected the rule of law, who had \nthe support of home-State Senators, and who had broad support in the \nSenate. Thus, the suggestion that the Republicans in this\n\n[[Page S12188]]\n\nbody voted against Judge White on the basis of race is no more true \nthan a parallel accusation that my Democratic colleagues voted against \nClarence Thomas because of his race. I don't think any of us have made \nthat suggestion.\n\n  I am also deeply disappointed by the patently false suggestions from \nthe administration, and some in this body, that Republicans \nintentionally delay the processing of minority and women nominees based \non their race and gender. This would be a surprise to Charles Wilson, \nwho was nominated on May 27, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the \nfloor of the Senate on July 22, and confirmed on July 30. This would \nalso be a surprise to Marryanne Trump Barry, who was nominated on June \n17, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the floor of the Senate on \nJuly 29, and confirmed on September 13. Both of these nominees had \noutstanding records reflecting respect for the law, strong home-State \nsupport, the support of both home-State Senators, and broad support in \nthe Senate. Mr. Wilson, Judge Barry, and most of these other nominees \nproceeded smoothly through the confirmation process because the \nPresident worked with the Senate, not against the Senate.\n  The administration is very proud of its record of placing women and \nminorities on the bench, and it makes a point of informing the public \nof its work in this regard. In an address to the American Bar \nAssociation this summer, President Clinton called the collection of \njudges he has nominated to the Federal bench ``the most diverse group \nin American history.'' Nearly half are women and minorities, he said.\n  But each of these judges was confirmed by the Senate, and all were \nconfirmed with Republican support. How can it be that a Senate which \nhas directly participated in this record of accomplishment can become \nan institution of bias simply by opposing one nominee--a nominee \nopposed by both home-State Senators and by an overwhelming number of \nState and national law enforcement leaders? It cannot be. It simply \ncannot be. The record and the Department of Justice's own numbers speak \nfor themselves.\n  According to the Clinton administration's own data, the Senate--\nwhether it was under Democratic or Republican control--has done its \nduty and confirmed qualified women and minorities. For example, in \n1998, based on Department of Justice data, approximately 32 percent of \njudicial nominees were women, and 21.5 percent were minorities. Even \nthough the committee does not keep formal statistics, I had my staff \nmanually compute the proportion of women and minorities reported to the \nSenate floor. So far this year, over 45 percent of the judicial \nnominees reported to the Senate floor are women or have been \nminorities.\n  Yes, some nominees take longer than others--but it is not because of \ntheir race or gender. My colleagues, I believe, know that. I believe \nthe President and his people at the White House know that. Indeed, \nseveral of the nominees of the past that took longer to confirm had my \nstrong support. These included Anne Aiken, Margaret Murrow, and Susan \nMollway. I have been condemned for that by certain people on the far \nright almost on a daily basis ever since.\n  In the end, those who make these troubling accusations either, one, \nbelieve them to be true or, two, know they are not true, but want to \npoliticize the issue. Either motivation is evidence of a serious \nproblem within our noble institution, which I hope we, as leaders, can \nwork to rectify. That is one reason I am taking this time today. Using \nrace as a political tactic to advance controversial nominees is \nespecially troubling. I care too much about the Senate and the Federal \njudiciary to see these institutions become the victims of base, cheap, \nwedge politics.\n  I would urge my colleagues and the President to reconsider this \ndestructive and dangerous ploy. Instead, they should put aside this \ndestructive rhetoric and work with us to do what is best for the \nJudiciary, the Senate, and the American people.\n  The Ronnie White nomination is an unfortunate example of what I \nbelieve is an increasing pattern on the part of the Clinton White \nHouse. I am referring to what appears to be a fire-sale strategy of \nknowingly sending up nominees who lack home-State support. Some time \nago, I sent the White House Counsel a letter stating clearly that \nconsultation was an essential prerequisite to a smoothly functioning \nconfirmations process. But over the past several months, a number of \nnominees have been forwarded to the Senate over the objection--both \nprivate and public--of home-State Senators. Is this a pattern the aim \nof which is to get nominees confirmed, or is this a strategy, the \nobject of which, is to create a political show down with the Senate. My \nconcern is with the latter.\n  To find the answer to the current political crisis, I turn once again \nto the Constitution and its requirement that the President and the \nSenate work ``with'' each other in the nomination and advice and \nconsent process. To enable us to return to working together instead of \nagainst each other, I propose that we take time for both sides to cool \noff. The President and the Senate should take a step back, cool off, \nand then return to working with each other in the nomination and \nconfirmation process as the Constitution so plainly requires.\n  Mr. President, we have worked well with this President up to now. I \nhave certainly taken my share of criticism for being as fair to this \nadministration as I can possibly be. But this administration knows the \nrules up here--that when two home State Senators oppose a district \ncourt nominee, that district court nominee is not going to make it. \nThat is the way it is. There is nothing I can do to change that because \nit is the correct rule. It is important that we work together and work \nwith home State Senators in order to resolve this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for that statement. I have just a word or two to \nsay about the same subject.\n  The White House made a comment--Mr. Lockhart--that I was one of three \nRepublican Senators who voted for Judge White in committee and then \nvoted against him on the floor. It is inaccurate to say I voted for him \nin committee because I did not. What happened was, the Judiciary \nCommittee had a very abbreviated session off the floor and I went there \nto see if there was a quorum. When there was a quorum, Justice White \nwas voted out of committee on a voice vote, but I was not present for \nthat voice vote.\n  I was especially sensitive to Judge White because Judge Massiah-\nJackson came before the Senate last year and withdrew her nomination in \nthe face of very considerable opposition by the State District \nAttorneys Association.\n  So I took a close look at the letters, and even had a brief \nconversation with the ranking Democrat before casting my vote, which I \ndid at the tail end of the vote on Justice White.\n  But contrary to what Mr. Lockhart of the White House said, and \ncontrary to what has appeared in a number of press accounts, I did not \nvote for Justice White in the committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12188-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12188-S12215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION AND \n          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), for himself, \n     and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 2272.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 216. STUDY AND REPORT ON THE GEOGRAPHIC ADJUSTMENT \n                   FACTORS UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall conduct a study on--\n       (1) the reasons why, and the appropriateness of the fact \n     that, the geographic adjustment factor (determined under \n     paragraph (2) of section 1848(e) (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(e)) used \n     in determining the amount of payment for physicians' services \n     under the medicare program is less for physicians' services \n     provided in New Mexico than for physicians' services provided \n     in Arizona, Colorado, and Texas; and\n       (2) the effect that the level of the geographic cost-of-\n     practice adjustment factor (determined under paragraph (3) of \n     such section) has on the recruitment and retention of \n     physicians in small rural states, including New Mexico, Iowa, \n     Louisiana, and Arkansas.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 3 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall submit a report to Congress on the study \n     conducted under subsection (a), together with any \n     recommendations for legislation that the Secretary determines \n     to be appropriate as a result of such study.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that Senator \nDomenici and I are offering to direct the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to conduct a study of and the appropriateness of the \ngeographic adjustment factor that is used in Medicare reimbursement \ncalculations as it applies particularly to our State of New Mexico.\n  We have a very serious problem in our State today; many of our \nphysicians are leaving the State. The reimbursement that is available \nunder Medicare, and accordingly under many of the health care plans in \nour State, is less for physicians performing procedures and practicing \nmedicine in our State than it is in all of our surrounding States. We \nbelieve this is traceable to this adjustment factor, this geographic \nadjustment factor.\n  This is a system that was put into place in 1992. It now operates, as \nI understand it, such that we have 89 geographic fee schedule payment \nareas in the country. We are not clear on the precise way in which our \nState has been so severely disadvantaged, but we believe it is a \nserious problem that needs attention.\n  Our amendment directs that the Secretary conclude this study within \n90 days, or 3 months, report back, and make recommendations on how to \nsolve the problem. We believe it is a very good amendment. We recommend \nthat Senators support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I am pleased to say I am a \ncosponsor of this amendment. I have helped Senator Bingaman with it.\n  This is a good amendment. We aren't asking for any money. We are not \nasking that any law be changed. We are merely saying that something is \nnot right for our State.\n  The reimbursement--or some aspect of how we are paying doctors under \nMedicare--is causing us to have much lower fees than the surrounding \nStates, and as a result two things are happening: One, doctors are \nleaving. In a State such as ours, we can ill afford that. Second, we \nare being told it is harder and harder to get doctors to come to our \nState. That was not the case years ago. They loved New Mexico. They \ncame for lots of reasons. But certainly we cannot be an underprivileged \nState in terms of what we pay our doctors--be a poor State in \naddition--and expect our citizens to get good health care.\n  We want to know what the real facts are: Why is this the case? Is it \nthe result of the way the geographic evaluation is applied to our State \nbecause maybe rural communities aren't getting the right kind of \nemphasis in that formula?\n  Whatever it is, we want to know. When we know, fellow Senators, we \ncan assure Members, if we find out it is not right and it is not fair, \nwe will be on the floor to talk about some real changes. Until we have \nthat, we ask Members for help in obtaining a study.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The managers have taken a look at this amendment and are \nprepared to accept it. It is a good amendment.\n  There is one concern, and that is a jurisdictional concern with \nrespect to the Finance Committee. We have attempted to contact the \nchairman of the Finance Committee to see if there was any substantial \nreason we should not accept it. If it went to a vote, it would clearly \nbe adopted. It merely asks for a report for a very good purpose. \nTherefore, the amendment is accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2272) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S12190]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am here today, as I was in July, to \npoint out to my colleagues another stealth effort to kill competition \nwithin the Medicare program. Title I, section 214, buried in the middle \nof this long appropriations bill on page 49, carries the following \nstatement:\n\n       None of the funds provided in this Act or in any other Act \n     making appropriations for fiscal year 2000 may be used to \n     administer or implement in Arizona or in Kansas City, \n     Missouri or in the Kansas City, Kansas area the Medicare \n     Competitive Pricing Demonstration Project operated by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services under authority \n     granted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n\n  If that statement sounds familiar, it is. Almost the same language \nwas buried in the HMO Patients' Bill of Rights bill as it passed the \nSenate back in July. It passed then undebated and undiscussed as to its \nimplications--just as we are about to do here tonight. July's action \nwas outrageous. This action is even more so.\n  There is a certain irony here. We have just heard that the House of \nRepresentatives passed, by an overwhelming vote, a version of the HMO \nPatients' Bill of Rights which is very similar to the bipartisan bill \noffered but not considered in the Senate. Our bipartisan bill was \nstrongly opposed by the HMO industry. Their basic argument is: let's \nkeep government out of our business, let us operate based on a \ncompetitive model that will allow the consumer, the beneficiary of the \nHMO contract, to negotiate without government standards, without \ngovernment sanctions for failure to deliver on those standards with the \nHMO industry. They wanted to have laissez-faire free enterprise; Adam \nSmith roams the land.\n  However, today we are about to pass a provision that says when the \nHMOs are dealing with their pocketbook and the question of how they \nwill get reimbursed, how much money they are going to get paid from \nMedicare, they don't want to have a free market of competition; they \ndon't want to have a means by which the taxpayers can be assured what \nthey are paying for the HMO product is what the market says they should \nbe paying.\n  There is a certain amount of irony there which I think underscores \nthe motivations of a significant portion of this industry. There also \nis a procedural ploy here. If this provision I just quoted were to be \noffered as an amendment to this bill, it would be ruled out of order \nunder rule XVI in part because it purports not only to control action \nin this act but in any other act that Congress might consider making in \nan appropriations bill. But this is not an amendment; this is in the \nbill itself as it has come out of the Appropriations Committee, and \ntherefore rule XVI does not apply.\n  Normally under the procedures the Congress has followed \ntraditionally, we would be dealing with a House bill because the House \ntraditionally has led in the appropriations process; therefore, we \nwould be amending a House bill. Thus, we could have excised this \nprovision. However, because we are violating tradition and taking up a \nSenate bill first, we do not have the opportunity to remove it by a \npoint of order.\n  I will state for the record that henceforth, when it is proposed we \ntake up a Senate appropriations bill before a House bill, I am going to \nstand here and object. This is exactly the kind of procedural abuse we \ncan expect in the future as is happening right now.\n  If that isn't bad enough, this is just plain bad policy. It stifles \ninnovation by eliminating the competitive demonstration which hopefully \nwould have led to a competitive process of compensating HMOs. It forces \nMedicare to pay more than necessary for some services in certain areas \nof the country while it denies managed care to other areas of the \ncountry.\n\n  This HMO pricing is not without its own history. The Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997 included the competitive pricing demonstration program for \nMedicare. That provision was fought in the committee and fought in the \nSenate in 1997 by the HMO industry and certain Members of this body, \nbut it prevailed. One by one, the HMO industry has been able to kill or \nhas attempted to kill demonstrations which have been scheduled in many \ncommunities across the country. Today it is Arizona and Kansas City.\n  The equation is pretty simple. It does not take rocket science to \nunderstand what is happening. Who benefits by continuing a system of \npaying Medicare HMOs that are not subject to competition? The HMOs \nbenefit. Who loses when the same system is open to competition? The \nHMOs, because they no longer have the gravy train that exists today. \nWho gains by competition? Beneficiaries gain, particularly in rural \nareas which don't have managed care today. It would be the marketplace \nthat would be establishing what the appropriate reimbursement level \nshould be for an HMO in a currently unserved or underserved rural \narea--not a formula which underpays what the real cost of providing \nmanaged care would be in such an area. And the taxpayers lose because \nthey do not get the benefit of the marketplace as a discipline of what \nthe HMO's compensation should be.\n  It is curious that out of one side of their mouth, they are screaming \nthe current system of reimbursement is putting them out of business and \ncausing them to have to leave hundreds of thousands of former HMO \nbeneficiaries high and dry and also to curtail benefits such as \nprescription drugs, but at the same time, they are saying out of the \nleft side of their mouth they are doing everything they can to prevent \nthe insertion of competitive bidding as a means of establishing what \ntheir HMO contracts are really worth and what they should be paid.\n  They cannot have it both ways.\n  It takes a certain degree of political courage to make this reform \nhappen. Let me give an example. In my own State of Florida, we were \npart of this demonstration project. We were selected to have a \ndemonstration for Part B services for what are referred to as durable \nmedical equipment. Lakeland, FL, was selected as the place to \ndemonstrate the potential savings for medical equipment such as oxygen \nsupplies and equipment, hospital beds and accessories, surgical \ndressings, enteral nutrition, and urological supplies.\n  The savings that have been achieved in this project are impressive.\n  They are 18-percent savings for oxygen supplies. I know the Senator \nfrom Iowa has stood on this floor and at times has even wrapped himself \nin medical bandages to demonstrate how much more Medicare was paying \nthan, for instance, the Veterans' Administration for the same items. \nThis competitive bidding process is attempting to bring the forces of \nthe market into Medicare, and an 18-percent savings by competitively \nbidding oxygen supplies and equipment over the old formula we used to \nuse. There were 30-percent savings for hospital beds and accessories, \n13-percent savings for surgical dressings, 31 percent for enteral \nnutrition products, and 20 percent for urological supplies. It has been \nestimated if that Lakeland, FL, project were to be applied on a \nnationwide basis, the savings over 10 years would be in excess of $1 \nbillion. We are not talking about small change.\n  Beneficiaries have saved money from this demonstration, and access \nand quality have been preserved and protected.\n  I find it troubling we are again today, as we were in July, debating, \nat the end of a major piece of legislation, a silently, surreptitiously \nincluded item which has the effect of sheltering HMOs from the \nmarketplace. We might find some HMOs cannot compete and others will \nthrive, but that is what the marketplace should determine. That is what \ncompetition is all about.\n  I urge my colleagues to examine this provision, to examine the \nimplications of this provision in this kind of legislation and the \nrestraints it imposes upon us, as Members of the Senate, to excise it \nas inappropriate legislative language on an appropriations bill.\n  I hope our conferees, as they meet with the House, will resist the \ninclusion of this in the final legislation we might be asked to vote \nupon when this measure comes back from conference. This disserves the \nbeneficiaries of the Medicare program. It disserves the taxpayers of \nAmerica. It disserves the standards of public policy development by the \nSenate. I hope we will not have a further repetition of this stealth \nattack on the Medicare program.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I took great interest in the statement \nthat Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham) made expressing his displeasure \nthat this legislation contains\n\n[[Page S12191]]\n\na provision--Section 214--halting implementation of the Medicare \nPrepaid Competitive Pricing Demonstration Project both in Arizona and \nin the Kansas City metropolitan area.\n  The Senator from Florida claimed that the inclusion of this provision \nwas accomplished by HMOs. I would like to take this opportunity to \npoint out to him that it was Medicare beneficiaries and doctors who \nalerted me to their grave concerns that the project would create huge \npatient disruption in the Kansas City area.\n  In fact, after the Senator from Florida made similar remarks during \ndebate on the Patient's Bill of Rights legislation regarding a similar \nprovision in that bill, the Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater \nKansas City wrote him a letter conveying their concerns with the \nimplementation of the demonstration project in Kansas City, and \nexpressing support for congressional efforts to stop the demonstration \nin their area. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be \ninserted in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. After hearing from a number of doctors and patients in \nmy State over the past few months, I concluded that Kansas City is an \ninappropriate location for this project and that it will jeopardize the \nhealth care benefits that seniors currently enjoy in the area. I \nbelieve that halting this project is necessary to protect the health \ncare of senior citizens and to assure that Medicare beneficiaries \ncontinue to have access to excellent health care at prices they can \nafford. HCFA's project is a clear and present danger to the health and \nwell-being of my constituents.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the Medicare Prepaid \nCompetitive Pricing Demonstration Project to use competitive bidding \namong Medicare HMOs. Through the appointment of a Competitive Pricing \nAdvisory Committee, HCFA was to select demonstration sites around the \nnation. Kansas City was one of the selected cities.\n  As I understand it, the intent of the project was to bring greater \ncompetition to the Medicare managed care market, to address concerns \nthat Medicare HMO reimbursement rates in some areas are too high, to \nexpand benefits for Medicare HMO enrollees, and to restrain the cost of \nMedicare to the taxpayers. When considering these factors, it is clear \nthat the Kansas City metropolitan area is not an appropriate choice for \nthis demonstration.\n  First, managed care competition in the Kansas City market is already \nvigorous, with six managed care companies currently offering Medicare \nHMOs in the area. Participation in Medicare HMOs is also high: As of \nJuly 1 of this year, nearly 23% of Medicare recipients in the Kansas \nCity metropolitan area were in Medicare+Choice plans--approximately \n50,000 of 230,000 total beneficiaries. Nationally, only 17% of Medicare \nrecipients are enrolled in such plans.\n  Second, Medicare managed care payments in the Kansas City area are \nbelow the national average. According to a recent analysis by the \nCongressional Research Service of the Library of Congress, 1999 payment \nrates per Medicare+Choice enrollee in Kansas City are $511, while the \nnational rate is $541. Documents provided to me by HCFA also \ndemonstrate that 75 other cities had a higher adjusted average per \ncapita cost (AAPCC) rate for 1997 than Kansas City. I wonder why Kansas \nCity was chosen for this experiment, when so many other cities have \nhigher payment rates.\n  Third, I am concerned that this demonstration project will not \nprovide expanded benefits to Medicare HMO enrollees, but will instead \ncause severe disruption of Medicare services. It is important to note \nthat customer dissatisfaction is low in current Medicare managed care \nplans in the Kansas City area. Only one in twelve seniors disenrolls \nfrom Medicare HMOs each year.\n  Currently, 33,000, or 66% of the seniors in Medicare managed care \nplans in the Kansas City area do not pay any premium. Under the bidding \nprocess set up by CPAC for the demonstration, a plan that bids above \nthe enrollment-weighted median--which becomes the reimbursement rate \nfor all plans--will be forced to charge seniors a premium to make up \nthe difference between the plan's bid and the reimbursement rate paid \nby the government. In essence, the penalty for a high bid will be \nimposed upon seniors. Under this scenario, it is virtually assured that \nsome seniors who pay no premium today will be required to start paying \none.\n  Moreover, seniors who cannot afford to pay a premium would be forced \nto abandon their regular doctor when it becomes necessary to change \nplans. Both individual doctors as well as the Metropolitan Medical \nSociety of Greater Kansas City have warned that the demonstration could \ncause extreme disruption of beneficiaries away from current doctor-\npatient relationships.\n  I have also heard concerns that both health plans and physicians may \nwithdraw from the Medicare program if reimbursements under the \ndemonstration project prove financially untenable. As a result, \nMedicare beneficiaries may be left with fewer choices in care. This \nwould be intolerable. I question why we should implement a project that \nwill create more risk and uncertainty for my State's seniors, who are \nalready satisfied with what they have.\n  Finally, I question how the demonstration project would be able to \nprovide us with useful information on how to improve the Medicare \nprogram if fee-for-service plans--which are generally the most \nexpensive Medicare option--are not included in the project. In its \nJanuary 6, 1999 Design Report, the Competitive Pricing Advisory \nCommittee expressed the judgment that the exclusion of fee-for-service \nmight ``limit HCFA's ability (a) to measure the impact of competitive \npricing and (b) to generalize demonstration results to the entire \nMedicare program.''\n  After studying this issue, I concluded that implementation of the \nMedicare Managed Care Demonstration Project in the Kansas City \nmetropolitan area should be halted immediately. HCFA must not be \nallowed to risk the ability of my State's seniors to continue to \nreceive high quality health care at affordable costs. I have been \nworking closely with my Senate colleagues from Missouri and Kansas to \nprotect our Kansas City area seniors from the dangers and uncertainty \nof a planned federal experiment with their health care arrangements.\n  So, I want to make clear to my colleague from Florida that patients \nand doctors speaking on behalf of their patients were the ones who \napproached me and asked for my assistance in stopping the Medicare \nmanaged care demonstration project in the Kansas City area. I heard \nfrom a number of individual doctors, as well as medical societies in \nthe State, expressing grave concerns about the project. The President \nof the Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater Kansas City even made \nthe prediction that the unintended risk of the demonstration ``could \ndictate 100% disruption of beneficiaries away from their current \nrelationships'' with their doctors. Clearly, this is unacceptable.\n  Inclusion, Mr. President, I would like to quote from some of the \nletters I received from the seniors themselves, voicing their \nopposition to the Medicare managed care demonstration project coming to \ntheir area.\n  Elizabeth Weekley Sutton, of Independence, Missouri, wrote to me:\n\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: We need help. My husband, my \n     friends, and I are very concerned and worried that our health \n     care will be very limited by the end of the Competitive \n     Pricing Demonstration that will be starting in January. Of \n     all the HMO's in the U.S., only the entire K.C. area and \n     Maricopa County in Arizona will be conducting this \n     competition for the next 5 years!\n\n  And here are some excerpts from a letter sent by Edward Smith of \nPlatte City, Missouri:\n\n       I am totally opposed to the Health Care Financing \n     Administration competitive pricing demonstration project to \n     take place here in the Kansas City area. My health will not \n     permit me to be a guinea pig for a total of five years when \n     the rest of the country will have business as usual.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Instead of the Health Care Financing Administration \n     determining what is best for the beneficiaries I would prefer \n     to do that myself.\n\n  And finally, Mr. Smith says:\n\n       If this plan is adopted my HMO could choose to leave the \n     market. Then what is gained? Certainly not my health.\n\n  Mr. President, we need to listen to the voice of our seniors. We \ncannot afford to jeopardize their health with a\n\n[[Page S12192]]\n\nrisky experiment that could raise costs, limit choices, and cause \ndoctor-patient disruption. For this reason, I have continued--and will \ncontinue--to work to halt this project in its present form in the \nKansas City area.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                      Metropolitan Medical Society\n\n\n                                       of Greater Kansas City,\n\n                                                    July 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I was concerned to read in the July \n     16, 1999, Congressional Record your dissatisfaction about the \n     Senate's passage of the moratorium on the Medicare Prepaid \n     Competitive Pricing Demonstration Project in Kansas City and \n     Arizona. On behalf of the more than 2500 physicians of the \n     Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater Kansas City and its \n     affiliated organizations, I want to assure you that doctors \n     strongly support the moratorium that was passed in the Senate \n     Patient Bill of Rights legislation last week.\n       The physicians of Kansas City have expressed serious \n     concerns about the demonstration project since April, and we \n     continue to be concerned. We believe the experiment will \n     bring unacceptable levels of disruption to our Medicare \n     patients and the local health care market. Additionally, I \n     worry that quality care, which is often more expensive, will \n     be less available to Medicare patients. In Kansas City, the \n     opposition to the project is widespread. Our senators acted \n     on behalf of our entire health care community, including \n     patients, doctors, hospitals, and health care plans.\n       The medical community has participated in the discussions \n     about the demonstration with the Health Care Financing \n     Administration (HCFA) and the local Area Advisory Committee \n     for the demonstration project. Despite these discussions, \n     problems with the experiment remain. We support congressional \n     efforts to stop the demonstration project in the Kansas City \n     area.\n       I remain concerned that under-funded HMOs place our most \n     vulnerable Medicare recipients at risk of getting less \n     attention to their health care needs. I expect to hear more \n     cases of catastrophes to Medicare recipients when the care \n     given is too little, too late. You may be aware that \n     Jacksonville, Florida is another potential site for the \n     demonstration.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my concerns. I hope \n     I've helped to clarify the existence of broad based support \n     in Kansas City for the moratorium on the competitive pricing \n     demonstration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Richard Hellman, MD,\n         President-Elect and Chair, National Government Relations \n           Committee.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1845\n\n     (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding school \n                            infrastructure)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator Robb and I have an amendment at \nthe desk. I call it up at this time, No. 1845.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, and Mr. \n     Robb, proposes an amendment numbered 1845.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SCHOOL \n                   INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The General Accounting Office has performed a \n     comprehensive survey of the Nation's public elementary and \n     secondary school facilities and has found severe levels of \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States.\n       (2) The General Accounting Office has concluded that more \n     than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of extensive \n     repair or replacement, 7,000,000 children attend schools with \n     life threatening safety code violations, and 12,000,000 \n     children attend schools with leaky roofs.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office has found the problem of \n     crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic \n     boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of \n     rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, at least \n     one building is in need of extensive repair or should be \n     completely replaced.\n       (4) The condition of school facilities has a direct affect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n     from a poor facility to a new facility.\n       (5) The General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate \n     electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of \n     technology. More than a third of schools lack the requisite \n     electrical power. Fifty-six percent of schools have \n     insufficient phone lines for modems.\n       (6) The Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 6,000 schools.\n       (7) The General Accounting Office has determined the cost \n     of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollment \n     levels.\n       (8) Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for \n     Native American children are also in dire need of repair and \n     renovation. The General Accounting Office has reported that \n     the cost of total inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities \n     is $754,000,000. The December 1997 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States states that, ``Compared with \n     other schools nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer \n     physical condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental \n     factors, more often lack key facilities requirements for \n     education reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology.''.\n       (9) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       (10) The Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction.\n       (11) The Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should provide at least $3,700,000,000 in \n     Federal resources to help communities leverage funds to \n     modernize public school facilities.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator Robb and I are going to take a few \nminutes. I know the time is late. I know people want to get to a final \nvote on this. I want to talk about how good this bill is and to urge \npeople to vote for it.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I will not go through the \nwhole thing. It basically is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying \nCongress should appropriate at least $3.7 billion in Federal resources \nto help communities leverage funds to modernize public school \nfacilities, otherwise known as public school construction.\n  What we have in this country is schools that are on the average 40 to \n50 years old. We are getting great teachers, new methodologies, new \nmath, new science, new reading programs, and the schools are crumbling \ndown around us. They are getting older every day. Day after day, kids \ngo to schools with leaky ceilings, inadequate heat, inadequate air \nconditioning for hot summer days and the fall when the school year is \nextended. They are finding a lot of these buildings still have asbestos \nin them, and it needs to be taken out. Yet we are shirking our \nresponsibilities to refurbish, renovate, and rebuild the schools in \nthis country. The General Accounting Office estimates 14 million \nAmerican children attend classes in schools that are unsafe or \ninadequate. They estimate it will cost $112 billion to upgrade existing \npublic schools to just ``good'' condition.\n  In addition, the GAO reports 46 percent of schools lack adequate \nelectrical wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. We want \nto get computers in the classrooms, we want to hook them to the \nInternet, and yet almost 50 percent of the schools in this country are \ninadequate in their internal wiring so kids cannot hook up with the \nInternet.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers reports public schools are in \nworse condition than any other sector of our national infrastructure. \nThink about that. According to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers--they are the ones who build our buildings, build our bridges \nand roads and highways and streets and sewers and water systems, and \nour schools--they say our schools are in the worst state of any part of \nthe physical infrastructure of this country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if the nicest things our kids ever see or \ngo to\n\n[[Page S12193]]\n\nis shopping malls and sports arenas and movie theaters, and the most \nrun-down places are their schools, what kind of signal are we sending \nthem about the value we place on education and their future?\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which simply outlines the \nterrible situation we have in this country and calls on the Senate and \nthe Congress to respond by providing at least $3.7 billion, a small \nfraction of what is needed but a step in the right direction--$3.7 \nbillion in Federal resources to modernize our Nation's schools.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague and cosponsor, \nSenator Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Iowa. \nSenator Harkin and I have offered a sense of the Senate amendment \nrelating to school construction, as Senator Harkin has just explained. \nThe amendment is not unlike the amendment Senators Lautenberg, Harkin, \nand I offered to the Budget Resolution earlier this year. That \namendment assumed that given the levels in the budget resolution, \nCongress would enact ``legislation to allow States and school districts \nto issue at least $24.8 billion worth of zero-interest bonds to rebuild \nand modernize our nation's schools, and to provide Federal income tax \ncredits to the purchasers of those bonds in lieu of interest \npayments.'' The actual cost as it was scored was referred to by the \nSenator from Iowa. That amendment was accepted and put the entire \nSenate on record as supporting the concept of providing federal \nassistance in the area of school construction and renovation.\n  Understanding that Rule 16 prevents us from doing anything of \nsignificance at this time with respect to school construction, Senator \nHarkin and I in just a moment will withdraw our amendment. But every \nday that passes, this Congress misses an opportunity to help our States \nand localities fix the leaky roofs, get rid of all the trailers, and \ninstall the wiring needed to bring technology to all of our children. \nThese are real problems--problems that our nation's mayors, school \nboards, and families simply need some help in addressing.\n  While school infrastructure improvement is typically a local \nresponsibility, it is now a national need. Our schools, as the Senator \nfrom Iowa has indicated, are over 40 years old, on average; our school-\naged population is at record levels; and our States and localities \ncan't keep up, despite their surpluses.\n  Abstract talk about State surpluses provides little solace to our \nnation's teachers and students who are forced to deal with wholly \ninadequate conditions. In Alabama, the roof of an elementary school \ncollapsed. Fortunately, it occurred just after the children had left \nfor the day. In Chicago, teachers place cheesecloth over air vents to \nfilter out lead-based paint flecks. In Maine, teachers have to turn out \nthe lights when it rains because their electrical wiring is exposed \nunder their leaky roofs.\n  Mr. President, we are missing an opportunity to help our States and \nlocalities with a pressing need.\n  I will continue to work for and press forward on this issue because I \nthink it's an area where the Federal Government can be extremely \nconstructive. When our children are asked about ``Bleak House,'' they \nshould refer to a novel by Dickens and not the place where they go to \nschool.\n  In my own State of Virginia, there are over 3,000 trailers being used \nto educate students. And there are over $4 billion worth of unbudgeted, \nunmet needs for our schools. This is a problem that is not going to go \naway, and it's a problem that our nation's schools need our help to \nsolve. And I regret that Rule 16 precludes us from considering \nlegislation which would reaffirm the commitment that we made earlier \nthis year.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa for his continued work on \nthe subject of school construction, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1845 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand this amendment is not \nacceptable to the other side. It is late in the day. I know people have \nto get on with other things, and we want to get to a final vote on the \nbill. I believe strongly in this. It is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment. Also, Senators Kennedy, Reid, Murray, and Johnson are added \nas cosponsors.\n  In the spirit of moving this bill along and trying to wrap this up as \nquickly as possible, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment \nat this time, but it will be revisited.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I am very \nsympathetic to the purpose of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment. He is \ncorrect; there would be objection, and I think it would not be adopted. \nI thank him for withdrawing the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 2273 through 2289, 1852, 1869, and 1882\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON WOMEN'S ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAND \n                   GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the 1st session of the 106th Congress, 23 bills have \n     been introduced to allow women direct access to their ob-gyn \n     provider for obstetric and gynecologic services covered by \n     their health plans.\n       (2) Direct access to ob-gyn care is a protection that has \n     been established by Executive Order for enrollees in \n     medicare, medicaid, and Federal Employee Health Benefit \n     Programs.\n       (3) American women overwhelmingly support passage of \n     federal legislation requiring health plans to allow women to \n     see their ob-gyn providers without first having to obtain a \n     referral. A 1998 survey by the Kaiser FamilyFoundation and \n     Harvard University found that 82 percent of Americans support \n     passage of a direct access law.\n       (4) While 39 States have acted to promote residents' access \n     to ob- gyn providers, patients in other State- or in \n     Federally-governed health plans are not protected from access \n     restrictions or limitations.\n       (5) In May of 1999 the Commonwealth Fund issued a survey on \n     women's health, determining that 1 of 4 women (23 percent) \n     need to first receive permission from their primary care \n     physician before they can go and see their ob-gyn provider \n     for covered obstetric or gynecologic care.\n       (6) Sixty percent of all office visits to ob-gyn providers \n     are for preventive care.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should enact legislation that requires health \n     plans to provide women with direct access to a participating \n     health provider who specializes in obstetrics and \n     gynecological services, and that such direct access should be \n     provided for all obstetric and gynecologic care covered by \n     their health plans, without first having to obtain a referral \n     from a primary care provider or the health plan.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, included in the Manager's amendment is an \nimportant provision relating to women's health and access to \nreproductive health care services. I am pleased to have worked with the \nmanagers of this bill to send a strong message on the importance of \ndirect access for women to their OB/GYN.\n  I was disappointed that we were unable to address the rule XVI \nconcerns with the amendment I had originally filed. My original \namendment would simply allow women and their OB/GYNs to make important \nhealth care decisions without barriers or obstacles erected by \ninsurance company policies. My amendment would have required that \nhealth plans give women direct access to their OB/GYN for all \ngynecological and obstetrical care and would have prohibited insurance \ncompanies from standing between a woman and her OB/GYN.\n  However, it has been determined that my amendment would violate rule \nXVI. As a result of the announcement by the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee that he will make a point of order against all \namendments that may violate rule XVI, I have modified my amendment. The \nmodification still allows Members of the Senate to be on record in \nsupport of women's health or in opposition to removing barriers that \nhinder access for women to critical reproductive health care services.\n  I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate that puts this question to each \nMember. I realize that this amendment is not binding, but due to \nopposition to my original amendment, I have been forced to offer this \nsense-of-the-Senate.\n  I am disappointed that we could not act to provide this important \nprotection to women, but I do believe this amendment will send an \nimportant message that the U.S. Senate does support greater access for \nwomen to quality health care benefits.\n  I have offered this amendment due to my frustration and \ndisappointment with managed care reform. I have become frustrated by \nstalling tactics and empty promises. The managed care reform bill that \npassed the Senate has\n\n[[Page S12195]]\n\nbeen referred to as an empty promise for women. I can assure my \ncolleagues that women are much smarter than they may expect and will \nnot be fooled by empty promises or arguments of procedural discipline. \nWhen a woman is denied direct access to the care provided by her OB/\nGYN, she will not be interested in a discussion on ERISA or rule XVI. \nShe wants direct access to her OB/GYN. She needs direct access, and she \nshould have direct access.\n  My amendment also reiterates the importance of ensuring that the OB/\nGYN remains the coordinating physician. Any test or additional referral \nwould be treated as if made by the primary care physician. This \namendment does not call for the designation of an OB/GYN as a primary \ncare physician, it simply says that if the OB/GYN decides additional \ncare is necessary, the patient is not forced to seek approval from a \nprimary care physician, who may not be familiar with her overall health \ncare status.\n  Why is this amendment important? The number one reason most women \nenter the health care system is to seek gynecological or obstetric \ncare. This is the primary point of entry for women into the health care \nsystem. For most women, including myself, we consider our OB/GYN our \nprimary care physician--maybe not as an insurance company defines it--\nbut, in practice, that's the reality.\n  Does a woman go to her OB/GYN for an ear infection? No. But, does a \npregnant woman consult with her OB/GYN prior to taking any antibiotic \nfor the treatment of an ear infection? Yes, most women do.\n  I know the policy endorsed in this amendment has in the past enjoyed \nbipartisan support. The requirements are similiar to S. 836, \nlegislation introduced by Senator Specter and cosponsored by several \nSenators both Republican and Democrat. This amendment is similar to \nlanguage that was adopted during committee consideration in the House \nof the fiscal year 1999 Labor, HHS appropriations bill. A similar \ndirective is contained in the bipartisan House Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation. It has the strong support of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists and I know I have heard from several \nOB/GYNs in my own state testifying to the importance of direct access \nto the full range of care provided, not just routine care.\n  I would also like to point out to my colleagues, that 39 states have \nsimilar requirements and that as participants in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Plan, all of us--as Senators--have this same guarantee \nas well as our family members. If we can guarantee this protection for \nourselves and our families, we should do the same for women \nparticipating in a manager care plan.\n  I realize that this appropriations bill may not be the best vehicle \nfor offering this amendment. However, I have waited for final action on \na Patients' Bill of Rights for too long. I have watched as patient \nprotection bills have been stalled or delayed. Last year we were told \nthat we would finish action on a good Patients' Bill of Rights package \nprior to adjournment.\n  Well, here we sit--almost 12 months later--with little hope of \nfinishing a good, comprehensive managed care reform bill prior to our \nscheduled adjournment this year.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues that we have in the past used \nappropriations bills to address deficiencies in current law or to \naddress an urgent need for action. I believe that addressing an urgent \nneed in women's health care qualifies as a priority that we must \naddress. I realize that the authorizing committee has objected to the \noriginal amendment I filed. As a member of the authorizing committee as \nwell, I can understand this objection. But, again I have little choice \nbut to proceed on this appropriations bill.\n  We all know that it was only recently on the fiscal year 1999 \nsupplemental appropriations bill that we authorized a significant \nchange in Medicaid recoupment provisions despite strong objections from \nthe Finance Committee.\n  In last year's omnibus appropriations bill, we authorized a \nrequirement that insurance companies must cover breast reconstruction \nsurgery following a mastectomy. I can assure my colleagues that this \nprovision never went through the authorizing committee. I would also \npoint out that there are several antichoice riders contained in this \nappropriations bill that represent a major authorization.\n  As these examples show, when we have to address these types issues \nthrough appropriations bills--we can do it. We have done it in the \npast, and we should do it today to meet this need.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. We all talk about the \nneed to ensure access for women to health care. I applaud Chairman \nSpecter's efforts in this appropriations bill regarding women's health \ncare. Adopting this amendment gives us the opportunity to do something \nthat does ensure greater access for women. This is what women want. \nThis is the chance for Senators to show their commitment to this \ncritical benefit.\n  I would like to quote a statement made by our subcommittee chairman \nthat I believe more eloquently explains why I am urging this amendment. \n``I believe it is clear that access to women's health care cuts across \nthe intricacies of the complicated and often divisive managed care \ndebate.'' I could not agree more.\n  We know from the current state requirement and the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit Program requirement, this provision does not have a \nsignificant impact on costs of health care. We also know from \nexperience that it has a positive impact on health care benefits. Since \n60 percent of office visits to OB/GYNs are for preventive care, we \ncould make the argument that adoption of this policy would reduce the \noverall costs of health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ask that we do \nmore than simply make empty promises to women. We need an honest and \nfair debate on this policy.\n  I would ask my colleagues to seek further education or advice from \nwomen as to the importance of direct access and ask their female \nconstituents about the relationship they have with their own OB/GYN. \nLet women speak for themselves. If you listen, you will hear why this \npolicy is so important and why women trust their OB/GYN far more than \ntheir insurance company or their Member of Congress.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I want to discuss my support for an \namendment Senator Murray and I offered which puts the entire Senate on \nrecord in favor of removing one of the greatest obstacles to quality \ncare that women face in our insurance system today: inadequate access \nto obstetricians and gynecologists.\n  I understand that our provision will be included in the manager's \namendment to this bill, and I want to thank the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS and Education, Senator \nSpecter, for his work both in including our amendment in his bill, as \nwell as his leadership on this issue. He has been one of the most \noutspoken members in this body in favor of helping women have better \naccess to women's health services.\n  We know today that for many women, their OB/GYN is the only physician \nthey see regularly. While they have a special focus on women's \nreproductive health, obstetricians and gynecologists provide a full \nrange of preventative health services to women, and many women consider \ntheir OB/GYN to be their primary care physician.\n  Unfortunately, some insurers have failed to recognize the ways which \nwomen access health care services. Some managed care companies require \na woman to first visit a primary care doctor before she is granted \npermission to see an obstetrician or gynecologist. Others will allow a \nwoman to obtain treatment directly from her OB/GYN, but then prohibit \nher from obtaining any follow-up care that her OB/GYN recommends \nwithout first visiting a primary care physician who serves as a \n``gatekeeper''.\n  This isn't just cumbersome for women, it's bad for their health. \nAccording to a survey by the Commonwealth Fund, women who regularly see \nan OB/GYN are more likely to have had a complete physical exam and \nother important preventative services like mammograms, cholesterol \ntests and Pap smears. At a time when we need to direct our health care \ndollars more toward prevention, allowing insurers to\n\n[[Page S12196]]\n\nrestrict access to the health professionals most likely to offer women \npreventative care only increases the possibility that greater \ncomplications--and greater expenditures--will arise down the road. We \nought to grant women the right to access medical care from \nobstetricians and gynecologists without any interference from remote \ninsurance company representatives.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Murray and I offered an amendment which \nwould do just that. Unfortunately, a number of my colleagues from the \nother side of the aisle objected to some of the specific wording in our \nbill, and the amendment was defeated.\n  Since that vote, we have reworked our amendment to address these \nconcerns. We had hoped to offer an amendment which was identical to \nlanguage included in a patient protection bill crafted by a Republican \nCongressman, Charlie Norwood, and that was approved by the House \nearlier today by an overwhelming vote of 275-151.\n  Yet despite this consensus on this issue by Republicans and Democrats \non the House side, my colleagues from the other side of the aisle \nthreatened to challenge our amendment under Senate Rule 16. Senator \nMurray and I are cognizant of the problem this created, and we've opted \nto offer a Sense of the Senate resolution in place of the amendment we \nhad hoped to see approved.\n  This Sense of the Senate, which has been accepted by both sides, puts \nthe entire Senate on record in favor of legislation which requires \nhealth plans to provide women with direct access to obstetrical and \ngynecological services, without first having to obtain a referral from \na primary care provider or their health plan. It is a strong step \nforward in our efforts to improve women's access to the type of health \ncare they need.\n  To my Republican colleagues who objected, I say: your party joined \nwith Democrats to hammer out this compromise language on the House \nside. Now that the Senate is on record as well, let's get behind this \nsame amendment at the earliest available opportunity in the Senate and \npass a provision which will help all women in this country get better \ncare.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2284\n\n(Purpose: To extend filing deadline for compensation of worker exposed \n                  to mustard gas during World War II)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this title for the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 8.7 in addition to the $1 million already \n     provided for asthma prevention programs which shall become \n     available on October 1, 2000 and shall remain available \n     through September 30, 2001, and be utilized to provide grants \n     to local communities for screening, treatment and education \n     relating to childhood asthma.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment \nregarding childhood asthma. For the next 15 minutes imagine breathing \nthrough a tiny straw the size of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough \nair. Now imagine suffering through this process three to six times a \nday. This is asthma.\n  Today, asthma is considered the worst chronic health problem plaguing \nthis nation's children, affecting nearly 15 million Americans. That \nfigure includes more than 700,000 Illinoisans, of whom 213,000 are \nchildren under the age of 18. Illinois has the nation's highest asthma-\nrelated death rate for African-American males, and Chicago has one of \nthe highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.\n  During a recent visit to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, I \nmet a wonderful little boy whose life is a daily fight against asthma. \nHe told me he can't always participate in gym class or even join his \nfriends on the playground. Fortunately, Nicholas is receiving the \nmedical attention necessary to manage his asthma. Yet for millions of \nchildren, this is not the case. Their asthma goes undiagnosed and \nuntreated, making trips to the emergency room as common as trips to the \ngrocery store.\n  In an effort to help the millions of children who live every day with \nundiagnosed or untreated asthma, I am offering this amendment with my \ncolleague Sen. Mike DeWine. It would provide $50 million in grants \nthrough the Center for Disease Control, for community-based \norganizations including hospitals, community health centers, school-\nbased programs, foster care programs, childhood nutrition programs to \nsupport asthma screening, treatment, education and prevention programs.\n  Despite the best efforts of the health community, childhood asthma is \nbecoming more common, more deadly and more expensive. In the past 20 \nyears, childhood asthma cases have increased by 160 percent and asthma-\nrelated deaths have tripled despite improved treatments.\n  Chicago has the dubious distinction of having the second highest rate \nof childhood asthma in the country. Only New York City has higher \nrates. According to a study published by the Annals of Allergy, Asthma \n& Immunology, of inner-city school children in Chicago, researchers \nfound that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was 10.8 per cent, or \ntwice the 5.8 per cent the federal Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention estimates in that age group nationally. The study also found \nthat most of the children with diagnosed asthma were receiving medical \ncare, but it may not be consistent with what asthma care guidelines \nrecommend. Researchers questioned parents of kindergartners and found \n10.8 per cent of the children had been found to have asthma. The \nresearchers estimated an additional 6 to 7 percent had undiagnosed \nasthma. By comparison, the nationwide asthma rate for children 5 to 14 \nis 7.4 per cent. Moreover, many of the asthma cases were severe: 42 per \ncent had trouble sleeping once or twice a week because of wheezing, and \n87 per cent had emergency room visits during the previous year.\n  Asthma disproportionately attacks many of society's most vulnerable \nthose least able to fight back, children and minorities. A recent New \nYork Times article described a study in the Brooklyn area where it was \nfound that a staggering 38 per cent of homeless children suffer from \nasthma.\n  Some of the factors known to contribute to asthma such as poor living \ncircumstances, exposure to cockroach feces, stress, exposure to \ndampness and mold are all experienced by homeless children. They are \nalso experienced by children living in poor housing or exposed to urban \nviolence. There are other factors such as exposure to second hand smoke \nand smog that also exacerbate or trigger asthma attacks.\n  For minorities, asthma is particularly deadly. The Asthma death rate \nfor African-Americans is more than twice as high as it is for other \nsegments of the population. Illinois has the highest asthma-related \ndeath rate in the country for African-American males. The death rate is \n3 times higher than the asthma-related death rate for whites in \nIllinois. Nationwide, the childhood asthma-related death rate in 1993, \nwas 3 to 4 times higher for African Americans compared to Caucasian \nAmericans. The hospitalization rate for asthma is almost three times as \nhigh among African-American children under the age of 5 compared to \ntheir white counterparts The increased disparity between death rates \ncompared to prevalence rates has been partially explained by decreased \naccess to health care services for minority children.\n  Even though asthma rates are particularly high for children in \npoverty,\n\n[[Page S12197]]\n\nthey are also rising substantially for suburban children. Overall, the \nrates are increasing. Every one of us knows of a child whether our own, \na relative's or a friend's who suffers from asthma.\n  Asthma-related death rates have tripled in the last two decades. My \nstate of Illinois has the highest asthma-related deaths in the country \nfor African American men.\n  The effects of asthma on society are widespread. Many of you may be \nsurprised to learn that asthma is the single most common reason for \nschool absenteeism. Parents miss work while caring for children with \nasthma. Beyond those days missed at school and parents missing work, \nthere is the huge emotional stress suffered by asthmatic children. It \nis a very frightening event for a small child to be unable to breathe. \nA recent US News article quoted an 8-yr old Virginian farm girl, \nMadison Benner who described her experience with asthma. She said ``It \nfeels like something was standing on my chest when I have an asthma \nattack.'' This little girl had drawn a picture of a floppy-eared, big \nfooted elephant crushing a frowning girl into her bed.\n  In many urban centers, over 60 per cent of childhood admissions to \nthe emergency room are for asthma. There are 1.8 million emergency room \nvisits each year for asthma. Yet the emergency room is hardly a place \nwhere a child and the child's parents can be educated in managing their \nasthma. In 1994, 466,000 Americans were hospitalized with asthma, up \nfrom 386,000 in 1979.\n  Asthma is one of the most common and costly diseases in the US. In \ncontrast to most other chronic diseases, the health burden of asthma is \nincreasing rapidly. The financial burden of asthma was $6.2 billion in \n1990 and is estimated to increase to more than $15 billion in 2000.\n  Most children who have asthma develop it in their first year, but it \noften goes undiagnosed or as the study I mentioned earlier, the \nchildren may not receive the best treatment. The National Institutes of \nHealth is home to the National Asthma Education and Prevention board. \nThis is a large group of experts from all across the fields involved in \nhealth care and asthma. They have developed guidelines on both treating \nasthma and educating children and their parents in prevention. It is \nvery important that when we spend money on developing such guidelines \nthat they actually get out to communities so that they can take \nadvantage of this research.\n  CDC has been working in collaboration with NIH to make sure that \nhealth professionals and others get the most up to date information. My \namendment could further help this effort by providing grantees with \nthis information.\n  We do have treatments that work for most people. Early diagnosis, \ntreatment and management are key to preventing serious illness and \ndeath. There are several wonderful models for success already available \nto some communities. Take for example the ``breathmobile'' program in \nLos Angeles that was started 2 years ago. This program provides a van \nthat is equipped with medical personnel, asthma education materials, \nand asthma treatment supplies. It goes out to areas that are known to \nhave a high incidence of childhood asthma and screens children in those \nareas. This ``Breathmobile'' program has reduced trips to the emergency \nroom by 17 per cent in the first year of operation. This program is \nbeing expanded to sites in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Baltimore. I hope that \nwe can be as successful in Illinois and other parts of the country. \nChildren in these Breathmobile programs are also enrolled in the \nChildren's Health Program if they are income eligible. We have all \nheard of how slow enrollment in the children's health program has been \nand anything that we can do to speed enrollment up is vitally \nimportant.\n\n  In West Virginia, a Medicaid ``disease management'' program which \nseeks to coordinate children with asthma's care so that they get the \nvery best care has been found to be very cost effective. It has reduced \ntrips to the emergency room by 30 per cent.\n  In Illinois, the Mobile CARE Foundation is setting up a program in \nChicago based on the Los Angeles initiative. In addition, the American \nAssociation of Chest Physicians has joined with other groups to form \nthe Chicago Asthma Consortium to provide asthma screening and \ntreatment. Efforts like these need our amendment. This Childhood Asthma \nAmendment would expand these programs to help ensure that no child goes \nundiagnosed and every asthmatic child gets the treatment he or she \nneeds.\n  I am offering this amendment here today with my colleague from Ohio, \nso that we can expand these programs to other areas of the country. It \nis a very simple amendment. It adds $10 million to the Centers for \nDisease Control's appropriations for local community grants to screen \nchildren for asthma and if they are found to have it, to provide them \nwith treatment and education into how to manage their asthma.\n  CDC has current authority to carry out such programs and as the Bill \nReport already notes on page 93 of the report: ``The Committee is \npleased with the work that CDC has done to address the increasing \nprevalence of asthma. However the increase in asthma among children, \nparticularly among inner-city minorities, remains alarming. The \nCommittee urges CDC to expand its outreach aimed at increasing public \nawareness of asthma control and prevention strategies, particularly \namong at risk minority populations in under-served communities.'' I \ncouldn't agree more. We do need to do more in this area.\n  No child should die from asthma. We need to make sure that people \nunderstand the signs of asthma and that all asthmatic children have \naccess to treatment and information on how to lessen their exposure to \nthings that trigger asthma attacks.\n  My amendment responses to the alarming increase in childhood asthma \ncases and asthma-related deaths. It would provide funds to community \nand state organizations that serve areas with the largest number of \nchildren who are at risk of developing asthma and areas with the \nhighest asthma-related death rates. The grantees could use the funds to \ndevelop programs to best meet the needs of their residents. The funds \ncould be targeted to those communities where there are the highest \nnumber of children with asthma or where there is the highest number of \nasthma-related deaths.\n  This amendment is a small step toward addressing this the single \ngreatest chronic health illness of children today. $10 million is a \npretty small sum. I am glad that this amendment has been accepted.\n  The Amendment is supported by the American Lung Association, the \nNational Association for Children's Hospitals and Research \nInstitutions, the Academy of Pediatrics, the Asthma and Allergy \nFoundation of America and others who support children's health.\n  I thank my colleagues on behalf of the 5 million children who suffer \nfrom asthma today in America for accepting this amendment that can make \nsome progress to combat this the most preventable childhood illness.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to support the Durbin-DeWine \npediatric asthma amendment. This amendment would appropriate $10 \nmillion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to \naward grants to local communities for screening, treatment, and \neducation relating to childhood asthma.\n  On May 5th of this year, the Allergy and Asthma Network's Mothers of \nAsthmatics organized an asthma awareness day to educate everyone about \nasthma. As most of you probably know, asthma is a chronic lung disease \ncaused by inflammation of the lower airways. During an asthma attack, \nthese airways narrow--making it difficult and sometimes impossible to \nbreathe. Fortunately, we have the ``tools'' to handle asthma attacks \nonce they occur. The most common way, of course, is to use an asthma \ninhaler that millions of us use every day. We also know a lot about how \nto prevent asthma attacks in the first place--through drug therapy and \nby avoiding many well-known asthma triggers.\n  With asthma prevalence rates--and asthma death rates--on the rise, \nespecially in inner-city populations, it is important for us to raise \nnational awareness, so we can educate families on how to detect, treat, \nand manage asthma symptoms. Of the more than 15 million Americans who \nsuffer from asthma, over five million are children.\n\n[[Page S12198]]\n\n The American Lung Association estimates that in my home state of Ohio, \n212,895 children under the age of 18 suffer from asthma. That's about \ntwo percent of the entire population in Ohio. Asthma is the most common \nchronic illness affecting children and is the leading cause of missed \nschool days due to chronic illness.\n  Asthma is hitting the youngest the hardest. Nationwide, the most \nsubstantial prevalence rate increase for asthma occurred among children \n4 years-old and younger. Hospitalization rates due to asthma were also \nhighest in this young age group, rising 74 percent between 1979 and \n1992. These increases in hospitalization rates are especially affecting \nthe inner city populations, where asthma triggers, like air pollutants, \nare more concentrated.\n  An August 29 Akron Beacon Journal article cites statistics from the \nCDC that show the ratio of children under age four with asthma \nincreased from one in forty-five in 1980 to one in seventeen in 1994. \nEvery year, more than 5,000 Americans die from this disease--these are \nPREVENTABLE deaths. A July 27 New York Times article described the \nresults of a study performed by a team at the Center for Children's \nHealth and the Environment at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. This \nstudy found that hospitalization rates were as much as 21 times higher \nin poor, minority areas than in the hardest-hit areas of wealthier \ncommunities. The article quotes Dr. Claudio, an assistant professor in \nthe division of neuropathology at Mount Sinai, who said, ``The outcomes \nin the poor Latino and African-American areas, especially among \nchildren, are tragic.'' This Mount Sinai report cited previous studies \nthat suggest that poor African-American and Latino children are \nsuffering at higher rates because the poor often rely on care in \nemergency rooms, where doctors have little time to educate families on \nhow to control the disease and where there is little follow-up care. \nWithout receiving adequate care and medication, the asthma victims \neventually suffer such severe attacks that they need immediate \nhospitalization.\n  Those are some of the reasons why I joined my colleague, Senator \nDurbin, in introducing S.805, the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act.'' \nThis bill will help ensure that children with asthma receive the care \nthey need to live normal lives. It provides grants that will be used to \ndevelop and expand asthma services to children, equip mobile health \ncare clinics that provide diagnosis and asthma-related health care \nservices, educate families on asthma management, and identify and \nenroll uninsured children who are eligible for, but not receiving, \nhealth coverage under Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. By requiring coordination with current children's health \nprograms, this bill will help us identify children--in programs such as \nsupplemental nutrition programs, Maternal and Child Health Programs, \nchild welfare and foster care and adoption assistance programs--who are \nasthmatic, but might otherwise remain undiagnosed and untreated.\n\n  By increasing local asthma surveillance activities through \nlegislation, such as S.805, and by better educating the public on the \nimportance of asthma awareness and management through events like \nAsthma Awareness Day, we can help reverse the distressing increase in \nhospitalization rates and mortality rates due to asthma. As a person \nwith asthma, and as the father of 3 children with asthma, I know first-\nhand how important diagnosis, treatment, and management are to ensuring \nthat this manageable disease will not prevent children and adults from \ncarrying on normal lives. We can make a big difference.\n  Asthma is a serious health concern that simply must be addressed.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Frist, for the outstanding children's \nhealth hearing that his Public Health Subcommittee held on September \n16. A very articulate 13-year old named Robert Jackson from South \nEuclid, OH, testified at that hearing. He described how important early \ndiagnosis and treatment plans are for children who suffer from asthma. \nAccording to Robert, doctors at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital \nin Cleveland explained to him how he could avoid asthma ``triggers''--\nlike cigarette smoke and strong odors like bleach--to avoid having \nserious asthma attacks. By learning how to manage his asthma through an \nasthma treatment plan, Robert now plays sports, attends school \nregularly, and maintains a newspaper route.\n  At a time when States, like Ohio, finally are passing laws that allow \nstudents to take their asthma inhalers to school, we need to provide \nthe federal public health dollars to the CDC for childhood asthma \nscreening, treatment, and education. The states gradually are realizing \nthe severity of this disease and the need for children to access their \ninhalers to manage their asthma. It is now time for the Federal \nGovernment to help local communities stem the rising prevalence of the \nworst chronic health problem affecting children.\n  I commend my colleagues for supporting this very important amendment \nas it will help the nearly 5 million children who have been diagnosed \nwith asthma, as well as those children who suffer from asthma, but \nremain undiagnosed and--sadly--untreated.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2287\n\n (Purpose: To rename the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as \n    the Thomas R.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Reid's \namendment No. 1852 as offered to S. 1650. As chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, I have had the \nopportunity to follow this issue first-hand. Make no mistake, ensuring \nthe safety of our Nation's health\n\n[[Page S12199]]\n\ncare workers is a priority--as it is for all of our Nation's workforce. \nHow we can best capitalize on occupational safety, however, is the \nbasis for my opposition to this amendment. I do not feel that this \namendment is appropriate on a spending bill. Nor is our agreeing to \nfuture legislation--sight unseen. Moreover, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration is already examining this matter and has not \ncommented to my request as to why legislation is now warranted.\n  ``Sharp'' injuries by exposed needles have a long history. Not only \nhas Senator Reid been interested in occupational injuries caused by \nunprotected syringes, but Senator Boxer has also shared her concerns as \nwell. As chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction, I am a bit \ndisappointed that my colleagues have yet to approach me on this issue. \nI am always eager to discuss occupational safety with members of this \nbody. Instead, I first learned of this issue when the San Francisco \nChronicle ran a series of articles in April, 1998. One article depicted \na nurse practitioner who tried to catch three blood-collection tubes as \nthey rolled toward a counter's edge. At the same time, she held a \nsyringe in her right hand that had just drawn blood from a patient \ninfected with HIV. The exposed needle pierced the side of her left \nindex finger. Working with HIV infected patients is dangerous business, \nbut the risk compounds when medical devices designed to improve health \ncare end up doing just the opposite.\n  At the request of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) \nand other interested groups representing health care workers, federal \nOSHA announced last year that it was issuing a formal request for \ninformation pertaining to injuries caused by unprotected syringes. \nSenators Jeffords, Frist and I wrote to Secretary Herman. We sought \nanswers concerning potential enforcement action by OSHA with regard to \nmedical devices that could conflict with FDA's traditional and \nstatutory jurisdiction. The FDA is statutorily charged with the \nnationwide regulation of medical devices. All syringes are defined as \nClass II medical devices in Section 513(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act. According to Sections 510(k), 519(e) and 705(a), the \nFDA has the statutory jurisdiction to review, approve and recall \nmedical devices as well as to disseminate information regarding the \npotential health dangers caused by any medical device.\n  FDA's jurisdiction over medical devices pertains to the patient. \nSince OSHA's jurisdiction covers workers, the agency is already moving \nforward to modify its Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to include \nregulation of medical ``sharp'' devices. In terms of worker safety, we \nare talking about nurses, doctors and other health care professionals \nand workers that regularly use or handle these medical devices. The \nregulatory lines between the two agencies are difficult to define in \nthis setting. Moreover, the question of reusing medical devices \ndesigned for one-time use only is also a matter that requires careful \nconsideration. Generally speaking, safer devices cost more money--\nraising the potential for re-use by providers. The FDA has not yet \nindicated that it will begin to examine this issue, but it is certainly \na matter of importance that includes the very medical devices we're \ndebating in this amendment.\n  A medical device that has been determined by the FDA to meet the \n``reasonable assurance of safety and efficacy'' standard of the Federal \nFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act can be lawfully marketed. Nonetheless, it \nis conceivable, given its authority over the domain of worker safety \nand health that OSHA might prevent the use of that medical device in \nthe workplace, thereby creating an environment of confusion for the \nregulated public. This confusion could result in diminished worker \nsafety and health and jeopardize patient safety as well. At the very \nleast, this duplication of effort promises to waste the scarce \nresources of both the FDA and OSHA.\n\n  I recognize Section 4(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 and the problems inherent in conflicting regulations which are \npromulgated by different federal agencies and affect occupational \nsafety and health. Although OSHA arguably might have sufficient \njurisdiction to proceed in the indirect regulation of the \naforementioned medical devices, I feel that it would be the best course \nfor OSHA and the FDA to delineate boundaries of jurisdiction and \ncoordinate efforts pertaining to the regulation and use of these \nmedical devices. This is of particular importance because the FDA has \nthe specific scientific expertise in the evaluation of medial devices--\nnot OSHA and not the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth (NIOSH). Despite Secretary Herman's assurances that agency \ncooperation is ongoing, I am not convinced that these boundaries have \nbeen properly addressed at this time. This amendment does nothing to \naddress the lack of communication between these agencies.\n  There are currently two manufacturers that are actively marketing \nprotected syringes. If OSHA is instructed to regulate this matter by \nstatutory instruction, I am concerned that a shortage of supply could \noccur. Not only does this raise questions of anti-trust, it also places \nproviders in the difficult position of being held liable for using \nmedical devices that are short in supply. The market and what it can \ncurrently sustain would not be a matter of consideration if this \namendment passes. Moreover, providers (hospitals) could be put in a \nposition to determine what devices are safe and effective if their \nparticipation is not adequately included in this process.\n  As OSHA moves forward on its own accord in a fashion that could lead \nto its regulation of medical devices, Senator Jeffords and I continue \nto wait for a formal explanation from the agency as to how legislation \nwould impact their current efforts to flush out many of the concerns I \nhave raised. We are still waiting for that response. Moreover, Chairman \nJeffords has voiced his interest in examining this issue within the \nauthorizing committee. In doing so, we would be better positioned to \naddress this emotional and complex issue rather than haphazardly \nlegislating on an appropriations bill.\n  I am committed to finding ways to enhance worker safety. If I thought \nlegislating through the appropriations process was such a wonderful \noption, I have a few bills that I wouldn't mind spending a little time \ndebating on the floor of the Senate. In terms of improving occupational \nsafety, I respect the role of our committee to examine these complex \nissues. Last Congress, I had the opportunity to amend the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act of 1970 three separate times. That was the first \ntime the Act had been amended in 28 years. All of the bills were \ncarefully considered prior to passage and not one of them were tagged \nto an appropriations bill. I ask that this issue be handled by its \nauthorizing committee and not be attached to the underlying bill. I am \ncommitted to doing just that.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1869\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the leveraging educational assistance \n                          partnership program)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n\n         leveraging educational assistance partnership program\n\n       Sec.   . (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this title, amounts appropriated in this title \n     to carry out the leveraging educational assistance \n     partnership program under section 407 of the Higher Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) shall be increased by \n     $50,000,000, and these additional funds shall become \n     available on October 1, 2000.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased that Chairman Specter and \nRanking Member Harkin as part of the managers amendment have included \nan additional $50 million for the Leveraging Educational Assistance \nPartnership (LEAP) program.\n  I had offered an amendment to provide this level of funding along \nwith Senators Collins, Gordon Smith, Snowe, Jeffords, Kennedy, Murray, \nLevin, Conrad, Hutchinson, DeWine, Chafee, Bingaman, Kerry, Feingold, \nand Lautenberg.\n  Since 1972, the Federal-State partnership now embodied by LEAP, with \nmodest federal support, has helped states leverage grant aid to needy \nundergraduate and graduate students.\n  When this program was funded at greater than $25 million, nearly \n700,000 students across the nation, including almost 12,000 students \nfrom my home state of Rhode Island, benefitted from LEAP grants. At $25 \nmillion, the amount included in the Committee's\n\n[[Page S12200]]\n\noriginal bill, we estimate that many of these students lose their \ngrants.\n  Without this important federal incentive, many states would not have \nestablished or maintained their need-based financial aid programs, and \nmany students would not have attended or completed college.\n  Indeed, as my colleagues, students, parents, and those involved in \nhigher education know, the purchasing power of our main need-based aid \nprogram--the Pell Grant, created by and named for my predecessor, \nSenator Claiborne Pell--has fallen drastically in comparison to \ninflation and skyrocketing education costs.\n  Students have searched for other sources of need-based higher \neducation grants and have come to rely on LEAP.\n  Two years ago, this program was on the brink of elimination. But it \nwas this body which recognized the importance of LEAP and \noverwhelmingly voted--84 to 4--for an amendment I offered with my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Collins, to save it from elimination.\n  Then, just last year, the Senate reaffirmed its support for LEAP by \napproving the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998, which updated \nand added several key reforms to this program to leverage additional \nstate dollars for grant aid.\n  Prior to the reforms, federal funding for LEAP was matched by the \nstates only on a dollar for dollar basis. Now, every dollar \nappropriated over the $30 million level leverages two new state \ndollars.\n  States in turn gain new flexibility to use these funds to provide a \nbroader array of higher education assistance to needy students, such as \nincreasing grant amounts or carrying out community service work-study \nactivities; early intervention, mentorship, and career education \nprograms; secondary to postsecondary education transition programs; \nscholarship programs for students wishing to enter the teaching \nprofession; and financial aid programs for students wishing to enter \ncareers in information technology or other fields of study determined \nby the state to be critical to the state's workforce needs.\n  The $25 million included in the Committee's bill falls far short of \nthe funding level necessary to increase student aid and trigger the \nreforms included in the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.\n  In fact, LEAP, if funded at $75 million, as called for in our \namendment, would leverage at least $120 million in new state funding--\nthereby securing almost $200 million in grant aid for our nation's \nneediest students.\n  Let me emphasize, LEAP is the only federal aid program that contains \nthis leveraging component. It is the only program for needy college \nstudents that is a state-federal partnership.\n  The bill does provide increased funding for many of the other student \naid programs, but without providing additional funding for LEAP, the \nSenate will miss an opportunity to expand access to college and make \nhigher education more affordable for some of our neediest students.\n  LEAP is a vital part of our student aid package, which includes Pell \nGrants, Work Study, and SEOG, that make it possible for deserving \nstudents to achieve their higher education goals. All of the student \naid programs must be well-funded if they are truly going to help \nstudents.\n  Moreover, since there are no federal administrative costs connected \nwith LEAP, all grant funds go directly to students, making it one of \nthe most efficient federal financial aid programs.\n  All higher education and student groups support $75 million in \nfunding for LEAP, including the American Council on Education (ACE), \nthe National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities \n(NAICU), the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid \nPrograms (NASSGAP), the United States Student Association (USSA), and \nthe U.S. Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG).\n  By providing $75 million for LEAP, the Senate has an opportunity to \nhelp states leverage even more dollars to help students go to college. \nAs college costs continue to grow, and as the grant-loan imbalance \ncontinues to widen--just 25 years ago, 80% of student aid came in the \nform of grants and 20% in the form of loans; now the opposite is true--\nfunding for LEAP is more important than ever.\n  I thank Chairman Specter and ranking member Harkin for their \nwillingness to accept this amendment. I look forward to working with \nthem during the Conference to retain this level of funding, which is \ncritical to providing greater access to higher education for our \nNation's neediest students.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senators \nSpecter and Harkin for including in the manager's package an amendment \ncosponsored by my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, myself and \nothers increasing funding for the LEAP program.\n  LEAP is an extraordinarily program that provides grant aid to needy \nundergraduate and graduate students. This federal program can be \ncredited in large part with encouraging States to create, maintain and \ngrow their own need-based financial aid programs. It is a program that \nrelies on a partnership for its strength by matching the federal \ninvestment in grant aid with State dollars. The end result is a good \none: increasing the pool of funds available to assist low income \nstudents who are struggling to pay for college.\n  As part of the 1998 Higher Education Amendments, we made significant \nchanges to the LEAP program with the goal of making additional grant \naid and a greater array of services available to post-secondary \nstudents. We challenged States to increase the match that they \ncontribute by offering $2 for every one federal dollar that we make \navailable for this program. With the additional funds, States will have \ngreater flexibility to provide more services to meet the diverse needs \nof low income students who are working to make the dream of a higher \neducation degree a reality.\n  I am proud to stand with the National Association of State Student \nGrant Aid, NASSGAP; the National Association of Independent Colleges \nand Universities, NAICU, the American Council on Education, ACE, the \nAmerican Association of State Colleges and Universities, AASCU; the \nUnited States Public Interest Research Group, USPIRG; and the United \nStates Student Association, USSA in support of this amendment that I \nbelieve will provide significant assistance to the students of this \nnation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1882\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding comprehensive \n                           education reform)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.   , SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC \n                   EDUCATION REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Recent scientific evidence demonstrates that enhancing \n     children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual \n     development before the age of six results in tremendous \n     benefits throughout life.\n       (2) Successful schools are led by well-trained, highly \n     qualified principals, but many principals do not get the \n     training that the principals need in management skills to \n     ensure their school provides an excellent education for every \n     child.\n       (3) Good teachers are a crucial catalyst to quality \n     education, but one in four new teachers do not meet state \n     certification requirements; each year more than 50,000 under-\n     prepared teachers enter the classroom; and 12 percent of new \n     teachers have had no teacher training at all.\n       (4) Public school choice is a driving force behind reform \n     and is vital to increasing accountability and improving low-\n     performing schools.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the federal government should support state and local \n     educational agencies engaged in comprehensive reform of their \n     public education system and that any education reform should \n     include at least the following principals:\n       (A) that every child should begin school ready to learn by \n     providing the resources to expand existing programs, such as \n     Even Start and Head Start;\n       (B) that training and development for principals and \n     teachers should be a priority;\n       (C) that public school choice should be encouraged to \n     increase options for students; and\n       (D) that support should be given to communities to develop \n     additional counseling opportunities for at-risk students.\n       (E) school boards, administrators, principals, parents, \n     teachers, and students must be accountable for the success of \n     the public education system and corrective action in \n     underachieving schools must be taken.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues, Mr. \nSpecter from the State of Pennsylvania and Mr. Harkin from the State of \nIowa, for accepting in the manager's amendment of S. 1650 the sense of \nthe Senate that my friend from Oregon, Mr. Smith\n\n[[Page S12201]]\n\nand I offered on comprehensive education reform. Our amendment \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the federal government should \nsupport state and local efforts to reform and improve our nation's \npublic schools, and further, that every child should begin school ready \nto learn; that training and development for principals and teachers \nshould be a priority; that public school choice should be encouraged to \nincrease options for students; that support should be given to \ncommunities to develop additional counseling opportunities for at-risk \nstudents; and that school boards, administrators, principals, parents, \nteachers, and students must be accountable for the success of the \npublic education system.\n  I appreciate that my distinguished colleagues have acknowledged the \nimportance of a bipartisan, comprehensive approach to reforming the \npublic education system that emphasizes the principles enumerated \nabove. If education reform is to succeed in America's public schools, \nwe must demand nothing less than a comprehensive reform effort. We \ncannot address only one challenge in education and ignore the rest. We \nmust make available the tools for real comprehensive reform so that \nevery aspect of public education functions better and every element of \nour system is stronger. We must empower low-performing schools to adopt \nall the best practices of our nation's best schools--public, private, \ncharter or parochial. We must give every school the chance to quickly \nand easily put in place the best of what works in any other school--and \nwith decentralized control, site-based management, parental engagement, \nand real accountability. Numerous high-performance school designs have \nbeen created such as the Modern Red Schoolhouse program and the Success \nfor All program. The results of extensive evaluations of these programs \nhave shown that these designs are successful in raising student \nachievement.\n  We must also restore accountability in public education--demanding \nthat each school embracing comprehensive reform set tangible, \nmeasurable results to gauge their success in raising student \nachievement. We must reward schools which meet high standards and \ndemand that those which fall short of their goals take immediate \ncorrective action--but the setting of high standards must undergird \ncomprehensive reform.\n  In order to do this, we must break out of the ideological bind we \nhave put ourselves in. We cannot only talk about education--it's more \nthan an issue for an election--we must do something about it. We have \nthe opportunity to implement comprehensive education reform at a time \nwhen the American people are telling us that--for their families, for \ntheir futures--in every poll of public opinion, in every survey of \nnational priorities, one issue matters most, and it's education. That \nis good news for all of us who care about education, who care about our \nkids. But the bad news is, the American people are not so sure that we \nknow how to meet their needs anymore. They are not even sure we know \nhow to listen. Every morning, more and more parents--rich, middle \nclass, and even the poor--are driving their sons and daughters to \nparochial and private schools where they believe there will be more \ndiscipline, more standards, and more opportunity. Families are \nenrolling their children in Charter schools, paying for private schools \nwhen they can afford them, or even resorting to home schooling--the \nlargest growth area in American education.\n  Earlier in this debate, I supported two amendments offered by the \ndistinguished Senator and my senior colleague from the State of \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. I am deeply disappointed that neither of \nthese worthy amendments were adopted by the Senate. Mr. Kennedy's \namendments would have exempted education from the across the board cuts \nin discretionary spending that Republicans have proposed and provided \nincreased funding for teacher quality. We know the American people are \nwilling to spend more on public education. Yet the Senate voted to \nallow cuts. And we know that the American people want qualified \nteachers in their children's schools. Yet the Senate did not \nappropriate the fully authorized level of the Teacher Quality \nEnhancement Grants program.\n  I am also distressed that an amendment offered by my distinguished \ncolleagues, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Reed, and myself was not adopted by \nthis body. Our amendment would have, for the first time, provided real \naccountability to poor children and ensure they attend successful \nschools. The American people have said time and again that education is \ntheir top policy concern. And we have heard time and again that the \nAmerican people want their public schools held accountable. Yet we \nrejected this important amendment, that would have appropriated no new \nfunding and would have ensured low-performing schools would be turned \naround, was rejected.\n  Given our inability to pass these important amendments, I am \nparticularly pleased that Mr. Smith and I could come together and offer \nthis bipartisan amendment. The sense of the Senate we offered is the \nessence of our bill, S. 824, the ``Comprehensive School Improvement and \nAccountability Act.'' Our bill emphasizes the principles embodied in \nthis sense of the Senate, such as early childhood development programs, \nchallenge grants for professional development of principals, second \nchance schools for violent and disruptive students, and increased \nfunding for the Title I program. We contend that these and other tenets \nare fundamental to the comprehensive reform of public schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2273 through 2289, 1852, 1869, and 1882) were \nagreed to.\n\n\n                      indian-chicano health center\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee for their continued support for community health centers \nand other programs within the consolidated health centers account. I \nfirmly believe that these centers represent the best investment the \nFederal government can make in health care for under-served populations \nand under-served areas. These centers provide an invaluable service to \nour communities and our citizens--they provide comprehensive primary \nand preventive services to a broad spectrum of persons without health \ninsurance and members of under-served populations. I note that the bill \nbefore us increases funding for these centers by nearly $100 million, \nand exceeds the President's request by $79 million.\n  It is my hope that the Department of Health and Human Services will \nuse at least part of this new funding to establish new community health \ncenters to address the needs of under-served populations. I am \nparticularly interested in guaranteeing that a proposal from the \nIndian-Chicano Health Center of Omaha, Nebraska, be fully and fairly \nconsidered during any review of new health center applications. This \norganization has made an extraordinary effort to serve a unique \ncommunity of low-income, uninsured Nebraskans who otherwise would go \nwithout health care.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee made a particular \neffort within the constraints of this bill to increase funding for the \nconsolidated health centers account. The Subcommittee strongly supports \nthe provision of comprehensive health services to persons without \nhealth insurance through these important providers. I am pleased that \nwe were able to increase funding for these critical services, and I \nencourage HHS to consider the proposal from the Indian-Chicano Health \nCenter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have long supported the work of the Iowa-Nebraska \nPrimary Care Association and specific community health centers in the \nMidwest. These providers serve as models for effectively and \nefficiently providing access and quality care to under-served \npopulations. I will also support full and fair consideration of the \nIndian-Chicano Health Center proposal.\n\n\n            The Maryland Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as the Senate continues its \nconsideration of the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill today, I rise to \ndiscuss a problem the State of Maryland is struggling to overcome as it \nseeks to extend health care coverage to the 158,000 uninsured children \nin our State. This issue is particularly timely in light of the Census\n\n[[Page S12202]]\n\nBureau report issued earlier this week which shows that the ranks of \nthe uninsured grew by approximately 1 million in 1998 to a total of \n44.3 million. The Census report also shows that the number of uninsured \nchildren has not decreased despite the establishment of a new Federal \nprogram designed to encourage States to expand health insurance \ncoverage to more low-income children. Moreover, Maryland experienced \none of the highest increases in uninsured people last year bringing the \ntotal number of uninsured to 837,000 or one-sixth of the population. A \nquarter of these uninsured Marylanders are children.\n  To address the growing number of uninsured children throughout the \nUnited States, Congress enacted the Children's Health Insurance Program \n(CHIP) in 1997, and Maryland eagerly applied to participate in this new \nFederal-State partnership. However, over the past couple of years, \nMaryland has been penalized under this program for having previously \nextended partial Medicaid coverage under a five year demonstration \nprogram to a class of low-income children who would not otherwise have \nqualified for Medicaid. These children should now be eligible for CHIP \nfunding, but the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is \nblocking Maryland from accessing its CHIP funds for the benefit of \nthese kids.\n  The law establishing the CHIP program prohibits the States from \nenrolling children into the State's CHIP program if those children were \npreviously covered by the State's Medicaid program. HHS has made the \ndecision to treat all children once eligible for the Maryland \ndemonstration program, called the Maryland Kids Count program, as \nthough they were covered under Medicaid. As a result of this \ndiscretionary decision by HHS, the majority of Maryland's uninsured \nchildren are ineligible for CHIP funding. In addition, Maryland has \nbeen unable to access most of the CHIP funding allocated to it.\n  The Maryland demonstration program should not be used to disqualify \nthe State from accessing its CHIP funds because this demonstration \ncannot be equated with covering this group of children with full \nMedicaid coverage. The Maryland demonstration offered only partial \nMedicaid benefits (primary and preventive care). Hospitalization as \nwell as dental and medical equipment were not covered. Thus, for each \nchild in the demonstration program, Maryland spent less than half the \namount it would have spent had Medicaid been extended to these \nchildren.\n  In addition, this demonstration program was conducted under a time-\nlimited waiver which was scheduled to expire at about the same time the \nCHIP program was launched. In fact, HHS informed Maryland that it would \nnot renew the waiver because Congress was establishing a more \ncomprehensive children's insurance program and also because the \nMaryland demonstration had been rather unsuccessful. Only 5,000 \nchildren were enrolled, largely because the benefits offered were so \nlimited.\n  HHS has used its discretionary authority in implementing the CHIP \nprogram to equate the Maryland demonstration program with full Medicaid \ncoverage. Since they used discretionary authority to make this \nerroneous determination, HHS clearly has the authority to reverse this \ndecision administratively. Would the Senator from Delaware, the \nChairman of the Finance Committee, agree that the Department of Health \nand Human Services has authority to allow Maryland to access its CHIP \nfunds to extend health insurance coverage to those low-income children \npreviously eligible for the Maryland Kids Count demonstration program \nwithout additional legislative action?\n  Mr. ROTH. I understand the Senator from Maryland's concerns. It is my \nview that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has authority, \nwithout additional legislative direction, to determine that children \nwho had been covered under Maryland's expired, limited-benefit \ndemonstration program were not receiving true Title XIX coverage, and \ncould therefore be considered uninsured for the purposes of CHIP \neligibility.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chairman for that clarification. Do you \nagree that HHS may use its section 1115 waiver authority to allow \nMaryland to use its CHIP funds to cover those children previously \neligible for the Maryland Kids Count program?\n  Mr. ROTH. I concur with the Senior Senator from Maryland that HHS \ncould use its section 1115 waiver authority to address Maryland's \nconcerns.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n                daniel j. evans school of public affairs\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the current political climate in our \nsociety is becoming increasingly disillusioned and thus less involved \nin public life and civil discourse. More than ever, we need public \nservants who combine vision, integrity, compassion, analytic rigor and \npracticality. As the first school of public affairs at a public \nuniversity, the Graduate School of Public Affairs at the University of \nWashington has trained public servants and leaders in the Northwest for \n37 years. The school's mission is motivating a new generation towards \nexcellence in public and non-profit service and restoring the \nconfidence, involvement and investment in public service.\n  Recently, the school was renamed for Daniel J. Evans, a longtime \npublic servant for the people of Washington state who embodies the \nGraduate School of Public Affairs focus and values. As a governor, U.S. \nSenator and regent for the University of Washington, Dan Evans has \nstood for effective, responsible, balanced leadership. His public \nservice legacy has touched so many citizens and has greatly impacted \nthe state of Washington. Dan Evans' involvement in the Graduate School \nof Public Affairs will provide students the opportunity to learn from \nsomeone who represents effective, responsible and balanced leadership \nand who embodies the school's ideals.\n  The Graduate School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington \nhas played a vital role in public policy and management and is now \npositioned to become the region's primary source of expertise and \noutreach on public issues. I have strongly endorsed these efforts and \nbelieve it is worthy of our support and investment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There certainly is a need for additional leaders in \npublic service. I appreciate the opportunity to learn about the work at \nthe University of Washington and will take a close look at this \nworthwhile project during the conference with the House.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate your commitment to developing highly \nskilled, principled individuals dedicated to service and leadership.\n\n\n                          medicare contractors\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am concerned about the funding level for Medicare \ncontractors. The Senate Committee mark reduced the FY 2000 funding \nlevel by $30 million below the President's Budget recommendation. I \nwant to be sure that this funding reduction will not adversely impact \nfee-for-service claims processing activities or the ability of \ncontractors to provide critical beneficiary and providers services.\n  In the recent past, we have seen the effect that inadequate funding \nlevels can have on services. In 1998 payments were slowed down, and \nbeneficiaries and providers were forced to deal with more voice mail \nrather than human beings when they called their contractors with \nquestions about claims.\n  Looking only at numbers, I see funding $21 million less than FY 1999 \nand $30 million less than the President's request. However, I \nunderstand this funding level reflects $30 million in savings from \nchanges in the processing of dates. Therefore, am I correct in saying \nthis would reflect efficiency and technological improvement, not a \npolicy change in fee-for-service claims processing or beneficiaries and \nprovider services? Furthermore, this $30 million in savings should not \nresult in decreased funding to services for beneficiaries or providers, \nshould it?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to make it clear that funding to assure the timely \nand accurate processing of Medicare claims also is a high priority for \nme and the beneficiaries in my state.\n  I also would like a reassurance that the mark will not affect access \nto health care services in rural America.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senators have correctly described the Committee's \nintent. These savings would be realized as a result of a change in \ndirection by HCFA for a managed care related project, and is not at all \nrelated to fee-\n\n[[Page S12203]]\n\nfor-service Medicare. I understand the Senators' concerns and want to \nassure them Medicare contractor services will not be harmed. These \nsavings of $30 million for HCFA's managed care project will not result \nin any related funding cut to the Medicare contractor budget.\n  I understand the issues both Senators are raising and the importance \nof adequately funding the Medicare contractor program. Let me assure my \ncolleagues that the savings reflected in this bill will not hamper \nMedicare contractors' ability to fulfill their responsibilities as \nMedicare administrators.\n\n\n                          parkinson's research\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman for his \nstrong leadership and support for the medical research in our nation. I \nstrongly support his efforts to double funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, and I am heartened by the increases in this bill. \nI also want to thank him for his leadership in increasing funding for \nParkinson's research and holding the September 28, 1999, hearing on the \npromise of Parkinson's research and the need for increased funding. \nMichael J. Fox put it best when he said that ``this is a winnable war'' \nas long as the funding is there to match the scientific promise.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that's right. Dr. Fischbach testified \nthat he sincerely believes that we are close to solving Parkinson's. \nThe scientific research community believes that it is realistic to \nthink that we will conquer Parkinson's in 5 to 10 years. Dr. William \nLangston, President of the Parkinson's Institute told the Subcommittee \nat the hearing that we have an historic opportunity with Parkinson's \nbecause the research is at a point where a focused, adequately funded \neffort will produce a cure. He also testified that once we understand \nand unravel Parkinson's, we will have answers to many other \nneurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's \ndisease.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Parkinson's hearing was great news \nfor all those who suffer from this disease. The advocacy community was \nwell-represented by actor Michael J. Fox, Joan Samuelson--President of \nthe Parkinson's Action Network, and Jim Cordy--a Parkinson's advocate \nfrom Pennsylvania. Their personal stories underscore the need for \nCongress to ensure that there is increased funding for Parkinson's \nresearch. Parkinson's is the most curable neurological disorder and the \none most likely to produce a breakthrough. Congress passed the Morris \nK. Udall Research Act, making clear that Parkinson's should receive the \nfunding it needs to eradicate this truly dreadful disease. Now it is \ntime to fulfill that promise.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I agree. At the hearing, we were asked to \nincrease funding for Parkinson's research $75 million over current \nfunding levels by increasing funding levels at two institutes, the \nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the \nNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), at $50 \nmillion and $25 million respectively. The research community thinks \nthat this will provide enough funding to quicken seriously the pace of \nresearch on Parkinson's--a down payment, if you will--on a fully funded \nParkinson's research agenda that scientific experts in the community \nconservatively estimate to be over $200 million. I believe NIH should \nbe able to do this from the funds provided in our bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I said at the hearing, I think the \nscientific community can find a cure in even less time, as few as 2 to \n4 years, if they have the resources. With the overall $2 billion \nincrease in NIH funding provided in this bill, those institutes will \nhave sufficient funds to provide the increases to Parkinson's focused \nresearch.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee I want to express \nmy strong support for substantially increasing NIH support for \nParkinson's research. We have a tremendous opportunity for real break \nthrough in the fight against this horrible disease and we cannot pass \nthat up.\n\n\n                      YOUTH LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a second degree amendment to \nSenator DeWine's amendment on higher education, amendment No. 1847.\n  Senator Specter, Senator Harkin and my other distinguished colleagues \non the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Subcommittee \ncertainly have your work cut out in crafting S. 1650, the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. The subcommittee was faced with a difficult task \nof appropriating limited funds to hundreds of programs.\n  I commend the subcommittee for its hard work and for its dedication \nto education funding. This bill provides $37.6 billion for the \nDepartment of Education. This amount is more than $2 billion above \nfiscal year 1999 levels and $537 million above the Administration's \nrequest.\n  Of this $37.6 billion, the committee bill provides over $139.5 \nmillion for the fund for the improvement of education. This amount is \n$500,000 over fiscal year 1999 appropriations. These funds are provided \nto support significant programs and projects to improve the quality of \neducation, help students meet high academic standards and contribute to \nthe achievement of educational goals.\n  During the appropriations process, Senator Specter, I submitted a \nletter requesting that the subcommittee provide $1.5 million in funds \nfor an innovative educational program known as the Youth Leadership \nInitiative (``YLI'') at the University of Virginia. I am thankful for \nthe subcommittee's consideration of my request and am grateful that the \nsubcommittee recognized the importance of YLI by including report \nlanguage on this invaluable educational program.\n  The goal of YLI is to work with America's middle and high school \nstudents to prepare them for a lifetime of political participation. YLI \nseeks to transform the way students view their role in our democracy, \ndevelop their trust in and awareness of our system, and instill in our \nstudents the core values of good citizenship and democracy.\n  To achieve its goal, YLI teaches students in the functional \ncomponents of America's political process. Among other things, YLI \nstudents will learn how to run student-forged mock campaigns, organize \npolitical events, conduct election analysis, and hold mock elections.\n  Senator Specter, these lessons need to be taught and are of paramount \nimportance. In 1998, voter participation during the mid-term \nCongressional elections was the lowest since 1942. Almost every survey \nof public opinion shows growing disinterest in the American electoral \nprocess, and disinterest is strongest among our young people.\n  Thomas Jefferson once warned Americans about the ramifications of \nsuch disinterest in our political system, stating, ``Lethargy is the \nforerunner of death to other public liberty.'' America's form of \ngovernment is uniquely dependent upon the active participation of its \ncitizens. Therefore, if voter participation continues to decrease, then \nour democracy will suffer.\n  By combining academic excellence with hands-on civic activity, YLI \nwill help turn our schools and communities into hotbeds for the \nrejuvenation of our democracy. Since its launch last spring, YLI has \nattracted national attention for its unique approach to teaching our \nyoung people about democracy. In a pilot program currently in progress \nin several Virginia communities, thousands of students in hundreds of \nclassrooms are experiencing the wonders of this pioneering program. \nStudents and teachers have participated in YLI training sessions and \nmembers of the inaugural class of youth leaders are already hard at \nwork organizing public debates between actual legislative candidates \nwhich they will host in the coming weeks.\n  On Tuesday, October 26, 1999, nearly 35,000 middle and high school \nstudents will be eligible to participate in the largest internet ballot \never conducted. On this day, YLI students will be voting on-line using \na secure, encrypted state-of-the-art ``cyber-ballot'' that is \nspecifically tailored to each student's voting precinct.\n  These achievements are only the beginning. YLI is a national crusade. \nThis year's pilot program in Virginia is laying the foundation for next \nyear's expansion throughout Virginia. Plans are already underway to \nmake this program available to every middle and high school in the \nUnited States soon after the 2000 elections.\n  YLI already has the financial support of the Commonwealth of Virginia \nand\n\n[[Page S12204]]\n\nmany of America's leading corporations, foundations and individuals. \nYLI is a model public-private partnership that will make available to \nall Americans students a program which will increase participation in \nour democracy for future generations. Senator Specter, a small \ninvestment today will pay dividends for many generations to come.\n  Again, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I certainly understand \nthe difficult task facing your subcommittee in crafting a bipartisan, \nfiscally responsible appropriations bill. I know you recognize the \nimportance of YLI and that's why report language was included in the \nCommittee's report. I ask my distinguished colleague, however, to \nensure that YLI receives the requested funding in the eventual bill \nthat emerges from conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague for his kind remarks \nand for his strong statement in support of the Youth Leadership \nInitiative. The Youth Leadership Initiative is certainly an innovative \nprogram designed to enhance public participation in our democracy. I \nshare the goal of enhancing participation in our democracy, and I \nrecognize that this is a priority for the senior senator from Virginia. \nAs we conference with the House, I will keep in mind that this project \nhelps us achieve our mutual goal of increasing voter participation in \nour democracy.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you Senator Specter for your support of YLI.\n\n\n                          star schools grants\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there has been some uncertainty in my \nstate about the continuation of Star School grants. For my colleagues \nwho are not familiar with Star Schools, it is a grant program that has \nhelped distance learning move forward in many parts of the country. The \nbeneficiaries in my state include many students in the San Juan school \ndistrict, a small, rural, and remote school district in southeastern \nUtah. Many Star School grants have been awarded to the winners of a \ncompetition. Often these grants are multi-year grants. Some recipients \nare fearful about losing funding for the continuation of their grants \nif new projects are funded. Is it the intent of the chairman that \ncontinuing grants will receive a high priority in funding allocations?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It was my intent to include enough funding in this bill \nto continue grants that have been awarded if at all possible. I believe \nthe amount recommended by the Senate will provide the means to do so. \nWhile I do not know what the conference committee's final \nrecommendation will be for Star Schools, it is my desire that there be \nenough dollars allocated to fund ongoing grants as planned.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman for clarifying his intent, and for \nhis efforts to provide adequate funding for these projects.\n\n\n                            heartland manor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Abraham and I have come to the \nfloor to seek assurance from Senator Roth and Senator Specter that they \nwill include our amendment concerning Heartland Manor in any Medicare \nBBA fix bill that is taken up by the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the Finance Committee will be working on a \nMedicare BBA repair bill and will review this amendment for possible \ninclusion in any such legislation and I believe he will give you such \nassurance directly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the assurance that the Senator from \nPennsylvania has given on this issue. I would like to ask the Chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, will he review our amendment \nfor possible inclusion in any Medicare BBA legislation that he takes up \nthis year?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, we will review the amendment through the committee \nprocess to determine inclusion in any Medicare BBA package that the \nFinance Committee takes up this year. I recognize how important this \namendment is to the Senators from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Senators Roth and Specter for their help in this \nmatter and I look forward to working with Senator Roth as we move \nforward with this amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I also thank Senators Roth and Specter for their help \nand appreciate their assurances.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to describe this amendment and why it is so \nnecessary. Our amendment concerns Heartland Manor, a nursing home \nlocated in Flint, Michigan, that provides care to an underserved \npopulation. Heartland Manor is not out to make money--it is owned by \nthe Hurley Foundation which is not for profit 501(c)(3) subsidiary of \nHurley Medical Center. Hurley Medical Center is a not for profit public \nhospital with an excellent reputation. Hurley Medical Center is one of \nthe few city owned hospitals left in the country, and it is the largest \nhospital in Flint, Michigan.\n  On July 27, 1989, Chateau Gardens, a privately owned nursing home \nfacility, was terminated from the Medicare program. On January 1, 1994, \nHurley Foundation, a not for profit 501(c)(3) subsidiary of Hurley \nMedical Center, purchased Chateau Gardens at the request of the state. \nIn 1994 Heartland Manor applied for certification into the Medicare \nprogram as a new or prospective provider. Heartland Manor had never \nbefore entered into a Medicare participation agreement and had never \nbeen issued a provider number. However, HCFA treated Heartland as a re-\nentry provider and Heartland was subsequently denied participation into \nthe Medicare program based in large part on violations which HCFA \ncarried over from Chateau Gardens, the previous owner. If Heartland \nManor had been treated as a new provider, it would have been approved \nand would presently be in the Medicare program.\n\n  This amendment would allow the facility to come into the Medicare \nprogram as a prospective provider which is exactly how the facility \nshould be treated.\n  Heartland Manor has the backing of Citizens for Better Care, a \nnonprofit agency, funded by the United Way, which monitors nursing home \ncare in Michigan. Moreover, the Mayor of Flint, Woodrow Stanley, the \nCongressman representing Flint, Representative Dale Kildee, and State \nSenator Bob Emerson all want to keep this nursing home open. These \norganizations and I wouldn't all be supportive of the facility if this \nnursing home were not meeting the needs of the Flint community.\n  I have visited Heartland manor and I believe that it should not be \nclosed. I would not make such a bold assertion if I could not honestly \nsay that this is a nursing home that has made great strides in recent \nyears and which is now providing an important service to the Flint \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure \nthat this amendment is part of any Medicare BBA package.\n\n\n                            Dental SeaLants\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I rise today in strong support of the use of dental \nsealants for children for purposes of oral health promotion and disease \nprevention. They have been proven to be safe and effective in the \nprevention of dental caries in children, and when coupled with \nfluoridated water systems can virtually eliminate dental decay and \nreduce tooth loss. I believe that the most successful dental sealant \nprograms for our children covered in the EPSDT programs in Medicaid \ncould be those that are school linked and community based. Analyses \nshow that an amount of $1,000,000 is a reasonable amount to begin a \ndemonstration project such as this.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am pleased that the Labor HHS Appropriations bill \ncontains language to provide for a multistate dental sealant \ndemonstration project. I feel that the Maternal Child Health Bureau of \nthe Health Resources and Services Administration will be the most \nappropriate entity to conduct a quality demonstration program. I concur \nwith the Senator from New Mexico that this amount seems reasonable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from New Mexico for raising this \nimportant public health matter. Prevention is a high priority for our \nsubcommittee as we have invested significant amounts of resources in \nbolstering the agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service. The amount \nthe Senator suggests is reasonable for a demonstration project and I \nconcur that the Maternal Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources \nand Services Administration is an appropriate agency to conduct a \nquality demonstration program.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senators from Pennsylvania and Iowa and \nurge the department to conduct the demonstration project in an \nexpeditious manner. Despite the fact that\n\n[[Page S12205]]\n\ndental sealants have been available for over 25 years, their use \nremains low and children deserve this preventive service.\n\n\n                     pediatric research initiative\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, and his subcommittee, for the tremendous \njob they have done in putting together this $312 billion bill. It is \nnot easy to work within tight budget caps and fund so many agencies and \ninstitutes at levels that will make all members--and constituents--\nhappy. I'd like to take this opportunity to especially thank Senator \nSpecter for his hard work and dedication in providing start-up funding \nfor the Ricky Ray Fund. Even though we would have all liked to have \nseen full funding, I realize that Senator Specter and his subcommittee \nperformed a monumental task in funding $50 million to make the Ricky \nRay Fund a reality. I look forward to working with my colleagues next \nyear to finish the job we are beginning in this appropriations bill and \nfund the remaining amounts for the Ricky Ray Fund that we authorized \nlast year.\n  As for the appropriations bill that is before us, I would like to ask \nmy colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to clarify the \n``Pediatric Research Initiative'' provision that is on page 138 of the \nCommittee Report. It is my understanding that the Report should state \nthat the ``Committee further encourages the Director of NIH to expand \nextramural research directly related to the illnesses and conditions \naffecting children.'' The Report currently states that the National \nInstitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) should expand \nextramural research, but it should state that the Committee encourages \nthe Director of NIH to expand extramural pediatric research--is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, that is correct. The Office of the Director \ncurrently funds the Pediatric Research Initiative at NIH, and we are \nencouraging the Director to expand extramural pediatric research.\n  Mr. DeWine. The Committee Report also currently states that the \nCommittee also encourages the Institute to provide additional support \nfor institutional and individual research training grants for medical \nschools' departments of pediatrics. It is my sense that the Report \nshould state that the Committee encourages the NICHD to provide \nadditional support for institutional and individual research training \ngrants for medical schools' departments of pediatrics. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, my colleague is correct. The NICHD supports such \npediatric research training grants, and the Committee is encouraging \nNICHD to expand its support for such pediatric research training \ngrants. I will work to ensure that the Conference Report for this bill \naccurately reflects these clarifications, which my colleague from Ohio \nand I have just discussed.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Again, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his \nclarifications and for his tremendous effort in increasing the funds \nfor NIH to ensure that medical research, including pediatric research, \nremains a top priority for our country.\n\n\n       Treatment of Child and Adolescent Violence Related Trauma\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As you know, it is well documented that domestic, \nschool, and community violence survived or witnessed by children and \nadolescents causes psychological trauma with very real and serious \nconsequences. These consequences can be physical (changes in the brain, \ndelayed development), psychological (anxiety, depression, learning \ndifficulty), or interpersonal (aggressive and violent behavior, \naffected individuals passing on the problems to their children). \nFortunately, there is a growing body of knowledge that attests to the \neffectiveness of treating this psychological trauma. While the course \nof treatment may vary depending on the type of trauma, the length of \nexposure, and the age of the child, it undoubtedly requires staff with \nthe specialized training needed to identify the signs and symptoms of \ntrauma, and to provide the appropriate therapeutic interventions. In \nthe wake of the violent tragedies in schools, community centers, \nchurches, and increasingly in communities and homes across this \ncountry, the desperate need to develop this specialized expertise and \nto make it more widely available could not be clearer.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I could not agree more with my friend from Massachusetts \nand I have been pleased to work with him on this vitally important \nissue. Research has shown that children exposed to negative brain \nstimulation in the form of physical abuse or community violence causes \nthe brain to be miswired making it difficult for the child to learn, \ndevelop healthy family relationships, reduce peer pressure, and to \ncontrol violent impulses. Early intervention and treatment is much more \nsuccessful than adult rehabilitation. This certainly points to a need \nfor more early intervention and treatment programs for children and \nadolescents who suffer from violence related trauma. It also highlights \nthe need for more professional training in the best practices for \ntreating this psychological trauma.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the remarks from my friend from Alaska and \nthank him for his interest in children and in child development. I \nwould also like to thank my friend from Pennsylvania, the Chairman of \nthe Labor-HHS-Education Sub-Committee, for his longstanding commitment \nto children. I understand that bill before us includes $10 million for \nthe creation of national centers of excellence on youth violence. I \nalso understand that a key aspect of these centers is going to be the \ndevelopment of effective treatments for violence related psychological \ntrauma in children, youth, and families, and the provision of training \nand technical assistance needed to make these best practices more \nwidely available. Is that the Sub-Committee Chairman's understanding.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes it is. My friend from Massachusetts has identified a \ncritically important need and this activity is intended to be an \nintegral function of these centers of excellence.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have worked closely on this with both the Sub-\nCommittee Chairman and Senator from Massachusetts, and this is \ncertainly my understanding as well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank both the Full Committee Chairman and the Sub-\nCommittee Chairman for that clarification, and I hope that as we move \nforward with this process, should additional funding become available, \nthat it could be targeted to this effort. I thank my colleagues and I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                    gender-based digestive diseases\n\n  Mr. REID. I rise today to address an issue of great concern to me. I \nwas recently made aware of the findings contained in a recent report \nfrom the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) regarding gender-\nbased differences in digestive diseases. The report identifies \nirritable bowel syndrome, functional bowel disorder and colorectal \ncancer treatment and detection as serious health problems that \ndisproportionately affect women.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am aware of this report and also am very concerned \nabout gender based differences in digestive diseases.\n  Mr. REID. The ORWH report recommends that Federal research efforts \nfocus on the need to: (1) develop a better understanding of the \nmechanisms of gastrointestinal motility and altered sensitivity to \nsensory dysfunction that will help explain why irritable bowel syndrome \nso disproportionately affects women more than men; (2) examine the \nrelationship between hereditary colon cancer and gynecologic malignancy \nin women; and (3) determine the relationship between functional bowel \ndiseases and pelvic floor dysfunction. As a result of these findings \nand recommendations, I hope that the Office on Women's Health will work \nwith NIDDK to address these digestive diseases that so \ndisproportionately affect women.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I strongly believe that NIH should respond to the \nrecommendations in this ORWH report and examine this problem as soon as \npossible.\n\n\n                              cdc funding\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nRanking Member of the Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee on funding for \nthe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention's building and \nfacilities project. The CDC's physical plant facilities are in dire \nneed of expansion and renovation. The lack of adequate laboratory and \nresearch facilities is crippling one of the nation's\n\n[[Page S12206]]\n\ncritical resources. Some of the infectious disease laboratories which \nconduct research on deadly organisms are 60-year old temporary wooden \nstructures. This raises serious concerns regarding safety for employees \nand the public. The existing CDC's buildings and facilities threatens \nthe United States' position as the world's last line of defense for \nprotecting the health of the public.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I concur with Senator Cleland's concerns \nand share in his support of the CDC and its vital role in research and \npublic safety. The Senate Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee had one of its most challenging years developing the FY \n2000 budget. The Subcommittee recommended a total of $60 million for \nCDC, $40 million in regular line item building and facilities \nconstruction and an additional $20 million in emergency funding. This \nrepresents a significant portion of the funding needed by the CDC.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I commend the Chairman and Ranking Member and the Labor/\nHHS/Education Appropriations Subcommittee for the FY 2000 \nappropriations bill. Under the circumstances, The Subcommittee has done \na more than adequate job than others in addressing CDC's needs. The \nAdministration's FY 2000 budget request was $39.8 million for all of \nCDC's buildings and facilities activities, including the repair and \nimprovement of existing structures. The House Labor/HHS/Education \nSubcommittee mark was for $40 million for buildings and facilities. The \nRanking Member is correct in stating that the Senate Subcommittee \nexceeded the Administration and marks by $20 million. I want to state \nfor the record that, given the need, the initial funding request was \nset far too low. The CDC needs $141 million or an additional $81 \nmillion to modernize the substandard existing buildings and \nlaboratories. I would request that Senate conferees examine all \npossible sources to obtain additional funding for CDC, and at the very \nleast, hold firm behind the Senate's funding level in conference.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank you Senator Cleland for clarifying the funding \nneeds for the CDC building infrastructure. We will continue to seek \nways to provide funding to adequately bring the CDC physical plant to \nnot only meet standard safety levels, but to exceed those levels. We \nhave an obligation to maintain this world renowned institution and to \nfacilitate its ability to attract highly skilled scientists, provide a \nsafe environment for the research of highly pathogenic organisms and to \nfulfill its intended objectives.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. One last point: does the Chairman \nand Ranking Member believe that it would be appropriate for the \nAdministration to submit a more adequate proposal for CDC buildings and \nfacilities in its FY 2001 budget?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator is correct. I would hope that the FY 2001 \nAdministration budget will appropriately address CDC's need for \nfacilities expansion and renovation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I too agree that the FY 2001 budget will address this \nissue.\n\n\n                          vocational education\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am concerned about the funding level in the Senate bill \nfor vocational education. While the Senate bill generally increases our \ninvestment in education, unfortunately funding for vocational education \nbasic state grants would remain at the President's request of \n$1,030,650,000.\n  Funding for vocational education basic state grants has been \nvirtually frozen over the last several years by both the Congress and \nthe President. Consequently funding for vocational, career, and \ntechnical programs has not kept pace either with inflation or with \nfunding for other education programs. In fact, if vocational education \nfunding had simply kept pace with inflation over the last eight years, \nit would be $220 million greater than is being proposed for FY2000. I \nwould suggest an additional $100 million in funding for basic state \ngrants, which represents about a 10 percent increase, but \nrealistically, I believe $50 million would represent a reasonable step \nin the correct direction.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I share the concerns of the Senator from North Dakota \nabout the proposed funding level for vocational education. As the \nChairman of the Senate Subcommittee that had the responsibility for \nreauthorizing the Perkins Act, I can assure my colleagues that the \nreauthorization of this law, which Congress enacted last year with \nstrong bipartisan support updated the Perkins programs. The authorized \nfunding level for the Perkins Act was increased by $10 million from \n$1.14 billion to $1.15 billion. Now that this work is done, now is the \nappropriate time to increase funding for vocational education.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator from Ohio's leadership on this \nissue and the Senator from Alaska's comments in support of vocational \neducation funding at the Appropriations Committee mark-up. I wonder if \nthe Senator from Alaska would give his assurance that he will work to \nsecure additional funding for vocational education as the Labor-HHS-\nEducation appropriations bill moves forward?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I share the concerns that the Senators are raising and \njoin in their support of vocational education. I want to assure them \nthat I am committed to work with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania \nto try to find additional funds for vocational education during \nConference. I also want to encourage the Administration to request an \nincrease in funds for vocational education in its FY2001 budget \nsubmission.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to add my support to the comments that have been \nmade here. I, too, feel strongly that additional funding for vocational \neducation is urgently warranted, and I will do what I can as the \nranking member on the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee \nto direct more resources to basic state grants in this area. Will the \nChairman of the Subcommittee also join me in this effort?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I recognize that funding for vocational education has \nnot kept up with inflation or with funding for other education \nprograms. I will work with Chairman Stevens, Senator Dorgan, Senator \nDeWine, and Senator Harkin to try to obtain additional funding for \nvocational education.\n\n\n The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey's Child Health \n                               Institute\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to ask the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill if they would consider a request I have concerning \nthe conference. Knowing the great difficulty they faced in reporting a \nbill that would not exceed this year's stringent budget restrictions, I \nunderstand why they were not able to provide funding for the University \nof Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey's (UMDNJ) Child Health \nInstitute. However, I hope that funding for the Children's Health \nInstitute can be found in conference.\n  The increased attention to childhood disease clusters in various \ncommunities throughout New Jersey and other states require molecular \nstudies for an explanation and solution. In that regard, UMDNJ of the \nRobert Wood Johnson Medical School developed the Child Health Institute \nof New Jersey as a comprehensive biomedical research center focused on \nthe development, growth and maturation of children.\n  The mission of the Institute is to improve child health and quality \nof life by fostering scientific research that will produce new \ndiscoveries about the causes of many childhood diseases and new \ntreatments for these diseases. Researchers will direct their efforts \ntoward the prevention and cure of environmental, genetic and cellular \ndiseases of infants and children. The Institute will work closely with \nboth the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the Environmental and \nOccupational Health Science Institute--two NIH-designated centers of \nexcellence. Organizations which also played a part in developing the \nChild Health Institute.\n  The Institute is seeking funds to develop three components: a program \nin Molecular Genetics and Development; (2) a program in Development and \nBehavior; and (3) a program in Environment and Development. These \nprograms will study human development and its disorders, noting the \nchanging environmental conditions which alter gene function during \ndevelopment, maturation and aging. Institute scientists will also study \nhuman growth and development and the emergence of cognition, motion, \nconsciousness and individuality.\n  The hospitals in central New Jersey birth nearly 20,000 babies each \nyear. The founding of the Child Health Institute has created an \nextraordinary\n\n[[Page S12207]]\n\nhealth care resource for those hospitals and the patients they serve. \nThe new Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital \nis scheduled to open in 2000 and the Child Health Institute in 2001. \nTogether these institutions will provide state of the art clinical and \nscientific research and treatment complex to serve children and their \nfamilies, not only in New Jersey, but throughout the nation with \ncutting edge care and the latest scientific developments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Indeed, New Jersey is poised to become a regional and \nnational resource for research into the genetic and environmental \ninfluences on child development and childhood disease. Working in close \npartnership with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the \nChild Health Institute of New Jersey will become a force for healthy \nchildren nationwide. I thank my fellow Senator from the State of New \nJersey and join him in giving my highest recommendation for this \nproject.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his efforts \non this project. I believe that the work of the Institute is an \nappropriate focus for the committee because the research focus will be \nof enormous value for the nation as a whole. Indeed, the Child Health \nInstitute will be one of the world's only research centers to examine \nnot only the biological and chemical effects on childhood, but also the \neffects of behavioral and societal influences as well.\n  The Child Health Institute's request is for $10 million in one time \nfunding from the federal government for the construction of the \nInstitute building. Total building costs are estimated at $27 million. \nThe Institute has already raised more than $13 million from private \nsources including $5.5 million from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \nand $5.5 million from Johnson and Johnson. Also, the Robert Wood \nJohnson University Hospital has made a $2 million in-kind contribution \nof the land on which the Institute will be built. At maturity, the \nChild Health is expected to attract $7 to $9 million in new research \nfunding annually, as well as provide $52 million in revenue for the \nlocal economy.\n  Mr. President, funding for the Child Health Institute in this bill \nwould be entirely appropriate under Health Resources and Services \nAdministration (HRSA) account. Indeed, it would be money well spent.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I simply ask that when the bill goes to \nconference the managers remember this request for funding the UMDNJ \nChild Health Institute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have received numerous requests for funding of health \nfacilities. In the past, we have faced difficult choices in making a \ndetermination of funding priorities and this year promises to be no \nexception. We are aware of the request by the Child Health Institute \nand commend its efforts toward enhancing its research and service \ncapacity. In conference, we will keep in mind its request as well as \nthose with similar meritorious characteristics and goals.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I, too, am aware of the Child Health Institute request \nfor assistance and share Senator Specter's views on this matter.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank both my distinguished colleagues for their \nassistance with this matter.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I also would like to thank my colleagues for their \nhelp.\n\n\n                       MEDICARE INTEGRITY PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am very concerned about the proposed $70 million \nfunding cut to the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) approved by the \nHouse Appropriations Committee. The Senate has recommended that MIP be \nfunded at $630 million, the amount authorized in the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).\n  In 1998, Medicare contractors saved the Medicare Trust Fund nearly $9 \nbillion in inappropriate payments--about $17 for every dollar invested. \nAny funding cut to MIP is tantamount to the government throwing money \nout the window. In fact, I believe, because of the tremendous need to \nreduce an estimated $13 billion in Medicare waste, we should increase \nMIP funding. Therefore, I will work hard to ensure that the Senate \nfunding level for this important program is not compromised.\n  Mr. ROTH. I've long been committed to the effective and efficient \nmanagement of the Medicare program, specifically the detection of fraud \nand abuse. I supported the creation of the MIP program, established \nunder HIPAA, to provide a stable and increasing funding source for \nfraud and abuse detection efforts. Prior to MIP, Medicare contractor \nfunding for anti-fraud and abuse activities was often reduced because \nof other spending priorities in the annual appropriations process. MIP \nwas created to prevent that from happening again. The House \nAppropriations Committee recommendation is in clear disregard of \ncongressional intent.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the importance of the MIP program to the \nintegrity of the Medicare Trust Fund, and I will work to ensure that \nMIP is funded at the Senate recommended level of $630 million.\n\n\n Prevention and Treatment of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n                                Effects\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have worked closely with my colleagues \nSenator Stevens, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin to make treatment \nand prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effect \n(FAE) more of a federal priority and to place language in the report \naccompanying the Fiscal Year 2000 Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations bill to underscore this commitment. I \nappreciate their efforts to support programs that will prevent and \naddress this important public health problem and their commitment to \ncontinuing those efforts as they serve on the conference committee.\n  There is a dramatic need for an additional infusion of resources to \naddress alcohol-related birth defects, which are the leading known \ncause of mental retardation. These funds are needed for the development \nof public awareness and education programs, health and human service \nprovider training, standardized diagnostic criteria and other \nstrategies called for in the competitive grant program authorized under \nthe Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and \nServices Act. These resources will complement the excellent work that \nhas been started by grass-roots organizations like the National \nOrganization for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and the Family Resource \nInstitute.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Stevens, Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin to promote treatment and prevention of FAS and FAE. It \nshould be a priority for the Fiscal Year 2000 conference committee to \nfund these much-needed programs, and I am hopeful that the conferees \nwill be able to find additional resources for this purpose. I believe \nit is critical that we provide line item funding for the competitive \nprogram that this Congress authorized last year. I look forward to \nworking with the Administration and my colleagues in the Senate toward \nthat end as they begin to draft the Fiscal Year 2001 Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I share the sentiments expressed by my \ncolleague from South Dakota. I have witnessed first hand the \ndevastating effects of FAS and FAE in Alaska, which has the highest \nrate of FAS/FAE in the nation. Our Alaska Native people are especially \nat risk for these entirely preventable conditions. It has been \nestimated that the lifetime cost of treating and providing necessary \nservices for a single victim of FAS/FAE is in excess of $1 million. I \nam pleased that the bill before us contains language encouraging the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to provide necessary resources \nto fund comprehensive FAS/FAE prevention, education and treatment \nprograms for Alaska and for a four-state region including South Dakota \nand will work with the conference committee to ensure that funds are \navailable for these programs. I also support language in the report \nmandating development of a nationwide, comprehensive FAS/FAE research, \nprevention and treatment plan. I know that federal support can make a \ndifference. In Alaska, federal assistance has allowed two residential \ntreatment programs for pregnant women and their children--the Dena A \nCoy program in Anchorage and the Lifegivers program in Fairbanks--to \nmake a positive difference in the lives of numerous Alaska Native women \nand their children. I look forward to working with my colleague to find \nreal solutions to\n\n[[Page S12208]]\n\nthe problems of alcohol-related birth defects.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have worked closely with my colleagues \nto find creative ways to address FAS and FAE at the federal level while \ndrafting the Fiscal Year 2000 Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations bill. I agree that it is critical to continue \nthat effort during the conference with members from the House of \nRepresentatives in order to further improve the federal commitment to \nindividuals with FAS and FAE and their families.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice in support of \nthe comments expressed by my colleagues from South Dakota, Alaska and \nPennsylvania. FAS and FAE are 100 percent preventable. Our country \nshould be doing everything it can to put an end to alcohol-related \nbirth defects and help individuals and families trying to copy with the \ndisease.\n\n\n                          idea funding at nih\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to address a question to my friend from \nPennsylvania regarding the Institutional Development Awards (IDeA) \nProgram funding within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget. \nI am joined by my colleagues Senators Lott, Daschle, and Reid in \nsupport of the House level of funding for IDeA in the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education, and related agencies Appropriations \nbill. It is my understanding that the Senate level is $20,000,000 while \nthe House level is $40,000,000.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my understanding that movement to the House level is \nnot an increase in the NIH budget, is that correct? As I understand it, \nthis would reallocate money within the NIH budget and that this would \nnot be additional funding. This would set aside a portion of NIH \nresearch money for those states, Mississippi included, to more fully \nexploit the opportunities to develop a competitive biomedical research \nbase.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The distinguished Majority Leader is correct. The point \nof this inquiry is to ask the chairman if he would reserve some \nresources for those IDeA states that receive the least among of \nresearch money.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree with my colleagues that this program is of \ntremendous benefit to rural states and to our nation's ability to \nproduce top quality research. In recent years, five states have \nreceived 48 percent of the NIH research money. We need to broaden this \ndistribution. In my state of South Dakota, universities have benefitted \nfrom this program in the past, but we need to continue this investment \nso that they may compete for research monies on an equal footing. \nIncreasing IDeA funding would help to meet this goal.\n  Mr. REID. I would also like to point out that according to the NIH's \nown figures, an average IDeA state, such as Nevada, receives $67 per \nperson in research money while the other states receive, on average, \n$258 per person. This program helps to disburse this vital research \nmoney to those states who traditionally do not fair well but can \nperform this research for much lower overhead and indirect costs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would also add that Oklahoma only receives, an \naverage, $45 per person of research money.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would agree with Senators Lott, \nDaschle, and Reid on the value of the IDeA program. As Senator Nickles \nmentioned before, we did increase this allocation from fiscal year 1999 \nin order to broaden the geographic distribution of NIH funding of \nbiomedical research by enhancing the competitiveness of biomedical and \nbehavioral research institutions which historically have had low rates \nof success in obtaining funding. With their concern in mind, I would \ntherefore like to assure my fellow Senators that when we conference, we \nwill take a very close look at the House funding level of $40,000,000 \nfor IDeA.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to thank the Chairman for his assistance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Fiscal Year 2000 \nAppropriations bill funding the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education. I would like to thank Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin for the tremendous job they and their staffs have done \non an extremely large, complex, and vitally important appropriations \nbill. This bill is important because it meets the day-to-day needs of \nAmericans as well as the long-range needs of our country.\n  However, I am concerned that the Senate has had to resort to gimmicks \nand tricks such as ``forward funding'' and ``emergency spending.'' When \nCongress resorts to these tricks, it means we're not doing our job \nright. The GM worker in Baltimore can't ``forward fund'' or declare his \nnext trip to the grocery store ``emergency spending.'' If a mother \ncan't pay for her children's health care using such devices, then \nCongress should not be able to resort to them to pay for our children's \neducation, health care for the underserved, or job training.\n  I am pleased with a number of funding levels in this bill. I know \nthat Senators Specter and Harkin had a difficult task in funding so \nmany programs that meet compelling human needs. As the Senator for and \nfrom the National Institutes of Health, I am very glad to see the $2 \nbillion increase in NIH funding, which keeps us on pace to double NIH's \nbudget over five years. I am particularly pleased with the $680.3 \nmillion for the National Institute on Aging (NIA). This is an increase \nof more than $80 million over last year. As we double NIH's budget, I \nbelieve that it is especially important to double NIA's budget. Our \npopulation is aging; by 2030 there will be about 70 million Americans \nage 65 and older, more than twice their number in 1997. This is clearly \nan investment in the future health of our nation.\n  Many of the day-to-day needs of our nation's seniors are met by the \nOlder Americans Act (OAA). It is heartening to see the $35 million \nincrease in funding for home delivered meals because it is greatly \nneeded. We are seeing an increased demand for home delivered meals \nwhich assist more older persons in remaining in their homes and \ncommunities. The Committee has also provided a $1 million increase for \nthe ombudsman program and an $8 million increase to $26 million for \nstate and local innovations/projects of national significance (Title \nIV).\n  I am disappointed that other programs under the Older Americans Act \ndid not see needed increases in funding. OAA programs have been level \nfunded and losing ground for too long. I am also deeply concerned that \nthere is no provision to fund the National Family Caregiver Support \nProgram. This program would offer valuable services to assist our \nnation's caregivers by providing respite care, counseling, information, \nand assistance among other services. This program has strong bipartisan \nsupport. I would urge that we look at ways to provide the necessary \nresources for this program in Fiscal Year 2000 so that it can be funded \nonce it is authorized. As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on \nAging, I will continue to work with my colleagues on the HELP Committee \nto reauthorize the OAA during Fiscal Year 2000.\n  In addition, I was distressed by the drastic cut of almost $860 \nmillion to the Social Services Block Grant. However, I'm pleased that \nthe Senate has restored these funds. The Social Services Block Grant \nprovides help to those who practice self help. In Maryland, this \nprogram funds adoption, case management, day care, foster care, home \nbased services, information and referral, prevention and protective \nservices to more than 200,000 people.\n\n  I must also mention the importance of funding for the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC). I am very aware of the funding \nconstraints the we have been operating under and believe that the $30 \nmillion increase for CDC is a step in the right direction. However, it \nis below the President's budget request and does not go far enough. \nWhile I am appreciative of the efforts to increase funding to modernize \nCDC's facilities and improve public health infrastructure, CDC has been \nrevenue starved for too long. Improving public health in our country \nrequires investments in NIH, CDC, and FDA. I am thrilled with our \nsupport of NIH, but I believe that if we do not provide sufficient \nresources to CDC and FDA we are only doing part of the job. I would \nurge that we consider this as we move to conference on this bill and \nwhen we look at funding for these agencies next year.\n  I am also pleased at the funding levels of many of our national \neducation programs and this bill is certainly better than the one that \npassed the House.\n\n[[Page S12209]]\n\n I am very concerned that the funding level for the bill overall has \nbeen reduced to pay for other programs. The spending caps put us in a \ntough position. And it is education that always suffers the most.\n  Like I said, even though the Senate funding levels are much better \nthan the House, there are at least two major problems with the Senate \nbill. There is no funding in this bill for school construction and \nthere is no funding in this bill for lowering class size and hiring \n100,000 new teachers. Last year, we passed a bipartisan bill, and we \nall agreed to lower class size. We agreed that this is one of the most \nimportant things we can do for our kids and our classrooms. Yet this \nbill contains no money for class size.\n  There is also no funding for school construction. What happened to \nour commitment to make sure our kids are not attending classes in \ncrumbling schools? I see there is $1.2 billion in the bill for \nsomething called ``Teacher Assistance Initiative.'' As far as I know, \nno one knows what this means exactly. Like Senator Murray said on the \nfloor of the Senate last week, it clearly isn't class size reduction.\n  I have serious reservations about this bill. It does not live up to \nthe commitment we made here in the Senate to reduce class size and hire \n100,000 teachers. It does nothing to fix our broken down schools. And \nthe House bill is even worse.\n  The House bill cuts $2.8 billion out of the President's education \nagenda to improve public schools. It denies 42,000 additional children \nthe opportunity to participate in Head Start. It repeals last year's \nbipartisan agreement to fund 100,000 new teachers to create smaller \nclasses. It combines Class Size Reduction, Eisenhower Teacher Training \nand Goals 2000 into a block grant funded at $200 million less than the \nauthorized level and $396 million less than the President's request for \ncomparable programs.\n  Given our recent tragedies in our schools, it is a shame that the \nHouse bill denies after school services to an additional 850,000 \n``latch key'' children in 3,300 communities during the critical 2-6 \np.m. hours when children are most likely to get into trouble. The bill \nalso freezes federal funding to help schools to create safer learning \nenvironments and denies funding for an additional 400 drug and school \nviolence coordinators serving 2,000 middle schools.\n  We need to work hard in conference. We are going to have to fight to \nkeep our stand behind our kids. We cannot allow the House to gut these \nimportant programs. We cannot let the Senate ignore class size and \nschool construction. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nmake sure we increase the Federal investment in education.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this evening we will vote on what is \narguably the most important of our 13 appropriations bills, the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services and Education Appropriations Act. When it \ncomes to funding for education, the Congress has fundamentally ignored \nthe messages of the American people. In this bill, education spending \nremains in the neighborhood of 1.6 percent of overall federal spending, \na very poor neighborhood indeed. The American people cannot understand \nwhy, if education is their first priority, it is the last bill passed \nand the lowest funding priority of their Congress. They cannot fathom \nwhy, in a year when school districts across the country are hiring \nhighly-qualified teachers to reduce class size, the Congress is walking \naway from its commitment.\n  The House, regrettably, has done far worse by education than any of \nus could have imagined. The drastic cuts to education that would take \neffect under the House bill would send America back into the 19th \ncentury, not forward into the 21st. The House bill would cause 142,000 \nfewer children to be served in Head Start, would keep 50,000 students \nout of after-school programs, and would deprive 2.1 million children in \nhigh-poverty communities of extra help in mastering the basics of \nreading and math.\n  The Senate has done better by our schools, but only through smoke-\nand-mirrors budgeteering that should give our school communities no \nlong-term confidence. Advance funding is not without effect on the \nlocal school budget, which demands consistency and predictability.\n  The numbers in the Senate bill are a better level from which to \nnegotiate in the conference committee, but even these funding levels \nignore the grim reality that our schools face a fundamentally tougher \njob than they did even five years ago, with skyrocketing enrollment, of \nstudents who are more expensive to educate, and who have less support \nat home and in the community.\n  Despite all this, at least the Senate provides current funding for \nmost educational services, makes some effort toward meeting the higher \nneeds in others, and does a good job of providing new investments in a \nfew areas. Funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education \nAct is increased by more than $900 million, a good start toward meeting \nour national commitment to fund forty percent of a local school \ndistrict's costs of educating a disabled child.\n  The $200 per student increase for Pell grants is a good investment, \nbut only about half of what is needed this year. I'm particularly proud \nthat we were able to increase funding for adult and family literacy, by \nincreasing the adult basic education program by more than $100 million. \nThis means that thousands more adults and their families will be able \nto take the first steps toward increased viability in our changing \neconomy.\n  The failures in this bill are many, however. As an example, let's \nlook at funding for vocational and technical education. Current funding \nor freezes in funding are not sufficient in a world where the economy \nchanges as rapidly as ours is changing. Young people need the skills \nnot only to survive but to thrive. All young people need access to \napplied skills as well as theoretical ones, in order for them to \nsucceed in the workplace, the classroom, and in life. And yet, we do \nnot make the significant investments needed.\n  The largest failure of all, of course, is the backward step the \nmajority is taking on class size reduction. Reducing class size by \nhelping school districts hire 100,000 high-quality teachers nationwide \nis an investment in our schools that is paying dividends right now. The \nfirst 30,000 teachers are in the classroom, and what a classroom it is. \nTo walk from a class with 25 or 28 first graders into one of the \nsmaller classes I've been visiting this fall is a stark contrast. \nImproved achievement, increased time on task, more individual \nattention, and a lack of discipline problems are obvious in the smaller \nclass. The teacher in the larger class looks as if he is running to \ncatch up, and the student must keep her hand in the air for too long a \ntime. This is a very real, tangible investment we have made in our \nschools. The Senate and the House, on a completely partisan basis, are \nreneging on the most common-sense investment in school improvement made \nin recent history. The reason that the Republicans are so afraid of \nthese 30,000 teachers is that this program is actually working.\n  Pili Wolfe, Principal at Lyon Elementary School in Tacoma, \nWashington, where federal class size funds are being used to \ndramatically reduce class size in first grade, and to provide high-\nquality professional development for teachers through a program called \nGreat Start, says: ``Children in our first-grade Great Start classrooms \nhave shown more growth within the first month of school than any \nprevious first-grade class.''\n  Andrea Holzapfel, a first-grade teacher at Lyon, says: ``Smaller \nnumbers allow me to spend significantly more time in individual and \nsmall-group instruction. Having fewer children allows more \nparticipation by the kids in discussion and classroom activities.''\n  The program works. The one-page, on-line application form means no \npaperwork, no bureaucracy. Two-hundred and sixty-one of Washington \nstate's two-hundred and ninety-six school districts have already put \nclass size reduction and teacher professional development into effect \nin their schools. The accountability is to the local community, through \na school report card describing how many teachers were hired and in \nwhich grades. Improved student achievement will be the ultimate measure \nof the success of this year's investment.\n  But the investment cannot stop here.\n  The President has said that this bill is headed for a veto, because \nof the\n\n[[Page S12210]]\n\nlack of continued investment in class size reduction, and other key \neducation efforts.\n  One such effort is GEAR UP, which enables low-income schools and \ntheir neighboring colleges to form partnerships to get mentors to help \nstudents study hard, stay in school, and go on to college. Funding for \nthis program is only $180 million, not the $240 necessary to get this \nimportant investment to the communities where it is needed most.\n  Increased funding for after-school programs was given short shrift, \ndespite what the research shows about the link between young people \nhaving no positive pursuits in the afternoon and evening, and the \nrelated increase in crime.\n  Education technology has been cut by the House, and the Senate \nnumbers are not sufficient to meet the growing need in an area where \nthe federal government is the primary funding source in most schools \nand communities, far beyond the investments made by states and \nlocalities.\n  When it comes to education, this Congress has not stepped up to the \nvery challenge we are asking the educators, students, families and \ncommunities across America to meet. When the expectations on Congress \nincreased, the level of commitment and vision decreased.\n  I am voting for this bill to move the process along. If class size \nfunding and other key investments are not restored, the conference \nreport will be vetoed. If it is vetoed, I and many of my colleagues \nwill vote to sustain that veto. This bill in its current form is only a \nvehicle through which we may negotiate higher numbers in conference.\n  The American people have a stake in this battle. We need to hear \ntheir voices now.\n\n  This has been a difficult vote for me. While the bill does provide a \nsignificant investment in public health and safety, it does so on the \nbacks of our children and retreating from our commitment to improve \nclass size. This bill cannot survive in its current form.\n  I do want to point out what I believe are positive aspects of this \nbill. I applaud the efforts of Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin in \npreparing an appropriations bill that meets important public health \npriorities. I know how difficult this appropriations process has been \nand know their job was not easy. As a member of the Labor, Health & \nHuman Services & Education Subcommittee, I am pleased that our product \ndoes maintain our commitment and investment in public health.\n  The additional $2 billion investment for NIH alone will bring us that \nmuch closer to finding a cure for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's, \ncardiovascular, Alzheimer's, MS and AIDS. Every dollar invested in NIH \nreaps greater savings in health care dollars as well as greater savings \nin human lives. This additional investment will ensure that we remain \non a course to double NIH funding. I know how important this funding is \nand am proud to represent outstanding research institutions like the \nUniversity of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center \nwho receive significant research funding from NIH.\n  I am also pleased that we have provided funding for trauma care \nplanning and development for the states. This is an essential program \nthat assists the states in efforts to effectively develop trauma care \nstrategies. We have neglected trauma care and we have lost ground in \nlife saving delivery of critical care. I was pleased that the \nSubcommittee recognized the importance of trauma care planning.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been pushing for federal \nfunding to establish a national poison control plan. My allegiance to \n``Mr. Yuk'' is well known within this chamber, as well as within the \nHELP Committee. It was only two years ago that I offered an amendment \nduring FDA reform to protect voluntary poison control labeling like Mr. \nYuk from possible elimination. I have used my position on the \nAppropriations Committee to push for funding for poison control centers \nand for a national 1-800 hotline. I am pleased that this legislation \nincludes $3 million for poison control efforts. This line-item within \nHRSA is a major victory for children and their parents. We have taken a \nhuge step forward in developing a national poison control plan that \nbuilds on successful efforts in all of the states, like those made in \nWashington state.\n  As one of the most vocal women's health care advocates in the Senate, \nI am pleased that the Committee report to accompany this Appropriations \nbill addresses several women's health issues and enhances programs to \neliminate gender bias or discrimination. I want to thank the Chairman \nfor his support of funding for the CDC Breast and Cervical Cancer \nScreening Program for low income women. This continued commitment will \nsave lives and improve survival rates for women who often have little \nor no access to cancer screening. We know that early dedication offers \nthe greatest hope of survival.\n  I am pleased that we have been able to provide additional funding to \nexpand the WISE WOMEN program to screen for cardiovascular disease as \nwell as breast and cervical cancer. Cardiovascular disease is the \nnumber one killer of American women. Twice as many women die from \ncardiovascular disease than breast and cervical cancers combined. I was \ndisappointed that we could not find additional monies to expand this \nprogram in all 50 states, and will continue to work to secure \nadditional funding for FY2000.\n  There are many reasons why I consider the Labor, HHS Appropriations \nbill one of the most important appropriations bills and the one piece \nof legislation that truly effects all Americans and offers hope to the \nmost vulnerable. But, perhaps one of the most critical programs funded \nin this appropriations bill is funding for battered women's shelters. \nThis funding does save lives. This funding is the life line for \nbattered and abused women and children. I am proud to have worked with \nthe Chairman of the Subcommittee to increase our investment in battered \nwomen's shelters. I am working for the day when we need no more \nbattered women's shelters. Unfortunately, we have a long way to go. \nBut, by increasing the funds available by $13.5 million for FY2000, we \nhave offered communities more resources to assist victims of domestic \nviolence find a vital, life-saving safe shelter.\n  I am hopeful that these important public health investments will \nsurvive what will likely be a difficult conference with the House.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the FY \n2000 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, H. R. 1650, because it \naddresses important priorities of the American people.\n  Among other increases, this bill increases funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) by $2 billion, including a $384 million \nincrease for the National Cancer Institute. This will continue us on \nthe path of doubling the funding of NIH over five years. The President \nrequested only a 2.1 percent increase over FY 1999, which does not keep \npace with medical research inflation, projected to be 3.5 percent next \nyear.\n  The National Institutes of Health--often called the ``crown jewel'' \nof the federal government--offers hope to millions of Americans who \nsuffer from diseases like diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimers, Tourette's \nSyndrome, Parkinson's and on and on. Sadly, NIH can now only fund 31 \npercent of applications. Under the Presidents's FY 2000 proposal, it \ncould have fallen to 28 percent, a 10 percent drop. This is the wrong \ndirection, especially at a time when research is opening many new \nscientific doors.\n  Federal support for curing diseases and finding new treatments is not \na partisan issue. Federal spending on health research is only 1 percent \nof the federal budget. Sixty eight percent of Americans support \ndoubling medical research over five years; 61 percent of Americans \nsupport spending part of the surplus on medical research. Fifty five \npercent of Californians said they would pay more in taxes for more \nmedical research, in a Research America poll.\n  NIH is especially important to my state where some of the nation's \nleading research is conducted. The University of California received \n$1.7 billion in NIH funds in 1998. The federal government supports over \n55 percent of UC's research.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes $ 3.28 billion for the National \nCancer Institute. This is an increase of $384 million or 13 percent \nover last year. With\n\n[[Page S12211]]\n\nthis, NCI will be able to fund at least 10 percent more grants. If we \nhad gone along with the President proposed 2 percent increase for \ncancer research, NCI would have been able to fund 10 percent fewer \ngrants. That is the wrong direction, at a time when cancer incidence \nand deaths are about to explode.\n  Today, one in every four deaths is due to cancer. Cancer costs over \n$100 billion a year. Because of the aging of the population, the \nincidence of cancer will explode by 2010, with a 29 percent increase in \nincidence and a 25 percent increase in deaths, at a cost of over $200 \nbillion per year. The cancer burden will hit America the hardest in the \nnext 10 to 25 years as the country's demographics change. (These are \nthe findings of the September 1999 Cancer March Research Task Force.) \nCancer deaths can be reduced from 25 to 40 percent over the next 20 \nyear period, saving 150,000 to 225,000 lives each year if we do the \nright thing.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for including in the \ncommittee report language indicating that we need to increase cancer \nresearch funding consistent with the recommendations of the Research \nTask Force of the Cancer March. The Cancer March called for increasing \nthe National Cancer Institute budget by 20 percent each year for four \nyears, to get to $10 billion by 2005. This bill with its 12 to 13% \nincrease in funds is a step on the way.\n  The National Cancer Dialogue, a national group representing leaders \nof the entire cancer community and over 120 cancer organizations, \nrecommended that NCI be funded at $5 billion in FY 2000 and CDC cancer \nactivities at $516 million.\n  What can be accomplished with $5 billion for research?\n  More drugs: NCI could bring 40 new cancer drugs from the laboratory \nto clinical trials. In NIH's entire history, only 70 drugs have been \napproved for treating cancer.\n  Cancer Genetics: Continuing to identify genes involved in cancer. \nImproving our understanding of the interaction between genes and \nenvironmental exposures.\n  Imaging: Finding new ways to detect cancers earlier when they are \nsmall, not invasive and more easily treated.\n  Clinical Trials: Increase participation from 2 percent currently. \nMedicare beneficiaries account for more than 50 percent of all cancer \ndiagnoses and 60 percent of all cancer death.\n  Prevention: 70 percent of all cancers are preventable says the \nAmerican Cancer Society. By expanding the CDC's efforts to provide \ncancer screening, cancer registries and other measures to help people \nprevent cancer screening, cancer registries and other measures to help \npeople prevent cancer. For example, tobacco-related deaths are the \nsingle most preventable cause of death and disability and account for \n30 percent of all US cancer death.\n  I am also pleased to see an increase of $200 million over last year \nand $100 million over the President's request for Ryan White AIDS, as \nwell as a 12 percent increase for AIDS research at NIH.\n  California has the second highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the US. \nWhile the AIDS death rate has declined it is still too high. Over \n40,000 new infections develop each year. In California, 100,000 people \nare living with HIV/AIDS. Half of all HIV-infected people do not \nreceive regular medical care according to the Rand study, December \n1998.\n  We face serious challenges. We must find a cure. We must find new \ntreatments. HIV lingers in cells so long that the ``virus cannot be \neradicated at all with current treatments * * * it remains tucked away \nlonger than though,'' according to the New England Journal of Medicine, \nMay 1999.\n  This funding bill also includes important funding for education at \nall levels. There is hardly a more important function of government \nthan providing a solid education for our youngsters.\n  The bill raises education by $2 billion over last year. This is \nimportant in light of the decline in the federal share of total \neducation funding from 14 percent in 1980 to six percent in 1998, \naccording to the Office of Management and Budget.\n  No doubt we need to do more. Our nation's schools face unprecedented \nchallenges. My state is fraught with problems: California has 6 million \nstudents, more students than 36 states have in total population and one \nof the highest projected enrollments in the country, California will \nneed 210,000 new teachers by 2008. We have about 30,000 teachers on \nemergency credentials. We have the most diverse student body in the \ncounty. In some schools, over 50 languages are spoken. While this \ndiversity is one of my state's great strengths, in the classroom, it \nplaces huge responsibilities on teachers.\n  Buildings: We need to build 6 new classrooms per day, $809 million \nper year. Some elementary schools have over 5,000 students. Our schools \nare too big.\n  In higher education, California is preparing for ``Tidal Wave II,'' \nthe demographic bulge created by children of the baby boomers which \nwill inundate our colleges and universities between 2000 and 2010.\n  And so our needs are huge. Our challenges are great.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate did not adopt the Murray amendment \nthat would have ensured that $1.4 billion be used to hire teachers and \nreduce class size. By adding $200 million and raising the allocation \nfrom $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and specifying that it be used to \nhire teachers and reduce class sizes, California could have hired 1,100 \nnew teachers, on top of the 3,322 that will provide funding for last \nyear. I hope the conference will see the importance of this.\n  One area of this bill that I have given my attention to is ESEA Title \nI, the program that provides over $8 billion for educating poor \nchildren. Unfortunately, despite my efforts in the Appropriations \nCommittee, I was unable to delete what is known as the ``hold \nharmless'' provisions. Also, the committee would not accept my \namendment to clarify and insure that any new or additional funds, over \nlast year, go to states that are hurt by the hold harmless provision.\n  The Title I hold harmless provisions (there are two in the bill, for \nbasic grants and for concentration grants) hold states and districts \n``harmless.'' They say in essence that no state or district will \nreceive less than it did the previous year despite changes in the \nnumber of poor children. In the bill, these apply to the Title I basic \ngrants and the concentration grants. These provisions freeze funding in \nplace despite the number of poor children, despite their eligibility.\n  I tried to delete these provisions in the committee, but because, \nfrankly, there are more low-growth states than high-growth states like \nmine, in the Senate, did not have the votes to completely eliminate \nthem.\n  Here is why the hold harmless provisions are wrong: One, they violate \nthe purpose of the program since 1965, to target funds on poor \nchildren, two, they contravene the census update requirement. The \nauthorizing law requires the Department to update child poverty data \nevery year so that each state will receive funds according to the \nnumber of poor children. The hold harmless renders that requirement \nvirtually meaningless.\n  Secretary Riley wrote, April 29, 1999: ``I do share your concern that \nthe 100 percent hold-harmless provision undermines the apparent \nstatutory intent that allocations for Title I and other programs be \nbased on the most recent census data.''\n  Three, a poor child is a poor child. Congress recognized that poor \nchildren need extra help, wherever that child may be. A poor child in \nCalifornia is as worthy as a poor child in Mississippi and should not \nbe deprived of funding.\n  A July 1999 study found that students in poor school districts (West \nFresno, Mendota, Farmersville) ranked at or near the bottom of \nCalifornia's achievement tests. ``Most of the lowest-scoring school \ndistricts * * * are in rural areas with high unemployment and poverty \nand have many children from migrant farm worker families who speak \nlittle English and have little education.'' (Fresno Bee, 7/25/99)\n  Four, hold harmless provisions disproportionately hurt states with \nhigh growth rates in poor children, states like California, Arizona, \nNew Mexico, Texas, Hawaii, South Carolina, Maryland, Nevada, Virginia, \nGeorgia, Florida, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma.\n  Here are some examples of losses of Title I Funds under FY 1999 hold \nharmless: California $36 million; Florida $32\n\n[[Page S12212]]\n\nmillion; New Mexico $4.5 million; New York $48 million; North Carolina \n$8 million; Texas $32 million.\n  Last year, under the bill's Title I hold harmless, California lost \n$32 million. California has 14 percent of all Title I children and gets \n11 percent of Title I funds. (US Dept of Education). California has a \n22 percent poverty rate for children; The US rate is 18.7 percent. (9 \nstates exceed California's). California's number of poor students grew \n53 percent from 1990 to 1995; nationally, it grew 22 percent. In total \nfederal dollars, California pays 12.5 percent of federal taxes but gets \nback only 11.2 percent.\n  California receives $656 in Title I funds per poor child. The \nnational average is $745. Some states receive as much as $1,289, \naccording to the US Department of Education. California has almost 40 \npercent of the nation's immigrants. The poverty rate for immigrants \ngrew by 123 percent from 1979 to 1997. (Center for Immigration Studies, \n9/2/99). Income inequality is growing in California faster than the \nrest of the country (Public Policy Institute of California, 2/9/99)\n  Five, the hold harmlesses freeze in the status quo, even for those \nnot eligible. The hold harmless provision gives funds to states and \ndistricts that may not even be eligible for funds, merely because they \ngot funds in the past. What good are eligibility rules if we ignore \nthem, override them willy-nilly. We either have eligibility rules or we \ndon't.\n  If Congress believes the formula is not properly structured or \ntargeted, Congress should change it in the authorizing statute. \nCongress will have that opportunity next year when ESEA is \nreauthorized.\n  I am grateful that the committee agreed, at my request, to modify the \nbill so that the Title I hold harmless will not apply in FY 2000 to the \neight federal programs have funding formulas based in whole or in part \non the Title I formula. Those programs are: Safe and Drug-free Schools; \nEven Start Family Literacy; Comprehensive School Reform; Eisenhower \nProfessional Development (Teacher training); Technology Literacy; Class \nSize Reduction; Goals 2000, Title III; and McKinney Homeless Education.\n  This amendment was needed because, in FY 1998 and 1999, the \nDepartment of Education applied the 100 percent hold harmless to 8 \nother education programs, thus compounding the harm of the Title I hold \nharmless provision and the cuts that result from it.\n\n  I believe in the current bill, Congress is giving the Department \nclear guidance that the Title I hold harmless provision should not be \napplied to other programs.\n  Because last year the Department applied the hold harmless to other \nprograms, my state lost funds under the following programs: Teacher \nTraining $40,000; School Reform $700,000; Technology Literacy $5.4 \nmillion; Goals 2000 $3 million; EvenStart/Literacy $1 million.\n  I thank the committee for remedying this inequity.\n  I am disappointed that the Committee did not provide funding for the \nPresident's English Language and Civics Education Initiative, under the \nAdult Education program. This is an effort to help states and local \ncommunities provide instruction to adults who want to learn English as \na Second Language (ESL) programs, as well as instruction in civics and \nlife skills. If adequately funded, this initiative would help ensure \nthat those who seek to become American citizens learn not only the \nwords of the citizenship oath, but also the broader language of our \ncivic life. Simply put, this initiative would help our nation's \nnewcomers become full participants in American life.\n  In 1990, there were about 25.5 million U.S. adults age 18 and older \nwho spoke a language other than English at home. Many of these non-\nEnglish speakers were new immigrants. Some immigrants have lived here \nfor many years. Still, other non-English speakers were born in the \nUnited States but grew up without mastering the English language. Many \nof these adults reported that they have difficulty speaking English, \nbut were highly motivated to learn the language, especially to obtain \njobs and gain access to educational opportunities.\n  As the number of non-English speaking residents has increased, so has \nthe demand for placement in English-as-a Second-Language (ESL) classes. \nIn the last five years, enrollment for ESL classes has jumped from 1.2 \nmillion in 1994 to nearly 2 million in 1998. In the state of \nCalifornia, more than 1.2 million adult students enrolled in these \nclasses in 1998, accounting for 38.2 percent of the adult education \nstudents in the state.\n  The increased demand for ESL classes have resulted in long waiting \nlists for ESL classes in many parts of the country. For example, Los \nAngeles has a waiting list of 50,000 people for ESL classes. Chicago's \nESL programs are filled to capacity as soon as they open their doors. \nAnd, New York State has resorted to a lottery system to select \nindividuals who wish to learn English.\n  I have visited several immigrant communities throughout California \nand have been impressed by the high work force participation rates, the \nstrong sense of family, and a tireless commitment to their community. \nHowever, during these visits and in letters from my constituents, I \nhave been often told about the lack of opportunities to participate in \nadult English education courses. This is particularly troublesome, \ngiven the large number of people in my state seeking to become American \ncitizens, and to otherwise more fully participate in our civic life.\n  More support for programs like English Language and Civics Education \nInitiative would help states and communities throughout California and \nthe rest of the nation that are struggling to keep up with this demand. \nProviding $70 million requested by the Administration would not merely \nbe an expenditure, but an investment in our nation's future.\n  While this bill cannot address all the health and education needs of \nour nation or even those that are a federal responsibility, allocations \nare good--$2 billion more for education and $3 billion more for health \n(for the discretionary programs). It does not do all I wish it would \ndo. For example, it does not adequately fund afterschool programs, \nhealth professions training, or educational technology as much as I \nwould like, but it does address many important needs and I will vote \nfor it.\n  I urge my colleagues to give it their strong support.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are under very heavy time constraints \nbecause some of our Members are about to depart. On two personal notes, \nI had said earlier that I had recused myself from consideration of the \nfunding for the National Constitution Center because my wife is the \ndirector of development there. I want to repeat that and include, \nagain, a copy of a letter to Senator Cochran who took over on that \nissue as the next senior ranking Republican.\n  I have one other item on a personal note. Senator Inouye for some \ntime has urged the naming of a building for me, which I had resisted. \nAfter my wife heard about it and the grandchildren, I have succumbed to \nthe majority vote on the naming of the building the National Library of \nMedicine.\n  In conclusion, I hope we will have a very strong vote in favor of \nthis bill. This bill stretches about as far as it can and is about as \nlow cost as it can be with the chance of getting the President's \nsignature. This is only one step along the way toward conference, and \nwe need a very strong vote in favor of this bill if we are to take care \nof the important funding, especially for not only worker safety but \nhealth and education.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield to this Senator?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Are we in our 10 minutes of time on which we had a \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That time might have already been used. Why don't we \nproceed with Senator Harkin's closing statement until Senators, who \nhave planes to catch, arrive.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield such time as he may want to the majority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I state for the Record that the issue of \nclass size reduction is of vital importance to everyone on this side of \nthe aisle, as the case has been made very clear. There are going to be \nenough votes to pass this bill by virtue of the Democrats voting in \nfavor of it, but we want to at this time alert the conferees that if \nthey fail to adequately address this\n\n[[Page S12213]]\n\nmatter, it will be extremely difficult to support this Labor-HHS \nconference report.\n  Further, the two managers of this bill have worked very hard. They \nhave shown compassion, courage, and expertise in getting the bill to \nthis point, and I congratulate and commend both of them for their \ndiligent work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid for all of his \nsupport and his help and great work in moving this bill along. We \nappreciate it very much.\n  We have had a good debate, a long debate, a good exchange of \namendments on this bill. We have had amendments that have been approved \nand rejected on both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank and commend my chairman, Senator Specter, for his leadership, \nhis skill, and his persistence, his dogged persistence in managing this \nbill and getting it through. Senator Specter had tried time and time \nagain during the long, hot, dog days of summer and coming into this \nfall, never giving up, always pushing us to get this bill up and get it \nthrough. Again, I commend him and thank him for his leadership and also \nthank Senator Specter and his staff for always working closely with us. \nI can honestly say that at no time were we ever surprised about \nanything. We have had a very good working relationship. We may not have \nalways agreed on everything--that is the nature of things around here--\nbut we always had a good, open, fair, and thoughtful relationship. I \nappreciate that very much on the part of my chairman.\n  This is always the toughest appropriations bill to get through. It \nwas tough when I was chairman and Senator Specter was ranking member. \nThings have not changed a bit. This year was a greater challenge than \never. But I say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, we have \nproduced a very good bill--not just a good bill, a very good bill. It \nis not perfect. Maybe there are some things I would like to have seen \ndifferent. Perhaps we can improve it a little bit in conference. But it \nis a very good bill.\n  Let me just give a few of the highlights of what we were able to \naccomplish in this bill:\n  First of all, an overall increase of $4 billion over last year; a \n$2.2 billion increase for education programs. That is $500 million more \nthan the President asked for. So if anyone says we did not take care of \neducation, they do not know what they are talking about, and I say that \nin all candor; $500 million more than what the President asked for.\n  A $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health--$2 \nbillion last year, $2 billion this year, keeping our promised goal of \ndoubling NIH funding in 5 years.\n  We have had a very important increase for community health centers, a \n$100 million increase for community health centers. Community health \ncenters in rural areas and in some of our poorer areas of this country \nare the health care system for a lot of poor people in our country, and \nthey are doing a great job. This bill has a $100 million increase for \ncommunity health centers.\n  We maintain the funding for all the job training and worker \nprotection provisions in the Department of Labor. We have over a $600 \nmillion increase for Head Start. Maybe I would like to see a little bit \nmore, but it is good progress. We are moving in the right direction \ntowards getting all 4-year-olds covered in Head Start programs.\n  The Dodd amendment almost doubles the child care development block \ngrant to $2 billion for child care. That is very important.\n  We double the funding for afterschool programs. Again, I know how \nstrongly Senator Specter feels about this. He authored a bill, the \nyouth antiviolence bill, of which I am a cosponsor, taking care of \nthese kids after school. We doubled from $200 million to $400 million \nthe afterschool programs.\n  We raised the maximum Pell grant from $3,150 to $3,325, the highest \nit has ever been.\n  Let me cut to the quick. I know many of my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle have signed a letter expressing their concern over the lack \nof authorization of reducing class size. We have the money in there for \nit, but we do not have the authorization.\n  As I have said repeatedly, reducing class size is critical. I am \npersonally disappointed that Senator Murray's amendment was not \nadopted. But I want to be very clear, though, that there is absolutely \nno inconsistency with signing that letter and voting for passage of \nthis bill.\n  We vote to send bills with problematic issues to conference all the \ntime around here. Maybe there is one little thing we do not agree with, \nbut overall we agree with the major thrust of the bill, and we send it \nto conference.\n  Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This is a good bill. \nWe should send it to conference. If you are concerned about class size, \nthe best and quickest way to have those concerns resolved is to vote \nthe bill out and send it to conference. We will have a chance there to \nmake improvements. If you still have problems after that, you can vote \nagainst the conference report.\n  But this bill is too important to the health, the well-being, and the \neducation of the American people to kill it on the Senate floor. \nEveryone who votes for this bill can be proud of their vote, proud of \nthe investments that we have made in the human infrastructure of this \ncountry.\n  Lastly, people have said there are a lot of gimmicks in this bill. \nThere are no gimmicks in this bill. We advance funds because of the \nunique way that education is funded in this country. We do not pay it \nout until the next year anyway. So there are no gimmicks in this bill. \nThis is straightforward. This is a sound bill. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this bill.\n  Again, I thank Senator Specter, his staff: Bettilou Taylor, Jim \nSourwine, Mary Dietrich, Kevin Johnson, Mark Laisch, Jack Chow, and \nAura Dunn for all of their hard work. I also thank my minority staff: \nEllen Murray and Jane Daye; also my personal staff: Bev Schroeder on \neducation; Chani Wiggins on labor; Sabrina Corlette on health; Katie \nCorrigan on disabilities; Rosemary Gutierrez on child labor; and, of \ncourse, my outstanding leader, legislative director, Peter Reinecke, \nfor all of his hard work.\n  So again I urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle to give this \nbill their ``yes'' vote and send it to conference resoundingly because \nit is a good bill, and it is good for America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters in support of passage of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral \n           Agencies,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the Board of Directors \n     and the more than 700 members of the National Association of \n     Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (NACCRRA), this \n     letter urges the U.S. Senate to pass the FY2000 budget bill. \n     NACCRRA appreciates the inclusion of a set-aside for child \n     care resource and referral and school-age child care in the \n     Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), even though \n     we sought an increase in the CCDBG to provide more and \n     improved services to children and families throughout the \n     country.\n       NACCRRA especially thanks the Senate for including language \n     for the Child Care Aware service in the budget bill. Child \n     Care Aware is the only national hot-line for parents, \n     families and community persons interested and involved in \n     child care and early education to get connected to the CCR \n     in their community. We continue to request inclusion of a \n     funding amount for CCA: $500,000.\n       Thank you once again.\n           Sincerely,\n     Yasmina Vinci,\n       Executive Director.\n     Edna Ranck,\n       Director of Public Policy and Research.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Student Aid Alliance,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Labor, Health and Human Services \n         Subcommittee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: We write on behalf of the Student Aid \n     Alliance--a coalition of 60 organizations representing \n     colleges and universities, students, and parents--to thank \n     you for your leadership in crafting a Labor-HHS-Education \n     appropriations bill for FY 2000 that recognizes the need for \n     increased investment in student aid programs.\n       Despite the constraints of a woefully inadequate 302(b) \n     allocation and stringent budget caps, your bill will help \n     maintain access to postsecondary education for low-income \n     students. It clearly recognizes the need for sustained \n     federal investment in proven student\n\n[[Page S12214]]\n\n     aid programs. We appreciate the central role you have played \n     in bringing about increases for student aid programs in FY \n     2000.\n       At the outset of this year's appropriations process, the \n     Student Aid Alliance set important goals for student aid \n     funding. As you will recall, we have advocated for a $400 \n     increase in the maximum Pell Grant, substantial increases in \n     campus-based aid (SEOG, Perkins Loans, and Work-Study), LEAP, \n     TRIO, and graduate education programs. Your bill takes a step \n     in the right direction toward achieving our funding goals.\n       During the final weeks of the Congressional session, we \n     will continue to seek additional opportunities to help \n     achieve the funding recommendations of the Student Aid \n     Alliance. We hope that by working together we can build upon \n     your good work to make even more funding available for your \n     subcommittee's priorities.\n       Again, thank you for your work on behalf of all college \n     students. We look forward to working with you as the \n     appropriations process continues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stanley O. Ikenberry,\n       Co-Chair.\n     David L.

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the National Coalition \n     for Cancer Research, a coalition of 25 national organizations \n     of cancer researchers, patients, and research advocates \n     dedicated to eradicating cancer through a vigorous publicly \n     and privately-supported research effort; I want to thank you \n     and your colleagues on the Labor-HHS Appropriations Committee \n     for your strong support of the National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH) with regard to the FY 2000 appropriations.\n       It is very important that the Senate make a strong \n     statement regarding the continued commitment to double the \n     budget of the NIH in order to sustain the momentum of this \n     historic initiative. It is vitally important that the Senate \n     pass this legislation in order to provide the necessary \n     leverage to maintain the Senate's position in conference \n     negotiations and to move this important legislation to the \n     next process. Thank you for your strong support and \n     consideration of this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Carolyn R. Aldige,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         National Alliance for Eye\n\n\n                                          and Vision Research,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Thank you for your continued strong \n     commitment to biomedical research demonstrated by the $2 \n     billion increase provided for the NIH in the Fiscal Year 2000 \n     spending bill moving through the Senate.\n       On behalf of the National Alliance for Eye and Vision \n     Research (NAEVR), I urge you and your colleagues to hold firm \n     to your commitment through the conclusion of the budget \n     process in order to stay on track towards doubling the NIH \n     budget by 2003. Your efforts have given renewed hope to \n     millions of Americans afflicted with disease and disabling \n     conditions that improved treatments and cures may be close at \n     hand.\n       It is critical that the Senate pass the Labor-HHS-Education \n     spending bill in order that the nation's commitment to \n     biomedical research is not weakened in the negotiations to \n     determine the final funding outcome for NIH.\n       Once again, thank you for your strong support and for your \n     consideration of this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Stephen J. Ryan, MD,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be brief because I know we need to go to final \npassage.\n  I must say that, amazingly, in a moment we are going to be voting on \nfinal passage of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I think this is the \nfirst time in 3 years that we have done that. I know we did not have \none last year. I cannot recall for sure about 1997. I know we did in \n1996. Regardless, this is the 13th and last of the appropriations \nbills. We are going to get to final passage. I hope it will pass.\n  I have to extend my congratulations to the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and the Senator from Iowa. \nA lot of people thought we could not get it done, but here we are. I \nwant to say a special thanks to Paul Coverdell, who acted as one of my \nassistants on this matter, working with the whip on our side, and Harry \nReid, who did a great job. In fact, I had asked Senator Coverdell if he \nwould do this every week, and he has respectfully declined.\n  Having said that, following this bill--the last appropriations bill--\nthere will be no further votes this evening, and no votes will occur on \nFriday of this week. In addition, the Senate will not be in session on \nMonday, in light of the Columbus Day holiday.\n  On Friday, the Senate will begin consideration of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty at 9:30 a.m. Obviously, this is a very important \ntreaty, a very important matter, so I urge my colleagues to participate \nin the debate tomorrow. I think we have somewhere between 10 and 20 \nspeakers who are going to speak on this tomorrow. I hope the Senators \nwill watch it from their offices or review the debate that occurs on \nFriday.\n  This evening, the Senate will shortly begin the Agriculture \nappropriations conference report. Additional debate on that issue will \noccur this evening. Several votes will occur on Tuesday, October 12, \nbeginning at 5:30. There could be one vote or more. I think it is very \npossible there could be a couple votes at that time on Tuesday dealing \nwith the Agriculture appropriations conference report and possibly with \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n[[Page S12215]]\n\n  So I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation. We have had a \nvery successful week. We passed the FAA reauthorization, confirmed two \njudicial nominations, passed the foreign operations conference report. \nNow we are hopefully fixed to pass the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, \nand we will file cloture tonight, since it seems it is necessary, on \nthe Agriculture appropriations conference report.\n  The bottom line: No further votes tonight; the next vote, 5:30 on \nTuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have a good bit to say, but since colleagues want to \nget to the airport, I shall say it after the final vote takes place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) is \nabsent because of family illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 73, nays 25, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 321 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--73\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--25\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bayh\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Dodd\n     Schumer\n       \n  The bill (S. 1650), as amended, was passed.\n  The text of the bill will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I ask unanimous consent when the Senate completes all action on S. \n1650, it not be engrossed and be held at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for the very strong vote in support of this bill. I thank my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, ranking member, for his \ncooperation, for his leadership, and for his extraordinary diligence. \nWe have had an extraordinary process in moving through this bill.\n  It is very difficult to structure funding for the Department of \nEducation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the \nDepartment of Labor which can get concurrence on both sides of this \naisle. The bill came in at $91.7 billion. There have been some \nadditions. It is hard to have enough spending for some, and it is hard \nnot to have too much spending for others. I think in its total we have \na reasonably good bill to go to conference.\n  The metaphor that I think is most apt is running through the \nraindrops in a hurricane. We are only partway through. We are now \nheaded, hopefully, for conference. I urge our colleagues in the House \nof Representatives to complete action on the counterpart bill so we may \ngo to conference.\n  We have already started discussions with the executive branch. I had \na brief conversation with the President about the bill. He said his \npriorities were not recognized to the extent he wanted. I remind \nSenators that the Constitution gives extensive authority to the \nCongress on the appropriations process. We have to have the President's \nsignature, but we have the constitutional primacy upon establishing the \nappropriations process at least to work our priorities. I am hopeful we \ncan come to an accommodation with the President.\n  We have had extraordinarily diligent work done by the staff: Bettilou \nTaylor, to whom I refer as ``Senator Taylor,'' has done an \nextraordinary job in shepherding this bill through and taking thousands \nof letters of requests from Senators; Jim Sourwine has been at her side \nand at my side; I acknowledge the tremendous help of Dr. Jack Chow, as \nwell as Mary Dietrich, Kevin Johnson, Mark Laisch, and Aura Dunn. On \nthe minority staff, Ellen Murray has been tremendous, as has Jane Daye.\n  There is a lot more that could be said, but there is a great deal of \nadditional business for the Senate to transact. I thank my colleagues \nfor passing this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12215-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12215-S12226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n      RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask consent following my remarks, Senator \nJeffords be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to the membership, if an agreement cannot be reached \nfor a total time limitation that is reasonable, I will file a motion \nfor cloture on the Agriculture conference report, and that a cloture \nvote will occur on Tuesday of next week at 5:30 unless a consent can be \nworked out to conduct the vote at an earlier time or unless something \ncan be worked out to just have the vote on final passage.\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont if he is in a position to agree to a \ntime limitation for debate at this time on the pending Agriculture \nconference report?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I believe I can't make that agreement at this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleague for his frankness. I understand his \nfeeling about it. I know there are Senators on both sides of the aisle \nwho have some\n\n[[Page S12216]]\n\nreservations about going forward with this bill.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is now recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great disappointment and \nreluctance that I stand before the Senate to express my reasoning for \nopposing the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill. This \nbill provides funding for agricultural programs, research, and services \nfor American agriculture. In addition, it provides billions of dollars \nof aid for farmers and ranchers throughout America who have endured \nnatural and market disasters.\n  However, and most unfortunately, it neglects our Nation's dairy \nfarmers. I understand the importance of funding these programs and the \nneed to provide for farmers. However, dairy farmers throughout the \ncountry, drought-stricken farmers in the Northeast, have been ignored \nin this bill. Congress is willing to provide billions of dollars in \nassistance to needy farmers across the country. Dairy farmers in States \nare not asking for Federal dollars but for a fair price structure for \nhow their products are priced.\n  Vermonters are generally men and women of few words. Given that the \nState's heritage is so intertwined with agriculture and the farmer's \nwork ethic, whether fighting the rocky soil or the harsh elements, \nVermonters have developed a thick skin. If Vermonters want advice, they \nwill ask it. Until then, it is best to keep one's mouth shut.\n  Indeed, a Vermonter will rarely meet a problem with a lot of \ndiscussion but, rather, with a wry grin and perhaps a shrug. If there \nis a blizzard and the temperature is below zero, the Vermonter will \nmost likely put on his boots and grab a shovel. Talking isn't going to \nmake the snow melt, but hard work will clear a path so the mailman can \nget to the door.\n  A Vermonter will always speak his or her mind with the fewest words \npossible. President Calvin Coolidge was a native Vermonter to the core. \nA woman told Calvin Coolidge, that taciturn 30th President who hailed \nfrom Vermont, she bet she could get him to say more than two words. \nCoolidge thought a moment and then replied, ``You lose.''\n  Vermonters know I must speak my mind about the importance of \nprotecting the farm families in our State. They expect me to be \ngenerous with my thoughts and expressions on just how critical the \nNortheast Dairy Compact is to Vermont. I will not let them down. The \nclock is ticking on the dairy compact and Federal order reform. Every \nmoment is valuable.\n  As Governor Aiken, a true Vermonter, said:\n\n       People ask what's the best time of the year for pruning \n     apple trees. I say, when the saw is sharp.\n\n  In other words, procrastination has no place in a Vermonter's \nmindset. Assuming every Vermonter owns a sharp saw, the best time to \nget to work pruning an apple tree is right about now.\n  America's dairy farmers need our help. Now is the time to help them. \nCongress has the tools and the means, so let us not procrastinate on \nprotecting the future of one of our most important resources. The \nfarmers in New England have a program that works. It is called the \nNortheast Dairy Compact. Because the dairy pilot program has worked so \nwell, no fewer than 25 States have approved compacts and are now asking \nCongress for approval.\n  Unlike other commodities such as wheat, cotton, or soybeans, milk \ncannot be stored to leverage a better price from the market. Milk must \nbe bottled and shipped to the grocery store as soon as it is taken from \nthe cow. Because of the unique situation milk is in compared to other \ncommodities and ensuring there is a fresh local supply of milk in every \nregion of the country, Congress established a pricing structure to \nprotect farmers and consumers. There have been several modifications of \nthe 1937 Agricultural Marketing Adjustment Act over the years to comply \nwith changes at the marketplace, but the structure of the Federal milk \nmarketing orders is as solid and important both to farmers and \nconsumers today as in 1937.\n  The Federal milk marketing orders have assisted dairy farmers in \nsurviving the economy and weathering prices. The Federal milk marketing \norders over the last 60 years have been, and continue to be, supplying \nthe Nation with sufficient supplies of a wholesome product and at very \nreasonable prices. You ought to compare the prices over time with other \nthings such as soft drinks and things such as that and you will realize \nwhat a deal you have. To those who say they do not understand them, who \nmake fun of their seeming complexity, I can only reply: They work. \nBecause they work, dairy is not looking for a bailout in the form of \ndisaster relief; no.\n\n  But dairy farmers do need relief of a different kind. There is no \nneed for the expenditure of money. The compact we need to have does not \ncost the Government money; it saves the Government money. It also \nbrings about a calm structure to the pricing aspects. It protects the \nproducers, protects also the manufacturers, and has worked out \nespecially well for consumers, giving them an average price for their \nmilk which is lower than the average in the country. Where commodity \nfarmers are asking their Government for relief from natural and market \ndisasters, dairy farmers are asking for relief from the promised \nGovernment disaster in the form of a fair pricing structure from the \nSecretary of Agriculture.\n  This chart, which I will have here in a moment, will demonstrate so \nthose who can see it will understand better what I am talking about. \nWhat we are here about today is that, basically, we have a very \nreasonable request for the continuation of a compact which has worked \nfor many years now, and is so good that, first of all, it has 25 States \nthat have passed laws to have another compact. But, most importantly, \nit also, unfortunately I should say at the same time, is keeping \nfarmers in business. For some reason or other, those up in the Midwest, \nwho have this compulsion to believe they can provide the milk for the \nwhole Nation if they just had the chance, they don't like it. Why? It \nis keeping the farmers in business and they want them out of business \nso they can take away their markets.\n  Second, you have people who do not like it--although those in the \narea who are using it like it very much--but others outside the area \nare very concerned about it; that is, those who buy the milk are \nconcerned because they no longer have a monopoly or they are at the \nmercy of the market. Because when dairy sits there, it spoils, so you \nhave to get it right away. If nobody takes it, it is not worth much. So \nthe processors do not like this because they do not set the price. They \ndo not have a monopoly.\n  How does it work? We put together a system for the dairy farmer up in \nnortheastern Vermont. They worked out this arrangement. That is why \nMassachusetts, which has very few farms, and Rhode Island, agreed to \njoin together, because they found out it would work out for their \nprocessors, it would work out for the consumers, and it would work out \nfor the farmers. But dairy farmers do need relief of a different kind.\n  There is no need for an expenditure of money where commodity farmers\n\n[[Page S12217]]\n\nare asking for relief from natural and market forces. They are asking \nfor relief in the form of a fair pricing structure from the Secretary \nof Agriculture. This chart says it all. I hope my colleagues remember, \nI had this chart before this body some time ago. It helps us get the \nnecessary votes to show a majority understood. From this chart, which \nis the revenue loss resulting from the Federal USDA order proposed--\nthat is 1-B--you can see why we are having such conflict and why we are \nhaving a difficult time getting the dairy bill through.\n  On this chart, those States in red are the ones that will lose under \n1-B. The States in green are the ones that will gain. Guess where those \nare that will gain. They are in the upper Midwest. Everybody else in \nthe country, with a few exceptions, loses. So what does the Secretary \ndo? He sets up this scam way of approving the order by saying it is 1-B \nor disaster. How would you vote? Would you vote for 1-B or would you \nvote for disaster? Guess what. 1-B won, but was that the preference of \nthe farmers? No. We have gone to court on that and the court agreed and \nsaid that was a farce. So there is a restraining order to stop the \nimposition of 1-B. But remember that chart because it shows why and \nwhat this is all about.\n  Unless relief is granted by correcting the Secretary's final rule and \nextending the Northeast Dairy Compact, dairy farmers in every single \nState will sustain substantial losses, not because of Mother Nature or \npoor market conditions but because of the Clinton administration and \nthe few in Congress who have prevented this Nation's dairy farmers from \nreceiving a fair deal.\n  Unfortunately, Secretary Glickman's informal rulemaking process \ndeveloped pricing formulas that are fatally flawed and contrary to the \nwill of Congress. The Nation's dairy farmers are counting on this \nCongress to prevent the dairy industry from being placed at risk, and \nto instead secure a sound future.\n  Secretary Glickman's final pricing order, known as option 1-B, which \nI just talked about, was scheduled to be implemented on October 1 of \nthis year. However, the U.S. district court has prevented the flawed \npricing system from being implemented by issuing a 30-day temporary \nrestraining order on the Secretary's final rule. That will expire at \nthe end of this month. Hopefully, it will be extended.\n  The court found the Secretary's final order and decision violates \nCongress' mandate under the Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of \n1937, and the plaintiffs who represent the dairy farmers would suffer \nimmediate and irreparable injury from implementation of the Secretary's \nfinal decision.\n  The court finds the plaintiffs have a likelihood of success in their \nclaim that the Secretary's final order and decision violates the AMAA \nby failing adequately to consider economic factors regarding the \nmarketing of milk in the regional orders across the country.\n  Again, this chart shows why the court said we had better take another \nlook at this. If this is what is going to happen with this order by the \nSecretary of Agriculture, that does not seem to be consistent with \ntalking about the regions, making sure the regions are handled fairly.\n  The temporary restraining order issued by the U.S. district court has \ngiven Congress valuable additional time to correct Secretary Glickman's \nrule. We must act now. With the help of the court, Congress can now \nbring fairness to America's dairy farmers and consumers. Instead of \ncosting dairy farmers millions of dollars in lost income, Congress \nshould take immediate action by extending the dairy compact and \nchoosing option 1-A for the Secretary.\n  The Agriculture appropriations bill, which includes billions of \ndollars in disaster aid, seems to be a logical place to include \nprovisions that would help one of this country's most important \nagricultural resources without any cost to the Federal Government. \nAgain, I repeat that over and over again--without any cost to the \nFederal Government. Giving farmers and consumers a reliable pricing \nstructure and giving the States the right to work together, at no cost \nto the Federal Government--again, at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment--to maintain a fresh supply of local milk is a novel idea.\n  If you learn about agricultural problems in this country, you will \nrealize much of the aid in this bill does not go for disasters of the \nkind of weather or whatever. It is low prices. So what is going to \nhappen? The Federal Government is going to put up billions of dollars \nbecause the farmers did not get the price that they thought was fair. \nThat is fine, but why in the world could you, then, deny the area of \nNew England an order which helps them to keep their farmers in business \nand doesn't cost any money to the Federal Government?\n  That sounds like a convoluted way of running a system, but we may be \ngetting used to it.\n  It is an idea towards which Congress should be working. Instead, a \nfew Members in both the House and Senate continue to block the progress \nand the interest of both consumers and dairy farmers.\n  The October 1, 1999, deadline for the implementation of the \nSecretary's rule has come and gone, but with the help of a U.S. Federal \ndistrict court, Congress still has time to act. We must seize this \nopportunity to correct the Secretary of Agriculture's flawed pricing \nrules and at the same time maintain the ability of the States to help \nprotect their farmers without additional costs to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Federal dairy policy is difficult to explain at best. I have been \nhere 24, 25 years. When I was in the House, I was fortunate enough, or \nunfortunate as you might say, to be the ranking member on a \nsubcommittee dealing with dairy. I point back to that time because that \nwas the Watergate years. The reason I got that job was because there \nwere not many Republicans left, and all of us received ranking jobs of \nsome sort.\n  At that time, we had problems, and we have had problems every year I \nhave been here. We finally have come across a program that works that \nwill prevent the travesties we have witnessed over the years. I have \nseen it for 24, 25 years now, and I finally see there are programs that \nwill work, programs that will keep us out of disasters, programs that \nwill make us proud of agriculture and protect the consumers' costs and \nprotect all the others who work with it. Why do we want to do away with \nit?\n  Federal dairy policy is difficult to explain at best. As a Member who \nhas served many years, and during my years in the House, I worked very \nclosely with dairy programs that impacted dairy farmers and consumers. \nThe Federal Milk Marketing Program may be difficult to explain, but its \nintent is simple. The Federal milk marketing orders, which are \nadministered by USDA, were instituted in the 1930s to promote orderly \nregional marketing conditions by, among other things, establishing a \nregional system of uniform classified pricing throughout the country's \nmilk markets. Milk marketing policy is defined by the fact that milk is \na unique commodity. It is not something such as grain which is put in a \nstorage bin or put in a freeze locker or canned. When you want it, you \nwant it fresh and you want to be able to drink it.\n  Fluid milk is perishable and must be worked quickly through the \nmarketing chain and reach consumers within days of its production. That \nis why if a farmer goes to the person from whom he normally purchases \nmilk and he says we don't want it, they are at their mercy: ``Well, \nwe'll take it up $2, $3 less a hundredweight if you really want to get \nrid of it.''\n  Unlike other commodities, this means that dairy farmers are in a poor \nbargaining position with respect to the price they can obtain from milk \nhandlers. In addition, persistent price instability, particularly when \nprices are depressed, serves to drive producers from the market and \ndamage the market's ability to provide a dependable supply of quality \nmilk to consumers.\n  We get this up and down. If there is too much, farmers go out of \nbusiness; if there is too little, then farmers either come back or they \nput more cows out. The interesting thing is, if you look at the \ncharts--consumers should be very interested in this--you will see a \nratchet effect. Every time the price to the farmer goes down, the \nretail price stays up there because the processors keep it up there. \nThe farmers lose and the consumers lose. That price should\n\n[[Page S12218]]\n\ngo down if the demand goes down, but that does not happen. That is \nanother reason why this compact has worked so well because it takes \nthat ratchet situation out of the system.\n  Based on the Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, the major \nobjectives of the Federal milk marketing orders are as follows: to \npromote orderly marketing conditions for dairy farmers; to equalize the \nmarket power of dairy farmers and processors within a market and \nthereby obtain reasonable competition; to assure consumers of adequate \nand dependable supplies of pure and wholesome fluid milk products from \nthe least costly sources; and to complement the efforts of cooperative \nassociations of dairy farmers, processors, and consumers; and to \nprovide maximum freedom of trade with proper protection of established \ndairy farmers against loss of the market.\n  For dairy farmers increasing production to adjust to market \nconditions is not a matter of sowing more seeds. Price stability is a \nkey to dairy farmers' success. That makes sense to me and should make \nsense to anyone who values having a local supply of fresh milk \navailable at their local market at reasonable prices.\n  Yet while the market order system is basically sound, it still needs \nimprovement. It is for this reason that the Congress in the 1996 farm \nbill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the pricing \nsystem.\n  This Congress has made its intention abundantly clear with regard to \nwhat is needed for the new dairy pricing rules. Sixty-one Senators and \nmore than 240 House Members signed letters to Secretary Glickman last \nyear supporting what is known as option 1-A for the pricing of fluid \nmilk.\n\n  On August 4 of this year, you will recall the Senate could not end a \nfilibuster from the Members of the upper Midwest but did get 53 votes, \nshowing a majority of the Senate supports option 1-A and keeping the \nNortheast Dairy Compact operating. Most recently, the House passed \ntheir version of option 1-A by a vote of 285-140.\n  The House and Senate have given a majority vote on this issue. Thus, \nI was very hopeful that its inclusion would have been secured in the \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  This unified statement of congressional intent reflected the fact \nthat the majority of the country and the dairy industry support option \n1-A. It has a broad support of Governors, State departments of \nagriculture, the American Farm Bureau, and dairy cooperatives and \ncoalitions from throughout the country. Even the Land-O-Lakes \nCooperative in the upper Midwest supports option 1-A and the compacts.\n  You can imagine the surprise and disappointment of so many of my \ncolleagues and dairy farmers around the country when Secretary Glickman \ninstead chose option 1-B for the pricing structure for fluid milk. \nSimply stated, if this option is allowed to be implemented, it will put \nthe future of this country's dairy industry at severe risk.\n  The pricing provisions of the Secretary's final rule will result in \nlower producer prices by as much as a $1/2 million a day and will \nunnecessarily force farmers out of business. Adequate local supplies of \nfresh milk in our region will then be threatened and consumers will pay \nhigher prices for fresh milk which is transported great distances from \nother areas of our country.\n  I see my good friend from New Jersey is here. I am ready to go on at \nlength. I expect he wants to express himself.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nyielding. I thank him in behalf of the dairy farmers in New Jersey and \nagricultural interests in our State and region for his extraordinary \nleadership in what is a defining moment for those of us in the Senate \nas to whether or not we will stand with agriculture in the Northeast or \nthe dairy farmers and the farmers who remain in our region of the \ncountry are simply to dwindle and die as did so many who came before \nthem.\n  I could not feel more strongly about this issue at this moment in the \nSenate. As the Senator from Vermont, year after year I have come to \nthis well--or in my service in the House of Representatives--as an \nAmerican feeling the need and the pain of others who suffered from \nhurricanes in Florida, earthquakes in California, tornadoes in the \nMidwest, floods in the upper Northwest to get assistance to people in \nneed.\n  Through the years, I voted for agricultural appropriation after \nagricultural appropriation because I understood the hard work of \nAmerican farmers in our heartland and the difficulties they face in \nflood or in diseases to crops, whatever the problem might be.\n  You can imagine my surprise to find, when the State of New Jersey, \nNew England, and the Mideastern States have suffered the worst drought \nin generations, that our farmers are not receiving the same \nconsideration.\n  From June through August, in a normal year, the State of New Jersey \nwould receive 8 inches of rain. This year, New Jersey received 2 inches \nof rain. Our reservoirs were severely drained. The crops of many fruit \nand vegetable growers were devastated with losses of 30 to 100 percent.\n  Yesterday, Senator Santorum noted that this legislation deals with \nthe falling prices of crops in the Midwest and offers relief. He \nappropriately said: We wish we had falling prices at which to sell our \ncrops.\n  The crops of New Jersey farmers are destroyed. Yet this legislation, \nwhich offers $8.7 billion in relief, goes largely for low crop prices \nin the South and to a lesser degree in the Midwest. Only 10 percent is \nfor natural disaster assistance for the entire Nation.\n  Not only is it not adequate, it is an insult to the hard-working \nfarmers in New Jersey and New England who have been devastated by the \ndrought. In my State, 400,000 acres of farmland, on 7,000 farms, have \nsustained what is estimated to be up to $100 million worth of damage.\n  Secretary Glickman has estimated there could be $2 billion worth of \ndamage in the entire Northeast. The Governors of our States, including \nGovernor Whitman in my own State, have estimated it could be $2.5 \nbillion. That was before Hurricane Floyd brought its own damage to \nNorth Carolina and New Jersey and other agricultural interests. This \nlegislation offers but 10 percent--less than half, probably less than a \nthird--of what the need really is at the moment.\n  It will surprise some around our country to understand why a Senator \nfrom New Jersey would take this stand attempting to block the entire \nagricultural appropriations for the whole Nation because of farmers in \nNew Jersey.\n  New Jersey has not been identified as the Garden State by chance. \nAgriculture in New Jersey is a $56 billion industry. It is the third \nlargest industry in the entire State. It matters. The nursery industry \nalone is a $250 million annual business. The sale of vegetables, such \nas tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers, is a $166 million industry. And \nthe sale of fruits, such as cranberries, peaches, and blueberries, is a \n$110 million business. Our field crops, such as corn, winter wheat, and \nsoybeans, generate $66 million in sales while our dairy industry is a \n$41 million business.\n  This is not some ancillary problem in the State of New Jersey. It is \nthe economic life of whole counties, entire communities, and thousands \nof people. At $8,300 for an average acre of land in New Jersey, our \nfarmland is the most valuable in the Nation, growing 100 different \nkinds of fruits and vegetables for local and national consumption.\n  I take a stand against this legislation because I have no choice. I \njoin with the Senator from Vermont because of the devastation of our \nagriculture industry but also because I share the Senator's deep \nconcern for the future of dairy. The dairy industry was once one of the \nlargest and most important in the State of New Jersey. There are now no \nmore than 180 dairy farms left, with hard-working people in Salem, \nWarren, Sussex, and Hunterdon Counties.\n  I know if the Senator from Vermont does not get consideration for his \ndairy farmers, his dairy industry will become tomorrow what the dairy \nindustry has come to be today--prices that do not sustain a quality of \nlife and do not allow people to keep the land. Those dairy farms will \nbe destroyed.\n  In the last decade alone, 42 percent of the dairy farms in New Jersey \nhave been destroyed--beautiful lands that sustained families and \ncommunities and are now parking lots and shopping centers or simply \nvacant, idle land. The fact is, a dairy farmer today in New Jersey \ncannot get a price to sustain the costs of his business. Without\n\n[[Page S12219]]\n\nthe compact that the Senator from Vermont is advocating, they never \nwill. New Jersey dairy farms have experienced a 37-percent drop in the \nprice of their product. It is not sustainable.\n  So I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding the time. I pledge \nto return to this floor with him to fight for disaster assistance for \nNew Jersey farmers who have lost their crops and need help--not a loan, \nbecause they cannot sustain a loan; they cannot pay interest on a loan. \nThese are small family farms that simply need a Federal grant, a \nfraction of the kind of expenditures that will go to the South and the \nMidwest--a fraction--so they can plant their crops again in the spring \nand have a new crop next year to feed their families and feed our \ncommunities. For this dairy compact, we need to make sure these few \nremaining dairy farmers are not lost and the 20 percent of the fresh \nmilk that goes to New Jersey families can continue to come from our own \nfarms.\n  For those people who live in the urban areas of New Jersey and in \nsuburban communities, who think they are far away from these dairy and \nagricultural needs, this remaining agricultural land in New Jersey must \nnot be destroyed, because with every dairy farmer who goes out of \nbusiness, every family farmer who has to sell their land, that open \nspace is lost to suburban sprawl, and it affects the quality of life of \nevery family in our State.\n  So I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding the time. I pledge \nto return again and again with him to try to fight this legislation \nand, if by chance we should fail, to urge the President to veto it. I \nthank the Senator for yielding the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I commend the Senator from New Jersey for his very \nrealistic look at this bill. I would like to emphasize that there is so \nmuch more than the ordinary disaster in here. It has nothing to do with \nhurricanes and the drought. And the billions of dollars for the \nNortheast, which had the drought and problems and all, have nothing to \ndo with farmers. Not only that, the program they have--which costs no \nmoney and which has given security to the farmers and helped the \nconsumers--will not go forward. They rejected our attempts to put it in \nthere.\n  The Senator from Oregon, I believe, desires to speak on another \nmatter. I would like to finish up with a few more remarks, and then I \nwould be happy to yield. We may have one other Member coming over to \nspeak on dairy. But I know he also supports this effort, and I \nappreciate that very much.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that unlike years ago, the Federal \npricing program has essentially no Federal cost and no Federal subsidy. \nSo here we are arguing for something to protect our farmers, to protect \nconsumers, to protect the processors with a reasonable price, and we \ncannot get it approved, when billions of dollars are being spent in the \ndisaster bill for nondisasters--except a lower price. That is a \ndisaster, but it is not the kind of disaster we look to for protection \nby the Federal Government.\n  The overall loss to dairy farmers caused by the overall final rule is \neven more startling. We are back on 1-B, the one the Secretary of \nAgriculture jammed down the farmers' throats. Fortunately, the courts \nhave put a stop to that.\n  The Secretary's final rule will drop the price paid for cheese by as \nmuch as 40 cents per hundredweight of milk. That is the way we look at \nhow we reward the farmers for each hundredweight of milk. Dairy \neconomists estimate that U.S. dairy farm annual income will fall in \ntotal by at least $400 million or more under the Secretary's final \ndecision.\n  Who benefits from that? Do the consumers? No. There is no evidence \nwhatsoever that they will benefit. Who will benefit? The processors, \nthe ones that buy the milk. Their profits will go up. The farmers' \nprofits will go down. And the consumer prices will go up. What we are \ntrying to set up is a system where that does not occur. The Northeast \nis projected to lose $80 million to $120 million per year under 1-\nB. The Southeast loses $40 to $60 million. The upper Midwest will lose \nupwards of $70 million, even though, as the chart in red shows, they \nlose a lot less. In fact, they gain. On the other hand, most areas of \nthe country will be better off under option 1-A, including the upper \nMidwest. Marginally increasing producer income in most regions of the \ncountry, option 1-A is based on solid economic analysis, benefiting \nboth farmers and consumers. It takes into account transportation costs \nfor moving fluid milk, regional supply and demand needs, the cost of \nproducing and marketing milk, and the need to attract milk to regions \nthat occasionally face production deficits.\n\n  In early August, dairy farmers were given the opportunity to vote for \noption 1-B or reject the Federal Milk Marketing Order Program. That is \nright. There were two choices given to dairy farmers: Either approve \noption 1-B or have no Federal order program. Which is it? It is not a \nsurprise that the farmers overwhelmingly chose the lesser of two evils.\n  There was no sense to this. There was no reason to allow it to occur. \nCorrecting the Secretary's final rule, as part of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, would have prevented dairy farmers across the \nNation from losing millions of dollars in income.\n  Let me also explain briefly, before I turn to my friend from Oregon, \nthe votes were in the conference committee to put in what we are trying \nto do. They were there. However, what happened? Just as we were about \nto have that vote, people from processors and others came in, and the \nleaders who were behind this move were able to convince those Members \nnot to vote for what we want here, which is basically real help to \nfarmers and consumers.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, at least until my good \nfriend from Oregon has finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes tonight--\nSenator Graham of Florida will be joining me, and Senator Gordon Smith \nof my home State, my friend and colleague, will be joining me as well \ntonight--the three of us want to take a few minutes to talk about the \nimportant amendment we were able to have added to the HHS \nappropriations bill during the course of the last week.\n  In the beginning, we especially express our appreciation to Senator \nSpecter and Senator Harkin. They worked with the three of us and our \nstaffs over the last week on this particular issue.\n  What our agricultural labor amendment does is require the Department \nof Labor to report to the Congress on how the Department plans to \npromote a legal, domestic workforce--specifically, to improve \ncompensation, working conditions, and other benefits for agricultural \nworkers in the United States.\n  Today's agricultural labor program is a disaster for both farm \nworkers and for farmers. We have a system that is completely broken. \nEstimates are that well over half of the farm workers in this country \nare illegal. As a result of their status, they can have no power at \nall. They can't even vote. They are subjected to the worst possible \nconditions imaginable, horrendous housing, and, in many instances, \nthrown into the back of pickup trucks and moved by people called \ncoyotes, who, for a profit, bring them from other countries. The \nconditions to which our agricultural workers are subjected in so many \ninstances are nothing short of immoral.\n  At the same time, the growers, who have a dependable supply of \nworkers to pick their crops, are also in a completely untenable \nsituation, the growers who want to do the right thing. Senator Smith \nand I represent a great many of those growers and farmers in our home \nState of Oregon, who don't know where to turn to find legal workers.\n\n  The General Accounting Office did a report a couple of years ago on \nthe farm worker situation in our country. They said there really are \nenough farm workers, but they came to that conclusion only by counting \nthe illegal farm workers in our country. Well over half of the farm \nworkers in the United States are illegal. It is a situation that \nessentially turns those farmers, when they want to do the right thing, \ninto people who have to make a choice as to whether or not they want to \nbe felons\n\n[[Page S12220]]\n\nand not comply with the law or simply another individual in the \nbankruptcy line in our country.\n  To give you an idea how absolutely unacceptable this situation is, \njust this week I had berry farmers from my home State in Oregon telling \nme they had recently had meetings with the Department of Justice and \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service. They were told, in effect, \nhow to work the system, but they weren't given any hope that what they \nwere doing was within the law. In effect, the administration was \ntelling the berry farmers in my State, with a wink and a nod, they \nshould tolerate this system that is based on workers who can have no \npower and farmers who lack a system that is dependable and reliable so \nthey can find legal workers.\n  In the last session of Congress, Senator Graham, Senator Smith, and I \nput together a bipartisan proposal to change this wholly unacceptable \nsituation and produce a new system for dealing with agricultural labor \nthat would be in the interest of both the farm worker and the farmer. \nUnder our proposal, workers who were legal would get a significant \nincrease in their benefits. Just how significant was documented in a \nreport done for us by the Library of Congress, October 21, 1998. At \npage 2 of that report, it states specifically that the Library of \nCongress found that under our proposal--it received 67 votes in the \nSenate--the legal farm worker would get significantly higher wages, \nunder what the Senate voted for. In addition, there would be benefits \nfor housing, transportation, a variety of benefits that are so critical \nto the farm workers.\n  But after 67 Members of the Senate voted for our proposal, the \nadministration said: It is unacceptable. We are going to veto it. It is \nnot good enough. We have other ideas.\n  At that time, Senator Smith, Senator Graham, and I entered into a \nseries of discussions with the Clinton administration asking them for \ntheir plan on how to produce this system that would address the \nlegitimate concerns of both the farm workers and the growers. We have \nbeen at that for more than a year.\n  I see our good friend Senator Graham coming to the floor, and I will \nyield to him in just a moment.\n  Senator Graham, Senator Smith, and I have been at the task of trying \nto get from the administration their plan to deal with agricultural \nlabor for more than a year. We told them, if they don't like our \nproposal--67 votes in the Senate; the Library of Congress said it will \nproduce higher benefits, wages, improved transportation, and improved \nhousing for so many legal workers--since it wasn't good enough for the \nClinton administration, we would like to see their proposal. We decided \nwe would, in the spirit of comity and a desire to get an agreement with \nthe executive branch, wait for their proposal.\n  We are still waiting to this day. The administration remains on the \nsideline to this day, unwilling to come forward with any specific ideas \nthat would be in the interests of both the workers and the growers. \nJust this week, they told the berry farmers in my home State--and we do \na lot of things in Oregon well; frankly, what we do best is grow \nthings; our farmers are very important to our State--the administration \nbasically told them, just wink and nod at the rules that are out there \ntoday.\n  In December of 1998, Alexis Herman, Secretary of Labor, sat in a \nmeeting in Senator Graham's office with Senator Graham, Senator Smith, \nand myself. Alexis Herman told us, three Members of the Senate, that \nthe administration would give us a specific proposal for dealing with \nthis agricultural labor situation by the end of February 1999.\n  No such proposal has ever been delivered. In a moment, I am going to \nyield to my friend from Florida because he has essentially laid out a \ntimeline that demonstrates how many times we have tried to get the \nadministration off the sidelines and to join us in a bipartisan effort \nto produce a system that would work for the farm worker and for the \ngrower.\n  By its inaction, the administration is perpetuating a system that is \na disaster for both the farm worker and the farmer. It is a system that \nis totally broken--a system that has condemned the vast majority of \nfarm workers to some of the most terrible and immoral conditions \nimaginable. It is a system that has made it impossible for the farmers \nwho want to do the right thing to know where to turn.\n  In the last Congress, Senator Graham, Senator Smith, and myself \nbrought a legislative proposal that would change that, which the \nLibrary of Congress said would produce a significant amount of \nadditional benefits for the legal farm worker. The Clinton \nadministration said that wasn't good enough, and we have waited and \nwaited for their ideas.\n  Well, tonight, as a result of the action taken in the Labor-HHS bill, \nwe are calling, as a matter of law, on the Clinton administration to \ngive us their plan as to how to produce a legal domestic workforce, \nwhich would have improved compensation, improved working conditions, \nand improved benefits that those farm workers are entitled to as a \nmatter of simple justice.\n  So I am hopeful that we will get the administration off the sidelines \nsoon. I am hopeful that they will do what they promised to do well over \na year ago.\n  If the Senator from Vermont is willing, I would like to break my \nremarks off at this point and allow the Senator from Florida to speak \nfor a few minutes. We want to be courteous to our colleague from \nVermont because he is dealing with an issue of great importance to him. \nWe will be brief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 1998.\n\n                              [Memorandum]\n\n     To: The Honorable Ron Wyden; Attention: David Blan.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Agricultural Labor Proposal.\n\n       In your letter of October 15, 1998, you asked for a \n     memorandum comparing the basic federal protections available \n     to farm workers with the protections that would have been \n     extended to farm workers under the proposed conference \n     agreement to the Commerce State Justice bill/H2A provision. \n     The letter stated that you are ``especially interested in \n     whether the agricultural labor proposal before the \n     Appropriations Conference Committee would have offered farm \n     workers, and particularly the more than 99.5% of U.S. farm \n     workers who work on non-H-2A farms new or expanded benefits \n     compared to current law.''\n       The proposal would have required the Secretary of Labor to \n     establish state and regional registries containing a database \n     of eligible United States workers seeking temporary or \n     seasonal agricultural jobs, in order to inform those workers \n     of available agricultural jobs and to grant them the right of \n     first refusal for available jobs. Basically, farmers would \n     have to apply to the registry for U.S. workers, and hire all \n     referred U.S. workers, before they could seek nonimmigrant \n     alien temporary agricultural workers under the immigration \n     program known as ``H-2A.'' Agricultural employers could not \n     import any workers unless the registry failed to refer a \n     sufficient number of registered workers to fill all of the \n     employer's job opportunities. Therefore, the employer could \n     only acquire as many imported workers as would be needed in \n     addition to those U.S. workers referred.\n       The proposal would have had an impact on domestic farm \n     workers in addition to its effect on alien workers. The \n     general legislative scheme was to condition the right of an \n     agricultural employer to request and hire temporary alien \n     workers on the employer's requirement, first, to seek \n     domestic workers from the registries maintained by the Labor \n     Department, and, then, to extend the protections granted to \n     H-2A aliens under the proposal to all workers in the same \n     occupation on the same farm. Under the proposal, agricultural \n     employers seeking domestic and foreign workers through the \n     registries were required to assure that they would not refuse \n     to employ qualified individuals, and would not terminate them \n     unless there were ``lawful job-related reasons, including \n     lack of work.'' Employers were also required to comply with \n     the following specific assurances.\n\n\n                                 wages\n\n       Under current law, agricultural employers, unless they are \n     exempt as small farmers, must pay the applicable minimum wage \n     and overtime rates under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act \n     (FLSA) or 1938, as amended. 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 201-19. Under \n     that law, farm workers must receive the greater of the \n     applicable federal or state minimum wage.\n       Under the conference agreement, the employer must pay the \n     greater of the prevailing wage in the occupation or the \n     adverse effect wage rate to the workers. The employer using \n     the registry must provide assurances that the wages and \n     benefits promised to the workers hired from the registry \n     would be provided ``to all workers employed in job \n     opportunities for which the employer has applied [from the \n     registry] and to all other workers in the same occupation at \n     the place of employment.''\n\n\n                       migrant worker protection\n\n       Under current law, agricultural employers who hire migrant \n     and seasonal workers must\n\n[[Page S12221]]\n\n     comply with the provisions of the Migrant and Seasonal \n     Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSWPA). 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1801-72. The MSWPA, however, does not cover any \n     temporary nonimmigrant alien authorized to work in \n     agriculture employment under the H-2A program. See 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1802(8)(B)(ii).\n       Under the proposal agricultural employers were required to \n     comply with all applicable federal, state, and local labor \n     laws, including laws affecting migrant and seasonal \n     agricultural workers, for all United States workers as well \n     as all alien workers on the farm.\n\n\n                                housing\n\n       Under current law, employers have no responsibility to \n     provide housing or housing assistance to their workers. Under \n     the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act \n     (MASWPA), any person who owns or controls housing must comply \n     with substantive federal and state safety and health \n     standards applicable to that housing. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1823.\n       Under the conference proposal, employers are required to \n     provide housing at no cost to all workers in jobs for which \n     the employer has applied to the registry, and to all other \n     workers in the same occupation as the place of employment, if \n     the workers' permanent place of employment is beyond normal \n     commuting distance. The employer may provide a housing \n     allowance as an alternative.\n\n\n                          workers compensation\n\n       Under current law, workers compensation coverage is \n     exclusively a subject of state law, which may not cover all \n     agricultural employees, especially those considered casual or \n     temporary.\n       Under the proposal, the employer was required to provide \n     insurance coverage providing benefits equivalent to those \n     under state law, at no expense to the worker, for any job \n     that was not covered by the state workers compensation law.\n\n\n                               head start\n\n       Under current law, migrant employees find barriers to \n     participation in Head Start programs.\n       Under the proposal, the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start \n     Program would have been established, removing barriers to \n     participation by the children of migrant farmworkers.\n\n\n                             transportation\n\n       Under current law, employers are not obliged to provide \n     transportation to workers. If transportation is furnished, \n     the employer and any farm labor contractor must comply with \n     the motor vehicle safety requirements of the MSWPA. 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1841.\n       Under the conference proposal, a worker who completed 50 \n     percent of the period of employment would be reimbursed for \n     transportation expenses to the job, and a worker who \n     completed the period of employment would be reimbursed for \n     the cost of transportation back to the worker's permanent \n     place of residence.\n\n\n                       enforcement of labor laws\n\n       Under current law, labor laws are enforced primarily by the \n     U.S. Department of Labor and by the responsible state labor \n     enforcement agencies.\n       Under the proposal, the Secretary of Labor was required to \n     establish an expedited complaint process, including a written \n     determination of whether a violation has been committed \n     within 10 days of the receipt of a complaint.\n       Workers on farms where the employer did not seek workers \n     through the Labor Department registry would not have been \n     affected by the proposal. Agricultural employers who hire \n     migrant and seasonal workers must comply with the provisions \n     of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker protection \n     Act (MSWPA). 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1801-72.\n       In conclusion, the proposed agricultural registry program \n     would have required farmers to extend the protections of the \n     federal migrant and seasonal worker law to all workers in the \n     same occupation on the site. The proposed agricultural \n     employment bill could well have expanded employment \n     protections for U.S. workers beyond current law. If an \n     agricultural employer applied to a registry and found enough \n     U.S. workers for some or all of the available job \n     opportunities, then those U.S. workers would have been \n     entitled to the enhanced wage, housing, transportation, and \n     other benefits and protections made applicable to all \n     employees in the same work on the same site.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am going to yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine has a brief \nstatement to make on the bill that we are talking about. I know the \nSenator from Florida has a brief statement, and I have no objection to \nthe Senator from Florida leading. I also thank my friend from Oregon \nfor his remarks about a very serious topic.\n  I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Vermont and \nMaine for their always courteous generosity, and my colleague from \nOregon, with whom I have been working so closely for approximately 2 \nyears-plus now on this important issue.\n  There is one thing I believe we can agree on, and that is that the \nstatus quo of agricultural farm workers in America is unacceptable. It \nis unacceptable to have somewhere between 35 and 50 percent of all of \nour migratory farm work done by people who are here illegally. It is \nunfair to the individuals involved because it puts them in the shadows \nof our society.\n  If I may, I will state a personal experience. Immediately after \nHurricane Andrew, which hit south Florida in August of 1992, there was \ngreat concern about communicable diseases such as cholera; therefore \nthe Public Health Service wanted to inoculate the whole population \nagainst the potential of these diseases. There is a substantial migrant \nfarm worker population that lives in the southern part of our State, \nand many of those people refused to come forward to be inoculated, nor \nwould they allow their children to be protected against communicable \ndiseases because they live in such a dark shadow because of their \nundocumented status. They were fearful that if they came forward, even \nwith firm promises and commitments by the Public Health Service that \nthey would not be reported for any other purpose, they were still not \nwilling to take the risk. So they put themselves, their families, and \nthe entire community at risk. That is one anecdote of the degree to \nwhich, by our acceptance of the status quo, we have placed hundreds of \nthousands of people into a status of servitude and in the dark closet \nof our society.\n  We also have placed honest farmers in an extremely difficult \nsituation. They are frequently presented with documents that appear to \nbe credible. They hire people to do necessary work during the brief \nperiod that is available to harvest the crops, and then they find out \nlater that these people had fraudulent documents, were undocumented, \nand that they might be subject to various sanctions.\n  We also know that because of the current system, we have farm \nworkers--both those who are legal citizens or residents of the United \nStates, as well as those who are undocumented--living in horrendous \ncircumstances of housing, being transported in vehicles that don't meet \nbasic safety standards, being placed in a position where their salaries \nare held each week in order to pay off previous debts, and they live in \nconditions that are reminiscent not of the 21st century but of the 17th \nor 18th century. These people are doing extremely difficult work, work \nthat is vital to our Nation and vital to our Nation's economy. They \ndeserve better from us, the policymakers of America, than we have done \nfor them in the past.\n  One thing we also know, in addition to the fact that the status quo \nis unacceptable, is the status quo will continue until we decide that \nthis issue is important enough to engage in a serious debate in which \nwe can analyze what the problems are with the status quo, and what the \nrange of solutions to those problems are, and which of those solutions \nappear to be most appropriate. And it is regarding that which the \nSenator from Oregon has mentioned that we have had a series of efforts \nto try to elicit from the administration their plan.\n  Now, why have we focused so much on the administration? Well, first, \nthey happen to have a unique perspective on the problem, since they are \nresponsible to the Department of Labor, and, secondarily, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, for the implementation of the status \nquo. Therefore, they should be in a specially advantaged position to \nanalyze and recommend alteration to the status quo.\n\n  We also know in this form of government we have that while the \nlegislature's responsibility is to enact law, the President, because of \nhis role and because of his constitutional veto authority, plays a key \nposition in terms of legislation and the law.\n  So beginning in June of 1997, we have been meeting with \nrepresentatives of the administration, heads of departments, as well as \nrepresentatives of the White House. Senator Wyden and myself, sometimes \naccompanied by others, have met face-to-face, occasionally by \nconference telephone call, and occasionally by correspondence with the \nadministration on 12 separate occasions between June of 1997 and May of \n1999.\n  Each one of those had a common theme: What is your proposal? What is \nyour diagnosis of the problem? What is your prescription against this \nproblem?\n\n[[Page S12222]]\n\n As of today, in early October of 1999, we have yet to receive a \ncredible response to that question.\n  Thus, the amendment that was accepted to the bill we have just \nadopted directs the administration to submit to the Congress such a \nplan. It is my hope that the administration will do so with a sense of \nexpedition. I hope within a period of 60 or 90 days we receive its \nrecommendations so that, if not at their first session of the 106th \nCongress, then at the earliest point in the second session of the 106th \nCongress, we would be in a position to have the administration's views \nas to how this very vexatious problem could be resolved.\n  I might say that the fact we have made this request, and have made it \nnow for the better part of 30 months, is not an indication that we are \ngoing to desist until we have heard the administration's plan. While we \nwould like to have their guidance and suggestions, we consider it to be \nour ultimate responsibility, as we did in 1998 when we presented to the \nSenate and the Senate adopted by a margin of well over 2 to 1, the \nproposal that we submitted. We will continue to take effective action \nto keep this issue on America's agenda because we cannot tolerate a \ncontinuation of the status quo which places hundreds of thousands of \nhuman beings into a position of servitude and which places hundreds of \nthousands of legitimate farmers in a position in which they must \noperate at the fringe of the law when what they want to do is to be \nlaw-abiding citizens.\n  Before this 106th Congress concludes, I hope we will have had the \nwisdom to reject the status quo and to have adopted humane, effective \npublic policy which will erase the stain of the status quo of American \nfarm workers, which will have lifted this cloud of illegality from \nAmerican farmers, which will assure standards of treatment that we as \nfellow human beings would consider to be dignified and respectful for \nother human beings, and that we can move forward with a new era in \nAmerica agriculture.\n  I appreciate the work of my colleague from Oregon. I also commend our \nother colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith. It is an outstanding \nexample of the people of Oregon who have sent to us these two Members \nof the Senate, who happen to be from different parties but understand \ntheir ultimate commitment is to America and to what is best for this \ngreat Nation. They are giving us, in this case, as in other areas, an \nexample of what bipartisanship means and what bipartisanship can \naccomplish. For that, as well as for their friendship, I extend my \ngratitude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know my good friend from Maine is \ndesirous to speak, and I certainly appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Agriculture \nconference report. I rise in strong opposition to the conference \nreport.\n  First, I wish to commend my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, \nfor his leadership, for his perseverance, for his hard work and \ndetermination on behalf of all the small dairy farmers, not only in his \nState of Vermont but in the State of Maine and throughout New England. \nI thank him. I commend him for the extraordinary effort he has \ndisplayed and exhibited throughout this process.\n  It is only regrettable that those members of the conference committee \nin resolving the differences between the House and the Senate on the \nAgriculture conference report did not recognize the position that has \nbeen held by all of us who represent the New England States for the \nNortheast Dairy Compact. That is why I rise in strong opposition to the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report because it does not extend \na reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  This issue is a States rights issue more than anything else. Quite \nsimply, it addresses the needs of the States in the Northeast, and most \nspecifically those in New England, that have organized in a way that we \ncan allow fair prices for locally produced supplies of fresh milk.\n  All the legislatures have approved the compact in New England, and in \nthe Northeast, and all that is required is the sanction of Congress to \nreauthorize this compact. The compact has protected New England farmers \nagainst the loss of their small family dairy farms and consumers \nagainst the decrease in the fresh supply of local milk. The compact has \nproven to be an effective approach to address farm insecurity. The \ncompact has stabilized the dairy industry in this entire region and has \nprotected farmers and consumers against volatile price swings.\n  As I say, we are talking about small dairy farmers. In my State of \nMaine, the farmer has an average of 50 cows on their farm. They are \ntrying to preserve a way of life, a way of life that has been there for \nfamilies for generations. We are trying to protect them through this \ndairy compact.\n  All we are asking from this Congress is a reauthorization so we can \nextend this way of life to small dairy farmers--not agribusiness, not \nbig business, not co-ops, just small dairy farmers who want to produce \nmilk so they can sell it to the consumers in my State of Maine, to \nSenator Jeffords' State of Vermont, and within the New England region.\n  Over 97 percent of the fluid milk market in New England is self-\ncontained. Fluid milk markets are local due to the demand for freshness \nand high transportation cost. So any complaints raised from other parts \nof the country about unfair competition is quite disingenuous.\n  All we are asking for is a continuation of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact, the existence of which does not threaten or financially harm \nany other dairy farmer in the country--not any other dairy farmer in \nthe country. It is to help our dairy farmers within New England, to \nhelp the consumers, to help a way of life. The Northeast Dairy Compact \ncurrently encompasses the New England States and only applies to fluid \nmilk sold on grocery store shelves in the Northeast.\n  Only the consumers and the processors in the New England region pay \nto support the minimum price to protect a fair return to the areas' \nfamily dairy farmers and to protect a way of life important to the \npeople of Northeast.\n  All six of the New England States have supported this through the \nacts of the legislature, and through all of their Governors, because \neach Governor has signed a resolution supporting the Northeast Dairy \nCompact.\n  Let me repeat. Every Governor and every State legislature in New \nEngland have supported the dairy compact. Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents support the dairy compact through acts of the legislatures \nbecause they recognize how important this compact is to the small dairy \nfarmers in the Northeast.\n  Under the compact, New England retail milk prices have been among the \nlowest and the most stable in the country. The opposition--again, we \nhave heard it day in and day out--has manufactured arguments against \nthe compact, saying that increased milk prices.\n  Let's look at dairy prices over the past few months around the \ncountry for a gallon of fresh milk. The price in Augusta, ME, ranged \nfrom $2.89 to $2.99 per gallon from February to April of 1999; in \nBoston, MA, the market price stayed perfectly stable at $2.89 from \nFebruary to April of 1999; the price in Seattle ranged from $3.39 to \n$3.56 over the same time period. Washington State is not in the \ncompact. Yet their milk was approximately 50 cents higher per gallon \nthan in the State of Maine. The range in Los Angeles was from $3.19 to \n$3.29; in San Diego, the range was from $3.10 to $3.62. California is \nnot in the compact. Las Vegas prices were $2.99 all the way up to $3.62 \nin that time period; not much price stability there. And then Nevada is \nnot in the compact. In Philadelphia the range was $2.78 to $3.01 per \ngallon, not as wide a shift as Nevada but a much wider price shift than \nthe Northeast Compact States.\n  That is why Pennsylvania dairy farmers want to join us. That is why \nPennsylvania supports joining the compact.\n  Denver, CO, on the other hand, is not in the compact. A gallon of \nmilk in Denver has cost consumers anywhere from $3.45 to $3.59 over the \npast few months, over one half a dollar more than in New England.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact has not resulted in higher milk prices in\n\n[[Page S12223]]\n\nNew England in spite of what the opposition has said, but milk prices \nare among the lowest in the country and are among the most stable.\n  Opponents also say consumers are getting a raw deal having to spend \nmore on milk. Obviously, based on what I have said thus far in terms of \nprices around the country, this claim is inaccurate, as prices are \namong the lowest in the Northeast Compact area and reflect greater \nprice stability.\n  Also, where is the consumer outrage from the compact States for \nspending a few extra pennies for fresh fluid milk so as to ensure a \nsafety net for dairy farmers so they can continue in an important way \nof life. Where is that consumer outrage? It isn't in New England. I \nhave not heard of consumer complaints in my State over the last 3 years \nas a result of this dairy compact, even in instances where milk prices \nmight have gone up a few pennies because consumers support our dairy \nfarmers. They realize that this pilot program is very important to a \nway of life, to the kind of milk they want in their region, and they \nare willing to support it. They recognize this dairy compact has been a \nhuge success.\n  The Compact Commission sent out over $4 million in checks to \nNortheast dairy farmers this past month. That averages to over $1,000 \nfor each dairy farmer--enough to help keep small family farmers in \nbusiness and continue a historical way of life that is so important.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has provided the very safety \nnet that we have hoped for when the compact passed as part of the \nFreedom to Farm Act, the omnibus farm bill of 1996. The dairy compact \nhas helped farmers maintain the stable price for fluid milk during \ntimes of volatile swings in farm milk prices.\n  In the spring and summer months of 1997 and 1998, for instance, when \nmilk prices throughout most of the country dropped at least 20 cents a \ngallon while consumers' prices remained constant, the payments to the \nNortheast Interstate Compact dairy farmers remained above the Federal \nmilk marketing prices for class 1 fluid milk because of the dairy \ncompact and I might add, at no expense to the Federal Government. The \ncosts to operate the dairy compact are borne entirely by the farmers \nand the processes of a compact region.\n  Also, consider what has happened to the number of dairy farmers \nstaying in business since the formation of the dairy compact. Another \ngoal of the compact is to preserve a way of life of the small dairy \nfarmer. It is now known throughout New England there has been a decline \nin dairy farmers going out of business. This is a clear demonstration \nthat with the dairy compact, the dairy producers were provided a safety \nnet, which is what we had hoped for. The results have been just that.\n  In addition, the compact requires the Compact Commission to take such \naction as necessary to ensure that a minimum price set by the \ncommission for the region does not create an incentive for producers to \ngenerate additional supplies of milk. There has been no rush to \nincrease milk production in the Northeast, as has been stated. Oh, we \nheard time and time again by the opposition that it would increase milk \nproduction.\n  We inserted in the compact legislation back in 1996 compensation \nproducers that have been implemented by the New England Dairy \nCommission specifically to protect against increased production of \nfresh milk. That legislation in the 1996 farm bill required the \ncommission to reimburse the USDA for any portion of the Government's \ncost of purchasing surplus dairy products that could be attributed to \nan increase in milk production in the Northeast in excess of the \nprojected national average. This provision was included in the farm \nbill in response to critics' concern that the compact price would lead \nto overproduction of milk in the Northeast and thus cause Government \npurchases of surplus milk under the dairy support program to rise.\n\n  Between March and September of 1998, the commission placed $2 million \nin escrow in anticipation of a potential liability to USDA for surplus \npurchases. The commission ended up paying $1.76 million to the USDA \ntoward the end of the fiscal year and returned unused escrow funds of \n$400,000 to the Northeast producers who did not increase milk \nproduction during fiscal year 1998.\n  I welcome anybody in this Chamber to cite any other commodity farm \nprogram that actually paid back the Federal Government money, that \ndidn't cost the Government any money. I daresay there is no other \ninstance of any other commodity farm program that actually reimbursed \nthe Federal Government, that didn't cost the Government one dime--other \nthan the New England Dairy Compact.\n  How can other regions of the country feel threatened by a Northeast \nDairy Compact for fluid milk produced and sold mainly at home in our \nregion of the country? This compact did what it said it would do: \nPreserve its way of life, create price stability; it didn't cost the \nGovernment money; it didn't increase production, and if it did in any \nsmall way, we reimbursed the Government so it wouldn't cost any money.\n  Despite what has been stated by the opposition, again there has been \nno additional cost to the Federal nutrition programs, no adverse price \nimpact in the WIC Program--the Women's, Infants and Children Program--\nor the Federal school lunch and breakfast program. In fact, the \nadvocates of the programs support the compact and serve on its \ncommission.\n  It should be noted that in the farm bill conference in 1996, the \nSecretary of Agriculture was required to review the dairy compact \nlegislation before implementation to determine if there was compelling \npublic interest for the compact within the compact region. In August 9, \n1996, and only after a public comment period, Secretary Glickman \nauthorized the implementation of the dairy compact, finding that it \nwas, indeed, in the compelling public interest to do so.\n  In addition, another mechanism for guaranteeing that this was in \ntheir interest, that it wasn't going to cost money to the Federal \nGovernment, the Agricultural Appropriations Act of 1998 directed the \nOffice of Management and Budget to study the economic effects of the \ncompact and especially its effect in the Federal food and nutrition \nprograms. Key findings of the OMB study released in February 1998 \nshowed that, for the first 6 months of the compact, the New England \nretail milk prices were 5 cents per gallon lower than retail milk \nprices nationally.\n  Also, a GAO study stated that the compact economically benefited the \ndairy producers, increasing their income from milk sales by about 6 \npercent, with no adverse effects to dairy farmers outside the compact \nregion.\n  These were independent studies. We had OMB, GAO, we had every safety \nmechanism and precaution in this legislation, and it has demonstrated \ntime and time again it is in the best interests of our small dairy \nfarmers, not costing the Government money--in fact, to the contrary.\n  The consumers in the Northeast Compact area are showing their \nwillingness to support this compact, to pay a little more for milk if \nthe additional money is going directly to the dairy farmer. Because we \nare not talking about big corporate farms, we are talking about the \nsmall dairy farmer whose family has been in business 100 years, 150 \nyears--generational. That is what they want to do--to maintain their \nfamilies, to maintain a way of life, and to sell their milk to their \nlocal consumers.\n  Environmental organizations have supported dairy compacting as the \ncompact helps to preserve dwindling agricultural land and open spaces \nthat help combat urban sprawl.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a joint \nresolution from the Legislature of the State of Maine that was passed \nlast spring. I have it here on this board. It shows strong support, on \na bipartisan basis, in the Maine State Legislature, and how enormously \nimportant this compact is to the near 500 dairy farmers in Maine who \nproduce annually over more than $100 million in the State of Maine, and \nhow it is in the best interests of Maine's consumers and businesses \nthat this compact be reauthorized. It is that important.\n\n  So we have Republicans and Democrats in the State legislatures, we \nhave an independent Governor who supports it, we have everybody across \nthe political spectrum who supports this dairy compact because they \nunderstand the value of it.\n\n[[Page S12224]]\n\n  I also will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nJuly 15, 1999, letter from Maine's Commissioner of Agriculture, who \nwrote:\n\n       I am writing to urge your continued support of Maine's \n     dairy farmers. As you know there is legislation pending \n     before Congress relating to the reauthorization of the \n     Northeast Dairy Compact Commission, and reorganization of the \n     Federal Milk Marketing Orders. These issues are of the utmost \n     importance to Maine dairy farmers and the dairy industry and \n     the infrastructure in this State as a whole.\n       We need only look at the recent volatility of milk prices \n     to see the Northeast Dairy Compact has been a great success.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I cannot stress enough the importance of this issue to the \n     Maine dairy industry.\n\n  I also will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nSeptember 29, 1999, letter from the Council of State Governments, \nEastern Regional Conference, signed by Senators and Representatives and \nheads of the departments of agriculture of Maine, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, \nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.\n  These State elected officials from States all over the Northeast \nwrote:\n\n       The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, in setting minimum \n     regional prices for milk, has been an essential stabilizing \n     force with respect to the price that the northeast dairy \n     farmers receive for the milk they produce. Because of its \n     regional focus, it has been extremely successful in promoting \n     adequate local milk production to meet the needs of consumers \n     for fresh milk at an affordable price.\n\n  I am also submitting for the Record the Council of State Governments' \nresolution of August 11, 1999, in support of the reauthorization of the \ncompact.\n  Last, I will ask consent to have printed in the Record a September 30 \neditorial from the Bangor Daily News in my State of Maine, which \nstates:\n\n       The compact helps keep local farmers in business, not only \n     through price support but also by keeping enough other \n     farmers at work. That means a dairy infrastructure of grain \n     dealers, truck drivers, and farm machinery salespeople will \n     remain. And that means jobs where they are needed most, in \n     the smallest towns whose residents cannot simply turn to \n     alternative industries. This is not mere nostalgia for the \n     bucolic past, but an immediate dollars and cents issue.\n\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       Certainly there would be less support for the compact as it \n     stood alone as the sole agricultural support states enjoyed. \n     But the sheer number and variety of Federal programs for \n     crops or for not growing crops, for research and marketing, \n     for electricity, grazing water, etc., makes singling out this \n     relatively small program seem more than a little short-\n     sighted.\n\n  That raises an important point. We do not get any support. We do not \nget the kinds of subsidies that other parts of the country, other \ncommodity programs, have received. Our dairy farmers work hard. They \nwork hard for the sole interest of producing a small amount, so they \ncan sell to their local consumers, to their neighbors, to their \ncommunity, to their State. That is all they ever want.\n  This editorial goes on to say:\n\n       None of the Midwestern representatives so angry about the \n     compact have suggested, for instance, that Congress end the \n     millions of dollars spent on local farm research or cut the \n     power lines at the Hoover dam.\n       Yet the dairy compact is in no sense different than these \n     programs--or it is different only in the sense it helps \n     farmers in this region rather than the usual pattern of \n     helping farmers in the Midwest. Unless Congress has some \n     hidden reason to single out punishment for New England dairy \n     farmers, it should support the compact as a sensible part of \n     our Nation's agricultural policies.\n\n  That is an important final point. As one who served 16 years in the \nHouse of Representatives, and now in my fifth year in the Senate, I \nhave seen a huge disparity in our farm programs between the policies \nand programs providing support for the big, the very big, farmers, and \nthe lack of support for the small family farmer, who is so indicative \nand characteristic of my State and I know the State of Vermont that my \ncolleague, Senator Jeffords, represents. It is the small family farmer \nwho just wants to survive, wants to go about doing his business each \nand every day. Yet we are not going to allow them to do that and to \ncontinue a way of life.\n  The pattern I have seen in these agricultural programs that are \nsupported here in this conference report, time and time again over my \n20 years, has been to the exclusion of the small family farmer and to \nthe benefit of the big agribusiness in America. I say that is a \ntravesty of justice. I say it is unfair. I say it is not right.\n  That is why this dairy compact is so important. Indeed, it is \nshortsighted on the part of the conferees who did not support the \nreauthorization in this conference report. It is shortsighted of those \nwho are unwilling to give it their support once again, raising the most \nbogus of arguments, which we have dispelled. We have refuted all of \ntheir arguments, not just based on our hearsay alone, but we have had \nOMB studies, we have had GAO studies--by everybody's reckoning. We even \nhave legislatures in all the New England States and in the Northeast \nthat support this dairy compact, and the Governors. Can they be all \nwrong? Could they be misrepresenting their constituency? I say not.\n  I hope we can defeat this conference report. It simply is not right. \nIt is simply not fair. I ask you to support the small farmers and the \nway of life they want to embrace, that they cherish, and that they want \nto sustain. We owe them that much.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for doing \nyeoman's work on behalf of these small dairy farmers in his State and \nmy State, throughout New England and the other States that want to join \nbecause they have seen the success of this compact over the last 3 \nyears. It was a very effective and successful pilot program, and it \ndeserves to be continued.\n  Mr. President, I now ask consent that the material I referred to be \nprinted in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    State of Maine Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Maine has nearly 500 dairy farms producing milk \n     valued annually at over $100,000,000; and\n       Whereas, maintaining a sufficient supply of Maine-produced \n     milk and milk products is in the best interest of Maine \n     consumers and businesses; and\n       Whereas, Maine is a member of the Northeast Interstate \n     Dairy Compact; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact will \n     terminate at the end of October 1999 unless action is taken \n     by the Congress to reauthorize it; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact's mission \n     is to ensure the continued viability of dairy farming in the \n     Northeast and to ensure consumers of an adequate, local \n     supply of pure and wholesome milk; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has \n     established a minimum price to be paid to dairy farmers for \n     their milk, which has helped to stabilize their incomes; and\n       Whereas, in certain months the compact's minimum price has \n     resulted in dairy farmers receiving nearly 10% more for their \n     milk than the farmers would have otherwise received; and\n       Whereas, actions taken by the compact have directly \n     benefited Maine dairy farmers and consumers; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved: That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the United States Congress reauthorize the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact; and be it further\n       Resolved: That suitable copies of the Memorial, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of the United \n     States, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United \n     States, each member of the United States Congress who sits as \n     chair on the United States House of Representatives Committee \n     on Agriculture or the United States Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, the United States \n     Secretary of Agriculture and each Member of the Maine \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n         State of Maine, Maine Department of Agriculture, Food & \n           Rural Resources\n                                       Augusta, ME, July 15, 1999.\n     Sen. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: I am writing to urge your continued \n     support of Maine dairy farmers. As you know, there is \n     legislation pending before Congress relating to \n     reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission and \n     reorganization of the Federal Milk Marketing Orders. These \n     issues are the utmost importance to Maine dairy farmers and \n     the dairy industry and infrastructure in this state as a \n     whole.\n       We need only look at the recent volatility in milk prices \n     to see that the Northeast Dairy Compact has been a great \n     success. The Compact was designed to provide dairy farmers \n     with a safety net against huge drops in prices. While much of \n     the rest of the country saw recent reductions in prices by up \n     to one third, the blow to dairy farmers of the northeast, \n     while substantial, was cushioned by the\n\n[[Page S12225]]\n\n     floor price established through the Compact. The Compact \n     worked! For many Maine dairy farmers, the Compact has been \n     the difference between existence and extinction.\n       There is no question that the Federal Milk Marketing Orders \n     needed reform. Consolidation of orders and updating of \n     standards and definitions was long overdue. However, adoption \n     of the pricing changes to the different classes of milk as \n     proposed by USDA will have enormous impacts for Maine dairy \n     farmers. Even by the most conservative estimates produced by \n     USDA, farm income in the northeast will decrease $84 million \n     dollars per year under the new proposed pricing system. Most \n     estimates indicate the loss to farmers will be in excess of \n     $100 million dollars.\n       Pending legislation would reauthorize the Northeast Compact \n     (along with authorization of a Southern Compact), require \n     USDA to adopt the so called 1-A option of pricing class I \n     milk and require USDA to hold rulemaking hearing on pricing \n     of class III milk. I urge your continued support and hope you \n     will encourage uncommitted colleagues to support the \n     Jeffords/Leahy amendment legislation. I can not stress enough \n     the importance of this issue to the Maine dairy industry.\n       Please contact me with any concerns or questions you have \n     regarding these important matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert W. Spear,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Council of Governments,\n\n                                              Septembver 29, 1999.\n                           Re: Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n       The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, in setting minimum \n     regional prices for milk, has been an essential stabilizing \n     force with respect to the price that northeast dairy farmers \n     receive for the milk they produce. Because of its regional \n     focus, it has been extremely successful in promoting adequate \n     local milk production to meet the needs of consumers for \n     fresh milk at an affordable price.\n       As you know, the Dairy Compact is due to expire on October \n     1, 1999. Twenty five states, including all of those in the \n     Northeast, have adopted the Dairy Compact. If it is not \n     reauthorized, the resulting volatility in milk prices will \n     cause regional dairy farmers to suffer devastating financial \n     consequences. Therefore, we urge you to promote the extension \n     of the Northeast Dairy Compact, as well as ratification of \n     the Southern Dairy Compact, by Congress in an effort to \n     secure the financial future of our region's dairy farmers.\n       In summary, we believe prompt action is necessary on both \n     of these matters that are so critical to maintaining he \n     viability of the region's agriculture industry and, thereby, \n     our overall economy and quality of life. The financial losses \n     endured by our farmers are substantial and immediate. We \n     respectfully request that you and your Congressional \n     colleagues from the Northeast support the measures we are \n     proposing and promote regional solidarity to assist the \n     struggling northeast farmers.\n       Please feel encouraged to contact any of the signatories \n     below or our staff in the Council of State Governments' \n     Eastern office with responses to this letter and any \n     recommendations for immediate follow-up action.\n           Sincerely,\n         Representative Jessie G.

As policy for promoting \n     economic diversity, food safety and open space, however, it \n     is an important program for the region.\n       The compact helps dairy farmers by guaranteeing a minimum \n     price for milk. Though it has cost consumers approximately 15 \n     cents per gallon since 1996, it returns to them at least that \n     much value through other means. As members of Congress debate \n     the future of the compact--which was set to end tomorrow but \n     has been postponed by a judge's ruling Tuesday--they should \n     keep in mind that their decision affects far more than a few \n     small farmers.\n       The compact helps keep local farms in business not only \n     through the price support but also by keeping enough other \n     farmers at work. That means a dairy infrastructure of grain \n     dealers, truck drivers and farm machinery salespeople will \n     remain. And that means jobs where they are needed most, in \n     the smallest towns whose residents cannot simply turn to \n     alternative industries. This is not mere nostalgia for the \n     bucolic past, but an immediate dollars and cents issue.\n       Having a healthy dairy industry is far more useful and \n     considerably less expensive to Maine taxpayers than sitting \n     by and watching these farms go under, then setting loose its \n     retraining programs and hoping for the best. On a national \n     level, the compact prevents an overdependence on a few large \n     Midwestern sources for this important and highly perishable \n     food. And it gives New England states more local say on \n     controversial issues such as bovine growth hormone.\n       Certainly, there would be less support for the compact if \n     it stood alone as the sole agricultural support states \n     enjoyed. But the sheer number and variety of federal programs \n     for crops or for not growing crops, for research and \n     marketing, for electricity, grazing and water, etc., makes \n     singling out this relatively small program seem more than a \n     little short-sighted. None of the Midwestern representatives \n     so angry about the compact have suggested, for instance, that \n     Congress end the millions of dollars spent on local farm \n     research or cut the power lines at the Hoover Dam.\n       Yet the dairy compact is in no sense different than these \n     programs--or it is different only in the sense that it helps \n     farmers in this region rather than the usual pattern of \n     helping farmers in the Midwest. Unless Congress has some \n     hidden reason to single out for punishment New England dairy \n     farmers, it should support the compact as a sensible part of \n     the nation's agricultural policies.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be finishing quickly. I would \nlike to point out--exactly where the Senator from Maine left off--why \nwe are here. It may be a little confusing why we are involved in a \nconference report, but it was pointed out in the farm bill of 1996, we \ngot agreement that we should run a pilot program in New England of a \nvery exciting idea, of a compact where the States would get together \nand handle the problems of their dairy farmers by having an organized \nmarketing system.\n  We would show this kind of a system where people from the States \nwould sit down on a commission and make sure the price of milk was held \nat a level which would guarantee a supply of\n\n[[Page S12226]]\n\nfresh fluid milk, which is a basic part of agricultural law, and that \nthe demonstration program would be reviewed when the milk orders were \nto be implemented.\n  What happened? Did the program work? That was the problem, it did. \nThat is why we are here tonight because the program did work.\n  As the Senator from Maine pointed out, the opponents of this, in the \nMidwest in particular, were so confident it was going to fail, they \nwent out and got the OMB, who they figured would be most friendly to \nthem being of the administration, many Democrats--whatever, that is \nbeside the point--but so certain were they that it would be a failure, \nthey got OMB to do a study.\n  Lo and behold, what happened? The study came back, and the GAO later \ncame back and said it worked great, it is a wonderful program. That is \nwhy 25 States now have said that ought to be a program in which they \ncan get involved. Half the States in the country have already said it \nis a success. OMB said it is a success.\n  What is the problem now? Why? Because of the desire of those in the \nMidwest to take over and supply these areas with milk themselves and \nnot the local dairy farmers, which helps make sure we have that fresh \nquality milk available, they decided they will put them out of \nbusiness.\n  They cannot put them out of business because it is working. The \nprocessors, who have been used to setting the price themselves--in many \ncases there are one or two; there are not many processors, so when \nthere is a good supply of milk, they can go to zero. That has stopped. \nIt is working well.\n  The Department of Agriculture was not going to do the pilot program. \nWe had to get it extended.\n  That is where we are. We wanted to extend it, and when we had one, at \nleast we thought we had one in the conference committee that we would \nhave approved because the majority in the House and Senate agreed it \nwas a good program and ought to be extended, what happened? Forces came \nin and put pressure on Members and we ended up without a majority in \nthe committee. Therefore, we got thrown out into the cold.\n  We are here to make sure this bill, which belonged on that conference \nreport, that everyone seemed to agree to, goes forward. That is why we \nare now trying to hold up this bill to get action. We are not going to \ntry to hold up the bill for the disaster payments. We will get into a \nfurther discussion of this whole bill and the stuff in it.\n  The one part that worked so well that does not cost any money and \nprevents disasters, we cannot get it put into law. That is why we are \nhere. We are going to continue.

Mr. President, I supported passage of the Conference \nReport on H.R.2606, the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for \nFiscal Year 2000.\n  Foreign aid programs, which constitute a mere one percent of federal \nspending, are an important and underappreciated component of United \nStates foreign and national security policy. Passage of the annual \nappropriations bill for foreign operations is, consequently, an \nimperative. It is for this reason that I voted for its passage, and \nanticipate its being signed into law by the President.\n  Despite my support for passage of the Conference Report, this \nlegislation is not without its flaws. While it includes essential \neconomic and military assistance for Israel and Egypt, it contains none \nof the funding associated with implementation of the Wye River accords \ninvolving Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority. It is \nanticipated that such funding will be included in a supplemental \nappropriations bill at some point in the not-too-distant future, but I \nquestion the fiscal and political wisdom of budgeting in this manner. \nSmoke and mirrors rarely provide for sound budgeting practices or a \ncoherent foreign policy.\n  I am also concerned about the continued inclusion in this legislation \nof unrequested earmarks and adds. While the Conference Report \nrepresents a vast improvement over the bill passed by the Senate in \nJune, it still represents the legislature's continued refusal to desist \nfrom earmarking in spending bills. Such earmarks in the bill include \n$500,000 for what by any other name remains the Mitch McConnell \nConservation Fund, $15 million for American universities in Lebanon, \nand a requirement to establish a $200 million maritime fund using \nUnited States commercial maritime expertise. The bill essentially \nmandates the establishment of an International Law Enforcement Academy \nin Roswell, New Mexico, thereby demonstrating yet again that fiscal \nprudence and operational necessity remain alien concepts to members of \nthis body.\n  There are more examples, but I think I have made my point. As I have \nstated in the past, there is undoubtedly considerable merit to some of \nthe programs for which funding is earmarked at the request of members \nof Congress. My concern is for the integrity of the process by which \nthe federal budget is put together. Merit-based competitive processes \nensure that the interests of the American taxpayer are protected, and \nthat the most cost-effective approach is employed. Absent such \nprocedures, I will continue to have no choice but to highlight the \npractice of adding and earmarking funds for programs and activities not \nrequested by the respective federal agencies.\n  Finally, I must register my strong opposition to language in the bill \nprohibiting any direct assistance to Cambodia and requiring U.S. \nopposition to loans from international lending institutions for that \nimpoverished country. Cambodia's election was not perfect; in fact, the \nmonths leading up to the vote were characterized by numerous efforts on \nthe part of the Cambodian People's Party to intimidate its political \nopposition. Cambodia, however, is experiencing its first period of \nrelative peace and stability in many years, and it is regrettable that \nsome in the Senate remain committed to isolating the government in \nPhnom Penh during a time when we should be working within that country \nto strengthen democratic institutions while facilitating economic \ngrowth. Section 573 of the Conference Report, consequently, represents \na significant impediment to our ability to help Cambodia move forward \nfrom an enormously painful past.\n  Despite these flaws, Mr. President, I reiterate my support for \npassage of the bill and request the accompanying list, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs for the \n    Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 2000, and for Other Purposes--\n                    Directive Language and Earmarks\n\n\n                        Bill Language Provisions\n\n       Not less than $500,000 should be made available for support \n     of the United States Telecommunications Training Institute;\n       $19.6 million shall be available for the International Fund \n     for Ireland;\n       $10 million shall be available for the Russian Leadership \n     Program;\n       $1 million shall be available for the Robert F.

Mr. President, I rise to note that since June 30 of \nthis year, the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit has, once again, \nbeen allowed to lapse. As this body considers whether to enact a so-\ncalled ``extenders'' package, I want to urge my colleagues to include \nand pass a permanent extension of the Research and Experimentation tax \ncredit.\n  The research and experimentation tax credit provides business an \nincentive to fund development of the technologies of tomorrow by \nproviding a tax credit for investments in research.\n  The research and experimentation tax credit is an important element \nin the creation of strong economic growth and rising productivity. \nIndustry leaders have credited it with spawning private enterprise \ninvestments. It is especially important to the high-tech and emerging \ngrowth industries that are driving the California economy. And, because \nit creates jobs and spurs economic activity, the research and \nexperimentation tax credit helps to increase the tax base, paying back \nthe benefit of the credit.\n  Yet, despite its many benefits, for 18 years the research and \nexperimentation tax credit remains, inexplicably, a temporary tax \nprovision requiring regular renewal.\n  In fact, since 1981, when it was first enacted, the Research and \nExperimentation Tax Credit has been extended nine times. In four \ninstances the research credit had expired before being renewed \nretroactively and, in one instance, it was renewed for a mere six \nmonths.\n  This is not a process which is conducive to encouraging business \ninvestment in the innovative industries--high technology, electronics, \ncomputers, software, and biotechnology, among others--which will \nprovide future strength and growth for the U.S. economy.\n  Earlier in this decade California was faced with its severest \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression. Today, the California \neconomy is healthy and vibrant, and it is so in no small part because \nof the critical role played by innovative research and development \nefforts in nurturing new ``high tech'' industries.\n  Today the 150 largest Silicon Valley companies are valued at well-\nover $500 billion, $500 billion which did not exist two decades ago. \nMuch of this growth is a result of ability of companies to undertake \nlong-range and sustained research in cutting-edge technologies. Scores \nof California companies--and companies across the country--owe much of \ntheir success and growth to the incentive provided by the research and \nexperimentation tax credit.\n  Research and experimentation is the lifeblood of high technology \ndevelopment, and if we want to continue to replicate the successful \ngrowth that has characterized the U.S. economy during this past decade \nit is crucial that we create a permanent research and experimentation \ntax credit.\n  For example, Pericom Semiconductor, located in San Jose, has expanded \nfrom a start-up company in 1990 to a company with over $50 million in \nrevenue and 175 employees by the end of last year and is ranked by \nDeloitte Touche as one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon \nValley. According to a letter I received from Pericom, utilization of \nthe research and experimentation tax credit has been key to their \nsuccess, enabling them to add engineers, conduct research, and expand \ntheir technology base.\n  Indeed, according to a 1998 study conducted by the national \naccounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, a permanent credit will increase GDP \nby nearly $58 billion (in 1998 dollars) over the next decade. The \nproductivity gains from a permanent extension will allow workers \nthroughout the Nation to earn higher wages, and the additional tax \nrevenue created by these new jobs will help pay back the benefit of the \ncredit.\n  Whether it is advances in health care, information technology, or \nenvironmental design, research and development are critical ingredients \nfor fueling the process of economic growth.\n  Moreover, aggressive research and experimentation is essential for \nU.S. industries fighting to be competitive in the world marketplace. \nFor example, American biotechnology is the world leader in developing \neffective treatments and biotech is considered one of the critical \ntechnologies for the 21st century. With other countries heavily-\nsubsidizing research and development, it is critical that U.S. \ncompanies also receive incentive to invest the necessary resources to \nstay on top of breakthrough developments.\n  I recently received a letter from the CEO of Genentech, for example, \nin which he wrote:\n\n       The R tax credit is especially important to Genentech and \n     our patients. Our newest therapy, Herceptin, which is used to \n     treat metastatic breast cancer, is a prime example. The early \n     clinical trials for Herceptin showed that it was a somewhat \n     effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer, but the \n     results were not particularly robust. It was a classic case \n     of a research project being ``on the bubble'' in terms of \n     deciding whether to go forward into the most expensive phase \n     of human clinical trials. However, because the value of the \n     tax credit to Genentech directly means that we are able to \n     move one additional drug candidate each year into clinical \n     trials, we were able to move forward with the Phase III \n     Herceptin clinical trial in late 1994. I dare say that \n     without the R credit, Herceptin might well not have become \n     a reality. Today, thousands of patients are receiving this \n     important treatment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the September 30, 1999 \nletter from Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Genentech, Inc.,\n\n                            San Francisco, CA, September 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. On behalf of \n     Genentech, I would like to thank you both for your long-\n     standing leadership and support for the Research and \n     Experimentation Tax Credit, more commonly known as the R \n     tax credit. Once again, however, we find ourselves in the \n     perilous position of the Congressional session quickly coming \n     to an end without providing an extension of the credit, which \n     expired on June 30, 1999. As you are well aware, the credit \n     is critical to California's economy, as the high technology \n     and biotechnology sectors count on the value of the credit to \n     continue the economic expansion our sectors have enjoyed for \n     the past few years.\n       The R tax credit is especially important to Genentech and \n     our patients. Our newest therapy, Herceptin, which is used to \n     treat metastatic breast cancer, is a prime example. The early \n     clinical trials for Herceptin showed that it was a somewhat \n     effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer, but the \n     results were not particularly robust. It was a classic case \n     of a research project being ``on the bubble'' in terms of \n     deciding whether to go forward into the most expensive phase \n     of human clinical trials. However, because the value of the \n     tax credit to Genentech directly means that we are able to \n     move one additional drug candidate each year into clinical \n     trials, we were able to move forward with the Phase III \n     Herceptin clinical trial in late 1994. I dare say that \n     without the R credit, Herceptin might well not have become \n     a reality. Today, thousands of patients are receiving this \n     important therapy.\n       Clearly, Genentech is among the most research intensive \n     companies in the world. In\n\n[[Page S12228]]\n\n     1996, we invested $471 million, or 49% of our revenue, on \n     research and development and have consistently devoted more \n     than 30% of revenues to R in the subsequent years. But \n     research is our lifeblood. It gives life to the ideas we test \n     to treat serious, unmet medical needs. Our strong portfolio \n     of products is a direct reflection of the ideas our \n     scientists have brought from the lab to the patient. And, as \n     evidenced by our exciting pipeline, I firmly believe the best \n     of our science is yet to come.\n       Direct federal support for overall research has, for the \n     most part, been declining for over a decade. While a long-\n     term commitment to increasing funds available to the federal \n     government for basic research is important, maximizing \n     private industry innovation through a permanent R tax \n     credit is perhaps the most cost-effective means of ensuring \n     that high levels of private-sector investment will continue \n     to be made.\n       Your leadership and commitment to the R tax credit, has \n     resulted in great economic benefit for both our country and \n     for California. I encourage you to, once again, redouble your \n     efforts to extend the credit now so that greater economic \n     benefits and new therapies can benefit all Americans.\n       I have attached a couple of op-ed pieces regarding the \n     credit which I and others wrote, and which ran in the San \n     Jose Mercury over the last two years. I look forward to \n     continuing to work with you and your staffs in support of the \n     R tax credit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Arthur D. Leninson, Ph.D.,\n                             Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Most biotech research and development efforts are \nlong term projects spanning five to ten years, sometimes more. The \nuncertainty created by the temporary and sporadic extensions is \nincompatible with the basic needs of biotech innovation--providing \ncompanies with a stable time frame to plan, launch, and conduct \nresearch activities. In the case of a promising but financially \nintensive research project, such unpredictability can make the \ndifference as to whether the project is completed or abandoned.\n  Anyone who has watched the growth of America's high tech sector in \nthe past two decades--much of it in California--has seen first hand how \nresearch and development investment leads to new jobs, new businesses, \nand even entire new industries. And anyone who has benefitted from \nbreakthrough products--from new treatments for genetic disorders to \ncleansing contaminated groundwater--has felt the effect of this tax \ncredit.\n  Over the past two decades the research and experimentation tax credit \nhas proven its worth in creating new technologies and jobs and in \ngrowing tax revenues for this country. It should not be imperilled by \nremaining a temporary credit, subject to termination because of the \nuncertainty of a given political moment. I urge my colleagues to work \nto make sure that any Senate tax bill contains a permanent extension \nfor the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12228-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12228-S12229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INCREASING THE FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THE AIDS EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are now entering the third decade of the \nAIDS epidemic and while we have made some progress in fighting this \ndevastating disease, our federal response is still lacking.\n  More than 400,000 people have died of complications associated with \nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome since 1981. Last year, more than \n54,000 new cases of AIDS were reported in this country. This trend is \nstaggering and belies the misperception that somehow the AIDS epidemic \nin this country or abroad has abated. While it is true that therapeutic \nand treatment breakthroughs have led to longer and more productive \nfulfilling lives for those living with HIV, and that the death rate \nfrom AIDS has fallen in recent years, the fact remains that this \nepidemic has no cure and the rate of new infections has not slowed.\n  But these are days of great hope, Mr. President, in the fight against \nAIDS. During the years of inaction by the Reagan and Bush \nAdministrations during the 1980s, we entered the second decade of the \nepidemic on a much different note: treatments were few, toxic and \nlargely ineffective; training of physicians in the care of patients \nwith HIV was incomplete, uneven and erratic; discrimination and abuse \nof people living with AIDS in housing, employment and medical care was \nrampant and abhorrent. It was difficult to have much hope as we entered \nthe 1990s.\n  But this decade has seen great promise. We have made significant \nstrides. No longer an immediate death sentence, AIDS has lost some--but \ncertainly not all--of its social stigma. In that dark dawn of the \nepidemic, Mr. President, who would have believed that we would see a \ndecade in which two Miss Americas would be AIDS activists, touring the \ncountry and speaking out on AIDS prevention and care? In the early \n1980s, who would have believed that we would have an Office of AIDS \nResearch at the National Institutes of Health, that funding for the \nRyan White program would increase by 260 percent, or that funding for \nAIDS research would increase by 67 percent?\n  And yet, Mr. President, the rumbling of the epidemic has not been \nstilled. In the early 1980s, who would have believed that some African \ncountries would have 25 or 35 percent infection rates, or that an \nentire generation of gay men in the United States would be lost? Who \nwould have believed that infection rates would continue at staggering \npaces at the same time leading voices would declare the epidemic over? \nHave we truly become victims of our own success?\n  I certainly hope not, for as Tony Kushner wrote at the end of his \nmonumental play, Angels in America, ``great work remains to be done.''\n  Until we have an AIDS-free day in America, I will not become \ncomplacent. As ranking member of the Housing subcommittee, I know that \ngreat work remains to be done in finding shelter for people living with \nAIDS. I was pleased that my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, and \nmy friend from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, were able to answer my \nrequest positively to increase funding by $7 million for the Housing \nOpportunities for People With AIDS program in the VA-HUD and \nIndependent Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. This \nmoney is crucial as people living with AIDS have a fundamental need for \nadequate and safe housing. I will continue to work with all of my \ncolleagues to keep the HOPWA program sufficiently funded.\n\n  Great work remains to be done on HIV prevention. We are lacking in \nour commitment to adequately fund the Centers for Disease Control in \ntheir anti-HIV efforts. Until a cure is found, we must ensure that the \nfederal government issues information widely which is accurate, blunt \nand unequivocal. Prevention efforts work, Mr. President. I have seen \nthe work of the AIDS Action Committee in Boston and I can tell you that \ntheir innovative programs are working to slow the spread of AIDS. \nUnlike the increase in funding which the National Institutes of Health \nhas received, the CDC's prevention efforts have remained at roughly the \nsame level in the past few years. It was my hope that the appropriators \nwould have recognized the unmet needs related to HIV prevention in this \ncountry and it is my fear that the failure to keep pace with that need \nportends a disaster.\n  For example, in this legislation as in other legislation this year, \nwe again were subjected to the perennial ill-informed debate on the \nissue of needle exchange. I am dismayed that the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill will include language which deprives the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services from using her discretion based on science \nand empirical academic study to determine if needle exchange programs \nreduce the transmission of HIV without encouraging illicit drug abuse. \nThis is bad public policy, when Senators act like scientists, and it is \nbad health policy. It is my hope that the conferees on this bill will \nrestore the Secretary's discretion.\n  Great work remains to be done in combating AIDS abroad. We are a \nfailure in our policy toward Africa. Our international efforts need to \nbe bolstered to assist developing countries crippled by the effects of \nHIV disease. My distinguished colleague and friend from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, has been stalwart in raising the funding levels to fight \nAIDS abroad in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill and the \nCongress needs to follow his guidance by continuing to increase these \nlevels. In addition, tomorrow I will introduce the Lifesaving Vaccine \nTechnology Act of 1999 to spur research of vaccines to combat diseases \nwhich kill more than one million people every\n\n[[Page S12229]]\n\nyear, and I will have much more to say on this topic at that time.\n  Great work remains to be done for hemophiliacs. There is perhaps no \ngreater neglect by the federal government in responding to the AIDS \nepidemic than the ignoring of our hemophiliac population. On November \n11, 1998 the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Act was signed into law. The \nbill, authored by the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, received \noverwhelming bipartisan support, and I was proud to be an original co-\nsponsor of the bill. When it passed, hemophiliacs felt their thirteen \nyear battle to be compensated for the lapse in regulation of our \nnation's blood supply was over.\n  In the early 1980s, it became apparent that HIV was being improperly \nscreened, and HIV-tainted blood product was being distributed to \npatients across the country. At the time, there were 10,000 Americans \nsuffering with hemophilia, an illness which requires regular infusions \nof blood clotting agents.\n\n  According to the Institute of Medicine's report on HIV and the Blood \nSupply, ``meetings of the FDA's Blood Product Advisory Committee in \nJanuary, February, July and December 1983 offered major opportunities \nto discuss, consider, and reconsider . . . and review new evidence and \nto reconsider earlier decisions, [yet] blood safety policies changed \nvery little during 1983.'' In effect, the report found the FDA was at \nfault for not responding to clear evidence of transmission dangers. As \na result, more than sixty percent of all Americans with hemophilia were \ninfected with HIV through blood products contaminated by the AIDS \nvirus. Currently, more than 5,000 have died and more are dying each \nday. In my office, I have been visited by courageous hemophiliacs and \nwhen they leave, I never know if I will ever see them again. This \npopulation has been decimated, Mr. President, and the personal tragedy \nis unspeakable.\n  We must fully fund the Ricky Ray Relief Act. The Senate version of \nthe Labor-HHS-Education bill appropriates $50 million out of the $750 \nmillion needed to fund the Ricky Ray Trust Fund, and that is certainly \nbetter than the inadequate level of the other body, but it is a far cry \nfrom the level needed by the hemophiliac community. Members of this \ncommunity never anticipated the one-time compensation from the trust \nfund, intended to assist with staggering medical bills and improve the \nquality of their lives, would turn out to be a pay-out to their \nestates.\n  You need only to speak to some of my constituents, like Therese \nMacNeill. She will tell you, as a mom, the hardship she has experienced \nin coping with the tragedy of losing one son to AIDS and caring for \nanother who is HIV-positive. Terri MacNeill will let you know in no \nuncertain terms why we must fully fund Ricky Ray to help families who \nfor years were storing HIV-infected blood product in their family \nrefrigerators next to the lettuce and milk, and now are struggling \nunder mountains of medical bills.\n  Other countries have recognized the plight of hemophiliacs who were \ninfected by poorly screened blood. Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, \nItaly, and Switzerland are just some of the countries which have \nestablished compensation programs. Sixty Senators signed on as co-\nsponsors of the legislation authorizing the establishment of the Ricky \nRay Trust Fund. Now is the time to realize our commitment to the \nhemophiliac population on par with other countries as well as our own \nactions in authorizing the bill. I hope that when the appropriations \nconference committee meets on this bill, the funding levels for the \nRicky Ray act are raised substantially.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I am heartened by the \nresponse of my friends, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, and the able Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, in \ncrafting this legislation. They have risen to an incredible challenge \nin the funding of programs designed for AIDS care, research and \ntreatment, and I remain committed to work with them during this year \nand next to finish some of the great work that remains to be done, \nespecially in regard to HIV prevention programs and the Ricky Ray Trust \nFund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12229-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, a couple of days ago on \nthe Senate floor, one of my colleagues, Senator Leahy from Vermont, \nmade some remarks regarding the possible motives of some of us who made \na vote on a particular nominee, Ronnie White of Missouri to the Federal \ncourt. I want to read from the Senate manual what we all know as rule \nXVIIII. I want to indicate before reading that I do not believe Senator \nLeahy violated that rule. That is not the purpose of bringing this up.\n  The rule says:\n\n       No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any \n     form of words impute to another Senator or to other \n     Senators--\n\n  Plural--\n\n     any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming of a Senator.\n\n  That rule is very clear, and it is not very often throughout the \nhistory of the Senate that rule has been violated.\n  I want to quote what Senator Leahy said on October 5 on the Senate \nfloor after the vote on Ronnie White. He said:\n\n       Mr. President, I have to say this with my colleagues \n     present. When the full history of Senate treatment of the \n     nomination of Justice Ronnie White is understood, when the \n     switches and politics that drove the Republican side of the \n     aisle are known, the people of Missouri and the people of the \n     United States will have to judge whether the Senate was \n     unfair to this fine man and whether their votes served the \n     interests of justice and the Federal courts.\n\n  Then the Senator from Vermont concluded by saying:\n\n       I am hoping--and every Senator will have to ask himself or \n     herself this question--the United States has not reverted to \n     a time in its history when there was a color test on \n     nominations.\n\n  The reason why I say rule XVIIII was not violated in that case, I \nbelieve, although the Senator from Vermont may have walked up to the \nline--he did not cross it--is because he said ``I am hoping.'' I, \ntherefore, will not make any contest at this point on that.\n  It concerned me deeply that those comments were made. I want to say \nfor the record, and it is interesting because I spoke to at least a \ndozen colleagues who voted the same way I did, in opposition to this \nnominee--not that it matters--who did not even know what race Mr. White \nwas. I didn't know. I had no idea, and I had numerous conversations \nabout this nominee over the course of several weeks and months, as his \nnomination was pending. I never knew what his race was nor would I care \nbecause I wouldn't want to look, frankly. What difference does it make? \nIt doesn't make any difference to me.\n  This went further than the Senate floor, which is quite disturbing. \nIn the Washington Post today is in an article, ``Deepening Rift Over \nJudge Vote, Minorities Confirmed At a Lower Rate.'' That was the \nWashington Post story. Very prominently pictured in the article is a \npicture of Ronnie White, and in addition, Senators Ashcroft and Bond. \nThere is an implication there that I don't like.\n\n[[Page S12230]]\n\n  In the article, we have Governor Mel Carnahan, who happens to be the \nopponent of Senator Ashcroft in the election in Missouri for the \nSenate, who said:\n\n       ``Judge White is a highly qualified lawyer and judge and \n     the [death penalty] figures were manipulated by Senator \n     Ashcroft to undermine him,'' Carnahan said.\n\n  Then it got a little worse from the Chief Executive of the United \nStates of America. I want to point out, if President Bill Clinton were \nSenator Bill Clinton, and he said what I am about to read, in my view, \nhe would have violated rule XVIIII. That is why I bring it up. Here is \nwhat the President said about all of us who voted against Mr. White's \nnomination:\n       Yesterday's defeat of Ronnie White's nomination for the \n     federal district court judgeship in Missouri was a \n     disgraceful act of partisan politics. The Republican-\n     controlled Senate is adding credence to the perception that \n     they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and \n     unequally.\n\n  That basically is a direct attack on all of us and our motives, \nbasically accusing us of being--the implication is that we are racists, \nthat we do not treat minorities fairly, and that we discriminate \nagainst women as well.\n  That came from the President of the United States.\n  I will also quote from an article in the Washington Times today in \nrelation to J.C. Watts, the most prominent African American Republican \nin the Congress of the United States, who was also deeply offended, as \nhe should have been, by these remarks. It is interesting what Chairman \nWatts of the House Republican Conference said. This is J.C. Watts \ntalking:\n\n       ``It is fascinating to me that racism often is defined, not \n     by your skin color, but by your ideology,'' said Mr. Watts, \n     the lone black Republican in the House, in a luncheon with \n     editors and reporters at The Washington Times.\n\n  He said further:\n\n       Unless you're a Democrat. It's OK to do it to black \n     Republicans, black conservatives. But don't do it to a black \n     Democrat.\n\n  Then it is racial.\n  It really is troublesome to me that we create these barriers between \nus.\n  President Clinton said:\n\n       [By voting down] the first African American judge to serve \n     on the Missouri State Supreme Court, the Republican-\n     controlled Senate is adding credence to the perceptions that \n     they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and \n     unequally.\n\n  But anyway, it is troubling to me that these kinds of things happen. \nI voted against the nominee because of his views on some issues. I \nspoke to this on the Senate floor on the same day. I am quoting myself \nnow:\n\n       In the case of Justice White, who now serves on the Supreme \n     Court in Missouri, he has demonstrated that he is an \n     activist, and has a political slant to his opinions in favor \n     of criminal defendants and against prosecutors. It is my \n     belief that judges should interpret the law, and not impose \n     their own political viewpoints.\n\n  That is why I voted against Ronnie White.\n  Prominent law enforcement people in Missouri were also opposed to \nhim, and said so, as Senator Ashcroft made very clear.\n  It is troubling to me that this issue raises its ugly head when \nsomebody happens to be African American. I thought really we would get \nbeyond this. It would have been nice if the President of the United \nStates had said: Ninety-two percent of the minority nominations that \nhave come through this Senate have been confirmed, most of them \nunanimously without even a recorded vote. It would have been nice if \nthe President said that was pretty good on the part of this Senate, \ninstead of singling out one who had not been confirmed for, I believe, \ngood reason.\n  One of the things you find out in the Senate, if you stay here long \nenough, is that you probably have said something somewhere along the \nline you would like to take back. I am going to say up front regarding \nmy colleague from Vermont, I do not impugn his motives, but it is \ninteresting that Senator Leahy did not vote to confirm Clarence Thomas. \nHe voted against Clarence Thomas, a very prominent member of the \nSupreme Court who happens to be African American--a man I was proud to \nsupport. I did not hear the President mention any of us who voted for \nClarence Thomas, an African American. The reason is very simple: \nClarence Thomas is a conservative. That is the reason.\n  I would never impugn my colleague's motives for voting against \nClarence Thomas. I assume he voted against Clarence Thomas because he \nwas a conservative, he did not like his politics, did not like his \nviews on abortion and other issues. I believe that.\n  I say, without any hesitation, if my colleague were here on the floor \nnow, I would look at him and say: Absolutely, I believe you, that that \nis your motive, and no other motive.\n  There was also another vote in 1989 in committee, for a gentleman by \nthe name of William Lucas. Lucas was President Bush's pick for \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. He happens to be African \nAmerican. Lucas's nomination never got to the Senate floor. The vote in \nJudiciary was 7-7. The Senator from Vermont voted no. Again, I would \nnever use the issue of race to say that was the reason for his vote. I \nwould not even imply it.\n  So I think it is important that we move beyond this, stop this \ndivisiveness, and give people the benefit of the doubt, and \nparticularly Senator Hatch who so many times has brought nominees whom \nyou and I--I would say to the Senator in the Chair, I myself have often \ndisagreed with Senator Hatch on some of the nominations he has brought, \nbut he has brought them forth I think probably more fairly than he \nshould have in terms of the nominations he brings forth.\n\n  So to throw that blanket over 54 individuals who voted the way they \ndid, or even to imply it, is unfortunate.\n  So I say, to set the record straight, I am going to vote against a \nperson who I think is an activist, who does not represent the views \nthat I believe should be on the court, no matter what the color, and, \nmost frankly, without knowing the color if I can help it because I do \nnot think it matters. It is unfortunate in this case that we came to \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I want to touch on one other issue before we close up \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12230-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12230-S12232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PANAMA CANAL\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. A few days ago, on October 4, I indicated \nthat there were 88 days until the Panama Canal would be turned over to \nthe Chinese--to the Panamanians and ultimately into the hands of the \nChinese Communists. That was October 4.\n  Today is the 7th, so we have 87, 86, 85--we are down to 85 days \nbefore the canal is closed, will be turned over to the Chinese. I have \na chart here on which I will put some stickers to cross those days off. \nThe days go fast. I point out that we are going to see this canal in \nthe hands of a nation that does not have positive feelings toward the \nUnited States--to put it as nicely as I can. So this is the flag of \nCommunist China. So now 3 more days have gone by.\n  I recently addressed this issue of Panama and the impending turnover \non October 4, a few days ago. Again, 3 more days have passed. The \ncountdown continues. On December 31, this canal leaves the control of \nthe United States and will come into the hands of the Chinese \nCommunists.\n  In his book, ``The Path Between the Seas,'' David McCullough's \nhistory of the canal reminds us of its historic importance:\n\n       The creation of the Panama Canal was far more than a vast, \n     unprecedented feat of engineering. It was a profoundly \n     important historic event and a sweeping human drama not \n     unlike that of war. . . .\n       Great reputations were made and destroyed. For numbers of \n     men and women, it was the venture of a lifetime. . . . \n     Because of it, one nation, France, was rocked to its \n     foundations. Another, Colombia, lost its most prized \n     possession, the Isthmus of Panama. . . .The Republic of \n     Panama was born. The United States was embarked on a role of \n     global involvement.\n\n  So while the United States has no assurances it may remain in Panama \nafter December 31, despite overwhelming public opinion in Panama in \nsupport of a continued U.S. presence-- we are going to be leaving--the \nChinese firm of Hutchison Whampoa will be there in the ports of \nCristobal and Balboa on both sides of the canal, having won, through \nwhat was widely regarded as a corrupt bidding practice, the right to \nlease the ports for 25 years and beyond. Both sides of the canal will \nnow be in the control of the Chinese.\n\n  After the United States withdraws from Panama, December 31, there is \nno doubt that a security vacuum will be\n\n[[Page S12231]]\n\ncreated. Who is going to fill it? We have less than 3 months, 85 days, \na very short window of time to try to work out a solution that is \nmutually acceptable to us and to the Panamanians.\n  Let us look at the status of the transition. What bothers me is that \nthis administration is doing nothing to try to renegotiate those leases \nor to somehow talk with the Panamanians to try to get us to remain \nthere. To date, we have transferred to the Government of Panama 57,000 \nacres--remember, we spent $32 billion building that canal--57,000 acres \nand 3,000 buildings controlled by our military, including schools, \nhospitals, houses, airports, seaports, roads, and bridges. It \nrepresents about 62 percent of the total property.\n  As of July 1 of this year, U.S. troop strength was down from 10,000 \nin February 1994 to a little over 1,200, so we are just about finished. \nAll U.S. presence on the Atlantic side was terminated on 30 June with \nthe transfer of Fort Sherman and Pina Range. The remaining 36,000 acres \nand 1,900 facilities will be transferred to the Government of Panama as \nfollows: On the 28th of July, the Empire Range for the Army and the \nBalboa West Range for the Air Force will go. On the 13th of August, the \nU.S. Army mortuary--these are what has already happened--on the 17th of \nAugust, the Curundu Middle School; on the 1st of November, Fort Kobbe, \nHoward Air Force base, Farfan housing and radio site will go; Curundu \nLaundry; Fort Clayton, West and East Corozal; Building 1501, Balboa, \nand Ancon Hill communications site; and on December 31, the grand \nenchilada, the big prize, the Panama Canal itself, gone, without a \nwhimper.\n  It troubles me this issue has not even entered the Presidential \ndebate in this country. There is no one at the State Department or in \nthe Defense Department or in the White House talking to the Panamanians \nabout reopening the bidding process or renegotiating leases to try to \nget in there ahead of the Chinese company. As if to rub it in, to rub \nsalt in the wound even more, the actual turnover is going to take place \non December 10. Perhaps they advanced the date so it wouldn't interfere \nwith our Christmas or New Year's Eve parties or maybe they were afraid \nof Y2K. Maybe they were afraid we would get stuck there.\n  The bottom line is, on December 10 we will turn it over, which is \nabout 21 days earlier than we should. So I want to elaborate, again, on \nthe significance of the canal to seapower, to our Navy, and to the \nimportance of preserving both the spirit and the letter of the \nneutrality treaty.\n  I will now discuss the background of a controversial law in Panama \nknown as Law 5.\n  President Teddy Roosevelt was a reader and admirer of Alfred Thayer \nMahan, a gentleman regarded by many as the father of the modern \nAmerican Navy. Mahan's book, ``The Influence of Sea Power,'' had a \nprofound impact on Theodore Roosevelt. Mahan traced the rise and \ndecline of past maritime powers and concluded that supremacy at sea \ntranslated into national greatness and commercial success. We are \nessentially an island or, more specifically, a peninsula nation. The \nNavy is very important to us.\n  Roosevelt, whose first published work was ``The Naval War of 1812,'' \nhad read Mahan's book and understood its importance. It prompted him to \nbe a strong advocate of constructing the canal, to be sure the United \nStates would have easy access through the isthmus of Panama and into \nthe Pacific from the Atlantic and vice versa.\n  In World War II, damage to the canal could have and would have \ndelayed the buildup of our war efforts in the Pacific big time. I can't \nimagine what it would be like to not have been able to use the canal. \nIt would have delayed the flow of supplies to Great Britain, the Soviet \nUnion, the dispatch of essential war materials from South America to \nthe United States, and on and on.\n  I am concerned that some officials in Panama might be somewhat naive \nabout the canal's security and about world history. In June, the then \nPanamanian Foreign Minister disagreed sharply with General Wilhelm, \nhead of SOUTHCOM, who had testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee that Panamanian security forces were undermanned and ill \nequipped to deal with growing threats from Colombian guerrilla \nincursions and drug traffickers. Panama's Foreign Minister at that \ntime, Jorge Ritter, said the general's statements were inadmissible and \nargued that ``never have the U.S. military forces been here to guard \nour borders, and they have even less to do with the security of Panama, \nnor do they have anything to do with the security of the canal.''\n  Even more surprisingly, the Foreign Minister alleged that the growth \nof drugs in Panama did not begin with withdrawal of U.S. troops but, \ninstead, grew while there were military bases in Panama.\n\n  Perhaps this gentleman, with all due respect, has forgotten what \nhappened in 1989. During questioning before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Adm. Thomas Moorer, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, was asked if the 1977 treaty had been more helpful or \nmore harmful to U.S. interests. Moorer's immediate response was that 26 \nsoldiers had died in Operation Just Cause in 1989. Among the reasons \nfor the military intervention--to thwart drug trafficking, to preserve \ndemocracy in Panama, and to defend the canal--26 Americans gave their \nlives. To have Mr. Ritter make those kinds of statements is outrageous.\n  Part of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing testimony \nincludes some interesting commentary on the background of Mr. Ritter. \nHe was the president of the Panama Canal Authority. He was also the \nchief Panamanian negotiator who reportedly torpedoed the base talks in \nPanama. He was tied by the Panamanian press and outside press to the \nhighest levels of drug cartels and served as Panama's ambassador to \nColombia during the time that Manuel Noriega was doing business with \nthe drug cartels in Colombia. He was Noriega's point man, bottom line.\n  It was also reported to the press that Ritter had issued a Panamanian \nID card for Jorge Escobar, which was found on him when he died in \nColombia in a shoot-out with law enforcement. I am not surprised that \nMr. Ritter downplayed the importance of the canal and U.S. military \nbase rights. It doesn't surprise me at all.\n  Hopefully, with the recent inauguration of President Moscoso, that \nattitude, as expressed by the former Foreign Minister, has changed. I \nhope it has. I am told that the new Panamanian President was planning \nto visit but, for whatever reason, I am not sure, canceled her trip. I \nhad hoped to have the opportunity to meet with her. Hopefully, we will \nbe able to do that at some point in the future.\n  I have been informed that, unlike her predecessor, President Moscoso \nwould like to do business with the United States and would like to be \nabove board with the negotiations. I wish her much success. I hope she \nrealizes how important her actions are. It would be nice if some in the \nState Department and the administration would talk with her and \nencourage her in the next few weeks and months.\n  I also hope that it is not too late for her to weigh in on the \ndecision about the leases at Cristobal and Balboa. I realize that would \ntake a lot of political courage for her, but I hope she will give a \nthorough review of the bidding process, its known irregularities, and \nits compliance with both the spirit and the letter of the canal and \nneutrality treaty.\n  In conclusion, this Law 5 reportedly does the following: It gives \nresponsibility for hiring new pilots for the canal who control the \nships passing through the canal. It gives Hutchison Whampoa, the \nChinese company, the right to possess Rodman Naval Station when it \nreverts to Panama this year. It gives the authority to control the \norder of ships utilizing the entrance to the canal and to deny ships \naccess to the ports and entrances of the canal, if they are deemed to \nbe interfering with Hutchinson's business operations. Contrast this \nwith the explicit grant of expeditious passage in the 1977 treaty, \nwhich the Panama Canal treaty gave to the U.S. Navy.\n  Now we are seeing the Chinese Communists--and there are thousands of \nChinese now in Panama. People say: Well, it is private business. There \nis no private business in China. It is all controlled by the \ngovernment, whatever they do. So this is government business in China. \nIt is Chinese Communist government in Panama by the Chinese. Law 5 \ngives the right to transfer unilaterally its rights to a third party to\n\n[[Page S12232]]\n\nany company or any country they select. This ought to be troublesome, \nand yet it is not even on the radar screen in the political debates \naround our country today.\n  Certain public roads could become private in a hurry, which could \nimpact canal access.\n  This Hutchison Whampoa deal includes U.S. Naval Station Rodman, as \nmentioned previously; U.S. Air Station Albrook; Diablo; Balboa, a \nPacific U.S.-built port; Cristobal, an Atlantic U.S.-built port; the \nisland of Telfers, strategically located adjacent to Galeto Island, a \ncritical communications center.\n  Telfers Island is said to be the future home of a Chinese work in \nprogress, an export zone, called the ``Great Wall of China'' project.\n  I cannot understand how we can ignore this presence into the Western \nHemisphere. Monroe would turn over in his grave. The Monroe Doctrine \nsaid that foreign European nations, and other nations around the world, \nshould stay out of the Western Hemisphere. Yet, here they are.\n  Law 5 is subservient to the 1977 treaty. But if we fail to notice the \ndiscrepancies and fail to act upon those discrepancies, or to point out \nthere are potential compliance problems, then we lose the opportunity \nto respond.\n  As I said before, I don't have the easel here now, but it's 84 more \ndays. We will come back next week, and I will come back with the chart \nand it will be 79 days, or whatever it happens to be. But as each day \nticks off, another day goes by--another day we haven't talked to \nPresident Moscoso and we haven't tried to reopen the negotiations, and \nwe are another day closer to turning the Panama Canal not over to the \nPanamanians, but to the Chinese Communists--and not a whimper from \nanybody in the State Department, or the President, the Defense \nDepartment, Presidential campaigns, or anywhere. So the days are \ngetting short. I think that I have an obligation to tell the American \npeople, on a day-to-day basis--remind them--about what is going on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12232-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on October 7, 1999, he had \npresented to the President of the United States, the following enrolled \nbill:\n\n       S. 559.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \nland exchanges to acquire from the private owner and to convey to the \nState of Idaho approximately 1,240 acres of land near the City of Rocks \nNational Reserve, Idaho, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          castle rock ranch/hagerman fossil beds land exchange\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nauthorize the Castle Rocks Ranch/Hagerman Fossil Beds Land Exchange in \nmy home state of Idaho.\n  Mr. President, in Idaho we have one of the foremost rock climbing \ndestination sites in the world. It is called the City of Rocks National \nReserve and is located in South Central Idaho. Most of the Reserve is \nowned by the National Park Service with parts of it being owned by the \nState of Idaho, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and \nprivate landowners. The State of Idaho runs the Reserve with a \ncooperative agreement with the National Park Service.\n  The Reserve has unique geologic features--essentially, large rock \nformations jut out of the ground. I can't give it justice with my \ndescription--it is really something that must be seen, so I invite \neveryone to come to Idaho and visit the City of Rocks. Besides the rock \nformations, many of which are used extensively and known \ninternationally for rock climbing, the site has unique historic \nsignificance. The California Trail, one of the major trails for \nWestward expansion during the 19th Century, passes through the Reserve. \nOne of the Reserve's major attractions, Twin Sisters, was a landmark \nfor this trail and is currently being protected for historic \nsignificance. Additionally, wagon trains often stopped in the area to \nmaintain their wagons. During these stops, pioneers wrote their names \non the rocks with wagon grease. Many of these names are still visible \non the rocks today and serve as a record of our ancestors who passed \nthrough the area.\n  Near the Reserve exists the Castle Rock Ranch, an approximately 1,240 \nacre ranch containing similar rock formations, which are ideal for fork \nclimbing. Additionally, the Ranch contains irrigated pasture land. The \nRanch was recently purchased by The Conservation Fund and other \nconservation groups in order to put it into the public domain for \nrecreation. It is currently being operated as a working ranch. However, \nthe State of Idaho would like to acquire this Ranch to make it into a \nstate park. They would open up the rock formations for rock climbing, \nprovide for camping and hiking, and, where irrigated pasture land \nexists, trade that irrigated land for dry land inholdings within the \nReserve. This would help local ranchers acquire irrigated land, which \nis more valuable than gold in Southern Idaho, and allow the state to \nconsolidate inholdings within the Reserve.\n  A couple of counties to the West and across the mighty Snake River \nexists the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument. This National \nMonument contains the Hagerman Fossil Beds, which is important because \nit contains the world's most important fossil deposits from a time \nperiod known as the late Pliocene epoch, 3.5 million years ago. They \nrepresent the last glimpse of time before the Ice Age. Additionally, \nthe beds contain the largest concentration of Hagerman Horse fossils in \nNorth America. While the State of Idaho owns the actual fossil beds, \nthe National Park Service runs and maintains the facility.\n  The State of Idaho wants to divest its interest in the fossil beds \nand acquire the Castle Rock Ranch. Additionally, the National Park \nService wants to acquire the Fossil Beds. This would make it easier for \neveryone to work to protect the resources we have and open up \nopportunities for recreation. Consequently, I am introducing this \nlegislation.\n  In brief, the legislation would authorize the National Park Service \nto acquire the Castle Rock Ranch, exchange the Ranch with the State of \nIdaho for the Hagerman Fossil Beds, and mandate that the State exchange \nland within the Ranch for inholdings within the City of Rocks. In the \nend, the National Park Service would run and own the Hagerman Fossil \nBeds, the State of Idaho would own and run a state park in part of the \nCastle Rock Ranch, and voluntary inholders in the\n\n[[Page S12235]]\n\nCity of Rocks would be able to trade their inholdings for irrigated \nland on the Castle Rock Ranch.\n\n  The only concern I have is the existence of an easement on the \nHagerman Fossil Beds for the local irrigation company. This is the only \nway for farmers in the local area to get water to their farms--a \nnecessity in that region. Section 4(e) of this legislation was included \nto ensure that this easement will continue to exist. It is vital to the \nexistence of family farms in the area, and, for the record, it is not \nmy intent to harm--and I will do all in my power to prevent this \nlegislation from harming--this easement or the irrigation in the local \narea.\n  Mr. President, this is a unique proposal that makes fiscal sense for \ntaxpayers and has garnered the support of the National Park Service, \nthe State of Idaho, The Conservation Fund, The Access Fund (a national \nclimbing group), other conservation groups, local legislators, and many \nlocal residents. I hope that my colleagues will recognize the \nimportance of this legislation and work for its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Mr. Robb, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Grams, and \n        Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1708. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require plans which \nadopt amendments that significantly reduce future benefit accruals to \nprovide participants with adequate notice of the changes made by such \namendments; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the pension reduction disclosure act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by Senators \nJeffords, Leahy, Grams, Kerrey, Robb, Rockefeller, and Sarbanes, to \nintroduce legislation to provide greater disclosure of the impact of \npension plan conversions.\n  This is the second bill I have sponsored this session aimed at \nachieving transparency of the effects of traditional pension plan \nconversions to ``cash balance'' plans, which have become extremely \ncontroversial in recent months. At least 300 large U.S. companies have \nconverted to cash balance plans in the last few years.\n  Cash balance plans combine certain features of ``defined benefit'' \nand ``defined contribution'' plans. Like defined contribution plans, \ncash balance plans provide each employee with an individual account \nrepresenting a lump-sum benefit. Like traditional defined benefit \nplans, cash balance plan contributions are made primarily by the \nemployer and are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  The calculation of benefits under cash balance plans, however, \ndiffers from other defined benefit plans. Whereas a traditional defined \nbenefit plan grows slowly in the early years and more rapidly as one \napproaches retirement, cash balance plans de-accelerate this later-year \ngrowth and increase the early-year growth. Consequently, younger \nemployees tend to do better under cash balance plans than under \ntraditional plans, while older employees typically do worse. In some \ncases, an older worker's starting account balance may remain static for \nyears--typically referred to as the ``wear away'' period.\n  The controversy over cash balance plans arises in part because \npresent disclosure requirements are inadequate. Under present law, when \nan employer amends a defined benefit pension plan in a manner which \nsignificantly reduces the rate of future benefit accrual, the employer \nmust provide participants with an advance written notice of the \namendment. The law does not, however, require employers to disclose the \neffect the amendment will have on participants. In fact, it does not \neven require employers to disclose that benefits will be reduced. All \nthat present law requires is that employers provide participants with a \nsummary or copy of the plan amendment. Consequently, current law can be \nsatisfied with a summary buried in an obscure document. In some cases, \nworkers have complained that their employers purposefully obscured \nbenefit reductions. As a result, employee anger over cash balance plans \nhas grown, resulting in several class action lawsuits being filed in \njust the last three years.\n  The Pension Reduction Disclosure Act will strengthen existing law by \nrequiring disclosure of information which will enable employees to \ndetermine the effects of benefit reductions. Specifically, before the \nplan is changed, each adversely-affected employee must receive \nillustrative examples showing the effects of the change on various \nemployee groups. Moreover, each employee must have the opportunity to \nreceive the benefit formulas for the old and new versions of the plan \nso that he or she can make specific comparisons of both plans. Then, 90 \ndays after the plan is changed, each adversely-affected employee must \nhave, upon request, the opportunity to receive an individual benefit \ncomparison prepared by the employer. This information will provide \nemployees with the knowledge they need regarding pension benefit \nreductions, while imposing minimal burden on employers.\n  The Pension Reduction Disclosure Act, is a modified version of \nlegislation I introduced in March entitled The Pension Right to Know \nAct (S. 659). The new measure attempts to address concerns raised by \nemployers concerning S. 659. For example, the new measure requires \ndisclosure only for adversely-affected employees, not all employees, in \norder to meet employer concerns that S. 659 was too broad in its reach. \nMoreover, the new bill addresses employer concerns that it would be \ndifficult to provide individual benefit comparisons before the \namendment effective date due to a lack of individual data. Under the \nbill introduced today, individual benefit comparisons would be required \nno earlier than 90 days after the effective date, and then only upon \nrequest. (To enable employees to compare the old and new plans before \nthe effective date, this bill provides illustrative examples and, upon \nrequest, the benefit formulas for the old and new plans.) Another \nchange is that the new bill allows the Secretary of Treasury to develop \nalternative and simplified compliance methods where appropriate, as in \ncases where there is no fundamental change in the manner in which \nbenefits are determined. Moreover, the Secretary may reduce the advance \nnotice period from 45 days to 15 days in cases in which the 45-day \nrequirement would be unduly burdensome because the amendment is \ncontingent on a merger, acquisition, disposition or other similar \ntransaction.\n\n  I believe that such disclosure not only is in the best interest of \nemployees, but also of the employer. Several class action lawsuits have \nbeen filed in the last three years challenging conversions to cash \nbalance plans. These suits will likely cost millions of dollars in \nattorneys' fees, but with proper disclosure they might not have \noccurred.\n  I want to acknowledge the work of the Clinton Administration in \nhelping to craft this measure. The bill largely follows the outline of \na proposal suggested by the Administration in July which was developed \nin collaboration with my staff. The Departments of Treasury and Labor \nhave provided great insight and creativity in developing this bill, and \nI thank them for their assistance. Two of our distinguished House \ncolleagues, Congressman Robert Matsui of California and Congressman \nJerry Weller of Illinois, are introducing this legislation in the other \nchamber, so hopefully it will become law this year.\n  In closing, let me repeat what I have said in the past. I take no \nposition on the underlying merit of cash balance plans. Ours is a \nvoluntary pension system, and companies must do what is right for them \nand their employees. But I feel strongly that companies must fully and \ncomprehensibly inform their employees regarding whatever pension \nbenefits the company offers. Companies have no right to misrepresent or \nobfuscate the projected benefit employees will receive under a cash \nbalance plan or any other pension arrangement, notwithstanding the fact \nthat some pension consultants have advocated cash balance plans for \nthat very purpose.\n  As I said upon introduction of my earlier legislation on this topic, \nit is time to let the sun shine on pension plan conversions. I urge the \nSenate to support this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy and summary of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12236]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The law does not, however, require employers to \n     disclose the effect the amendment will have on participants.\n\n\n     summary of provisions of the pension reduction disclosure act\n\n       Notice Requirements for Pension Plan Amendments Reducing \n     Future Benefit Accruals.--At least 45 days before the \n     effective date of a pension plan amendment that reduces the \n     rate of future benefit accruals, employees adversely affected \n     by the amendment must receive notice of a reduction, as \n     described below.\n       Basic Notice.--Pension plans with fewer than 100 \n     participants must provide a basic written notice including: \n     the effective date of the amendment; a statement that the \n     amendment is expected to significantly reduce the rate of \n     future benefit accrual; a description of the classes of \n     applicable individuals to whom the amendment applies; and a \n     description of how the amendment significantly reduces the \n     rate of future benefit accrual.\n       Enhanced Notice.--Pension plans with 100 or more \n     participants must provide the following information in \n     addition to the basic written notice.\n       A description of the plan's benefit formulas before and \n     after the amendments, and an explanation of the effects of \n     the different formulas on participants;\n       An explanation of the circumstances under which any \n     ``wearaway'' or other temporary suspension of benefit \n     accruals may occur;\n       Illustrative examples showing the adverse effects of the \n     plan amendment by comparing expected benefit accruals for \n     various categories of participants (e.g., participants of \n     similar age and years of service) under the old and new \n     versions of the plan.\n       Alternative methods of compliance with enhanced notice in \n     certain cases. The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe \n     alternative or simplified methods of compliance with the \n     enhanced notice requirements in situations where there is no \n     fundamental change in the manner in which benefits are \n     determined (e.g., where the benefit formula is reduced from \n     1.25 percent of compensation to 1.0 percent of compensation). \n     The Secretary may also reduce the advance notice period from \n     45 days to 15 days for cases in which compliance with the 45-\n     day requirement would be unduly burdensome because the \n     amendment is contingent on a merger, acquisition, \n     disposition, or other similar transaction or because 45 days \n     advance notice is otherwise impracticable.\n       In the case of plans with 100 or more participants, the \n     plan must provide adversely-affected participants, within 15 \n     days of request, the specific benefit formulas and actuarial \n     factors used in the preparation of the illustrative examples. \n     The information must be sufficient to confirm the benefit \n     comparisons provided in the illustrative examples and to \n     enable participants to make calculations of their own \n     benefits under the old and new versions of the plan that are \n     similar to the calculations made in the examples.\n       Individual Benefit Statements.--In the case of plans with \n     100 or more participants, an adversely-affected participant \n     may request and receive an individual benefit statement \n     providing information which is substantially the same as the \n     information in the illustrative examples described above, but \n     which is based on data specific to the requesting individual. \n     If the individual so requests, the individual statement must \n     reflect one other future date not included in the examples. \n     As with current law regarding accrued benefit calculations, \n     individual statements must be provided within 30 days of \n     request. The earliest required date for providing individual \n     statements shall be 90 days after the amendment effective \n     date.\n\n\n                      sanctions for noncompliance\n\n       Egregious Failure to Supply Notice.--Employers failing to \n     provide most of the required notice information to most \n     affected participants, or intentionally failing to provide \n     notice information to any affected participant, shall provide \n     the greater of the benefits available under the old and new \n     versions of the plan and shall also be subject to an excise \n     tax of $100 per day for every day of the noncompliance \n     period.\n       Nonegregious Failure to Supply Notice.--Employers failing \n     to provide the required notice information, but not in the \n     egregious manner described above, shall be subject to an \n     excise tax of $100 per day for every day of the noncompliance \n     period.\n       Maximum Excise Tax Where Failure Due to Reasonable Cause.--\n     In a case where the failure was due to reasonable cause and \n     not willful neglect, the excise tax is limited to $1 million \n     for plans with 100 or more participants and $500,000 for \n     plans with fewer than 100 participants.\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nMoynihan, Leahy, Robb, Kerrey, Rockefeller and Grams of Minnesota in \nthe introduction of the Pension Reduction Disclosure Act. This bill \ngreatly expands current law and will provide improved disclosure of the \nimpact of the conversion of a traditional defined benefit pension plan \nto a cash balance or other hybrid pension plan. We believe that current \nlaw protections are insufficient to protect the interests of plan \nparticipants. The Pension Reduction Disclosure Act is an important \nfirst step in improving worker pension protections. I am also pleased \nthat the President supports this bill.\n  Appropriate disclosure for cash balance pension plans is a serious \npublic policy issue affecting the retirement benefits of millions of \nAmericans. At a minimum, employees should have meaningful notice when \ntheir employer plans to reduce pension benefits in the switch from a \ntraditional to a cash balance plan.\n  This bill does that.\n  First, employers have not always been candid with employees about \nwhat the changes in pension plans will mean for the employee's \nretirement. Our bill will require that they spell it out in black and \nwhite, and do so in language that anyone who is not an actuary or tax \nattorney can understand.\n  Second, plan sponsors will have to provide this information in a \ntimely manner, so that employees can engage their employer and seek \nchanges if they choose to do so. As we have seen at IBM and elsewhere, \ncompanies can misjudge the impact of these changes on their workforce.\n  Third, plan sponsors will be required to provide their employees with \nspecifics about the effect that the change will have on their \nretirement benefits so that individuals can understand the financial \nimpact that the conversion will have on their pension. Once we pass \nthis bill, my guess is that employers will think long and hard about \nwhat changes they want to make to their pension plans.\n  Long-serving, loyal employees should not wake up to find their \npension benefits slashed without even the chance to confront their \nemployer. We can't expect people to save for retirement if the sand is \nforever shifting under their feet.\n  This bill addresses but one part of the conversion issue. But I think \nit deserves widespread bipartisan support. I believe that there are \nmore issues at stake for workers, such as my own concerns regarding the \npension benefit\n\n[[Page S12239]]\n\n``wear away''. However, the Pension Reduction Disclosure Act is a good \nfirst step we ought to take to address the legitimate concerns that \nhave been raised about these plans.\n  We don't have a lot of time, but I hope we can send this bill to the \nPresident for his signature before we adjourn this fall.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Moynihan and \nSenator Jeffords as a cosponsor of the Pension Reduction Disclosure Act \nof 1999. I believe this bill is a good first step to providing American \nworkers with the information they deserve to know about changes to \ntheir pensions. President Clinton has endorsed our legislation and is \nready to sign it into law.\n  As the controversy surrounding IBM's decision to convert its \ntraditional pension plan to a cash balance plan taught many Vermonters, \nCongress needs to revise our laws to require greater disclosure of \npension changes. When IBM first announced its pension switch, many \nVermont IBMers told me that they did not have enough information to \njudge the new plan's impact on their pensions. They discovered that \ncurrent Federal law does not even require an employer to explain to its \nemployees how any future pension benefits will be reduced. This is not \nright.\n  Unfortunately, Vermont IBMers are not alone. At least 325 companies, \nwith more than $330 billion in pension-defined benefit assets, have \nadopted cash-balance plans in recent years. This phenomenon is the \nbiggest development in the pension world in years. But, as we all know \nnow thanks to the tireless efforts of IBMers in Vermont and elsewhere, \nthere is a dark side to this corporate trend: the fact that many \nexperienced workers face deep cuts in their promised pensions when \ntheir company switches to a cash-balance plan.\n  The Pension Reduction Disclosure Act would require all employers, \nregardless of the size of their pension plan, to notify their employees \nof pension plan changes that would reduce the future benefit accrual \nrate at least 45 days in advance of the change. In addition, this \nlegislation would require employers to explain any differences in \nfuture accrual rates between the old and new plan in a clear and \nmeaningful fashion, by providing employees with detailed examples \nshowing the difference between the old and new plans.\n  This bill complements the Pension Right to Know Act, which Senator \nMoynihan and I introduced earlier in the year. Our earlier bill would \nrequire employers to provide employees with individualized comparisons \nof future benefits under the old and new plans 15 days prior to the \nconversion for pension plans covering 1000 or more employees. Our \nlegislation today also complements the Older Workers Pension Protection \nAct, S. 1600, which Senator Harkin, Senator Jeffords and I introduced \nlast month to prevent the wear away of an employee's promised pension \nbenefits after a cash balance plan conversion.\n  Now is the time for Congress to act to ensure that all employers \nfully disclose the negative effects of their pension plan changes. \nEmployees have a right to know how their futures will be affected by a \ncompany's decision to change its pension plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1709. A bill to provide Federal reimbursement for indirect costs \nrelating to the incarceration of illegal aliens and for emergency \nhealth services furnished to undocumented aliens; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n   the state criminal alien assistance program ii and local medical \n                      emergency reimbursement act\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement \nAct. Senators McCain, Hutchison, Domenici, Bingaman, and Feinstein join \nme.\n  Border counties and other jurisdictions throughout the Southwest are \nincurring overwhelming costs to process and incarcerate illegal \nimmigrants who commit crimes. Hospitals are also bearing steep costs to \ntreat illegal immigrants for medical emergencies.\n  Regarding the first issue, it should be pointed out that, when states \nand localities do not have the resources to deal with criminal illegal \nimmigrants, disasters can happen. Just last week, it was discovered \nthat illegal immigrants who, in some cases, had committed serious \ncrimes in Maricopa County, Arizona--including first degree murder in \none of the cases--were permitted to post bond to the county, were then \nreleased to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and were then \nallowed to return to their home country. Needless to say, those cases \ndid not go to trial. Because the alleged criminal aliens never returned \nfor their court date, justice was not served.\n  I continue to work toward better cooperation between the INS and \nlocal criminal justice systems, to make sure that illegal immigrants \nwho are charged with crimes prosecuted under state law--and murder is \nprosecuted under state law--are held in Arizona. That means before, \nduring, and after trial. It means, if the person is convicted, serving \nout his time in Arizona.\n  I will continue to work toward full funding for the federal program \nCongress created in 1995 to reimburse states and localities for the \ncosts of incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants, the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Incarceration of criminal illegal \nimmigrants costs state and local governments over $1 billion a year. \nLast year's Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill provided $585 \nmillion for the program, and reimbursed states approximately 39 cents \non the dollar for such costs. I will work to increase federal funding \nfor SCAAP, and will work to ensure that the FY 2000 C-J-S funding bill \nmaintains, at the very least, the FY 1999 funding level of $585 \nmillion.\n  It is my hope that the bill I am introducing today will further \nenhance the ability of states and localities to prevent the release of \ncriminal illegal immigrants by giving them the resources they need, not \nonly to incarcerate but to process and sentence such individuals. My \nbill creates SCAAP II and provides an additional authorization of $200 \nmillion per year between 2001 and 2004 to states and localities for \nsuch expenditures. When illegal immigrants commit crimes and are then \ncaught, they drain the budgets of a locality's sheriff, justice court, \ncounty attorney, clerk of the court, superior and juvenile court, and \njuvenile detention departments, as well as using up a county's indigent \ndefense budget. And, even though illegal immigration is a federal \nresponsibility, states and local jurisdictions all along the \nsouthwestern border have incurred 100 percent of specifically \nprocessing-related costs to date. This bill will change that.\n  Unfortunately, we do not yet know the full financial burden the \nstates and localities are bearing. I am hopeful that the FY 2000 \nCommerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill conference report will \ninclude funding for a study that will lay out realistic estimates of \nthese costs.\n  What is known is that such expenditures comprise approximately 39 \npercent of the aforementioned budgets of just one Arizona county, Santa \nCruz, with a population of just 36,000 residents. As a recent report \nconducted by the University of Arizona detailed, ``such illegal entry \npressures place inequitable demands on the resources and taxpayers of \nSanta Cruz County.''\n  Other counties throughout the Southwest are in the same boat. \nMaricopa County, Arizona, for example, incurs costs of $9 million to \nincarcerate illegal criminal immigrants. It is unclear what its costs \nare to process and sentence such aliens. Cochise County incurs costs of \napproximately $406,000 per year to incarcerate criminal illegal \nimmigrants and, therefore, must also incur significant costs to process \nand sentence these individuals. Providing resources to states and \nlocalities with such burdens will help prevent the release of criminals \nonto our nation's streets, and is clearly the financial responsibility \nof the federal government.\n  The second issue addressed by this bill is the burden borne by \nhospitals in southwestern states. The federal government is obligated \nto fully reimburse states, localities, and hospitals for the emergency \nmedical treatment of illegal immigrants.\n  According to a preliminary Congressional Budget Office estimate \nprovided two years ago, the total annual cost to treat illegal \nimmigrants for medical emergencies is roughly $2.8 billion a\n\n[[Page S12240]]\n\nyear. It is roughly estimated that the federal government reimburses \nstates for approximately half of those costs. That means states must \npay the remaining $1.4 billion. The state of Arizona estimates that it \nincurs unreimbursed costs of $20 million annually to treat undocumented \nimmigrants on an emergency basis.\n  This legislation will provide states, localities, and hospitals an \nadditional $200 million per year to help absorb the costs of adherence \nto federal law, under which all individuals, regardless of immigration \nstatus or ability to pay, must be provided with medical treatment in a \nmedical emergency. I have heard from individual doctors in Arizona, and \nhospitals as well, conveying their frustration in the face of these \ndaunting costs.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can address these very pressing issues in \nthe coming months, and that Members will consider joining my cosponsors \nand me in support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Federal policies and strategies aimed at curbing \n     illegal immigration and criminal alien activity implemented \n     along our Nation's southwest border influence the number of \n     crossings, especially their location.\n       (2) States and local governments were reimbursed \n     approximately 60 percent of the costs of the incarceration of \n     criminal aliens in fiscal year 1996 when only 90 \n     jurisdictions applied for such reimbursement. In subsequent \n     years, the number of local jurisdictions receiving \n     reimbursement has increased. For fiscal year 1999, 280 local \n     jurisdictions applied, and reimbursement amounted to only 40 \n     percent of the costs incurred by those jurisdictions.\n       (3) Certain counties, often with a small taxpayer base, \n     located on or near the border across from sometimes highly \n     populated areas of Mexico, suffer a substantially \n     disproportionate share of the impact of criminal illegal \n     aliens on its law enforcement and criminal justice systems.\n       (4) A University of Arizona study released in January 1998 \n     reported that at least 2 of the 4 counties located on \n     Arizona's border of Mexico, Santa Cruz, and Cochise Counties, \n     are burdened with this problem--\n       (A) for example, in 1998, Santa Cruz County had 12.7 \n     percent of Arizona's border population but 50 percent of \n     alien crossings and 32.5 percent of illegal alien \n     apprehensions;\n       (B) for fiscal year 1998, it is estimated that, of its \n     total criminal justice budget of 5,000,000 ($5,033,000), \n     Santa Cruz County spent $1,900,000 (39 percent) to process \n     criminal illegal aliens, of which over half was not \n     reimbursed by Federal monies; and\n       (C) Santa Cruz County has not obtained relief from this \n     burden, despite repeated appeals to Federal and State \n     officials.\n       (5) In the State of Texas, the border counties of Cameron, \n     Dimmit, El Paso, Hidalgo, Kinney, Val Verde, and Webb bore \n     the unreimbursed costs of apprehension, prosecution, indigent \n     defense, and other related services for criminal aliens who \n     served more than 142,000 days in county jails.\n       (6) Throughout Texas nonborder counties bore similar \n     unreimbursed costs for apprehension, prosecution, indigent \n     defense, and other related services for criminal aliens who \n     served more than 1,000,000 days in county jails.\n       (7) The State of Texas has incurred substantial additional \n     unreimbursed costs for State law enforcement efforts made \n     necessary by the presence of criminal illegal aliens.\n       (8) The Federal Government should reimburse States and \n     units of local government for the related costs incurred by \n     the State for the imprisonment of any illegal alien.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is--\n       (1) to assist States and local communities by providing \n     financial assistance for expenditures for illegal juvenile \n     aliens, and for related costs to States and units of local \n     government that suffer a substantially disproportionate share \n     of the impact of criminal illegal aliens on their law \n     enforcement and criminal justice systems; and\n       (2) to ensure equitable treatment for those States and \n     local governments that are affected by Federal policies and \n     strategies aimed at curbing illegal immigration and criminal \n     alien activity implemented on the southwest border.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nSenator Kyl and I are introducing with a number of our border-state \ncolleagues to provide appropriate Federal reimbursement to states and \nlocalities whose budgets are disproportionately affected by the costs \nassociated with illegal immigration. The premise of our bill, and of \ncurrent law governing this type of Federal reimbursement to the states, \nis that controlling illegal immigration is principally the \nresponsibility of the Federal government, not the states.\n  Our legislation would expand the amount and scope of Federal funding \nto the states for incarceration and medical costs that arise from the \ndetention or treatment of illegal immigrants. Such funding currently \nflows to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. \nterritories. Although our bill gives special consideration to border \nStates and States with unusually high concentrations of illegal aliens \nin residence, it would benefit communities across the Nation. It \ndeserves the Senate's prompt consideration and approval.\n  Many of my colleagues are probably not aware that the Federal \ngovernment, under the existing State Criminal Alien Assistance Program \n(SCAAP), reimbursed states and counties burdened by illegal immigration \nfor less than 40 percent of eligible alien incarceration costs in \nFiscal Year 1998. Border counties estimate that more than 25 percent of \ntheir criminal justice budgets are spent processing criminal aliens. In \nmy State of Arizona, Santa Cruz County last year spent 39 percent of \nits total criminal justice budget to process criminal illegal aliens, \nof which over half was not reimbursed by the Federal government. In its \nlast budget cycle, New Mexico's tiny Luna County spent $375,000 on \nimmigrant detention costs but received only $32,000 from the Federal \ngovernment to offset jail expenses. Overall, SCAAP reimbursed states \nand counties along the border for only 33.7 percent of the cost of \nincarcerating illegal aliens in FY 1997 and 39.9 percent in FY 1998.\n  The State of California spent nearly $600 million last year to keep \ncriminal aliens behind bars, but was reimbursed for only $183 million \nof those expenses. In Texas, prosecution of drug and immigration crime, \nprincipally in the form of illegal entry into the United States, \naccounted for an astonishing 70 percent of criminal filings during \nfiscal 1998. That figure represents a one-year increase of 58 percent \nin the number of immigration cases brought before the courts, an \nincrease that was not matched by Federal reimbursement for associated \nlegal expenses and incarceration costs to the state and its counties.\n  Earlier this year, the House voted to fund SCAAP at $585 million for \nFY 2000. This level is insufficient, but would at least roughly \nmaintain existing levels of Federal support to states and localities \nfor alien incarceration costs. Astonishingly, the Senate, in its \nversion of the fiscal year 2000 Commerce, Justice, State, and the \nJudiciary Appropriations bill, proposed to slash SCAAP funding by 83 \npercent, to only $100 million, for reasons that escape me. In the words \nof the U.S./Mexico Border Counties Coalition, ``Given this program's \nhistory of not meeting its obligations to state and local governments \neven at higher levels of funding, this latest action will in essence \nleave state and local taxpayers to foot the Federal government's bill \nfor the incarceration of criminal undocumented immigrants.''\n  A June 21, 1999, letter from the Governors of Arizona, California, \nNew York, New Jersey, and Illinois to members of the United States \nSenate makes the same point: ``Control of the nation's borders is under \nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal government, yet State and \nlocal governments bear the brunt of the costs when the Federal \ngovernment fails to meet its responsibility to prevent illegal \nimmigration. By cutting funding for SCAAP by 83 percent, the Senate is \nabandoning its responsibility and forcing the states to pay for a \nFederally mandated service.'' It is my hope that Congress will restore \nSCAAP funding to at least $500 million, as the President requested for \nfiscal 2000 to help meet the needs of local communities across the \ncountry.\n  The legislation Senator Kyl and I are introducing today would \nactually expand the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program by \nauthorizing funding for state and local needs that currently go unmet. \nAlthough states receive Federal reimbursement for part of the cost of \nincarcerating illegal adult aliens, the Federal government does not \nreimburse States or units of local government for expenditures for \nillegal juvenile aliens. Nor does it reimburse states and localities \nfor costs associated with processing criminal illegal aliens, including \ncourt costs, county attorney costs, costs for criminal proceedings that \ndo not involve going to trial, indigent defense costs, and unsupervised \nprobation costs. Our legislation would authorize the Federal government \nto reimburse such costs to States and localities that suffer a \nsubstantially disproportionate share of the impact of criminal illegal \naliens on their law enforcement and criminal justice systems. It would \nalso authorize additional Federal reimbursement for emergency health \nservices furnished by States and localities to undocumented aliens.\n  Reimbursement to States and localities for criminal alien \nincarceration is woefully underfunded according to the existing limited \ncriteria for SCAAP, which do not take into account the full detention \nand processing costs for illegal aliens. Nor does the existing SCAAP \nprovide necessary support to local communities for the cost of \nemergency care for illegal immigrants, a growing problem in the \nSouthwest, and one exacerbated by the increasingly desperate measures \ntaken by undocumented aliens to cross our border with Mexico. Our \nlegislation thus authorizes the expansion of SCAAP to cover costs \nwrongly borne by local communities under current law--costs which are a \nFederal responsibility and should not be shirked by those in Washington \nwho do not live with the problem of illegal immigration in their midst.\n  As my colleagues know, illegal immigrants who successfully transit \nour\n\n[[Page S12242]]\n\nSouthwest border rapidly disperse throughout the United States. That \nSCAAP funds flow to all 50 states reflects the pressures such aliens \nplace on public services around the country. I hope the Senate will act \nexpeditiously on this important legislation to alleviate those \npressures by compensating state and local units for the costs they \nincur as unwitting hosts to undocumented aliens, even as we continue to \nfund border enforcement measures to reduce the flow of illegal \nimmigrants into this country.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues from \nArizona, California, and Texas in introducing the ``State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement \nAct of 1999.''\n  The purpose of the bill is to expand to scope of the current SCAAP \nlaw to allow counties and states to be reimbursed not only for the \ncosts of incarcerating illegal aliens, but also for the costs of \nprosecuting them, defending them and detaining them. Currently, SCAAP \nonly pays for the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens convicted of a \nfelony in the United States. This means that counties and states do not \nget reimbursed for the indirect and direct costs leading to such a \nconviction. Because many illegal aliens arrested for drug smuggling or \nalien smuggling by federal agents are prosecuted by the county \nprosecutors, this has put an enormous strain on the county's \nprosecution budgets and has burdened the already struggling indigent \ndefense programs. With the expansion of SCAAP, the counties will \nfinally get some relief.\n  Another positive change to the SCAAP law is the addition of juvenile \nincarceration as a reimbursable expense. Many drug traffickers are \nusing teenagers to transport drugs across the border, knowing that we \ndo not currently have a good system for dealing with criminal illegal \njuvenile aliens. Because these teens' parents are not living in the \nUnited States, the county jails are required to detain the teens \npending adjudication. The other option is to let the teens go. Neither \noption is good from a law enforcement perspective, but the cost of \ndetaining a juvenile places an enormous burden on the counties' \njuvenile detention facilities. I am pleased that this bill considered \nthe counties' concerns and included the costs of detaining juveniles as \na reimbursable expense.\n  In 1994 I supported the original SCAAP bill. Between 1996 and 1999, \nthe federal government has reimbursed the State of New Mexico $4.5 \nmillion for costs incurred in incarcerating criminal illegal aliens \nunder this program. New Mexico counties have been reimbursed more than \n$1.4 million for similar costs. However, this $6 million reimbursement \nrepresents but a small fraction of the actual costs expended by New \nMexico jails and prisons. This bill seeks to increase the amount \navailable for reimbursement by raising the amount authorized to $200 \nmillion between 2002 and 2005.\n  The second part of this bill addresses another problem facing the \nborder states. Because many towns near the US-Mexico border are a mere \nstones throw away from much larger Mexican towns and cities, many \nMexican nationals often cross the border illegally in search of \nemergency medical services due to the lack of adequate facilities in \nMexico. This bill will reimburse the health care providers required to \nprovide emergency medical services to illegal aliens.\n  The border counties in New Mexico have repeatedly expressed their \nconcern about the lack of federal assistance for emergency medical \nservices provided to undocumented immigrants. Yet, under current law, \nNew Mexico border communities are not eligible to be reimbursed for \nproviding such emergency medical services. This has placed a \nsignificant financial burden on the public and private hospitals who \nare just trying to do what they think is right--provide emergency \ntreatment to those in need. This lack of federal assistance has been \nvery detrimental to New Mexico because the number of undocumented \nimmigrants seeking medical attention in New Mexico is very high \ncompared with the population of the New Mexico border community.\n  Between January 1, 1999 and August 31, 1999, Mimbres Memorial \nHospital in Deming, New Mexico reported that 22 percent of its patients \nthat were unable to pay for their medical care were residents of \nMexico. These individuals accounted for $379,311 in charges that had to \nbe absorbed by this hospital. In a town of roughly 10,000 people, this \nis a sizeable amount for a local hospital to write-off as \nuncollectible.\n  With the passage of this bill, New Mexico will be eligible to \nparticipate in this federal reimbursement program. Because the \nauthorized amount for this program will be increased to $200 million \nbetween 2002 and 2005, this change will not affect the reimbursements \nto other states. This increase in funding is sorely needed to \nadequately address the financial burdens that illegal immigration \nimposes on the border communities.\n  I commend my fellow members of the Senate Southwest Border Caucus for \nworking together on a bill what will make these necessary changes to \nthe SCAAP program and address the financial hardship that illegal \nimmigration imposes on our border communities.\n  I thank Senator Kyl for introducing this bill and I encourage the \nSenate to take up this bill and pass this worthwhile legislation.\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President I am pleased to join my \ncolleague Senator Kyl in introducing the ``State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act.''\n  The control of illegal immigration is a Federal responsibility. \nHowever, more and more, this burden is shifting to the states. The \n``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical \nEmergency Reimbursement Act'' (SCAAP II), properly shifts the fiscal \nburden of illegal immigration into the hands of the Federal Government. \nThis bill builds upon the existing Federal obligations under the \n``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program'' (SCAAP I) by providing $200 \nmillion for each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2005 to help border \ncommunities defray the indirect costs of illegal immigration, and an \nadditional $200 million to help state and local governments cope with \nthe cost of providing emergency medical care to illegal immigrants.\n  The issue of illegal immigration, is one of national consequence that \nrequires a Federal response. Unfortunately, Federal reimbursements have \nconsistently failed to cover the actual costs borne by States and local \ncommunities confronting the effects of illegal immigration. For those \ncommunities that continue to shoulder this burden, the control of \nillegal immigration has become an unfunded mandate.\n  Mr. President, while I consider illegal immigration an issue that \npervades communities across the nation, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues how this issue has affected my home State of California. As \nyou might imagine, the border counties in California are among the \nhardest hit in terms of dollars spent on incarceration, court costs, \nand emergency medical care for those who have entered the U.S. \nillegally.\n  San Diego County, for example, spent an estimated $10.1 million in \n1998 to cover the costs of illegal alien incarceration and spends an \nestimated $50 million annually to provide emergency medical care for \nillegal immigrants. Imperial County estimates that it spent more than \n$4 million last year in detention costs and another $1.36 million in \nemergency medical expenses.\n  I am greatly concerned about the disproportionate burden these costs \nimpose on the criminal justice system, hospitals and residents of San \nDiego and Imperial Counties, especially given the counties' limited tax \nbase and fiscal resources. Given what I have witnessed in my own state, \nit is not hard for me to understand the frustration and concern of \ncommunities in a growing number of other states. Similar burdens have \nfallen on border communities in states like Arizona, New Mexico, and \nTexas. Each year, the costs borne by states to respond to illegal \nimmigration continue to soar, while Federal involvement remains minimal \nat best.\n  Unfortunately, we can only expect these costs for border states to \nswell over the next few years as border enforcement initiatives force \nillegal migration to shift further eastward from San Diego County to \nneighboring southern States and counties as well as to the more porous \nnorthern state borders. In launching Operation Gatekeeper, for example, \nthe INS has\n\n[[Page S12243]]\n\nachieved considerable success in deterring illegal border crossings \nalong the San Diego border.\n  At the same time, Gatekeeper has had the effect of shifting a large \nvolume of migrant crossings to the more rugged East San Diego County \nmountain area and the desert region of Imperial County where there have \nbeen numerous instances of illegal immigrants in need of emergency \ncare. One county hospital in El Centro, for example, reports that the \nBorder Patrol has dropped off countless numbers of undocumented aliens \nfound in the desert suffering from hypothermia or dehydration, or from \nbroken limbs and fractured skulls as result of failed attempts at \nscaling the fence along the San Diego border.\n  The more ``fortunate'' border crossers are being detained at state \nand county jails. Although states receive Federal reimbursement for \nsome of the direct costs of incarcerating adult illegal immigrants, the \nFederal Government does not reimburse states and localities for the \nindirect costs relating to the incarceration or the control of illegal \naliens, including: court costs, county attorney costs, indigent \ndefense, criminal juvenile detention, and unsupervised probation costs. \nNor does it compensate state and local hospitals for the emergency \nmedical care provided to illegal immigrants who are not in Federal \ncustody.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in introducing the SCAAP II bill \nin hopes that it will alleviate some of the fiscal strains illegal \nimmigration has imposed on border states and communities. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to move it through the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which \nwould designate October 24-30, as ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning \nPrevention Week.'' Despite steady progress over the past two decades to \nregulate inappropriate uses of lead, the tragedy of childhood lead \npoisoning remains very real for nearly one million preschoolers in the \nU.S.\n  Most children are poisoned in their own homes by deteriorating lead-\nbased paint and lead-contaminated dust. While lead poisoning crosses \nall barriers of race, income, and geography, most of the burden of this \ndisease falls disproportionately on low-income families or families of \ncolor who generally live in older, poorer quality housing. In the \nUnited States, children from low-income families are eight times more \nlikely to be poisoned than those from high income families. African \nAmerican children are five times more likely to be poisoned than white \nchildren. Nationwide, almost 22 percent of African American children \nliving in older housing are lead poisoned, a staggering statistic, \nparticularly given the overall decline in blood lead levels in the last \ndecade.\n  Unfortunately, many communities have not experienced a major decline \nin blood lead levels. In fact, in some communities, more than half of \nthe preschool children are lead poisoned. Baltimore, Providence, \nPhiladelphia, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Chicago all have lead poisoning \nrates that are three to nine times the national average.\n  Even low levels of exposure to lead impair a child's ability to learn \nand thrive, causing reductions in IQ and attention span, reading and \nother learning disabilities, hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, \nhearing loss, and coordination problems. These effects are persistent \nand interfere with their success in school and later in life. Research \nshows that children with elevated blood lead levels are seven times \nmore likely to drop out of high school and six times more likely to \nhave reading disabilities. State health officials believe that the need \nfor certain education services is 40 percent higher among children with \nsignificant lead exposure.\n  Mr. President, lead poisoning is entirely preventable, making its \nprevalence among children all the more frustrating. In addition, lead \npoisoning has many dimensions, and therefore we have to tackle it from \nall directions. Specifically, our efforts should include screening and \ntreating poisoned children, identifying and removing the source of \ntheir exposure, educating parents, landlords and entire communities \nabout the dangers of lead, and ensuring that resources to address the \nproblem are available and accessible to all who need them.\n  I have been working on a number of initiatives in the Senate to \naddress this problem including urging Senate leaders to provide for \nmore funding for lead abatement. Last year, I sponsored an amendment \nthat resulted in an increase of $20 million in funding to eliminate \nlead hazards in the homes of young children. This year, the Senate has \nsupported a similar figure.\n  Also, I have become deeply concerned, along with my colleague Senator \nTorricelli, about recent reports that children at risk for lead \npoisoning are not adequately screened or treated for the disease, even \nif they are enrolled in Medicaid. Although children enrolled in \nMedicaid are three times more likely than other children to have high \namounts of lead in their blood, the General Accounting Office (GAO) \nrecently reported that less than 20 percent of these young children \nhave been screened for lead poisoning. Even more disconcerting is that \nhalf of the states do not have screening policies that are consistent \nwith federal requirements. For this reason, we have introduced the \nChildren's Lead SAFE Act (S. 1120) to ensure that all children at risk \nof lead poisoning receive their required screenings and appropriate \nfollow-up care by holding states accountable.\n  Mr. President, I have been working on making important, yet common-\nsense, policy changes to ensure that children are screened and treated \nfor lead poisoning and to provide critical funding for leadsafe \nhousing. Beyond these efforts, I believe we need to take further steps \nto raise pubic awareness about the dangers of lead poisoning. Last \nmonth, Senator Collins and I hosted a Public Health Subcommittee \nhearing in Rhode Island to highlight the importance of the issue and to \nhear about the successful approaches undertaken by organizations in my \nhome state to address the problem. We plan to hold a similar hearing in \nMaine next month. Because lead poisoning is a national problem, we \nbelieve it deserves national attention.\n  That is why Senator Collins and I, along with 26 original co-sponsors \nare introducing this bipartisan resolution that would commemorate the \nweek of October 24-30, 1999 as ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning \nPrevention Week.'' Designation of a national week for lead poisoning \nprevention would raise public awareness about the issue and highlight \nthe need to protect children from lead poisoning to ensure their \nhealthy development.\n  The Senate resolution would serve to further our efforts to recognize \nlead poisoning as a national problem and declare lead poisoning \nprevention as a national priority. The proposed resolution would also \nacknowledge the suffering of the many children with lead poisoning and \ntheir parents whose active involvement individually and through \ngrassroots organizations has been instrumental in efforts to reduce \nlead poisoning. The resolution is supported by the Alliance to End \nChildhood Lead Poisoning, the Children's Defense Fund, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, and more than one hundred state and local \norganizations. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of \nsupport from the Children's Defense Fund and the Alliance to End \nChildhood Lead Poisoning, along with the list of the 100 supporting \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: I am writing in strong support of \n     resolution to commemorate the week of October 24-30, 1999 as \n     ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.''\n       Lead poisoning in children can cause learning disabilities, \n     behavioral problems, and at extremely high levels of \n     poisoning, seizures,\n\n[[Page S12246]]\n\n     coma, and death. According to the Centers for Disease Control \n     (CDC), about 890,000 children in the United States have \n     elevated blood lead levels, including one in five African-\n     American children living in housing built before 1946. \n     Infants and toddlers are most susceptible because they spend \n     so much of their time with their hands in their mouths--hands \n     that may have been on the floor, on the windowsill, on the \n     wall, along the stairway, places where lead paint particles \n     exist.\n       Over 80% of the homes and apartments built before 1978 in \n     the United States have lead-based paint in them. Paint \n     doesn't have to be peeling to cause a health problem; \n     particles can circulate in dust and air circulation systems. \n     Although elevated blood lead levels in children have declined \n     in the last few decades, lead poisoning is preventable; any \n     level of lead poisoning in children is too high.\n       Your resolution will highten awareness of this tragic and \n     preventable health problem. I commend your attention to the \n     issue and look forward to working with you to ensure that all \n     children have the chance to grow up healthy and reach their \n     fullest potential.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Marian Wright Edelman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Alliance to End\n\n\n                                     Childhood Lead Poisoning,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: I am writing in support of your \n     resolution to designate the last week of October ``National \n     Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.'' This measure is \n     supported by over 100 local health departments, housing \n     agencies, community-based organizations and lead poisoning \n     prevention programs from across the country (see attached \n     list).\n       Despite steady progress over the past two decades to \n     regulate inappropriate uses of lead, the tragedy of childhood \n     lead poisoning remains very real for nearly one million \n     preschoolers in the United States. Children are most often \n     poisoned in their own homes by lead-contaminated dust from \n     lead-based paint that is deteriorating or disturbed by \n     repainting or renovation projects.\n       While lead poisoning crosses all barriers of race, income, \n     and geography, the burden of this disease falls \n     disproportionately on low-income families or families of \n     color, who generally live in older, poorer quality housing. \n     In some communities, more than half of preschool children are \n     lead-poisoned. Even low levels of exposure to lead can impair \n     young children's ability to learn and thrive, causing reduced \n     IQ and attention span, learning difficulties and behavior \n     problems. These effects are persistent and interfere with \n     success in school and later life.\n       Formal designation of a national week for lead poisoning \n     prevention will instrumentally advance national, state, and \n     local efforts to educate communities about the threat of lead \n     to children. Thank you again for supporting designation of \n     the last week of October ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning \n     Prevention Week.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Don Ryan,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n\n                                members\n\n       Alabama State CLPPP, Montgomery, AL.\n       Alliance To End Childhood Lead Poisoning, Washington, DC.\n       Anne Arundel Co.

Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my \ncolleague, Senator Jack Reed, in submitting a resolution designating \nOctober 24th-30th as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. \nThis designation will help increase awareness of the significant \ndangers and prevalence of child lead poisoning across our nation.\n\n[[Page S12247]]\n\n  Recently, Senator Reed and I held a hearing in Rhode Island to \naddress the impact exposure to lead paint can have on children's health \nand development, and to explore ways to improve our efforts to prevent \nand eventually eliminate lead poisoning in children.\n  Great strides have been made in the last 20 years to reduce the \nthreat lead poses to human health. Most notably, lead has been banned \nfrom many products including residential paint, food cans and gasoline. \nThese commendable steps have significantly reduced the incidence of \nlead poisoning. But the threat remains, and continues to imperil, the \nhealth and welfare of our nation's children.\n  In fact, lead poisoning is the most significant and prevalent \nenvironmental health threat to children in the U.S. today. Even low \nlevels of lead exposure can have serious developmental consequences \nincluding reductions in IQ and attention span, reading and learning \ndisabilities, hyperactivity and behavioral problems. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention currently estimates that 890,000 \nchildren aged 1-5 have blood levels of lead that are high enough to \naffect their ability to learn.\n  Today, the major lead poisoning threat to children in found in \ninterior paint that has deteriorated. Unfortunately, it is all too \ncommon for older homes to contain lead-based paint. In fact, more than \nhalf the entire housing stock--and three quarters of the stock built \nprior to 1978--contain some lead-based paint. Paint manufactured prior \nto the residential lead paint ban often remains safely contained and \nunexposed for decades, but over time, often through the remodeling \nprocess or through normal wear and tear, the paint can become exposed, \ncontaminating the home with dangerous lead dust.\n  Because of the prevalence of older homes in the Northeast, lead \npoisoning exposure is a significant problem in our region. In Maine, 42 \npercent of our homes were built prior to 1950. Although screening rates \nnationally and in my state are considered to be too low, the sampling \nthat has been done in my state shows that in some areas of the state 7-\n15 percent of children tested have high blood lead levels. In some \nareas of our country, the percentage is even higher.\n  Next month, I will hold a hearing in Maine to address the lead-based \npaint threat in our homes, and what parents can do to protect their \nchildren from the risks associated with lead exposure.\n  Once childhood development is impaired by exposure to lead, the \neffect is largely irreversible. However, if the presence of lead is \ndetected prior to exposure, then remedial steps can be taken, such as \nlead containment or abatement, to prevent children from ever being \nharmed by lead's presence in the home.\n  We are not helpless to stop this insidious threat. By raising \nawareness of the prevalence of lead paint in homes, and the steps that \ncan be taken to prevent poisoning, we can stop the life-impairing \neffects of childhood lead poisoning. I urge my colleagues to support me \nin raising awareness about childhood lead poisoning by co-sponsoring \nChildhood Lead Paint Poisoning Prevention Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12247-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12247-S12249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n                RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BOND (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2270\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Nickles and Mr. Hutchinson) proposed an \namendment to amendment No. 1825 proposed by Mr. Bond to the bill (S. \n1650) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 1 of the amendment, strike all after the first word \n     and insert the following:\n       ____. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Labor, through the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration (referred to in this section \n     as ``OSHA'') plans to propose regulations during 1999 to \n     regulate ergonomics in the workplace. A draft of OSHA's \n     ergonomics regulation became available on February 19, 1999.\n       (2) A July 1997 report by the National Institute for \n     Occupational Safety and Health that reviewed epidemiological \n     studies that have been conducted of ``work related \n     musculoskeletal disorders of the neck, upper extremity, and \n     low back'' showed that there is insufficient evidence to \n     assess the level of risk to workers from repetitive motions. \n     Such evidence would be necessary for OSHA and the \n     administration to write an efficient and effective \n     regulation.\n       (3) An August 1998 workshop on ``work related \n     musculoskeletal injuries'' held by the National Academy of \n     Sciences reviewed existing research on musculoskeletal \n     disorders. The workshop showed that there is insufficient \n     evidence to assess the level of risk to workers from \n     repetitive motions.\n       (4) In October 1998, Congress and the President agreed that \n     the National Academy of Sciences should conduct a \n     comprehensive study of the medical and scientific evidence \n     regarding musculoskeletal disorders. The study is intended to \n     evaluate the basic questions about diagnosis and causes of \n     such disorders.\n       (5) To complete that study, Public Law 105-277 appropriated \n     $890,000 for the National Academy of Sciences to complete a \n     peer-reviewed scientific study of the available evidence \n     examining a cause and effect relationship between repetitive \n     tasks in the workplace and musculoskeletal disorders or \n     repetitive stress injuries.\n       (6) The National Academy of Sciences currently estimates \n     that this study will be completed late in 2000 or early in \n     2001.\n       (7) Given the uncertainty and dispute about these basic \n     questions, and Congress' intention that they be addressed in \n     a comprehensive study by the National Academy of Sciences, it \n     is premature for OSHA to propose a regulation on ergonomics \n     as being necessary or appropriate to improve workers' health \n     and safety until such study is completed.\n       (b) Prohibition.--None of the funds made available in this \n     Act may be used by the Secretary of Labor or the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration to promulgate or issue, or \n     to continue the rulemaking process of promulgating or \n     issuing, any standard, regulation, or guideline regarding \n     ergonomics prior to September 30, 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 2271\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1880 proposed by \nMr. Wellstone to the bill, S. 2271, supra; as follows:\n\n         Beginning on page 1 of the amendment, strike \n     ''$70,000,000'' and all that follows and insert the \n     following: ``$358,816,000 shall be made available to carry \n     out the mental health services block grant under subpart I of \n     part B of title XIX of the Public Health Service Act \n     ($48,816,000 of which shall become available on October 1, \n     2000 and remain available through September 30, 2001), and''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                BINGAMAN (AND OTHERS AMENDMENT NO. 2272\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Feingold) proposed \nan amendment to the bill, S. 1650, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 216.

A 1998 survey by the Kaiser FamilyFoundation and \n     Harvard University found that 82 percent of Americans support \n     passage of a direct access law.\n       (4) While 39 States have acted to promote residents' access \n     to ob- gyn providers, patients in other State- or in \n     Federally-governed health plans are not protected from access \n     restrictions or limitations.\n       (5) In May of 1999 the Commonwealth Fund issued a survey on \n     women's health, determining that 1 of 4 women (23 percent) \n     need to first receive permission from their primary care \n     physician before they can go and see their ob-gyn provider \n     for covered obstetric or gynecologic care.\n       (6) Sixty percent of all office visits to ob-gyn providers \n     are for preventive care.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should enact legislation that requires health \n     plans to provide women with direct access to a participating \n     health provider who specializes in obstetrics and \n     gynecological services, and that such direct access should be \n     provided for all obstetric and gynecologic care covered by \n     their health plans, without first having to obtain a referral \n     from a primary care provider or the health plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REED AMENDMENT NO. 2284\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for Mr. Reed) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1650, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nfighting men of the Fox Division, United States Navy, USS Rochester \n(CA-124), who bravely served our country in the Korean Conflict from \nJune, 1950 to March, 1953. Aboard the USS Rochester--the flagship of \nthe Commander Seventh Fleet--the men of the Fox Division participated \nin nearly every major naval engagement along the Korean Peninsula. The \nFox Division's three teams: the Main Plot, the Sky Plot, and the Mark \n56 directors, shared the critical responsibility of operating, \nrepairing, and maintaining the complex equipment which ensured the \naccuracy of the Rochester's weapons systems. They accomplished these \ntasks with outstanding success.\n  The Fox Division recently celebrated their 1999 reunion in \nFrankenmuth, Michigan. Some of these reunited shipmates had not seen \neach other in over 45 years. Included among their ranks were:\n  Jerry Barca; John Brothers; Robert Cadden; Russell Daniels; Farrell \nFerguson; Sheri Holman, representing her late husband Bob Holman; Bill \nHontz; Marv Hufford; Larry Kobie; Tony Kontowicz; Leo Lane; Charles \nNewsham; Bobby Page; Carl Ray; Ronald Richards; Pete Russell; Roland \nSchneider; Donald Spencer; and Joe West.\n  Today I join my colleagues in thanking the men of the Fox Division \nfor defending the cause of democracy, and for preserving our country's \nnational security. I am proud to say that these veterans are an \ninspiration to all of us. By dedicating a portion of their lives to the \nservice of their country, they have helped guarantee the freedom we \nAmericans hold so dear. Our nation is grateful to each and every member \nof the Fox Division, USS Rochester, for their outstanding dedication \nand commitment to the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12250-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12250-S12251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VIOLENCE IN MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week, students at Erickson \nElementary School and Willow Run High School are mourning the deaths of \ntheir peers. On Sunday afternoon, gun fire cut short the lives of two \nyoung boys in Ypsilanti Township. Sixteen year old Ernest Earl Lemons \nwas shot in plain daylight, after a fight broke out between young \npeople. Nine year old Cullen Ethington, who was a half a block away, \nwas also killed by a stray bullet from that fight.\n  Both young people are now being remembered by their classmates and \nteachers. The tree where Lemons fell,\n\n[[Page S12251]]\n\nafter he was shot, is now decorated with teddy bears. Students at \nErickson are planning to plant a tree or flowers in honor of the short \nlife of fourth grader Cullen Ethington, who will be memorialized by his \nclassmates as a peer mediator who helped students resolve their \ndisputes without violence.\n  School children are too often the victims of senseless gun violence. \nGun violence results in injury and death, destroys families, and causes \nlasting psychological and emotional harm. In Michigan, each school is \nnow forced to handle the trauma of children losing other children to \ngunfire. As many other school districts now know, violence and the fear \nof violence is not only tragic for individuals and families involved, \nit also interferes tremendously with the educational process. Students \nat Erickson, for example, are now spending time at school with trauma \nteams learning how to cope with death while their peers at other \nschools are learning about the pilgrims and practicing for the school \nplay.\n  Congress must act now to end the proliferation of gun violence. Like \nyoung Cullen, we must not only make a pledge to live our lives without \nviolence, but must also send a message to others that violence is never \nthe answer.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to the both the Ethington and the \nLemons families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12251-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12251-S12252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WILDERNESS DESIGNATIONS\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, given the recent creation of the \nWilderness and Public Lands Caucus and the ongoing debate on public \nland management, I think that all views on this complicated and \nemotional issue are vital to the discussion. Therefore, I ask that a \nbrief statement from the Wilderness Act Reform Coalition, a group from \nmy home State of Idaho be printed in the Record for all Senators to \nread and consider.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  The Wilderness Act Reform Coalition\n\n\n                         Why we are organizing\n\n       September 3, 1999 marks the 35th anniversary of the passage \n     of the Wilderness Act. During those 35 years, it has never \n     been substantively amended. Yet, the history of the \n     application of the Wilderness Act to the public's lands and \n     resources provides overwhelming evidence that it must be \n     significantly reformed if the public interest is to be \n     served.\n       September 3, 1999 also marks the launch of the Wilderness \n     Act Reform Coalition (WARC), the first serious effort to \n     reform this antiquated and poorly-conceived law. Much has \n     changed since the Wilderness Act became law in 1964. Dozens \n     of other laws have been passed since then to protect and \n     responsibly-manage all of the public's lands and resources. \n     Underpinning all of these laws--and guaranteeing their \n     enforcement--is a public sensitivity and commitment to wise \n     resource management which was not present two generations ago \n     when the Wilderness Act was enacted.\n       Over this same time period our knowledge and understanding \n     of how to accomplish this kind of wise and responsible \n     resource management has increased exponentially. The demand \n     side of the public's interest in their lands and resources \n     has also increased exponentially. Recreation demand, for \n     example, has increased far beyond what anyone could have \n     anticipated 35 years ago and it has done so in directions \n     which could not have been foreseen in 1964. Demand for water, \n     energy and minerals, timber and other resources continues to \n     go up as well.\n       All of this means that as the 21st Century dawns we find \n     ourselves facing more complex natural resources realities and \n     challenges than ever before in our history. Meeting these \n     challenges while at the same time serving the broad public \n     interest will require careful and thoughtful balancing of all \n     resource values with other social goals. It will also require \n     integrating them all into a comprehensive management approach \n     which will provide the greatest good for the greatest number \n     of Americans over the longest period of time.\n       These lands and resources, after all, belong to all of the \n     American people. They deserve to enjoy the maximum benefits \n     from them. Yet, the Wilderness Act, with its outdated, \n     inflexible, and anti-management requirements, presently locks \n     away over 100 million acres of the public's lands and \n     resources from this kind of intelligent and integrated \n     resource management. The inevitable result is the numerous \n     negative impacts and damage to other resource values which \n     are becoming increasingly apparent on the public's lands. The \n     Wilderness Act remains frozen in another era. Due to the \n     exponential changes which have occurred since it was passed, \n     that era lies much further in the past than a mere 35 year \n     linear time line would suggest.\n\n\n                        Our goals and objectives\n\n       The Wilderness Act Reform Coalition is being organized by \n     members of citizen's groups and local government officials \n     who have experienced firsthand the limitations and problems \n     the Wilderness Act has caused. It has a simple mission: to \n     reform the Wilderness Act. In carrying out that mission, the \n     Coalition has identified two primary goals towards which it \n     will initially work.\n       The first goal is to make those changes in the wilderness \n     law which are essential to mitigate the most serious resource \n     and related problems it is causing. These problems range from \n     prohibiting the application of sound resource management \n     practices where needed to hampering important scientific \n     research and jeopardizing our national defense.\n       The second goal of the coalition is to use the failings of \n     the Wilderness Act to help educate the public, the media and \n     policy makers on the fundamentals of natural resource \n     management. Most of the ``conventional wisdom'' about natural \n     resource management to which most of them presently subscribe \n     is simply wrong. It is essential that the public be better \n     educated on the facts, the realities, the challenges and the \n     options before there can be any responsible or useful policy \n     debate on the most fundamental problems with the Wilderness \n     Act or, for that matter, any of the other federal management \n     laws and policies which also need to be reformed. That is why \n     the Coalition has chosen a comparatively limited reform \n     agenda for this opening round in what we recognize ultimately \n     must be a broader and more comprehensive national policy \n     debate.\n\n\n                           Our reform agenda\n\n       The Coalition currently advocates the following reforms of \n     the Wilderness Act:\n       1. Developing a mechanism to permit active resource \n     management in wilderness areas to achieve a wide range of \n     public benefits and to respond to local needs. The inability \n     or unwillingness of managers to intervene actively within \n     wilderness areas to deal with local resource management \n     problems or goals has resulted in economic harm to local \n     communities and damage to other important natural resource \n     and related values and objectives. The Coalition supports the \n     creation of committees composed of locally-based federal and \n     state resource managers, local governments, local economic \n     interests and local citizens which will initiate a process to \n     override the basic non-management directive of the Wilderness \n     Act on a case-by-case basis.\n       2. Establishing a mechanism for appeal and override of \n     local managers for scientific research. Wilderness advocates \n     often tout the importance of wilderness designation to \n     science. The reality, however, is that agency regulations \n     make it difficult or impossible to conduct many scientific \n     experiments in wilderness, particularly with modern and cost-\n     effective scientific tools. Important scientific experiments \n     have been opposed simply because they would take place \n     within wilderness areas. A simple, quick and cheap appeal \n     process must be created for scientists turned down by \n     wilderness land managers.\n       3. Making it clear that such things as use of mechanized \n     equipment and aircraft landings can occur in wilderness areas \n     for search and rescue or law enforcement purposes. There have \n     been incidents where these have been prevented by federal \n     wilderness managers.\n       4. Requiring that federal managers use the most cost-\n     effective management tools and technologies. These managers \n     have largely imposed upon themselves a requirement that they \n     use the ``least tool'' or the ``minimum tool'' to accomplish \n     tasks such as noxious weed control, wildfire control or \n     stabilization of historic sites. In practice, this means that \n     hand tools are often used instead of power tools, horses are \n     employed instead of helicopters and similar practices which \n     waste tax dollars.\n       5. Clarifying that the prohibition on the use of mechanized \n     transportation in wilderness areas refers only to intentional \n     infractions. This would be, in effect, the ``Bobby Unser \n     Amendment'' designed to prevent in the future the current \n     situation in which he is being prosecuted by the federal \n     government for possibly driving a snowmobile into a \n     wilderness area in Colorado while lost in a life-threatening \n     blizzard.\n       6. Pulling the boundaries of wilderness areas and \n     wilderness study areas (WSA's) back from roads and \n     prohibiting ``cherrystemming.'' In many cases, the boundaries \n     of wilderness areas and WSA's come right to the very edge of \n     a road. Lawsuits have been filed or threatened against \n     counties for going literally only a few feet into a WSA when \n     doing necessary road maintenance work. It is clearly \n     impossible to have a wilderness recreational experience in \n     close proximity of a road. When formal wilderness areas are \n     designated, the current practice is to pull the boundaries \n     back a short distance from roads, depending on how the roads \n     are categorized. That distance should be standardized and \n     extended, probably to at least a quarter of a mile. The \n     practice of ``cherrystemming,'' or drawing wilderness \n     boundaries right along both sides of a road to its end, \n     sometimes for many miles, is a clear violation of the intent \n     of the Wilderness Act that wilderness areas must first and \n     foremost be roadless. It must be eliminated.\n       7. Permitting certain human-powered but non-motorized \n     mechanized transport devices in wilderness areas. This would \n     include mountain bikes and wheeled ``game carriers'' and \n     similar devices. The explosion of mountain biking was not \n     envisioned by the Congress when the Wilderness Act was \n     passed.\n\n[[Page S12252]]\n\n     Opening up those wilderness areas which are suitable to \n     mountain biking would provide a high quality recreation \n     experience to more of the Americans who own these areas. Use \n     of these human-powered conveyances would also reduce pressure \n     on these areas in a number of ways, such as by dispersing \n     recreation use over a wider area. At the same time opening \n     these areas can also reduce the current or potential \n     conflicts between various recreation uses on land outside \n     of designated wilderness. The impact on the land from \n     these types of mechanized recreation uses would be minimal \n     to non-existent. Their presence in wilderness areas would \n     not cause problems on aesthetic grounds for any but the \n     most extreme wilderness purists and they represent only a \n     tiny fraction of the Americans who own these lands.\n       8. Requiring that the resource potential in all WSA's and \n     any other land proposed for wilderness be updated at least \n     every ten years. For example, mineral surveys and estimates \n     of oil and gas potential completed on many of the WSA's on \n     BLM-managed land which have been recommended for wilderness \n     designation are now 10 to 15 years old and in some cases even \n     older. These reviews were often not very thorough even by the \n     standards and technology available then, much less what is \n     available now. Before any additional land is locked up in \n     wilderness, Congress and the American people should at least \n     have the best and most up-to-date information on which to \n     weigh the resource trade offs and make decisions.\n       9. Stating clearly that wilderness designation or the \n     presence of WSA's cannot interfere with military \n     preparedness. In a number of instances, conflicts related to \n     military overflights of designated or potential wilderness \n     areas, or to the positioning of essential military equipment \n     on the ground in these areas, poses a threat or a potential \n     threat to our defense preparedness. The Coalition will push \n     for clarification that when considering the impacts of any \n     mission certified by the military as essential to the \n     national defense, wilderness areas or WSA's will be treated \n     exactly the same as any other land administered by that \n     agency.\n       10. Clarifying that wilderness designation or WSA \n     designation will not in and of itself result in any \n     management or regulatory changes outside the wilderness or \n     WSA boundaries. This change is essential to prohibit federal \n     agencies or the courts from taking actions to impose any type \n     of ``buffer zones'' around these areas, including such things \n     as special management of ``viewsheds'' or asserting \n     wilderness-based water rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12252-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ON MENTAL RETARDATION ILLINOIS \n        CHAPTER'S 1999 DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthose who have enriched the lives of men and women with disabilities. \nEach year the Illinois chapter of the American Association on Mental \nRetardation recognizes the work of Illinoisans who have dedicated and \ncommitted their lives to helping people with disabilities.\n  These award winners live in Illinois and play an important role in \nthe lives of Illinoisans with disabilities. A 1999 Direct Service Award \nwinner is someone who devotes more than 50 percent of their time \nworking hands-on with their client. These award winners work directly \nwith their clients with commitment, sensitivity, professionalism, and \npatience. These qualities set them apart and increase their value to \ntheir patients.\n  It is important we recognize these individuals who go beyond the call \nof duty to improve the lives of others. We should note that these \nindividuals do not only enrich the lives of those for whom they care, \nbut enrich our lives as well.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David \n``Moose'' Miller, husband, father, friend, community leader, sports \nenthusiast, and owner of the nationally known watering hole, Moose's \nSaloon, who lost his life to cancer recently. Moose had battled cancer \nfor the last year and convinced himself and others that he would beat \nit. Today, in Kalispell, Montana, family and friends are remembering \nMoose Miller and I would like to take a moment to make a special \nacknowledgement to such a great man.\n  Moose played football for the University of Montana, served his \ncountry in the U.S. Army, and with his wife, converted the Corral Bar \nto the famous Moose's Saloon. Swinging doors, sawdust on the floor, \ninitials carved into the heavy tables, the best pizza around, and the \nrustic atmosphere attracted people from all walks of life and all ages. \nWhether you're from Kalispell, Montana, Peoira, Illinois, or \nWashington, D.C., you likely know someone who knows of Moose's Saloon \nand Moose Miller.\n  I had the privilege of knowing Moose. Moose not only owned and ran a \nsuccessful business in the Flathead Valley, he gave back to the \ncommunity in many ways. The Kalispell Chamber of Commerce honored him \nas its Great Chief in 1986, recognizing his years of community service. \nHe and his ``elves'' made Christmas special for many people, especially \nthe handicapped, each year for several years, he donated proceeds from \nthe kitchen to support the March of Dimes, was an active supporter of \nthe University of Montana and helped administer the Flathead Youth \nFoundation.\n  Moose is leaving behind a wife, Shirley; his children; Bruce, Wallis, \nRoyce, Lexie, Lee and Aimee; his grandchildren, Zach, Anne, Lexie, \nLeah, Alicia, Hannah, and Zane; and his sister, Marcie.\n  I know that Moose will be missed by his family and friends, as well \nas the entire community. May God bless them all and may his memory live \non.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12252-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12252-S12253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JOHN ``JACK'' J. DRISCOLL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on the occasion of his retirement \nas executive director of the Los Angeles World Airports, LAWA, I would \nlike to recognize the important contribution Jack Driscoll has made to \nthe City of Los Angeles and to the economy of Southern California over \nthe past seven years.\n  Jack Driscoll was appointed executive director in December of 1992. \nHis record of accomplishment can best be shown in the outstanding \nquality of management and development at the city's four airports: Los \nAngeles International, LAX, Ontario International, Palmdale Regional, \nand Van Nuys.\n  Under Mr. Driscoll's financial management, LAWA has increased its \noperating income by an overwhelming 329 percent through the combination \nof reorganization, streamlining measures, and renegotiating contracts \nwith airport tenants. Revenues from non-aviation sources, including \nupdated concessions and new vendor contracts, have nearly equaled \nrevenues from aviation sources. In fact, leading investment rating \nagencies have rewarded LAX with their highest ratings for a stand-alone \nairport.\n  Even in adversity, Mr. Driscoll worked to maintain quality in service \nand operations. He was at the reins of LAWA during a major dispute \nbetween the City of Los Angeles and the airlines over landing fees. \nDuring litigation at LAX, he revived the dormant, 12-year-old plans to \nbuild new terminals at Ontario International Airport. With Mr. \nDriscoll's direction, this $270-million project was completed four \nmonths ahead of schedule and $26 million under budget. These new \nterminals put ONT in position to bring regional solutions to meet \nSouthern California's ever-growing air transport needs and made it the \nonly airport in the region with new facilities to do so.\n  In addition, Mr. Driscoll initiated the LAX Master Plan, a long-term \nprocess to guide development of LAX to meet air passenger and cargo \ndemands for the next 20 years. Since 1992, LAX has become the third \nbusiest passenger airport in the world and the second busiest air cargo \nairport in the world.\n  To offset this growth, Mr. Driscoll committed LAWA to undertake major \nnoise reduction and management programs, including nearly $500 million \nin programs for residential soundproofing\n\n[[Page S12253]]\n\nand compatible land-use; recycle water programs; and a variety of clean \nair programs, including alternative-fuel vehicles and traffic \nmitigation. All of these programs have received awards from \nenvironmental organizations and regulatory agencies for outstanding \nachievement.\n  I wish Jack Driscoll well and thank him for his contribution towards \nimproving Southern California's aviation gateway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12253-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF JIM DeFRANCIS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Jim \nUpton DeFrancis: a great politician, a great historian, and a great \nfamily man, who died on January 1 of this year.\n  Jim DeFrancis was one of the most influential people in the political \nfield, always maintaining political savvy--but not sacrificing \nperspective, an incredible sense of humor, and a belief that politics \nwas an avenue for serving others. Very early in my career, I had the \ngood fortune of working for Jim in Senator Bob Griffin's office. I will \nnever forget the many lessons I learned from him--both directly and \nsimply by working near him. One couldn't help but learn from Jim \nDeFrancis.\n  In addition to his 10 years with Senator Griffin, Jim DeFrancis was \nan integral member of the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford and \nGeorge Romney. As a member of the staff of these politicians, Jim was \nable to avoid the spotlight while serving Michigan and national \npolitics, in the honorable and professional manner for which now he is \nrecognized as a very significant member of Michigan political history.\n  Jim's love of politics was rooted in his love of history. He \nespecially enjoyed reading about Winston Churchill. An avid reader, Jim \ncollected any book on Winston Churchill that he could find, as well as \nother artifacts related to the late Prime Minister. During difficult \ntimes, Jim would look at Churchill's life as a model, gaining \ninspiration and guidance.\n  And while Jim's contribution to politics is exceptional--in his very \nactions, he inspired us to work for others through politics--his true \nlove was his family. More than anything else, Jim DeFrancis was a \nfamily man. Survived by his wife, three sons, his mother and sister, \nhis family was the real focus of his life. Everyone who came in contact \nwith him would quickly learn about his family--as he always found a way \nto bring them up in a conversation.\n  Jim DeFrancis' devotion to his family, his friends, and his career \nwas matched by few and will be deeply missed by those who knew him. We \nwill never forget Jim--crossing paths with Jim DeFrancis was sure to \nleave a lasting impact. And it is this lasting, far-reaching impact \nthat Jim's life has had on those who knew him which calls to mind a \nquote that I think Jim would appreciate, not only because it is a quote \nby Winston Churchill, but because I believe Jim would be moved to know \nwhat an influence he had on us:\n  ``This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But \nit is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12253-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BUDDY CHARLES\n\n   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to take note of an \nupcoming milestone in the career of a man from Illinois whose \nmusicianship, warmth and exuberance have brought joy to all who have \nheard him play and sing over the past 52 years.\n  On Saturday, October 9th, Mr. Buddy Charles will play the final night \nof his most recent engagement--a 9-year stand at the Drake Hotel in \nChicago. Buddy Charles is no less than a living encyclopedia of what \ncritics call the ``Golden Age'' of American popular music. During the \nperiod from about 1920 to 1950, the Gershwins, Arlens, Berlins and \nCarmichaels of the world produced a rich legacy of songs. Although \nrecorded versions of these songs are numerous, they are kept alive in a \nspecial way by entertainers such as Buddy Charles.\n  Buddy is a lifelong Chicagoan, born there 72 years ago, raised on the \nNorth Side, and a graduate of Loyola University. The roster of clubs in \nwhich he has performed since 1946 reads like a history of night life \nand entertainment in Chicago: London House, Spaghetti Bowl, Dubonnet, \nCasino, Drum Lounge. . . .\n  Perhaps his most memorable stand--chronicled frequently by the \nChicago news media--was his 18-year engagement, from 1972 to 1990, at \nthe Acorn on Oak. There he could be found, as the Chicago Tribune \nwrote, ``shouting and singing when most sensible people are sleeping \nand dreaming, the most devilishly delightful creature of the city \nnight.''\n  And it was there that Buddy became the favorite entertainer of two of \nChicago's most famous personalities--Mike Royko and Harry Caray. When \nMike's memorial service was held two years ago in Wrigley Field, there \nwas Buddy at home plate, playing and singing Royko's favorite song.\n  Buddy's music and personality have provided refuge, relief and \ndelight to four generations of music lovers. And through all those \nyears, he has also been a loving husband to his wife of 45 years, Pat, \na caring father to their now-grown children Teresa, Christopher, \nTabitha and Amanda, and a daily churchgoer and teacher of catechism.\n  He has given himself to thousands of people through his music. \nAlthough it is a little sad that he won't be dispensing his brand of \njoy on a nightly basis any more, it is reassuring to know he is \navailable to play when someone asks.\n  My sincerest good wishes to Buddy Charles and his family on this \nimportant occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12253-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FREDERIK MEIJER GARDENS DEDICATION OF LEONARDO DA VINCI SCULPTURE, IL \n                                CAVALLO\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \ncongratulate Frederik Meijer and the Frederik Meijer Gardens as they \nunveil and dedicate the Da Vinci sculpture Il Cavallo (the horse).\n  Frederik Meijer's incredible generosity and foresight enabled Il \nCavallo to be seen at its permanent home in the Frederik Meijer \nGardens. In an effort to fulfill his dream of creating a world class \nsculpture garden Frederik Meijer and the City of Milan, Italy (where an \nidentical sculpture is located) allowed for the work of Da Vinci to be \nrecommissioned and created. Il Cavallo was originally sketched and \ncommissioned by Da Vinci in 1482 and he continued to work on it for \nfourteen years. However, the bronze intended to cast the sculpture was \nused to make cannons to defend the city of Milan, therefore Da Vinci \nnever completed the work.\n  In 1977, after reading an article about the horse that Da Vinci never \nhad the chance to create, amateur sculpture and pilot, Charles Dent \ncreated the first model of Il Cavallo. After his death in 1994 Nina \nAkamu sculpted the Il Cavallo that is on display today. The sculpture \nwas cast using twenty thousand pounds of bronze, stands twenty-four \nfeet tall and weighs fifteen tons.\n  Frederik Meijer is to be thanked and commended for carrying out his \nvision and giving a world class gift to the city of Grand Rapids and \nthe people of Michigan. Nearly five hundred years ago Da Vinci had the \nvision for this great horse. Due to the acts of Frederik Meijer, a \ngreat humanitarian, this rare and magnificent work of art will stand \ntall in the Frederik Meijer Gardens for all to see for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/07/senate-section/article/S12253-4", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12253-S12254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THOSE KILLED AND INJURED IN EARTHQUAKES IN \n                           TURKEY AND GREECE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.
