Mr. President, I understand the Democrat leader has a \nstatement to make. Let me just say to our colleagues, we are going to \ntake up the bill providing loan guarantees to those who would develop \nthe technology and make the investments to bring local television to \nrural America. We expect there to be opening statements this morning. \nLet me say, since there is no one here on the other side to debate the \nissue, I intend at some point to ask unanimous consent that we might \nhave an hour or so for opening statements and then I might be \nrecognized to offer an amendment at that point. If there is an \nobjection to that, then I will go ahead and offer an amendment at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  Let me say we should have votes throughout the day. We are confident \nwe will finish this bill today--or we hope to.\n  Following the disposition of this bill, there will be a cloture vote \non the motion to proceed to the gasoline tax legislation. After the \ncloture vote, the Senate will begin a period of morning business with \nstatements expected by Senator Brownback on the marriage penalty.\n  I thank our colleagues for their attention.\n  Mr. President, before I go into a discussion of the bill, I ask \nunanimous consent I might yield to the Democrat leader to make a \nstatement on his leadership time, and then that I might be recognized \nto make the initial opening statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the two managers of the bill are on \nthe floor, the Senator from Texas asked that there be an hour for \nopening statements. The Senator from Maryland, the manager on the \nminority side, thinks that is a good idea.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, that being the case, let me ask unanimous \nconsent, following the comments of the acting Democrat leader, that \nthere be an hour equally divided for opening statements and that at the \nconclusion of that hour I be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1925-7", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1925-S1926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GAS TAX REPEAL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to take a little while this morning \nto lay the foundation for a vote we will be taking later today. There \nis going to be a limited amount of time to talk about the cloture vote \non the gas tax repeal.\n  No one is happy about the cost of gasoline in America today. It is \nsomething of which we are all aware, especially those of us on the west \ncoast. In the State of Nevada, there are places where gas can cost more \nthan $2 a gallon. In California, that is the rule rather than the \nexception.\n  However, what the majority is attempting to do today, in moving this \nlegislation forward, is something that should not take place. The bill \nwas placed on the calendar under what we call rule XIV. That means it \nis acted on in an expedited fashion. It goes right here. It has not had \na single hearing in the Finance Committee, the committee of \njurisdiction. There is no companion bill that has passed the House. If \nthis bill is passed by this body, only two things can happen: No. 1, it \nwill lie here on the desk indefinitely; or, No. 2, it can be sent to \nthe\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\nHouse where it will be automatically blue slipped, meaning that the \nbill is dead. So it is quite clear the repeal of the gas tax is nothing \nmore than an effort to make a political statement, and I think the \npolitical statement is not appropriate.\n  If the majority is serious about this matter, it should call up, for \nexample, the House-passed tax bill. There is one there, H.R. 3081, \ndealing with minimum wage and various other tax matters.\n  I do not believe there is anyone in this body who does not want a tax \ndecrease on fuel. But this is not the way to go about it. Let's keep in \nmind where we are. OPEC has agreed to produce more oil. In addition to \nthat, there are other nations, such as Mexico and Norway, that have \nagreed to produce more oil. It is going to take some time before these \ngas prices go down, but they will.\n  To show how really frail in logic the majority is on this matter, \nthey recognize it should be just a short-term fix. That is, by the end \nof the year a certain mechanical thing would happen that would \nreestablish the tax. Remember, we are talking about a tax of 4.3 cents \nper gallon. So I think the action by the majority leader is wrong.\n  There are a lot of things we can do, I think, to meet some of the \ndemands for fuel we have in this country. For example, there are \n300,000 barrels of oil every day produced in our country, in Alaska, \nthat are shipped to Asia. Should that oil not be shipped to the United \nStates? Obviously, the answer is yes.\n  There is also every reason to believe there are things we can do to \nlessen our dependency on this foreign oil. We could develop alternative \nfuels. I think we could improve the efficiency of energy use through \ndifferent economy measures. One of the things we have not done for many \nyears is advance and enhance fuel efficiency standards, what we call \nCAFE. Given the modern technology that we have, there is no reason in \nthe world we cannot produce automobiles in America that are more fuel \nefficient. We did it once before, and it was tremendous. It was unheard \nof, that cars would get over 20 miles to the gallon of gasoline, but we \nwere able to do that through modern technology.\n  We need to promote renewable energy. In what ways? Geothermal, solar, \nwind. As soon as the energy crisis was over, it seemed we backed off \nfrom that as a government. We fight every year in this Senate Chamber. \nEvery year, there is a battle. I am the ranking member of the Energy \nand Water Development Subcommittee on Appropriations. Senator Domenici, \nfrom New Mexico, is the chairman. We have an ongoing battle in here \nevery year, trying to get more money for alternative energy programs--\ngeothermal, solar, wind.\n  There are other things that simply need to be done that are not being \ndone. Reducing the price of fuel by 4.3 cents a gallon for part of a \nyear is not the solution to the problem.\n  It is important that we recognize some of the things that are being \nwritten around the country. There are lots of things being written \nabout how foolish it would be to reduce the price of gas for part of \nthe year by 4.3 cents a gallon, especially when one keeps in mind the \ntremendous infrastructure needs in this country.\n  Take, for instance, the State of Nevada. I hope to travel to Nevada \ntomorrow to be part of a very large celebration. That celebration will \ndeal with cutting a ribbon to open a highway project, the largest \npublic works project in the history of the State of Nevada, except for \nHoover Dam and a few other programs. Certainly, without question, it is \nthe largest public works project that relates to highways. This one \nthing we call the spaghetti bowl cost $100 million.\n  Those moneys came from this tax. When the American consumer goes to \nthe fuel pump and buys gasoline, there is money taken every time, about \n18 cents a gallon, and put into a trust fund. That money can be used \nfor the construction of roads, bridges, highways. That is why I am able \nto go to Las Vegas tomorrow and cut the ribbon on this project. It will \nalleviate traffic problems significantly in that area.\n  These programs take place all over America, and if we cut this \nprogram, if we eliminate this 4.3-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax, it will \nmean we will not have approximately $6 billion a year for construction \nprojects around the country.\n  That is why there is a bipartisan effort to defeat this foolish \nproposal to take away this tax.\n  I was here yesterday afternoon when Senator Warner of Virginia, who \nserves, and has served for many years, on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and is one of the senior members of that committee, \nsaid it is not the right thing to do. Sitting in the position of \nPresiding Officer yesterday was Senator Voinovich of Ohio. He was \nrelieved of his duties as Presiding Officer and came down and gave a \nspeech as to why this should not be done.\n  I hope we will look at this and realize that papers all over America, \nnot the least of which is the New York Times, talks about the \n``Gasoline Tax Follies.'' This means it is simply a foolish thing to \ndo.\n  Quoting from the New York Times:\n\n       Let's start with why the oil cartel should love this \n     proposal.\n       Put yourself in the position of an OPEC minister: What sets \n     the limits to how high you want to push oil prices? The \n     answer is that you are afraid that too high a price will lead \n     people to use less gasoline, heating oil and so on. Suppose, \n     however, that you can count on the U.S. Government to reduce \n     gasoline taxes whenever the price of crude oil rises. Then \n     Americans are less likely to reduce their oil consumption if \n     you conspire to drive prices up--which makes such a \n     conspiracy a considerably more attractive proposition.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       A cynic might suggest that that is the point.\n\n  They are being critical in this article, among other things, about \nGov. George W. Bush pushing for repeal of this gas tax. In fact, they \nsay, as others say, it appears his solution to all the problems in \nAmerica today is tax reduction. For example, we know he wants over a $1 \ntrillion tax cut over the next few years. The American people do not \naccept this. Why? Because they think it is more important that we have \ntargeted tax cuts and we also spend these moneys, if we have extra \nmoneys, to do something about education, to fix the prescription drug \nproblem we have with Medicare, make sure we bolster Social Security, \nand, most important, that we do something to reduce the $5 trillion \ndebt that has accumulated.\n\n  This New York Times article goes on to state:\n\n       A cynic might suggest that that is the point. But I'd \n     rather think that Mr. Bush isn't deliberately trying to throw \n     his friends in the oil industry a few extra billions; I \n     prefer to believe that the candidate, or whichever adviser \n     decided to make gasoline taxes an issue, was playing a \n     political rather than a financial game. . . .\n       This is one case in which a tax cut would lead directly to \n     cutbacks in a necessary and popular government service.\n\n  I hope the Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, will resoundingly defeat \nthis effort to roll back this 4.3-cents-a-gallon gas tax. There are \nother places we can look to move taxes back or adjust taxes. Certainly, \nthis is not one of those places. We need to do better than this.\n  I repeat, I hope in a bipartisan fashion this afternoon we will \ndefeat the motion to invoke cloture on the repeal of the 4.3-cents-a-\ngallon gas tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

To the extent the Administrator is delegated \n     such authority, the Administrator shall comply with the terms \n     of this Act applicable to the Board.\n       (d) Requirements and Criteria Applicable to Approval.--\n       (1) In general.--The Board shall utilize the underwriting \n     criteria developed under subsection (g), and any relevant \n     information provided by the departments and agencies with \n     which the Board consults under section 3, to determine which \n     loans may be eligible for a loan guarantee under this Act.\n       (2) Prerequisites.--In addition to meeting the underwriting \n     criteria under paragraph (1), a loan may not be guaranteed \n     under this Act unless--\n       (A) the loan is made to finance the acquisition, \n     improvement, enhancement, construction, deployment, launch, \n     or rehabilitation of the means by which local television \n     broadcast signals will be delivered to an unserved area or \n     underserved area;\n       (B) the proceeds of the loan will not be used for operating \n     expenses;\n       (C) the proposed project, as determined by the Board in \n     consultation with the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration, is not likely to have a \n     substantial adverse impact on competition that outweighs the \n     benefits of improving access to the signals of a local \n     television station in an unserved area or underserved area;\n       (D) the loan is provided by an insured depository \n     institution (as that term is defined in section 3 of the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Act) that is acceptable to the \n     Board, and has terms, in the judgment of the Board, that are \n     consistent in material respects with the terms of similar \n     obligations in the private capital market;\n       (E) repayment of the loan is required to be made within a \n     term of the lesser of--\n       (i) 25 years from the date of the execution of the loan; or\n       (ii) the economically useful life, as determined by the \n     Board or in consultation with persons or entities deemed \n     appropriate by the Board, of the primary assets to be used in \n     the delivery of the signals concerned; and\n       (F) the loan meets any additional criteria developed under \n     subsection (g).\n       (3) Protection of united states financial interests.--The \n     Board may not approve the guarantee of a loan under this Act \n     unless--\n       (A) the Board has been given documentation, assurances, and \n     access to information, persons, and entities necessary, as \n     determined by the Board, to address issues relevant to the \n     review of the loan by the Board for purposes of this Act; and\n       (B) the Board makes a determination in writing that--\n       (i) to the best of its knowledge upon due inquiry, the \n     assets, facilities, or equipment covered by the loan will be \n     utilized economically and efficiently;\n       (ii) the terms, conditions, security, and schedule and \n     amount of repayments of principal and the payment of interest \n     with respect to the loan protect the financial interests of \n     the United States and are reasonable;\n       (iii) to the extent possible, the value of collateral \n     provided by an applicant is at least equal to the unpaid \n     balance of the loan amount covered by the loan guarantee (the \n     ``Amount'' for purposes of this clause); and if the value of \n     collateral provided by an applicant is less than the Amount, \n     the additional required collateral is provided by any \n     affiliate of the applicant; and if the combined value of \n     collateral provided by an applicant and any affiliate is not \n     at least equal to the Amount, the collateral from such \n     affiliate represents all of such affiliate's assets;\n       (iv) all necessary and required regulatory and other \n     approvals, spectrum rights, and delivery permissions have \n     been received for the loan, the project under the loan, and \n     the Other Debt, if any, under subsection (f)(2)(B);\n       (v) the loan would not be available on reasonable terms and \n     conditions without a loan guarantee under this Act; and\n       (vi) repayment of the loan can reasonably be expected.\n       (e) Considerations.--\n       (1) Type of market.--\n       (A) Priority considerations.--To the maximum extent \n     practicable, the Board shall give priority in the approval of \n     loan guarantees under this Act in the following order: First, \n     to projects that will serve the greatest number of households \n     in unserved areas; and second, to projects that will serve \n     the greatest number of households in underserved areas. In \n     each instance, the Board shall consider the project's \n     estimated cost per household to be served.\n       (B) Prohibition.--The Board may not approve a loan \n     guarantee under this Act for a project that is designed \n     primarily to serve 1 or more of the 40 most populated \n     designated market areas (as that term is defined in \n     section 122(j) of title 17, United States Code).\n       (2) Other considerations.--The Board shall consider other \n     factors, which shall include projects that would--\n       (A) offer a separate tier of local broadcast signals, but \n     for applicable Federal, State, or local laws or regulations;\n       (B) provide lower projected costs to consumers of such \n     separate tier; and\n       (C) enable the delivery of local broadcast signals \n     consistent with the purpose of this Act by a means reasonably \n     compatible with existing systems or devices predominantly in \n     use.\n       (f) Guarantee Limits.--\n       (1) Limitation on aggregate value of loans.--The aggregate \n     value of all loans for which loan guarantees are issued under \n     this Act (including the unguaranteed portion of loans issued \n     under paragraph (2)(A)) and Other Debt under paragraph (2)(B) \n     may not exceed $1,250,000,000.\n       (2) Guarantee level.--A loan guarantee issued under this \n     Act--\n       (A) may not exceed an amount equal to 80 percent of a loan \n     meeting in its entirety the requirements of subsection \n     (d)(2)(A). If only a portion of a loan meets the requirements \n     of that subsection, the Board shall determine that percentage \n     of the loan meeting such requirements\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\n     (the ``applicable portion'') and may issue a loan guarantee \n     in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the applicable \n     portion; or\n       (B) may, as to a loan meeting in its entirety the \n     requirements of subsection (d)(2)(A), cover the amount of \n     such loan only if that loan is for an amount not exceeding 80 \n     percent of the total debt financing for the project, and \n     other debt financing (also meeting in its entirety the \n     requirements of subsection (d)(2)(A)) from the same source \n     for a total amount not less than 20 percent of the total debt \n     financing for the project (``Other Debt'') has been approved.\n       (g) Underwriting Criteria.--Within the period provided for \n     under subsection (b)(1), the Board shall, in consultation \n     with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and \n     an independent public accounting firm, develop underwriting \n     criteria relating to the guarantee of loans that are \n     consistent with the purpose of this Act, including \n     appropriate collateral and cash flow levels for loans \n     guaranteed under this Act, and such other matters as the \n     Board considers appropriate.\n       (h) Credit Risk Premiums.--\n       (1) Establishment and acceptance.--The Board may establish \n     and approve the acceptance of credit risk premiums with \n     respect to a loan guarantee under this Act in order to cover \n     the cost, as determined under section 504(b)(1) of the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, of the loan guarantee. To \n     the extent that appropriations of budget authority are \n     insufficient to cover the cost, as so determined, of a loan \n     guarantee under this Act, credit risk premiums shall be \n     accepted from a non-Federal source under this subsection on \n     behalf of the applicant for the loan guarantee.\n       (2) Credit risk premium amount.--\n       (A) In general.--The Board shall determine the amount of \n     any credit risk premium to be accepted with respect to a loan \n     guarantee under this Act on the basis of--\n       (i) the financial and economic circumstances of the \n     applicant for the loan guarantee, including the amount of \n     collateral offered;\n       (ii) the proposed schedule of loan disbursements;\n       (iii) the business plans of the applicant for providing \n     service;\n       (iv) any financial commitment from a broadcast signal \n     provider; and\n       (v) the concurrence of the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget as to the amount of the credit risk \n     premium.\n       (B) Proportionality.--To the extent that appropriations of \n     budget authority are sufficient to cover the cost, as \n     determined under section 504(b)(1) of the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act of 1990, of loan guarantees under this Act, the \n     credit risk premium with respect to each loan guarantee shall \n     be reduced proportionately.\n       (C) Payment of premiums.--Credit risk premiums under this \n     subsection shall be paid to an account (the ``Escrow \n     Account'') established in the Treasury which shall accrue \n     interest and such interest shall be retained by the account, \n     subject to subparagraph (D).\n       (D) Deductions from escrow account.--If a default occurs \n     with respect to any loan guaranteed under this Act and the \n     default is not cured in accordance with the terms of the \n     underlying loan or loan guarantee agreement, the \n     Administrator, in accordance with subsections (h) and (i) of \n     section 5 of this Act, shall liquidate, or shall cause to be \n     liquidated, all assets collateralizing such loan as to which \n     it has a lien or security interest. Any shortfall between the \n     proceeds of the liquidation net of costs and expenses \n     relating to the liquidation, and the guarantee amount paid \n     pursuant to this Act shall be deducted from funds in the \n     Escrow Account and credited to the Administrator for payment \n     of such shortfall. At such time as determined under \n     subsection (d)(2)(E) when all loans guaranteed under this Act \n     have been repaid or otherwise satisfied in accordance with \n     this Act and the regulations promulgated hereunder, remaining \n     funds in the Escrow Account, if any, shall be refunded, on a \n     pro rata basis, to applicants whose loans guaranteed under \n     this Act were not in default, or where any default was cured \n     in accordance with the terms of the underlying loan or loan \n     guarantee agreement.\n       (i) Judicial Review.--The decision of the Board to approve \n     or disapprove the making of a loan guarantee under this Act \n     shall not be subject to judicial review.\n\n     SEC. 5.

There will now be 1 hour for general debate \nequally divided. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, at the end of the last session of Congress, \nwe passed a very important piece of legislation establishing the legal \nframework whereby local television stations and satellites could \nnegotiate contracts under which television broadcasts could be carried \nby satellite.\n  In the midst of that conference, a sizable majority of the conference \ncommittee members from the House and the Senate concluded there was a \nproblem in rural America that the bill they were considering would not \naddress: that there were substantial economic impediments to the \ndevelopment of systems that would deliver the local television \nbroadcast into remote, isolated, and rural areas of the country.\n  In trying to deal with this situation, with all the time constraints \nin the midst of a conference, an effort was made to write a loan \nguarantee into that bill. That loan guarantee program has subsequently \nbeen offered in the House and is pending before the House committee. \nAnd when I talk about it again, I will be talking about the bill as \nintroduced in the House.\n  There was great concern at that time about how the system would work \nand what it would cost. As a result of numerous negotiations and a lot \nof good will, a decision was made to drop that provision at the end of \nthe last session with a commitment I made that, by the end of this \nmonth, we would report a loan guarantee bill from the Banking Committee \nto address this very real concern. I am happy to say that on a \nbipartisan basis we reported such a bill by unanimous vote and we, in \ndoing so, fulfilled the commitment we made at the end of the last \nsession.\n  Rather than go through a fairly complicated bill in detail, I will \nfocus in my opening statement on the problems we face--why it is \ndifficult--why there are economic perils involved--in guaranteeing \nloans to do something that has never been done before using technology \nthat is unproven, why it is so expensive to do this, and then how we \nhave tried to deal with each of these problems.\n  It is important to remember that when the Congressional Budget Office \nlooked at the loan guarantee program pending in the House of \nRepresentatives, they concluded that of the loan guarantees that would \nbe made--and let's be precise, a loan guarantee is where the taxpayers \nare committed to stand in the place of the borrower should the borrower \ndefault--roughly 45 percent of the $1.25 billion worth of loans made \nunder that bill will be defaulted.\n  When I say defaulted, I am not saying just that the borrower would be \nunable to pay that face amount. I am saying that if one looks at the \nCBO estimate--which is an estimate of the present value of the losses \nthey estimate will arrive, remembering that a loss 20 years from now is \ndiscounted using the Government's cost of borrowing--what they \nconcluded was, as the bill is structured in the House, we were looking \nat the potential of the taxpayers paying 45 percent of the cost of \nthese loan guarantees as a result of their being defaulted and \nultimately not being repaid.\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\n  The Banking Committee, in looking at this number, concluded that it \npresented an unacceptable risk for the American taxpayer.\n  Sometimes people get confused by these estimated CBO costs because \nthe cost often looks low because it is the present value of a default \nwhich would occur 10 years, 20 years, even 25 years from now.\n  But basically, the CBO analysis of the House bill is that we are \nlooking at a potential default rate of about 45 percent.\n  How did we try to deal with that?\n  We held a set of hearings where we heard from experts in industry, \nand we worked with the Congressional Budget Office. We decided there \nwere two ways we could reduce the probability the taxpayer was going to \nend up paying off these loans.\n  One way we could do would be to set up a board that could exercise \nindependent judgment as to the quality of the project being proposed \nand the risks that were involved, and that we could put someone who was \nresponsible, who had knowledge of financial markets, and who was \nresponsible to the taxpayer, in a position to make that judgment.\n  We concluded we should have a board made up of the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and the Secretary \nof Agriculture, or their designees--but their designees would have to \nbe people who were appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  Our first line of defense is the good judgment and prudence of the \nthree people on this board. The House would give that basically to a \nGovernment agency, but we have rejected that.\n  Our second and, by far, our more important line of defense is that we \ndo not guarantee the entire loan. The loan would have only an 80-\npercent guarantee.\n  What this means is, when a private lender makes this loan, they are \ngoing to be liable for 20 percent. The protection we get from that \nrequirement is not just that they lose the first 20 percent, and then \nwe lose the other 80 percent, if the loan goes bad--that is important; \nand we guarantee that the taxpayer is protected first, unlike the House \nbill--but what we get is far more important because with a private \nlender, if they are liable for 20 percent of the money, they are going \nto perform their due diligence, they are going to scrutinize this loan, \nand they are going to realize that if the loan goes bad, they are going \nto lose 20 percent of the money they have lent.\n  As we initially wrote this bill--in fact, the language of the bill as \nreported out of the Banking Committee I will amend in our first \namendment today in an effort to reach a compromise--the logic was that \nwe would have a private lender. The language of the bill requires that \nthey be FDIC insured, that they would make the loan, and that they \nwould be liable for 20 percent of the cost.\n  Why is this so important? We are not talking about making a loan to \ndeliver electricity to rural America, where we have a captive customer \nbase, where someone cannot buy electricity from anybody else. We are \nnot talking about making a loan to deliver telephone service to rural \nAmerica where you either buy from the telephone co-op or you do not \nhave a telephone. We are talking about a very risky business where \nthere will be no guaranteed ratepayer. Nothing in this bill--nothing in \nlaw--requires any American living in a rural area to buy these \nservices. So there is no captive base. When we get to the discussion of \nthe amendment I will offer, we are going to be discussing this in \ndetail because this is very important.\n  The second important risk is, no one has ever done what we are \nproposing to do. We have one company proposing to use a satellite, \nwhich has a directed beam so that it would send a signal into a \ngeographic area, and they are pretty confident it is going to work. In \nfact, they are going to invest over $1 billion to build such a system \nto basically service these top 40 markets in terms of viewership.\n\n  But the plain truth is, no one has ever used that satellite. So while \nwe hope it will work, while we have reason to believe it will work, and \nwhile the fact that somebody is willing to invest $1 billion in it \nsuggests to me it might very well work, we do not know it will work. It \nhas never been proven on the scale we are talking about.\n  But there is a second and more fundamental risk. It is one that I \nthink, in our rush to do something here, we want to look beyond. It is \nnot the risk that the technology does not work.\n  Let's say we are talking about a satellite--and our bill is neutral \nin terms of technology--but let's say someone comes in and asks for a \nloan of $1.25 billion to build and launch and put into orbit a directed \nbeam satellite. Obviously, you have the risk that somehow the system \ndoes not work, it is not launched into orbit. Maybe they would buy \ninsurance. I assume a lender would require that. Maybe it would work; \nmaybe it wouldn't work.\n  But let's say it does work. The biggest risk you face in dealing with \nnew technology is we have no guarantee, that if someone borrowed $1.25 \nbillion and we guaranteed 80 percent of it --and it worked perfectly--\nthat 2 years from now some young computer genius, getting a degree in \ncomputer science at Texas A, might not develop a technology that \nwould use the Internet to deliver the local TV signal and would do it \nat one one-thousandth of the cost of this satellite.\n  I say to my colleagues, if that happened, obviously, it would be a \ngodsend for rural America because then everybody would have local \ntelevision, and they would have it inexpensively, but it would not be a \ngodsend for the taxpayer because we all know that if that happened, \nwhich would be the answer to someone's prayer, it would not be the \nanswer to the taxpayer's prayer. The company that launched that \nsatellite and invested $1.25 billion in it would lose every customer \nthey had to someone who could sell for one one-thousandth of their \ncost.\n  Let me say, this isn't just theoretical, this is happening every day \nin America.\n  The taxpayer would be on the hook for over $800 million of losses.\n  This is risky business, which is why the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the House bill will have a default rate of roughly 45 \ncents out of every $1 that is loaned. That is risky business.\n  We have tried to deal with this by establishing a loan board to \nexercise due diligence, requiring a private lender, as it is now \nwritten, and an FDIC-insured lender, so basically we are talking about \nan institution that is in business to make money, and they are going to \nbe making loans. They can make loans to anybody--to REA or to a \nprivate, for-profit company. They know as the bill is now written, they \nare going to be liable for 20 percent of that loan. If it goes bad, \nthey will lose that money.\n\n  It is my understanding that we are going to have a series of \namendments that assault, in my opinion, these two basic protections of \nthis bill. One amendment, which has been discussed, is the amendment to \nlet Government lend the money. I totally and absolutely reject that. If \nwe let Government lend any of this money, we destroy the whole \nfoundation of this bill. Our protection is, if Chase Manhattan is \nlending this money, they are liable for 20 percent of the money. If the \nloan goes bad, they lose that money, and somebody will probably lose \ntheir job. So they are going to be paying attention to their business.\n  On the other hand, if we allow an amendment which says the Government \ncan make the loan guaranteed part directly, we are eliminating some of \nthe due diligence that is at the very heart of this bill and which CBO \nhas scored as lowering the cost of this loan by $100 million.\n  The second proposal that is going to be made, a proposal I am going \nto accept but with a very important amendment, relates to the CFC, \nwhich is the Cooperative Finance Corporation. This is basically a \ncaptive lender of the REA. It is an entity that is given tax exemption. \nWhy is it given tax exemption? It is given tax exemption because it is \nserving a public purpose: it is a lending institution that historically \nhas lent money to REAs to provide telephone service and electric power.\n  The important difference between a loan to provide telephone service \nor electric power and a loan to launch a satellite or to invest in an \nunproven technology is twofold. One, we have been doing phones a long \ntime. We have been generating power for over 100 years. We know how to \ndo it. There is no uncertainty about the technology of\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\ntelephones and power generation in a traditional sense.\n  Second, in these activities, they have captive customers. Where I am \nan REA customer, I can't buy power from anybody else. So if a mistake \nis made, there is an easy way to cover it up--raise my rates. There \nwon't be an easy way to cover up a mistake here because there won't be \nany captive ratepayer whose rate can be raised.\n  Let me make it clear, I have the highest opinion of the CFC. I think \nit has done a great job. It was chartered and given a tax subsidy to do \nthat job in the public interest, and I think it does that job well. But \nI believe we are taking an unnecessary risk in letting the CFC make \nthese loans. I am willing to do that as part of an effort to have a \nbipartisan compromise but only under the following circumstances:\n  No. 1, what we are being asked to do is take out of the bill the \nrequirement that the lender be FDIC insured. When we do that, we open \nup this whole process to institutions that we may never have \nconsidered. So we have two sort of boilerplate requirements. One is, if \nit is a traditional financial institution, they have to meet two \nrequirements: First, no self-dealing; that is, they can't lend the \nmoney to themselves, so to speak; and, second, they have to meet the \nnormal capital requirement, which is, you can't lend more than 10 or, \nin some cases, 15 percent of your capital to any one borrower.\n  Now, for the CFC, we don't impose--in the final compromise I offered \nlast night--the 10-percent loan to one borrower restriction. I would \nprefer it, but I know that some of my colleagues are opposed to it \nbecause CFC is opposed to it.\n  What we require is the following: To be sure we are talking about CFC \nand not some other Government or some other nonprofit entity that none \nof us have thought about, we say that to qualify, a nonprofit \ninstitution must have one of the three highest credit ratings on a \nlong-term bond. Some people have gotten confused between a credit \nrating on a long-term bond and a credit rating on any commercial paper. \nAlmost any institution can issue a 30-day note that will be AAA rated. \nWe are talking about lending for 25 years here, so the fact that \nsomebody can get a good rating for short-term borrowing, what we want \nto know is their rating for long-term lending. That is what is \nsignificant.\n\n  The first requirement is that those nonprofits that can participate \nmust have one of the top three ratings and the Cooperative Finance \nCorporation qualifies.\n  The second requirement, which I think is of equal importance, is that \nthe board must find that by making this loan the Cooperative Finance \nCorporation will not see its credit rating decline, that in making the \nloan they are not jeopardizing the good credit they have.\n  Why is that important? We have, as best I can estimate--and we are \ntrying to get the final number--25 million Americans who are captive \nratepayers. They are customers of REA for telephone and for electric \npower--one or the other and, in some cases, both. If the rating of the \nCFC in borrowing money to lend principally to co-ops is diminished by \nmaking this loan, every ratepayer of every co-op in America will end up \npaying more because this happened. We want to prevent that from \nhappening. I am going to argue all day long, if I have to, that we \nshould not imperil 25 million Americans who are captive ratepayers by \nallowing CFC to get into a risky business that can push down their \ncredit rating.\n  What I am proposing and will propose in the first amendment, when the \ngeneral debate is over, is that we let CFC make the loans but that the \nboard has to find that, in making the loans, CFC is not going to \ndowngrade its creditworthiness, and in the process impose new costs on \nratepayers.\n  Finally, if their creditworthiness does decline, then they would be \nrequired, in an arm's length transaction, to sell this note on the open \nmarket. I think these are important requirements.\n  Someone may argue that the CFC has engaged in providing television \nservices. That is a real stretch because what really happened is the \nco-ops borrowed $100 million to enter into a contract with Direct \nTelevision where they were the marketing arm of Direct Television. As \nit turns out, over 80 percent of what they were doing, they have \nsubsequently sold off to a private company named Pegasus that is a long \nway from launching a satellite and engaging in this business.\n  Let me sum up.\n  I think we have put together a well-crafted bill. To this point, this \nbill costs $100 million less than the House bill. It is still risky \nbusiness. Let's remember that if this loan is defaulted, rural America \nis probably going to lose its television service.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at the amendment I have offered, and I \nhope it can be accepted.\n  I thank all members of the Banking Committee, Republicans and \nDemocrats, for the bipartisanship we had in committee.\n  I thank Senator Conrad Burns. I thank him for his leadership. There \nis no question that we would not be here today were it not for his \npersistence. I also thank him for not only trying to get television \nsignals to rural America but trying to do it in the right way. It is \nvery easy when you are trying to deal with all the groups that hope to \nbenefit from some program such as this to just throw caution to the \nwind and say don't worry about the cost. I thank Senator Burns not only \nfor the leadership in seeing that we are writing this bill, but for his \nleadership in seeing that we are doing it right.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very brief because Senator \nJohnson is going to handle the time on this side. He has been very \nintimately involved in shaping this legislation and has done an \noutstanding job and I think made a major contribution.\n  The bill that is now before us is a consequence of a unanimous \nconsent agreement that was reached last year. Much discussion took \nplace within the committee. As a consequence, we were able to move \nconsiderably closer on many of the issues that divided Members when we \nfirst addressed S. 2097. In fact, I think it is fair to say, with the \nexception of the issue Senator Johnson will raise on the floor, we have \na consensus product before us that we can move through in short order.\n  We seek a loan guarantee program that will provide comprehensive \ntelevision service for the American people at the best possible price. \nWe are particularly concerned about rural Americans who have either no \naccess or inadequate access to local television service. We seek to \nobtain that for them at an affordable price and yet, at the same time, \nprotect the American taxpayer as we move forward with the loan \nguarantee program. Obviously, you have to strike the right balance \namong these objectives. I think the bill, with the Johnson amendment, \nwith the proposal of the very able Senator from South Dakota, would \naccomplish that.\n  The chairman has gone over some of the specific provisions of the \nbill. I think it is important to note that the board we are providing, \nwhich will grant the loan guarantees, is made up from the Federal \nReserve, the Treasury, and the Department of Agriculture. The day-to-\nday administration of the program would be done by the Rural Utilities \nService, which would also write the regulations, subject to the \napproval of the board. The Rural Utilities Service is the most \nexperienced agency in the Federal Government in dealing with this type \nof investment in rural areas. Therefore, we think they have a clear \nunderstanding of what is involved.\n  The guarantee level provided in the legislation is 80 percent. That \ndiffers, of course, from the House bill. It is designed to provide some \nadditional safeguards. We also worked to ensure that the legislation \nwould give priority to the projects seeking to provide services to \nareas in this country that are unserved and underserved, as we move \ntoward trying to provide a universal service.\n  Senator Johnson led the effort on our side. We were markedly assisted \nby Senator Baucus, Senator Harkin, and many others. I know there are a \nnumber of Senators on the Republican side of the aisle, too, who come \nfrom rural areas who are very deeply concerned about this issue.\n  Let me touch on the one important improvement that I hope will be \nmade to this legislation, and that is the\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\nJohnson initiative. The bill, as it is now before us, requires that the \nlenders involved in this program be FDIC insured. That is the \nrequirement in the bill as it now stands. Many believe this is \nunnecessarily restrictive, that there are a number of other lenders \nand, in particular, the National Rural Utilities' Cooperative Finance \nCorporation, the CFC, which would be barred from participating in the \nprogram as the bill now stands.\n  Senator Johnson is intending to address that issue. Actually, the \nlender we are talking about--the Cooperative Finance Corporation--is \nextremely well capitalized. It has over 11 percent shareholders' equity \ncapital, which is better than 9 of the 10 largest banks in the country. \nThe credit rating agencies rate CFC's debt as high as any of the \nlargest federally insured banks and higher than most. So by these \nmarket standards, they are an extremely strong and well-managed \nfinancial institution. I see no reason to exclude it from the program. \nI think we can adjust to accommodate this issue.\n\n  I think we can achieve a broad, if not total, consensus on this \nlegislation. I think, in fact, including lenders of this nature in the \nprogram will help to encourage the participation of organizations, such \nas rural cooperatives that have the most experience in doing business \nin rural areas and therefore make it more likely that the program will \nreach its ultimate goal of universal service in rural areas.\n  So I am supportive of the legislation with this change that we will \nseek to make. I think it meets all the questions and concerns that have \nbeen raised in a balanced and straightforward manner. Again, I thank \nSenator Johnson for his leadership on this issue, and I commend all the \nmembers of the committee, the chairman and all the members on his side, \nand on our side, who worked closely together to try to work out \nagreeable solutions to most of the concerns that have been expressed.\n  I think if we can address this one remaining concern on the floor in \na positive and constructive way, we will have done a good piece of \nlegislative work and will be able to move this issue forward.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. Senator Johnson will manage \nthe remainder of the time of the debate on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the time remaining on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 6 minutes. The \nSenator from South Dakota has 22 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2097, which will help \nprovide local broadcast coverage for all Americans. Under legislation \nwe passed last year, satellite companies are for the first time free to \nbroadcast local network broadcasting into local markets. What we are \ndoing today will make that benefit a reality for Americans who live \noutside the largest 40 television markets across America.\n  As do many colleagues, I represent a State with rural viewers who \nshould not be left out of the information age. South Dakota is one of \nthe 16 States that do not have a single city among the top 70 markets. \nWithout this loan guarantee, markets such as Sioux Falls and Rapid City \nsimply will not get local service, despite the fact there is a great \nneed for the reception of that local broadcasting.\n  This proposal is about more than just providing sports or \nentertainment programming over local channels. It is a critical way to \nreceive important local news, public affairs, storm information, road \nreports, public safety, school closings, and so on. Rural Americans \nneed the same opportunity to access their local networks as do our \nurban friends, and this legislation would go a long way toward making \nthat a reality.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Gramm, \nfor his hard work on this important issue. He correctly raised several \nissues which have strengthened this bill, adding critical taxpayer \nprotections to the program. I want to thank Senator Sarbanes, the \nranking member of the Banking Committee for his hard work on this \nlegislation as well.\n  As a sign of the support we have for this package, I have agreed with \nSenators Gramm and Sarbanes to oppose all amendments to the bill with \none exception. I will be offering shortly an amendment to correct a \nsignificant flaw in this bill. Other than that one change, I believe we \nhave produced a substantive bill that will produce this service to all \nAmericans without resorting to risks for the American taxpayers.\n  S. 2097 provides an 80 percent guarantee of projects to bring local \nto local to all markets. The remaining 20 percent will be private \ncapital provided by qualified lenders. These private capital will bring \nmarket discipline to the program. No entity will fund a project it has \nnot scrutinized, that it does not believe will succeed.\n  We have created an oversight board consisting of the Federal Reserve \nChairman, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of \nAgriculture. This board will review loan applicants with a eye toward \nfiscal discipline. The Fed and Treasury are especially tasked with \nensuring that the taxpayer dollars are protected. They will look \ncarefully at the proposals and support projects that will work. The \nUSDA brings expertise in rural America to this venture. The experience \nof the Rural Utilities Service, with its $40 billion loan portfolio and \nphenomenally low default rate, will make this a sound venture.\n  The combination of these experts plus the market discipline of a \nlender with 20 percent of the project at risk, will screen applicants \nso only the soundest, most viable proposals are funded.\n  With this program, we can take a giant step for rural America. All of \nour citizens will be enabled to follow local events. In states like \nSouth Dakota, wide stretches of area are not served by any form of \nlocal programming; this bill for the first time makes that possible.\n  There is one area where the bill could be improved. The bill in its \ncurrent form requires that lenders be FDIC insured to participate in \nthe program. This would effectively eliminate rural electric \ncooperatives and telephone systems from participation in the program.\n  This limitation excludes private finance corporations that have years \nof experience lending to rural utilities (including institutions that \nhave years of experience in lending guaranteed loans). It would also \nexclude institutions with billions of dollars of assets, that operate \non a national basis, are highly rated by the rating agencies and file \nwith the Securities Exchange Commission.\n  The amendment I will be offering is supported by Senators Thomas and \nGrams and others. It is bipartisan in nature. It simply allows \nqualified lenders with experience and expertise in these types of \nprograms to participate in the funding subject to board approval, \nkeeping in mind always that everything we do must be approved by the \nFederal Reserve, Treasury, and USDA. As an example, Cooperative \nFinancing Corporation is AA rated and considered to be ``the best \ninvestment in the high quality electric utility sector'' by Shearson \nLehman. These are the types of lenders that should be potentially part \nof this program.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support rural America by making S. 2097 \nmore likely to successfully provide local to local to smaller markets. \nMy amendment provides, but does not mandate, alternate financing \noptions. The purpose behind the change is to allow participants in the \nprogram to seek the lowest possible interest rate. Those dollars saved \non interest make the program more likely to succeed, and improve the \nviability of the program, making it more likely the loans will be \nrepaid without recourse to the guarantee.\n  This issue has aroused the greatest level of constituent concern in \nquite some time in my State. With this amendment to S. 2097, we will \nprovide a fiscally responsible, prudent response to the concerns raised \nby thousands of our constituents. The issue which Senator Gramm has \nably outlined this morning is in response to a concern Senators Thomas \nand Grams and I also share but to which we take a different approach.\n  The view of those of us who will be offering our amendment as a \nsecond-degree amendment, I believe, to Senator Grams' amendment would \nbe to\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\nrecognize that institutions that have years of experience in lending to \nrural electric and telephone cooperatives should not be excluded from \nparticipation.\n  Our amendment simply allows qualified lenders that have experience \nand expertise in these kinds of programs to participate subject to \nboard approval. It will also require eligible lenders that have at \nleast one issue of outstanding debt that is rated in one of the three \ncategories rated by a national statistical rating agency. This will \nensure that an expanded list of lenders will have subjected themselves \nto rigorous market discipline. The CFC and other private lenders have \nsubstantial experience providing multiple million-dollar loans in \ncooperative environments and provide important protections in rural \nareas.\n  We encourage all of our colleagues to support rural America by \nsupporting S. 2097. We are more likely to succeed in doing that by \nproviding local-to-local programming to these smaller markets.\n  Mr. President, I do not have any additional Members on the floor at \nthe moment with opening remarks. I withhold my time but yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Texas, chairman \nof the Banking Committee, and also the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee, my good friend from South Dakota, for his work on this bill.\n  We offered in the Satellite Home Viewers Act last year, an amendment \nin conference that would enable us to help people in smaller markets \naround the country. This would help people to receive their local \ntelevision signal on satellite by facilitating the delivery of these \nlocal stations in the gray areas--the B contour and the C contour where \nreception is poor --in the station's area of dominant influence.\n  I chair the Communications Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee. In \nMontana, we have great distances to cover with few people in between. \nOther States share this difficulty and also the geographical challenge \nposed by the mountains. Since the television signal is line of sight, \nmountains can make the problem of providing local coverage for people \nin hard to reach places even harder to solve. So, how do we do that? \nHow do we level the playing field and still provide the compulsory \nlicensing for cable, and for satellite television users and, of course, \nfor those local programmers?\n  I think we now have before us a better bill than the one we offered \nlast year. This bill is more complete, because it takes into account \nboth the agencies that are going to make the loans, and also those who \nwill be borrowing the money. It puts some responsibility on each of the \nparties to make sure, No. 1, that it works and, second, that they \nassume some of the risk so taxpayers' money is not in jeopardy.\n  I thank the Senate Banking Committee for their commitment in bringing \nthis issue to the Senate floor as fast as they possibly could. Their \nword has been good, and by working with the Agriculture Committee and \nalso a lot of us individually, the Banking Committee has helped us \nbuild a better bill than we had last year.\n  Providing access to local television signals is crucial to rural \nStates. With over-the-air broadcast signals and cable delivery limited \nby geography in my own State, satellite television has been a staple of \nthe so-called video marketplace for many years. Montana has the highest \npenetration level of satellite television of any State, at over 35 \npercent.\n  When I initially proposed the legislation in this area, I was \nconcerned that, without it, only the largest television markets in \nAmerica would receive local-to-local service as authorized by the \nSatellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. These are the profitable cities \nsuch as New York and Los Angeles with millions of television \nhouseholds. But it is not so profitable a venture in areas where we \nhave quite a lot of dirt between light bulbs.\n  The issue we will be debating, of course, will be the amendment \noffered by my good friend from South Dakota and the cosponsors.\n  Let's talk about the other 140 TV markets in this country. There are \n16 States, including my own, that do not have a single city in the top \n70 markets. It is time we help those 16 States gain equal footing with \nthe ones with more urban populations. Just because they are small \ndoesn't mean they should be left out of the mix when we talk about \nlocal to local, because people enjoy their local sports, they enjoy \ntheir local weather, they enjoy their local news. It doesn't do any \ngood for anybody who lives in rural Kentucky to watch a station that is \nbased out of Charlotte, NC.\n\n  We have to find ways of delivering their signal off the satellite. \nThe ability to receive local television signals is much more than just \nhaving access to local sports or entertainment programming. It is a \ncritical and an immediate way to receive local news, weather, and \ncommunity information.\n  Access to local signals is particularly critical in rural areas, such \nas Montana, when we experience flooding and other weather situations, \nincluding blizzards.\n  This is very important. The LOCAL TV Act reflects the belief that the \nloan guarantee program should not favor one technology, it should be \ntechnology neutral. It is a win-win for consumers. It is also a win-win \nfor the taxpayers, and I urge my colleagues to support this. I don't \nthink we have received more mail on any other subject since I have been \nhere. Whenever they start turning our networks off the satellite, we \nget immediate responses.\n  I look at this the way I looked at REA when I was a lad on a farm in \nnorthwest Missouri. I have made this speech many times. Had it not been \nfor the Rural Electrification Administration, we would be watching \ntelevision by candlelight. That is fact. We were in rural areas. We \nwould never have seen the build-out of electricity or power to our \nfarms and ranches.\n  We have to take the same look at smaller markets in television \nbecause the only support they get is through advertising. That \nadvertising is based on viewership, and the profitability of that \nstation is at stake and, with that, the services they provide. I think \nit is pretty important.\n  This bill is set up with a three-member board. It offers access. The \nadministration is very tight, and it also protects the taxpayer. \nRemember, the taxpayers' dollars are at stake.\n  We will move through the debate on different amendments that will \ncome up and should be debated. The concept of the bill, if passed right \nnow as it is, is darn good. There are a couple of amendments that I \nthink will improve this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nLOCAL TV Act of 2000. Last year, Congress passed a law allowing \nsatellite providers to retransmit local signals into local markets, but \nwe knew then that the large satellite providers had no plans to provide \n``local into local'' into rural areas, completely ignoring Nebraska and \n14 other states. At the time I strongly supported the inclusion of a \n$1.25 billion loan guarantee program to encourage companies to \nretransmit local signals in rural areas. Unfortunately, political \nwrangling left this important provision behind as we passed the bill.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has fulfilled its promise to pass a loan \nguarantee program before April 1, 2000. The LOCAL TV Act of 2000 will \nprovide $1.25 billion in loan guarantees to companies to bring local \nstations into currently unserved areas. Local stations are vital to a \ncommunity, broadcasting local news, sports, weather, and emergency \nwarnings. A small but significant portion of the U.S. population cannot \nreceive local television signals from any means, while as much as half \nof the population must settle for New York or Los Angeles news (so-\ncalled distant network signals) via satellite. Nebraska has over \n270,000 satellite viewers who cannot receive their local stations \nthrough their satellite dishes. This bill will provide the financial \nbacking necessary to support companies to bring local television to all \nareas of America. ``Local into local'' has become another technology \nthat urban areas are able to enjoy, while rural communities get left \nbehind. The LOCAL TV Act will ensure that does not happen.\n  I have great confidence in the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) which is \ncharged with administrating this loan guarantee program. Many previous \nprograms launched through RUS to help\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\nclose the gap between urban and rural areas have proven successful. The \npublic/private partnership between RUS and its borrowers has helped \ndevelop electric, telecommunications, and safe, clean drinking water in \nrural America. It has also fostered rural economic development across \nthe nation. I believe the RUS will administer this program with the \nsame expertise it has demonstrated in the past.\n  Bridging the so-called ``Digital Divide'' remains one of my top \npriorities. It is absurd that some areas of the country cannot receive \nhigh speed internet access, local television programming, or other \ntechnologies, simply because they live too far from a big city. I will \ncontinue to work hard to bring the newest technologies into all regions \nof Nebraska. The LOCAL TV Act of 2000 is an important step in this \ndirection, so I enthusiastically support this legislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support for S. 2097, \nthe Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television, legislation \nof which I am proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is simply about equity. Should \nsatellite customers in the rural Maine communities of Lovell and \nGreenville and Fort Fairfield have the right to receive the local \nbroadcasts of stations in Portland, Bangor, and Presque Isle, Maine? \nShould they have the ability to receive their local news, emergency \nweather forecasts, information about school closures, and the wrap-up \nof the local school sports via satellite? My answer is yes, of course, \nthey should.\n  While Congress authorized the ability of local network stations to \nbroadcast their local signals via satellite by passing the Satellite \nHome Viewer Improvement Act last November, current satellite capacity \nonly allows the top 40 to 50 television markets to receive this unique \nservice. Unfortunately, this excludes the Portland, Bangor, and Presque \nIsle, Maine, markets and the satellite customers within those markets \nwho want to view local programming.\n  This last year has been a particularly difficult and frustrating one \nfor satellite customers. We took an important step in addressing many \nof the problems they and local broadcasters have experienced by passing \nthe Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. We are, however, lacking a \nfinal component. Providing a rural loan guarantee program that is \ntechnologically-neutral, fiscally responsible, and focused on \nunderserved markets will encourage companies to bring important \ninformation access to my State's rural communities and lead us to a \nconclusion of this important issue. I urge my colleagues to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think it is now timely for me to offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I yield back the reminder of my time so \nwe can proceed with the substance of this legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2897\n\n            (Purpose: To address certain lending practices)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2897.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, strike line 22 and all that follows through \n     page 31, line 3, and insert the following:\n       ``(D)(i) the loan (including Other Debt, as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B))--\n       ``(I) is provided by any entity engaged in the business of \n     commercial lending--\n       ``(aa) if the loan is made in accordance with loan-to-one-\n     borrower and affiliate transaction restrictions to which the \n     entity is subject under applicable law; or\n       ``(bb) if subclause (aa) does not apply, the loan is made \n     only to a borrower that is not an affiliate of the entity and \n     only if the amount of the loan and all outstanding loans by \n     that entity to that borrower and any of its affiliates does \n     not exceed 10 percent of the net equity of the entity; or\n       ``(II) is provided by a nonprofit corporation engaged \n     primarily in commercial lending, if the Board determines that \n     the nonprofit corporation has one or more issues of \n     outstanding long term debt that is rated within the highest 3 \n     rating categories of a nationally recognized statistical \n     rating organization, and that such rating will not decline \n     upon the nonprofit corporation's approval and funding of the \n     loan;\n       ``(ii)(I) no loan (including Other Debt as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B)) may be made by a governmental entity or \n     affiliate thereof, or a Government-sponsored enterprise as \n     defined in section 1404(e)(1)(A) of the Financial \n     Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 \n     (12 U.S.C. 1811 note) or any affiliate thereof;\n       ``(II) any loan (including Other Debt as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B)) must have terms, in the judgment of the \n     Board, that are consistent in material respects with the \n     terms of similar obligations in the private capital market;\n       ``(III) if a nonprofit corporation fails to maintain the \n     debt rating required by subclause (i)(II), the subject loan \n     shall be sold to another entity described in clause (i) \n     through an arm's length transaction, and the Board shall by \n     regulation specify forms of acceptable documentation \n     evidencing the maintenance of such debt rating;\n       ``(IV) for purposes of subclause (i)(I)(bb), the term `net \n     equity' means the value of the issued and outstanding voting \n     and nonvoting interests of the entity, less the total \n     liabilities of the entity, as recorded under generally \n     accepted accounting principles for the fiscal quarter ended \n     immediately prior to the date on which the subject loan is \n     approved;''.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to explain the amendment and \nwhat the issue is. I know there are strong feelings on both sides of \nthe issue. I believe we have worked out 95 percent of the bill to \neverybody's satisfaction. But we now have come down to an issue. I \nreally believe that while there will be extraneous amendments offered, \nthis and possibly one other amendment might be the only amendments we \nwill be actively debating.\n  Let me first explain what the bill now does. Then I would like to \nexplain the changes my amendment makes, why I am making them, and then \nI would like to address the overall issue we are about to debate, \npotentially through a second-degree amendment or through another \nfreestanding amendment.\n  In the bill as it is now written--as it passed unanimously in \ncommittee, even though I knew an amendment was going to be offered--in \norder to make a loan that the Federal Government guarantees, you have \nto be an insured depository institution. There has been objection \nraised to this because of a desire on the part of the Cooperative \nFinance Corporation. This is a captive lender, for all purposes, for \nAmerica's REAs, with a very proud record and with a great record of \nachievement.\n  The question then is, if we take out of the bill that a lender has to \nbe FDIC insured--and remember we are having the taxpayer guarantee the \nloan they are making--What kind of protections do we need for that \nguarantee to be extended? I have offered this amendment, really, as an \neffort at a compromise where we take the FDIC lender out but where we \nset specifically three sets of rules to apply to different lenders.\n  The first two have to do with commercial for-profit lenders. They are \nthe standard kind of constraints you would normally see in any \nfinancial transaction; that is, they have to meet the capital \nrequirement which traditionally, for banks and S, has been that you \ncannot lend more than 10 percent or 15 percent of your capital to any \none borrower.\n  Second, we eliminate the potential for any for-profit institution to \nlend to an affiliate. What we are trying to do here is ban self-\ndealing. I do not believe there is any objection to these two \nprovisions, but it is very important that they be in the bill.\n  Now we get to the controversy. What do we do about nonprofit lenders? \nLet me remind my colleagues, institutions are not nonprofit for \nnothing. We grant a very special privilege to an institution when we \nmake it a nonprofit institution because we dramatically lower its \ncosts. And we do it because that institution is serving a public \npurpose.\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\n  In this case, the institution that is basically going to be discussed \nhere is CFC, the Cooperative Finance Corporation. Its public purpose is \nthat it provides funding at a very low cost to our REAs that are \nproviding telephone and electric power to rural America. It is true \nthat it makes some other loans, but the principal purpose for its \nlending is REA power and REA telephone.\n  What we are saying is for these nonprofits, since they are carrying \nout a Government function, even though they may be chartered as private \ninstitutions, they are chartered with tax exemption because they are \npromoting a public purpose. Therefore, we do have some concern about \nthem.\n  Now, if Citigroup or Bank of America or Chase makes this loan and it \nis defaulted and they lose 20 percent of it, I am not happy about it--\nand I am very unhappy about the taxpayer losing 80 percent--but I \nfigure they are in this for profit. They know what they are doing and \nwhat they do to their credit rating and what they do to their \nprofitability; that is their business. That is what for-profit private \nenterprise is about.\n  I am more concerned about what a nonprofit corporation does because \nit is nonprofit and it is carrying out a public purpose. In the case of \nCFC, that public purpose is to make loans to bring electric power and \ntelephone, and to continually modernize both to rural America. More \nimportant, they are lending money to 25 million captive customers. Why \ndo I say captive? Because if you are buying power from the REA, you do \nnot have the right to buy it from anybody else. If you are buying \ntelephone services through an REA affiliate, you do not have the right \nto buy telephone services from anybody else, on a hard line anyway. So \nin making loans, these nonprofits, and principally CFC, are carrying \nout a public mandate in providing these services for rural America as \ncheaply as possible.\n\n  Why should there be a certain set of rules for nonprofit \ncorporations? Because they are nonprofit; because they do have tax \nexemption; because they are supposed to be promoting a public purpose. \nIf Citigroup or Bank of America makes a bad loan and it is defaulted, \npeople do not have to do business with them. They can borrow money from \nsomebody else. But if the CFC makes a bad loan and their credit rating \ngoes down, then every REA customer for electric power and telephone, \nall of whom are captive customers, would have to pay higher prices; \nhence, the public interest in seeing that we protect the interests of \nthose ratepayers.\n  How do we protect the interests of the ratepayers in this amendment? \nI have colleagues on both sides of the aisle who want the CFC to be \nable to make these loans. Frankly, if this were left to me, I would not \ndo it that way. The whole logic of this is for-profit lending. But in \nan effort to try to reach a compromise, we would let CFC, this tax-\nexempt entity which is providing credit to rural America, make these \nloans. But the board would have to find, in making the loan, that they \nwould not lower their credit rating.\n  Why is that important? Why should we care what the credit rating of \nCFC is? Because that credit rating affects their ability to borrow \nmoney, affects the interest they have to pay, and since they are in \nturn lending that money to REA providers who have captive American \ncustomers--25 million of them--if they do something speculative and \ndrive down their bond rating, everybody in rural America is going to \npay more money for electric power and telephones.\n  The restriction we are imposing is hardly overwhelming. All it says \nis, where we are dealing with a nonprofit lender, where the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated the probability of default is \nsuch that 45 percent of the loan will be defaulted under the House \nbill, if they want to make this loan, doesn't it sound reasonable on \nbehalf of the 25 million ratepayers in rural America that we would \nsimply ask that the board--the Secretary of the Treasury, the Federal \nReserve Board chairman, and the Secretary of Agriculture--that they \ndetermine that the CFC is not going to see its bond rating go down as a \nresult of making this loan?\n  Why do we care if it goes down? Because if it goes down, every buyer \nof electricity, every buyer of telephone services in rural America, is \ngoing to pay more money. That is why we should care. So we say, if the \nboard finds that this is not going to lower their credit rating, they \ncan do it.\n  We have a provision that says, if the CFC's credit rating is \nlowered--and credit rating agencies, when they change somebody's \ncredit, say why they have changed it, so that if they change it and the \nreason is this loan--we require the loan to be sold so it can move to \nrestore their credit rating.\n  I believe this is an eminently reasonable amendment, and while it \ndoes not bear directly on the loan guarantee, it does bear directly on \nanother issue, and that is the well-being of 25 million Americans who \nlive in rural America. I represent more of them than any other Senator \nhere. I am not indifferent to CFC taking action that will drive up \ninterest rates and drive up power rates and telephone rates in my State \nto Texans who choose to live in rural areas. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  This amendment, in responding to a request by Members of the Senate, \ntakes out the requirement that you have to have an insured lender. That \nopens it up potentially to anybody.\n  We tighten it up in three ways. We say if you are a commercial \nlender--a bank, for example--you have to meet the capital requirements \nand the loan-asset ratio that is currently the law, and you cannot do \nself-dealing. You cannot lend it to your brother-in-law, and you cannot \nlend it to the bank. It has to be an arm's length transaction.\n  For those lenders, such as Morgan Stanley, that do not have a capital \nrequirement, we say they have to have one. We are not going to \nguarantee a loan that Morgan Stanley makes if that loan is more than 10 \npercent of their capital. Why? Because it is risky, and if they lose \nmoney, it enhances the chances that the taxpayers will lose money.\n  Finally, for nonprofits, we do not have a capital requirement, but \nwhat we say is, since we gave this institution nonprofit status to \nperform a public purpose--in the case of CFC, to make loans to \nelectrify and bring telephones to rural America--that if the board \nfinds that by making this loan it is going to drive down their bond \nrating and drive up their cost of borrowing and, in turn, drive up \npower rates and phone rates for 25 million Americans, the board will be \nrequired to not guarantee their loan. I hope my colleagues will look at \nthis provision.\n  Let me give an example. Under current market conditions, the 1-year \ncost of borrowing for dropping from a AA to a AA- is 5 basis points, or \n$500,000 on a $1 billion loan. Over 10 years, that would be $5 million. \nIt is pretty relevant when one is talking about dropping a bond rating. \nIf it just dropped by one notch, from AA to AA- on a 10-year loan, that \n5 basis points will cost $5 million. If you drop from AA to BB, then \nthe cost will drive by a great multiple of that.\n  This is a reasonable issue. It is not an issue directly involved in \nthis loan, but it is an issue that, unfortunately, has gotten pulled \ninto it. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will look at \nthis very closely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2898 to Amendment No. 2897\n\n            (Purpose: To improve the loan guarantee program)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], for himself, \n     Mr. Thomas, Mr. Grams, Mr. Robb, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Harkin, \n     and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 2898 to \n     amendment No. 2897.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       ``(D) The loan is provided by an insured depository \n     institution (as defined in section 3 of the F.D.I. Act) that \n     is acceptable to the Board, or any lender that (i) has not \n     fewer than one issue of outstanding debt that is rated within \n     the highest three rating categories of a nationally \n     recognized statistical\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\n     rating agency; or (ii) has provided financing to entities \n     with outstanding debt from the Rural Utilities Service and \n     which possess, in the judgment of the Board, the expertise, \n     capacity and capital strength to provide financing pursuant \n     to this act and has terms, in the judgment of the Board, that \n     are consistent in material respects with the terms of similar \n     obligations in the private capital market;''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have reached concurrence on the core \nof this legislation, and I commend Senator Gramm for his work with us \non that matter. We have had bipartisan cooperation.\n  We have one remaining issue in particular, however, that remains to \nbe resolved. Senator Gramm has an amendment which opens up the \npossibility of CFC financing but under very circumscribed conditions, \nwhich I contend are so severe as to make CFC financing very unlikely. \nThe question is: What can we do to lower the cost of financing to make \nthis programming available to rural Americans and yet do so in a \nresponsible, fiscally prudent manner?\n  The amendment offered by Senator Gramm does essentially three things:\n  First, it requires that any lender that is a nonprofit, such as a \nCFC, cannot provide financing under this act unless the board \ndetermines the credit rating of the lender will not decline upon the \napproval and funding of the loan.\n  Second, it requires that nonprofit lenders sell any loans guaranteed \nunder this act if their credit rating declines.\n  Third, it excludes GSE lenders, such as CoBank, from participating in \nthis program.\n  It is inappropriate, I believe, to require the board to make a \njudgment on the impact on the credit rating of a nonprofit lender, such \nas a CFC, because, one, it places the burden of proof on the lender to \nshow why its rating would not decrease. Under the proposed amendment, \nthe board would need to predict future actions of credit rating \nagencies, and I do not believe this is a reasonable requirement to \nimpose on a governmental board.\n  In reaching the bipartisan compromise in this legislation, I went \nalong with the creation of a board. This was a good idea on the part of \nChairman Gramm. It involved the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, as well \nas the Department of Agriculture, to oversee this lending to make sure \nwe have that extra element of prudence. But I believe it is simply not \nfair to put a burden of proof on the board to certify in advance what, \nin fact, is going to happen to a rating on the part of a CFC or another \nnonprofit.\n  Wall Street credit rating agencies make determinations on credit \nratings on a continuous basis. This is a real world market discipline \nthat is imposed on lenders by the capital markets. A board of three \npeople, qualified as they may be, is not an appropriate substitute for \nmarket discipline. It makes no sense, I believe, to charge this board \nwith the requirement to predict that the credit rating of any lender \nwill not decline.\n  CFC raises funds in the private capital markets through sale of \nbonds, sale of equity hybrid securities, and by equity investments by \nCFC owners. All of these entities have expressed their confidence in \nCFC, and that is a real test of the CFC's strength.\n  The CFC has demonstrated over its 30-year life that it understands \nrural energy and telecommunications markets. It has done a fine job of \nevaluating credit risks and has made sound credit decisions. CFC is not \na new or untested entity in the marketplace.\n  It may be argued that all CFC loans are to ``utilities with captive \ncustomers.'' This is not true. Many rural electric and telephone \ncooperatives do have a monopoly position in their service areas, just \nas other utilities do. However, in the electric area, deregulation is \nbeing implemented in a number of States, and co-ops and other utilities \nin those States are, in fact, facing a competitive marketplace.\n  In the telecommunications area, CFC, through its controlled \naffiliate, the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative, has made loans to a \nnumber of projects that include highly competitive services, including \nwireless telephone services, PCS, and CLEC service in rural areas that \nwere previously poorly served by incumbent providers.\n  The question then is: Why add an additional layer of bureaucratic \nreview to one class of lenders--CFC and other nonprofits--when that \nlevel of review is not imposed on other lenders? This delays \nimplementation in this needed program, adds costs, and provides a \ncompetitive advantage to for-profit finance companies.\n  The amendment does not require banks to be within the highest three \nratings categories, and most are not.\n  Why would this provision be applied to nonprofit lenders and not to \nfor-profit banks?\n  I have a chart here which I think is interesting. The bottom line \nshows the Cooperative Finance Corporation's AA- rating under S and \nAa3 rating under Moody, which compares with the largest banks in \nAmerica. I think it is of interest that even if there were a decline, \nthe CFC would still have a rating higher than most of the largest banks \nin the United States.\n  A second point has to do with the requirement that a lender sell its \nloan if its credit rating declines. The requirement that a nonprofit \nlender sell a loan guaranteed under this act if its credit rating \ndeclines is an onerous provision that would cause significant financial \nstress and costs to the lender. If such a decline in a lender's rating \nshould occur, a forced sale at that time could result in still further \nfinancial losses.\n  This is basically, I believe, a poisonous provision designed to \nexclude nonprofit lenders, such as the CFC. Even if the credit rating \nof an AA rated company would decline to AA-, it would still have a \nsignificantly higher credit rating than the vast majority of banks in \nAmerica. No similar requirement is being imposed on banks. I believe \nthe idea of requiring a lender to sell loans is not the proper remedy.\n  The last point I would make is, I believe the exclusion of lenders \nunder the program is an unwise public policy. The exclusion of lenders \nunder this program will only increase the cost of funds to borrowers \nand ultimately to rural and other TV viewers.\n  The bill already establishes a sound process for the evaluation of \nprojects applying for financing. This process includes approval by a \nboard that includes the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, and the Secretary of Agriculture, advice from NTIA, \nevaluation, underwriting and analysis by the Rural Utilities Service, \nand the commitment of private lenders that are on the line to take a \nvery substantial risk in the event of default by a project funded under \nthis program.\n  I believe that much of what we have accomplished in this \nlegislation--the creation of a board and an 80-percent guaranteed loan \nrather than the 100 percent which, frankly, was the idea being pushed \nin the House and which I originally thought might be the way to go--we \nhave diminished to an 80-percent guarantee; we have set up a board. I \nthink we have a responsible approach to this guaranteed loan process.\n  But I do believe that Senator Gramm's amendment would go one step \nfurther to the point of, in effect, making it very difficult, if not \nimpossible, for the board and institutions, such as a Cooperative \nFinancing Corporation, to participate in the program.\n  Keep in mind, our amendment does not require that the CFC be involved \nat all. It simply makes it an alternative financing strategy that would \nbe available for the board, with the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury, \nand USDA to evaluate. I have great confidence in their leadership.\n  I think if we were to adopt this second-degree amendment, we would be \nback to what I believe would be a clean bill.\n  I look forward to additional debate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that the House-committee-\nreported bill provided a 100-percent guarantee. Is that correct?\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The Agriculture Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives reported a 100-percent guaranteed bill. The Commerce \nCommittee, it is my understanding, is working on a bill that may \ninvolve an 80-percent guarantee.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just want to make the point that in our committee, we \nagreed to an 80-percent guarantee, which I think was, in the end, \naccepted by everyone on the committee, although there were differing \nviews about that question. I think it does provide an important measure \nof safety in considering this matter.\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\n  Secondly, is it correct that if these institutions, which amendment \nNo. 2898 addresses in terms of qualifying--if this amendment carries, \nthe board that is being established under this legislation would still \nhave to approve any loan guarantee made by such an institution, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In other words, the institutions, they are only being \nincluded in the sense that they are eligible to submit their proposal \nto the board. It does not mean they can then go ahead and do these loan \nguarantees simply on their own. They have to obtain board approval in \norder to do that; that is, this board of the Federal Reserve, the \nTreasury, and the Department of Agriculture. Is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is absolutely right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Thirdly, I just make this observation. We are allowing \nFDIC institutions to do this. But, of course, in a sense, that creates \nan extra exposure that one of these institutions would not have because \nthe Government, the taxpayer, would be exposed on the loan guarantee. \nBut, in addition, if the institution itself were to run into serious \ntrouble, there would be taxpayer exposure on the Federal deposit \ninsurance for the depositors of that institution. Is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, we do not have the latter in the case of \nthese institutions. I think we have to exercise caution and prudence, \nbut as you have pointed out, certainly for the CFC, they rank very well \nindeed. It seems to me they ought to qualify. I think the limitations \nhave a great deal of difficulty connected with them, which the Senator \nhas outlined in his statement.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from Maryland for his leadership on \nthis issue. He has been of great assistance to us. When we ultimately \npass this legislation, a great share of credit goes to the Senator.\n  I also note that the second-degree amendment, which is pending, is a \nbipartisan amendment. I express appreciation particularly to Senators \nThomas of Wyoming and Grams of Minnesota for their work and their \nstaffs' work on this legislation. Those two Senators share a very great \nconcern for access to local programming for rural residents. I am \nappreciative of that kind of bipartisan cooperation on this second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending second-\ndegree amendment, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  First, I thank the Senator from Texas for his good work in getting \nthis bill moved forward. We remember that this came up last year when \nwe talked about the local-to-local broadcasting, and so on. The \nSenator--properly, I think--suggested it be sent back for more \nconsideration by the Banking Committee. Indeed, it was. He promised us \nat that time that this bill would come forward. He has adhered to that \npromise and is out here with it now.\n  The other thing on which I agree with the Senator from Texas is that \nhe has divided this responsibility and there is an 80-percent \nguarantee. I agree with that. There needs to be someone who has some \nrisk and promises that there will be more attention paid to it. I have \nagreed with all those things.\n  What we are talking about is being able to include a not-for-profit \nfinancing organization that has been involved with rural \ntelecommunications, that has been involved with rural electric, and, \nindeed, serves the rural area. Very appropriately, that should be \nconsidered.\n  By the way, this is the Cooperative Finance Corporation, not the \nCommodity Finance Corporation that has been mentioned a time or two. It \nis not set up by the Feds. It is a private co-op without Federal \nsupport.\n  CFC is adequately capitalized, so it has actually better ratings than \nmost of those banks.\n  Furthermore, as we talk about the requirement that might include \nincreased costs to rural electrics--rural electrics, by the way, with \nwhich I am rather familiar, having worked in that area before I came to \nthe Senate--they can get their financing other places; they are not \ncaptive borrowers from the CFC.\n  I think this second-degree amendment is one that simply provides more \nopportunity for this unit, this nonprofit unit, owned by rural people, \nto participate in the financing of an effort to provide rural \ntelevision, local-to-local television,  the kinds of coverage we now do \nnot have in Wyoming. If you want to see ABC, you have to get your \nprogram from California or from Chicago. We are saying we can provide \nthat locally so you can get local news, local information. We think \nthat is very important. Of course, that is what this bill is all about.\n\n  The proposal that is before us and that we seek to second degree \nplaces the burden of proof to show that the lender's ratings will not \ndecrease. Under the proposed amendment, this board would need to \npredict what the financial condition is going to be. That is a pretty \nunreasonable requirement for this governmental board composed of \nCabinet officers or their designees.\n  Secondly, of course, Wall Street rating agencies make these kinds of \nratings, and they will be making it here. This, after all, is a market \nfunction. CFC raises its capital in the private capital markets through \nthe sale of bonds, through the sale of equity securities, equity \ninvestments. So these things are all a function of the market and are \ntested by the market. We don't need to set up an artificial \norganizational effort to do that.\n  CFC is over 31 years old. I think it has $600 million worth of \ncapitalization. They have been in the energy and telecommunications \nmarkets. They are mature. What we are saying is that we appreciate very \nmuch the Senator's willingness to allow these kinds of nonprofits to \nparticipate, but our argument basically is there are restrictions and \nregulations here that are not needed. They are additional bureaucratic \nreviews that are not necessary in order to accomplish the purpose the \nSenator has set forth.\n  I won't take longer. I am very much in favor of this bill. I hope we \nwill move to pass it quickly. I thank Senator Johnson and Senator Grams \nfor joining in this effort to make some changes. I do not think they \nchanged the policy direction that the Senator from Texas takes, and I \nurge the support of the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  I think, as people try to follow this debate, it often looks \ncomplicated, but if they burrow into the real issue, it boils down to \nthis: In trying to accommodate those who want the Cooperative Finance \nCorporation to participate in this program, I have taken from the bill \nin my amendment the requirement that the lender be FDIC insured. I have \nset out some conditions. For banks, I require that they meet a capital \nrequirement and that they do not engage in self-dealing. That \nrequirement is not in this amendment that would strike my amendment. \nUnder this amendment, potentially we could have an 80-percent \nGovernment guaranteed loan to some institution that is lending the \nmoney to itself. I am opposed to that. I am adamantly opposed to that. \nI think that is an outrage.\n  Under this provision, we could have an institution lend all of its \ncapital and the Federal Government is going to guarantee 80 percent of \nit. Under this amendment which strikes my amendment, some institution \nsomewhere could lend 100 percent of its capital, and the Federal \nGovernment is going to guarantee 80 percent of it. I don't think so. \nUnder the amendment I have offered, I have said that in such \ninstitutions, we are not going to guarantee their loan if they are \nlending more than 10 percent of their capital. This is taxpayers' money \nwe are talking about. Both of those provisions are dropped.\n  This amendment does a curtsy toward fiscal responsibility in that it \nsays for a lender to qualify, they have to have one of the top three \nratings on at least one issue of outstanding debt. You can issue a 30-\nday note, and almost anybody can get a  AAA rating for their credit for \n30 days, but the taxpayer is going to be on the hook for 25 years. The \nfact that a borrower could get a good rating for a 30-day note does not \nexcite me very much, when the taxpayer is going to be on the hook for\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\n25 years. And that does not even apply to the CFC. They don't have to \nhave any capital requirement at all. Every other nonprofit institution \ndoes in their amendment, but not CFC.\n\n  Let me explain the issue of the CFC. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas estimated that the loan guarantee in the House is going to have 45 \npercent of the loan defaulted. The scoring by the Congressional Budget \nOffice of the House bill assumes 45 percent of the loan guarantee the \nFederal Government makes will be defaulted and that the taxpayer will \nbe left holding the bag. That is what the present value of $350 million \nis when you are discounting on a 25-year bond.\n  This is risky business. We are lending money on a technology that has \nnever worked anywhere. We are talking about totally new technology. I \nknow there are people running around saying: We are going to have a \ndirected beam satellite. Where are they? Show me one. Where is one \nworking in the world today? They may work.\n  The point is, this is new technology. We are talking about somebody \nborrowing the money, launching a satellite, for example, using brand \nnew technology, cutting it on, it works. Maybe it works; maybe it \ndoesn't work. The Congressional Budget Office believes this is risky \nbusiness. They assume 45 percent of the loan is not going to be repaid.\n  I have tried to build in protections, and those protections are \ncritical. The most important protection is that a private lender is on \nthe hook for 20 percent.\n  Our Presiding Officer used to be in the banking business. He did not \noften get an 80-percent Government loan guarantee, but when he was on \nthe hook for 20 percent, he paid attention to his business because it \nwas his money. The guarantee that we are getting is that people are \ngoing to be judicious with the part we are not guaranteeing.\n  Why do we treat nonprofits differently? What is this issue about \ncredit rating of nonprofits? Why should Joe Brown who lives in San \nGeronimo Creek, TX, care about the credit rating of the Cooperative \nFinance Corporation when he is going to guarantee 80 percent of the \nloan they make? What difference does it make to him?\n  First of all, why do they have a tax exemption at the Cooperative \nFinance Corporation? Because we gave it to them to promote a public \npurpose. What was the public purpose? The public purpose was to provide \nelectricity to rural America and to provide telephone to rural America \nand to keep it moderate. That is why they have a tax exemption--because \nthey are providing a public purpose.\n  In letting them be involved in an activity where, under the \nconditions set in the House, 45 percent of the loan will be, according \nto the estimate of CBO, defaulted, all I have asked is that this \nnonprofit organization, or any other, since they are performing a \npublic purpose by lending money to provide electricity in rural Texas \nand rural America, I want the board to find that their credit rating is \nnot going to go down as a result of making this loan.\n  Now, our colleague from South Dakota says, what business is it of \nours whether the credit rating of the Cooperative Finance Corporation \ngoes down or not? It is my business. It is my business because I have \nover a million Texans who buy electric power and/or telephone from \nrural co-ops that borrow money from the CFC. That is why it is my \nbusiness. If they make a bad loan and their credit rating goes down, \nthe cost of borrowing money to maintain electric power and telephone in \nmy State is going to go up, and my ratepayers, who are captive--they \ncan't buy electric power from anybody else and they can't buy hard-line \ntelephone services from anybody else--are going to end up paying more \nmoney. That is why I care. That is why it is relevant.\n  Now, this is risky business we are engaged in here. All I am trying \nto do is say, if you want the financial institution that has \nhistorically serviced REA and serviced electric power and telephone--\nand let me remind my colleagues you don't lose money lending money to \nan electric co-op to provide telephone or electric power generation. \nWhy? Because you have a captive market so that if the loan doesn't work \nout, you raise the rates--you restructure the loan, you raise the rates \nto pay it.\n  In this case, if that satellite doesn't go into orbit, whose rates \nare you going to raise? You are going to raise the rates of people in \nTexas who are buying electric power. That is whose rates you are going \nto raise. That satellite doesn't work. You don't have anybody buying \nits services. They have a right not to buy them. You are not going to \nbe able to raise their rates. So all I am trying to do is say before we \nlet this lending institution, with a proud history, which has done a \ngreat job--and I don't dispute any of that--this tax-exempt lender that \nwe gave tax exemption to electrify America and to provide phone \nservices to America, before we have them make a loan that the \nCongressional Budget Office says 45 percent of, under the House \nstructure, will be defaulted, before we let them do it--why is it so \noffensive to have, among other people, Alan Greenspan look at their \nloan and their proposal and try to make an estimate as to whether or \nnot making this loan is going to drive down their bond rating and drive \nup the cost of electric power and telephone services in rural America? \nDo we not trust Alan Greenspan to make an honest judgment?\n  I don't understand this issue. It seems to me what we have is a \ncaptive lender that somehow desperately wants to get into a business we \ndidn't give it tax exemption to do. We have a mission creep here on a \ngigantic scale. Now, I am willing to let them do the mission creep as \nlong as it doesn't cost Texas consumers of electric power and telephone \nservices in rural Texas money. If it is not going to cost them money, I \nam willing to let them basically dramatically change the business they \nare in. If they make a $1.25 billion loan, that is larger by far--twice \nas big--than any loan they have ever made. Their average loan is less \nthan $20 million. I would say that is a pretty dramatic change in \nbusiness. If we are going to let them do that, all I am asking is that \nthere be somebody responsible--and I would call Alan Greenspan \nresponsible--who is going to look at their application and make a \ndetermination as to whether this is going to drive down their bond \nrating and cost every REA customer in America a bunch of money.\n  The second provision is if, in fact, it does drive down their bond \nrating, I want them to sell it and get out of that business. You might \nsay how dare we tell them they can't engage in some of the most \nspeculative lending in America. How dare we tell them that. Well, the \nreason we dare tell them that is they are tax exempt. We gave them a \nvery special privilege to do a certain kind of work, and that special \nprivilege was to bring electricity and telephone service to America. I \nknow we have let them get into other kinds of business. We let them \nmake a loan so that REAs could go into a partnership with Direct \nTelevision. But they didn't put up any satellite or develop any new \ntechnology, and they didn't take any real risk. This is big-time risk.\n\n  So the difference between the two amendments is, first of all, this \namendment, in my opinion, is not very well crafted in that it strikes \nall of my provisions against self-dealing, all of the provisions in my \namendment--and you don't have to worry about that when you are dealing \nwith FDIC institutions because they have those requirements already. \nBut those provisions in my amendment that were struck by this amendment \nare pretty important. If we are going to have the taxpayers on the hook \nfor over $800 million, I want to be sure somebody is not lending this \nmoney to his brother in law, or to an affiliate of the company. I don't \nunderstand why those provisions were struck by this amendment.\n  Secondly, if we have a traditional REA lender in the Cooperative \nFinance Corporation making loans, I am willing to let them into this \nbusiness if they want to get into it; though, to the best of my mental \nability, I can't see why they want in this business. But they do. They \nare determined to get into it. I am saying, let them in the business, \nbut don't let them in if it is going to drive up the cost of electric \npower and telephone service to rural America by driving down their bond \nrating.\n  I thought, when we made the concession to treat these nonprofits \ndifferently by not requiring them to meet a capital requirement for the \nsize of their loans, that the compromise was\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\ngoing to be accepted. But it seems to me that, basically, what we are \ntrying to do is we are trying to go back and undo all the other stuff \nwe have done in this bill because the logic of the bill is that we are \ngoing to have a private lender who is going to be on the hook. Now, \nsome people say, won't the Cooperative Finance Corporation be on the \nhook? Who will be on the hook if they lose $800 million? Who really \nloses? Whose money is it? Well, ultimately, who is going to lose is the \npeople who are buying electric power in America, in rural areas, and \npeople who are buying telephone services, because they are going to \nlose a very cheap source of credit because the Cooperative Finance \nCorporation is going to end up losing its double-A rating.\n  So that is what this whole issue is about. Unfortunately, we have a \nseries of votes in the Budget Committee, and we don't have proxy \nvoting. It is going to require Senator Johnson, Senator Sarbanes, and I \nto be there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we set aside this amendment, that we let \nother amendments be offered in our absence, but that we don't reach a \nfinal disposition of any amendment until the hour of 1:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Reserving the right to object, and I don't intend to \nobject, if I might inquire of the Senator so I am clear about this, we \nhave a number of Members who would like to speak to the Senator's \namendment and the second-degree amendment. I assume they will have an \nopportunity in that context.\n  Mr. GRAMM. They will. Under the unanimous consent, any Member could \nspeak on this amendment and on the bill, and any Member could offer \nanother amendment. But there could be no final disposition of an \namendment until 1:30 when we are back and have an opportunity to \naddress it.\n  I would prefer, if no one objects, to let people offer amendments \nbecause we want to finish this bill today. It is not going to hurt my \nfeelings if somebody offers an amendment when I am gone. I can read it \nwhen I get back and discuss it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, I suggest to the Senator \nthat 2 o'clock might be a better time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to change the \nrequest to 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And then, for clarification, the time between now and 2 \nwould be spent either debating what is before us at the moment or \noffering some other amendment and debating that amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. One of those amendments might be involved.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, if I might take 1 minute--I know there \nare a number of others who want to address this legislation, and I have \nto return to the Budget Committee as well for a series of votes--let me \nobserve, having listened carefully to the chairman's remarks, that I \nthink the differences we have are fairly straightforward, in a sense.\n  On the one hand, our amendment says we have already come up with some \nsafety provisions with an 80-percent guarantee rather than 100 percent, \nand so on. But what we are suggesting is that guidelines be adopted by \nthe board, by Mr. Greenspan, by Treasury, and by USDA. They certainly \nhave it within their prerogative to develop whatever guidelines they \nfeel appropriate to ensure that the lending practices are secure and \nsound from the perspective of the taxpayers.\n  The Senator from Texas, rather than relying on the Fed, the Treasury \nand USDA, is suggesting that he will impose guidelines statutorily. We \nnow have, I believe, the consequence of, in effect, shutting out the \nCFC from participating in the program.\n  I think we have a solid piece of legislation with the Johnson-Thomas-\nGrams amendment. We would then turn to the board as the chief \ninstrument for any further fine-tuning of what kind of provisions might \nbe helpful to them in seeing to it that these loans are handled in due \ncourse and in the proper fashion.\n  I think that is the difference we have between the underlying Gramm \namendment and our second-degree amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Gramm, and am also in opposition, then, to the second-degree \namendment offered by Senator Johnson.\n  The Gramm amendment puts all possible lenders on an equal footing. I \nbelieve we must protect the taxpayers. It is the primary charge for the \nBanking Committee to ensure that this program does not turn into a \nsource of free money. The amendment would do that and make the \nrequirements for lending institutions equal regardless of the lender.\n  I have concerns about allowing lenders that are active in the farm \ncredit programs--Government-sponsored enterprises--to get into risky \nbusiness ventures potentially lending to a new satellite TV venture. \nThe CFC and farm credit banks focus their lending on electric and \ntelephone loans, as well as farm operating and housing loans. They \ndon't have experience with launching satellites.\n  Where taxpayer money is concerned, we can't just open up the program \nto any lender that has previously participated in the Rural Utilities \nService program. Too much is at stake.\n  The amendment would not only allow FDIC-insured institutions to make \nthe loan, but it allows investment banks and commercial lending \ninstitutions such as GE Capital and TransAmerica to make the loan. \nThese institutions have unique knowledge of market risks of investing \nin satellite services.\n  The amendment also provides for not-for-profit cooperative lending \ncorporations to participate in the program only if the loan can be made \nand not cause the credit rating to fall below an AA rating. A lower \ncredit rating could cause rate increases for rural electric and \ntelephone customers.\n  The Gramm amendment also restricts all lenders to lend only up to 10 \npercent of their net equity. This solution ensures that no lender is \ntreated differentially.\n  The comment was made earlier that the board is going to be required \nto predict the future on the ratings for the CFC. That is what boards \ndo. They don't predict the past. They predict the future. And they have \nto determine whether there will be a significant impact on a lending \ninstitution.\n  Earlier we saw a chart. It pointed out that CFC has an AA rating. And \nit showed the other 10 rating agencies.\n  One of the things that emphasis was not placed on was the asset size \nof those different institutions. The banks range in size from $716 \nbillion in assets down to $63 billion in assets. CFC has $15 billion in \nassets--one-fourth of what the smallest of the 10 banks have.\n  Why is this important? We are talking about a $1.25 billion loan. \nThat is a pretty significant portion of $15 billion. We should pay \nattention to the impact that it can have on that institution. That is \nwhy we have a board to make those decisions.\n  The basis for this legislation is to create incentives for private \ninvestors to use their own risk capital to bring local television \nservice to rural areas. The Congress decided it was in the national \ninterest to allow satellite companies to rebroadcast local television \nstations to their home markets. The loan guarantee program is designed \nto make that possible in smaller markets, such as Casper, WY, and \nGlendive, MT. It is not being created to give away the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  The amendment that Senator Gramm has offered levels the playing field \nfor all lenders and addresses the concerns of the Banking Committee. \nOne of those concerns is how to bring more lenders into the program and \nensure that any potential qualified borrower can participate. Rural \nelectric cooperatives borrow through the Cooperative Finance \nCorporation. It is a private corporation with an AA credit rating that \ncaters to the special needs of rural electric cooperatives. \nHistorically, they lend for electricity and telephone projects. A loan \nto launch a satellite and provide local television stations in rural \nareas is a much bigger and much different risk than an electric \nproject. There is less guarantee that the service will attract \ncustomers or that the launch of the satellite will be successful.\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\n  The rural language that members of the Banking Committee have been \nworking on with the distinguished Senator from Texas protects the REA \nmembers and CFC from taking a bigger risk than necessary but allows \nthem to take the risk. It does not give any lender an advantage over \nany other lender to obtain the guarantee.\n  I believe Congress should make the playing field as level as possible \nfor all participants. I don't think it should give more potential to \nthose that have some Federal connection. Senator Gramm's language does \nthat. I urge its adoption. I urge a vote against the second-degree \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2896\n\n(Purpose: To require that the entity, if any, that receives the entire \n  amount of the available loan guarantee shall provide in each under-\n  served area or unserved area in each State all the local television \n               broadcast signals broadcast in such State)\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2896.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 33, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       (4) Requirement relating to applicant receiving entire \n     guarantee amount.--The entire amount of the guarantee \n     available under subsection (f) may not be provided for the \n     guarantee of a single loan unless the applicant for the loan \n     agrees to provide in each unserved area and underserved area \n     of each State the signals of all local television stations \n     broadcast in such State.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this amendment is pretty simple. It says \nthat any entity that receives the entire $1.25 billion loan under this \nbill must provide to its subscribers all of the local television \nbroadcast signals which are broadcast in that State.\n  Since coming to the Senate I have heard from my constituents about \nsatellite TV more than any other issue. More than impeachment, Social \nSecurity, taxes, or anything else.\n  That might sound strange, but I constantly hear from Kentuckians who \nare unhappy that they can't get local news and local programming. \nBelieve me, when the University of Kentucky is playing basketball, \nthat's a big deal.\n  Kentucky is rural, and a lot of our communities are isolated and hard \nto reach. Cable isn't an option for them because the cable companies \nwon't come--it's too expensive to wire them.\n  And they often can't get a clear signal with traditional TV antennae \nbecause of the geography and landscape of our commonwealth. This has \nled many Kentuckians to try satellite coverage, but then they often \nhear more about New York City, Los Angeles, or Chicago.\n\n  With my amendment, I am trying to make sure Kentuckians and other \nAmericans living in rural areas get local news and local programming. \nIn Kentucky, this problem is made even worse because much of our State \nis dominated by media markets from surrounding States, making it even \nharder to get local programming.\n  I live in northern Kentucky near Cincinnati, OH. It is frustrating to \nconstantly hear Ohio news and not be able to find out what is happening \nin Louisville, Lexington, Paducah, or Bowling Green.\n  In talking with the industry, the satellite technology soon is going \nto allow for spot beaming to provide local-to-local coverage for \neveryone. I think that is great. I encourage them to keep pushing \nforward. I also want to make sure that if anyone gets the full value of \nthis loan, then they have to provide local programming for local areas. \nThese loans are going to be guaranteed 80 percent by the Federal \nGovernment and taxpayers in Kentucky and other rural States deserve to \nbe considered.\n  I am simply trying to look out for my constituents. I have a feeling \nthere are other rural States in the same boat. I bet they are as \nfrustrated as we are when they can learn about New York City politics \nor the Chicago Cubs baseball or the latest news in neighboring States \nbut they cannot find out what is going on in their own backyards.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment. I want to make sure Kentuckians, \nand all others in rural States who do not have local broadcasts in \ntheir own State, can receive local news from their State, not just news \nfrom an adjoining State. I urge passage of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud the U.S. is the world leader in \nthe advancement of technology, providing businesses and consumers \nfaster and better ways to work and to communicate. But even though we \nhave made great progress in technology, much of rural and small town \nAmerica has been left behind. In the small town of Cumming, IA, where I \nwas born and still have a house I live in when I am not here, we do not \nhave access. We do not even have cable yet. So a lot of people are \nputting up satellite dishes as the only way of getting adequate \ninformation through television.\n  I joined a Senate rural telecommunications task force last year to \naddress these issues and to work, as a group, to pass legislation to \nhelp rural communities catch up. Just as cable and telephone companies \nsay it does not make good business sense to provide service to a few \ncustomers in Cumming, IA, for example, we know that without this access \nrural America will suffer and will be left behind in the new digital \nage. You talk about a digital divide. There is a digital divide and \nrural America is on the short end of that divide.\n  We are not just talking about high-speed Internet access or reliable \ntelephone lines. We are talking about the lack of access to basic local \nTV programming--local weather, local news, local school information for \nrural residents and farm families. You would think it is easy; if you \nlive on a farm or in a small town in rural Iowa, you just put an \nantenna on your house and get the local weather and news from a local \nTV station. Once again, it is not that easy for rural and small town \nresidents. An antenna just doesn't reach that far. Weather conditions \ninterrupt, for example. Cable will not extend lines outside of \nmetropolitan areas because of the high cost. As I said, in my hometown, \nwe do not have cable yet. We live fairly close to a metropolitan area.\n  The satellite dish came along and provided relief and access and they \nsprouted up like mushrooms all over rural Iowa and rural America. But \nthe satellite also has its problems. It does not include what is called \n``local-into-local'' programming, into small and rural TV markets. The \nsatellite dish companies say they do not have the capacity in their \nexisting satellites. That is what they say.\n  I happen to have a satellite dish on my house in Virginia, 12 miles \nfrom here. I can turn that thing on any time and get hundreds of \nchannels--many of which are, I think, kind of ridiculous, but they are \nthere. So they can provide hundreds of channels to customers in \nmetropolitan areas, but they cannot transmit local TV to the 60 million \ncustomers who live outside the big TV markets, they say, without \nlaunching more multimillion-dollar satellites.\n  Last year, we fought hard to keep in the satellite bill a rural loan \nguarantee program, one that would make it easier for companies or \nnonprofit cooperatives to provide local TV to rural customers. \nUnfortunately, it was taken out at the last minute before the bill was \npassed and signed into law. Senator Gramm, the Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, has drafted a rural loan guarantee bill, similar to the one \nI cosponsored last year, that will go a long way to ensuring that rural \nresidents receive the benefit of local television.\n  However, I am concerned about the provision in the bill that requires \nall potential lenders in the Loan Guarantee Program to be Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation insured. That\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\nlanguage would exclude several qualified lenders who have previously \nprovided financing under the Rural Electrification Act. These \ninstitutions include the Cooperative Finance Corporation, the CFC, and \nother lenders that have the financial strength, the expertise, and the \nability to participate in this program for rural citizens. These \ninstitutions have had years of experience. They have had a strong \nrecord in lending to rural and electric cooperatives.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve the Johnson-Thomas bipartisan \namendment, of which I am a cosponsor, to allow qualified lenders with \nexperience, expertise, and a strong reputation in these types of \nprograms, to participate in the funding subject to approval. The \ncooperatives use lenders such as CFC because it means lower interest \nrates, resulting in a more affordable and workable project.\n  Again, I don't want to say I am favoring cooperatives or any one over \nanother providing local TV in rural areas. I favor any institution and \nany technology that would be willing to provide local service to most \ncustomers in unserved areas; however, without the Johnson-Thomas \namendment, we are effectively, legislatively shutting out a potential \nparticipant interested in extending local TV to rural America. They \nmight win, they might not, but why should we shut them out of this \nprocess.\n  I would also like to mention Senator Dorgan's Rural Broadband \nEnhancement Act, introduced yesterday--again of which I am a cosponsor. \nThis important legislation would help ensure that rural and small town \nAmerica are not left behind by the revolution taking place in the \ntechnology industry that I mentioned earlier. The Dorgan bill would \nauthorize $3 billion for a revolving loan fund over 5 years to provide \ncapital for low-interest loans to finance construction of the needed \nbroadband infrastructure. I am an original cosponsor of this bill \nbecause we cannot sit around waiting for this important technology to \ncome to rural and small town America on its own. We know from past \nexperience that we need to help make it happen. I believe the Dorgan \nbill will provide the incentives for companies to expand beyond their \nurban markets.\n  The Rural Broadband Enhancement Act and the Rural Loan Guarantee--\nLOCAL TV bill that is being considered on the floor today, are sorely \nneeded in rural America. They both are akin to what happened in the \n1930s with the Rural Electrification Act when we started to electrify \nrural America. I at one time did some research on that. I read the \nSenate debates when the Senate was debating whether or not to pass the \nRural Electrification Act to provide the long-term, low-interest loans \nthrough cooperatives to build rural electric lines to families such as \nmine in rural Iowa.\n  At that time there was more than one Senator who got up and said this \nis a free market. If private companies do not want to go out there and \nbuild these electric lines to rural America, that is the marketplace. \nIf people living in rural America don't like it there because they \ndon't have electricity, they can move to the cities.\n  Fortunately, those voices were in the minority. The majority \nrecognized that because of the sparse population in rural America, it \nwas going to cost a little more for the initial installing of those \nrural electrification lines. What happened after that, of course, was \nbecause of the electrification of rural America we saw new schools go \nup. We saw new factories and plants go up to buttress the farm economy \nin our rural areas. We saw colleges being built.\n  So all of rural America expanded and became financially more sound \nbecause of the investment we made up front in rural electrification. We \nface that same kind of frontier right now both in broadband access and \nalso in access to local television broadcasting.\n  That is why I feel so strongly that these are synergistic. The Dorgan \nbill introduced yesterday for broadband access and the Johnson-Thomas \namendment which is before the body will provide the same kind of long-\nterm, low-interest loans that could be made available through \ncooperatives and through other institutions to provide for a better \npossibility that we will get direct, local-to-local satellite \nbroadcasting in rural America.\n  I hope the Senate will review this history. I hope the majority of \nthis body will support the Johnson-Thomas bipartisan amendment so that \nrural America can have the same kind of satellite dish reception that \nwe get in rural Virginia 12 miles from here. We can get on our \nsatellite dish in our home ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, all local from \nWashington, DC. It costs about four or five bucks a month. I believe \npeople all over rural Iowa and rural Kansas would be willing to pay \nfour or five bucks a month to get that kind of local television service \nfrom their local stations' satellite so they can know when tornadoes \nare approaching, bad weather, when schools are closed, and other local \ninformation they need which they otherwise do not get.\n  I urge adoption of the Johnson-Thomas amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to go into \nmorning business for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in morning business, I send an amendment \nto the desk to S. 2285.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be received and numbered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, soon the Senate will have an opportunity \nto consider legislation to lower the Federal gasoline tax. The \namendment I submit intends to at least consider on that particular \nmeasure an increase in the minimum wage in two phases--50 cents this \nyear and 50 cents next year.\n  If the idea of repealing the gasoline tax is to provide some relief \nfor hard-working Americans, it seems to me the best way we can provide \nsome relief to the 11 million Americans who are earning the minimum \nwage is to provide a modest increase--50 cents this year and 50 cents \nnext year--so they have less of an adverse impact, whether they are \npaying for gas to go to work at the present time or otherwise dealing \nwith increased costs with which they are faced every single day.\n  I am mindful of some of the recent reports about whether this \ngasoline reduction will have much of an impact, in any event, for \nconsumers and working families in this country. All one has to do is \nread what a Republican leader in the House of Representatives said \nabout this particular issue when he pointed out in the New York Times--\nthis is J.C. Watts:\n\n       If that were not chilling enough to Republicans eager to \n     maintain their tenuous control of the House this fall, other \n     party leaders voiced skepticism over the repeal's impact on \n     consumers.\n       ``I don't know if the tax has any effect on fuel costs,'' \n     says Rep. J.C. Watts. ``Supply and demand is driving prices \n     right now.''\n\n  That is an interesting and, I think, a pretty accurate statement. As \na matter of fact, included in the fundamental legislation is a study as \nto whether lowering the cost of gasoline will have any positive impact \non consumers.\n  On Wednesday, March 15, in the New York Times, there was a very \ninteresting article by Paul Krugman of MIT talking about ``Gasoline Tax \nFollies.'' I will reference part of the article.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, March 15, 2000]\n\n                          Gasoline Tax Follies\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       Teachers of economics cherish bad policies. For example, if \n     New York ever ends rent control, we will lose a prime example \n     of what happens when you try to defy the law of supply and \n     demand. And so we should always be thankful when an important \n     politician makes a really bad policy proposal.\n       Last week George W. Bush graciously obliged, by advocating \n     a reduction in gasoline taxes to offset the current spike in \n     prices. This proposal is a perfect illustration of why we \n     need economic analysis to figure out the true ``incidence'' \n     of taxes: The people who really pay for a tax increase, or \n     benefit from a tax cut, are often not those who ostensibly \n     fork over the cash. In this case, cutting gasoline taxes \n     would do little if anything to reduce the price motorists pay \n     at the pump. It would, however, provide a windfall both to \n     U.S. oil refiners and to the Organization of Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries.\n       Let's start with why the oil cartel should love this \n     proposal. Put yourself in the position of an OPEC minister: \n     What sets the limits to how high you want to push oil prices?\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\n     The answer is that you are afraid that too high a price will \n     lead people to use less gasoline, heating oil and so on, \n     cutting into your exports. Suppose, however, that you can \n     count on the U.S. government to reduce gasoline taxes \n     whenever the price of crude oil rises. Then Americans are \n     less likely to reduce their oil consumption if you conspire \n     to drive prices up--which makes such a conspiracy a \n     considerably more attractive proposition.\n       Anyway, in the short run--and what we have right now is a \n     short-run gasoline shortage--cutting gas taxes probably won't \n     even temporarily reduce prices at the pump. The quantity of \n     oil available for U.S. consumption over the near future is \n     pretty much a fixed number: the inventories on hand plus the \n     supplies already en route from the Middle East. Even if OPEC \n     increases its output next month, supplies are likely to be \n     limited for a couple more months. The rising price of \n     gasoline to consumers is in effect the market's way of \n     rationing that limited supply of oil.\n       Now suppose that we were to cut gasoline taxes. If the \n     price of gas at the pump were to fall, motorists would buy \n     more gas. But there isn't any more gas, so the price at the \n     pump, inclusive of the lowered tax, would quickly be bid \n     right back up to the pre-tax-cut level. And that means that \n     any cut in taxes would show up not in a lower price at the \n     pump, but in a higher price paid to distributors. In other \n     words, the benefits of the tax cut would flow not to \n     consumers but to other parties, mainly the domestic oil \n     refining industry. (As the taxtbooks will tell you, reducing \n     the tax rate on an inelastically supplied good benefits the \n     sellers, not the buyers.)\n       A cynic might suggest that that is the point. But I'd \n     rather think that Mr. Bush isn't deliberately trying to throw \n     his friends in the oil industry a few extra billions; I \n     prefer to believe that the candidate, or whichever adviser \n     decided to make gasoline taxes an issue, was playing a \n     political rather than a financial game.\n       There still remains the argument that the only good tax is \n     a dead tax. This leads us into the whole question of whether \n     those huge federal surplus projections are realistic (they \n     aren't), whether the budget is loaded with fat (it isn't), \n     and so on. But anyway, the gasoline tax is dedicated revenue, \n     used for maintaining and improving the nation's highways. \n     This is one case in which a tax cut would lead directly to \n     cutbacks in a necessary and popular government service. You \n     could say that I am making too much of a mere political \n     gambit. Gasoline prices have increased more than 50 cents per \n     gallon over the past year; Mr. Bush only proposes rolling \n     back 1993's 4.3-cent tax increase.\n       But the gas tax proposal is nonetheless revealing. Mr. Bush \n     numbers some of the world's leading experts on tax incidence \n     among his advisers. I cannot believe that they think cutting \n     gasoline taxes is a good economic policy in the face of an \n     OPEC power play. So this suggests a certain degree of cynical \n     political opportunism. (I'm shocked, shocked!) And it also \n     illustrates the candidate's attachment to a sort of knee-jerk \n     conservatism, according to which tax cuts are the answer to \n     every problem.\n       As a citizen, then, I deplore this proposal. As a college \n     lecturer, however, I am delighted.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Krugman writes:\n\n       Anyway, in the short run--and what we have right now is a \n     short-run gasoline shortage--cutting gas taxes probably won't \n     even temporarily reduce prices at the pump. The quantity of \n     oil available for U.S. consumption over the near future is \n     pretty much a fixed number; the inventories on hand plus the \n     supplies en route from the Middle East. Even if OPEC \n     increases its output next month--\n\n  Which they did, as we heard from the announcements in the last couple \nof days--\n\n     supplies are likely to be limited for a couple more months. \n     The rising price of gasoline to consumers is in effect the \n     market's way of rationing that limited supply of oil.\n       Now suppose that we were to cut gasoline taxes. If the \n     price of gas at the pump were to fall, motorists would buy \n     more gas. But there isn't any more gas, so the price at the \n     pump, inclusive of the lower tax, would quickly be bid right \n     back up to the pre-tax-cut level. And that means that any cut \n     in taxes would show up not in lower price at the pump, but in \n     a higher price paid to distributors. In other words, the \n     benefits of the tax cut would flow not to consumers but to \n     the other parties, mainly the domestic oil refining industry.\n\n  There is a very substantial body of opinion that agrees with that. If \nwe are talking about enhancements of profits of the domestic oil \nrefining industry--and that is going to be the result of legislation--\nwe ought to give consideration to men and women in this country making \nthe minimum wage, trying to make ends meet, playing by the rules, \nworking hard 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year trying to keep their \nfamilies together.\n  There is a more compelling public interest for a modest increase in \nthe minimum wage than in lowering the gas tax. If we are talking about \nproviding some relief to the American consumers, it seems to me among \nthe American consumers, the ones who are the most hard-pressed in our \nsociety, are those who are earning the minimum wage. If we are \ninterested in providing such relief, we ought to at least address their \nparticular needs.\n  That is what this amendment will do, and that is the reason I have \nfiled it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss a \nDear Colleague letter which Senator Biden and I are circulating today. \nI expect to have the agreement of at least two other Senators to \ncirculate this Dear Colleague letter. It is an effort to deal with the \nvery serious problems which have been caused by the rise in the price \nof oil as a result of the activities of the OPEC countries.\n  The price of imported crude oil rose from $10.92 per barrel, for the \nfirst quarter of 1999, to over $31 per barrel in this month. In the \nfirst quarter of last year gasoline prices were, on an average, 95 \ncents per gallon, and heating oil was 80 cents per gallon. A year later \nboth have peaked at $1.70.\n  On Tuesday, the day before yesterday, OPEC agreed to raise oil \nproduction over the next 3 months by up to 1.7 million barrels a day. \nBut this is far less than what is necessary to take care of the very \nserious problems imposed upon Americans at the gas pump, for heating \noil, diesel fuel for the truckers, and our whole society beyond the \nUnited States--foreign countries, as well--as a result of these cartels \nand conspiracies.\n  This conduct is reprehensible. If it were going on in the United \nStates, it would be a clear-cut violation of our antitrust laws.\n  There have been declarations at the international level. The \nOrganization for Economic Development, consisting of some 29 countries, \nmade a declaration in March of 1998 that conspiracies in restraint of \ntrade constitute a violation of international law.\n  At about the same time, 11 countries from Latin America made a \nsimilar declaration that conspiracies of cartels to restrain trade \nviolate international law.\n  After a considerable amount of research, we are writing to the \nPresident asking him to consider two courses of litigation going to \ncourt. One course of action would be to file suit under United States \nantitrust laws, because these conspiracies of cartels in restraint of \ntrade have an economic impact on the United States. There is ample \nauthority for the Government of the United States to proceed in this \nway.\n  Suits were filed by private parties in 1979 in the Central District \nof California. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded in \n1981 that it would be inappropriate for a U.S. court to pass on that \nsubject because international law was not clearly defined at that time. \nBut there have been significant developments in international law since \nthat 1981 decision by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit so \nthat, in my judgment, the opportunities would be excellent to win this \ncase and certainly well worth the effort.\n  The Dear Colleague letter which we are submitting has a second \naspect, and that is a recommendation to the President that legal action \nbe instituted in the International Court of Justice, perhaps for only \nan advisory opinion, that OPEC countries were violating international \nlaw.\n  I was surprised to see the International Court of Justice take \njurisdiction in a case involving the issue of the legality to use or \nthreaten to use nuclear weapons in war. I had thought that such an \nissue would be what is called nonjusticiable law, that is, not subject \nto going to court. You talk\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\nabout national sovereignty. You talk about nuclear weapons. Such a \nsubject would be really beyond the scope of what the International \nCourt of Justice would decide. But the court did take jurisdiction on \nthat issue. The court rendered an advisory opinion it would be illegal \nto either use or threaten to use nuclear weapons except in self-\ndefense.\n  We have also seen, in the last few years, very significant \ndevelopments in international law with the War Crimes Tribunal for the \nformer Yugoslavia, where there have been indictments, prosecutions and \nconvictions for crimes against humanity. There was also the extensive \nuse of international law from the War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda.\n\n  In a surprising case which has captured international headlines for \nmonths, an effort has been made to try Pinochet, former leader of \nChile, on the application of the courts of Spain, although the acts did \nnot occur in Spain. Customarily under criminal law, the prosecution is \nbrought where the acts occurred. Pinochet was in England. There was a \ntremendous amount of litigation there. Surprisingly, there was an \nextension of international law into areas where conduct is really \ndespicable, as are the allegations related to Pinochet. Recently the \nformer dictator from Chad was tried in the courts of Senegal on charges \nof torture and violation of human rights.\n  We are looking at a rapidly expanding international picture. I \nbelieve we ought to be taking every step possible to deal with these \ncartels and this conspiratorial and reprehensible conduct by the OPEC \nnations. While they have agreed to raise production slightly, we are at \ntheir whim for action any time they see fit to cut back on production, \nto extract and extort enormous sums of money from consumers in the \nUnited States and consumers around the world.\n  This is not a problem for this day only. This is a problem which \nplagued the United States, with the long gas lines in 1974, 26 years \nago, but I remember them well. People lined up for three blocks waiting \nin a gas line to get some fuel. By the time you got there, the pumps \nsometimes were out or sometimes it was limited. There is no reason why \nwe should have to put up with this kind of conduct because it does \nviolate international norms and really ought to be stopped.\n  This letter does not contain any reference to actions on a class \naction basis by consumers. Right now, the antitrust law calls for \nactions only by so-called direct purchasers. But consideration is being \ngiven by a number of Senators to an amendment to the existing antitrust \nlaws to allow indirect purchasers; that is, somebody who buys gas at \nthe pump. Texaco could sue OPEC, at least would have standing to sue \nOPEC. There would be the other considerations that would have standing \nas a direct purchaser.\n  Under a case denominated Illinois v. Brick, an indirect consumer \ncannot sue. But I believe there would be good reason to amend our \nantitrust laws, limited to the field of purchases relating to oil. That \nis a distinction, because oil is such a critical part of our economy \nand such a critical part of our everyday life: for keeping our houses \nand offices warm, our general buildings warm, to supplying gasoline for \ntruckers who transport necessary items for everyday life, and for the \ngasoline which is necessary for our automobiles. This is where we have \nbeen gouged by the OPEC conduct.\n  Some have raised the question: What good would it do to take these \ncases to court; what would the remedy be? The fact is, there are \nconsiderable assets from these OPEC countries in the United States \nwhich would be subject to attachment. With respect to the suit in the \nInternational Court of Justice, there would be considerable opprobrium \nin being sued, hauled into court. Nobody likes to be sued, whether an \nindividual, a company, or a country. This conduct is reprehensible and \nwe ought to call them on it.\n  I do believe, in the final analysis, our U.S. laws on antitrust would \nenable us to get a remedy. Actually, the International Court of Justice \nwould hold out these international pirates to be nothing more than they \nare, really preying on the weak, those who have to buy the oil at any \nprice. This conspiracy and restraint of trade and these cartels ought \nnot to be allowed to go on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nletter to the President be printed in the Record, together with a copy \nof a Dear Colleague letter which Senator Biden and I are circulating.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In light of the very serious problems \n     caused by the recent increase in oil prices, we know you will \n     share our view that we should explore every possible \n     alternative to stop OPEC and other oil-producing states from \n     entering into agreements to restrict oil production in order \n     to drive up the price of oil.\n       This conduct is nothing more than an old-fashioned \n     conspiracy in restraint of trade which has long been \n     condemned under U.S. law, and which should be condemned under \n     international law.\n       After some considerable research, we suggest that serious \n     consideration be given to two potential lawsuits against OPEC \n     and the nations conspiring with it:\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based, perhaps, upon an advisory opinion under ``the \n     general principles of law recognized by civilized nations,'' \n     which includes prohibiting oil cartels from conspiring to \n     limit production and raise prices.\n     (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust law\n       A case can be made that your Administration can sue OPEC in \n     Federal district court under U.S. antitrust law. OPEC is \n     clearly engaging in a ``conspiracy in restraint of trade'' in \n     violation of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). The \n     Administration has the power to sue under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 4 \n     for injunctive relief to prevent such collusion.\n       In addition, the Administration should consider suing OPEC \n     for treble damages under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     15a), since OPEC's behavior has caused an ``injury'' to U.S. \n     ``property.'' After all, the U.S. government is a major \n     consumer of petroleum products and must now pay higher prices \n     for these products. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330 \n     (1979), the Supreme Court held that the consumers who were \n     direct purchasers of certain hearing aides who alleged that \n     collusion among manufacturers had led to an increase in \n     prices had standing to sue those manufacturers under the \n     Clayton Act since ``a consumer deprived of money by reason of \n     allegedly anticompetitive conduct is injured in `property' \n     within the meaning of [the Clayton Act].'' Indirect \n     purchasers would appear to be precluded from suit, even in a \n     class action, under Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 \n     (1977), but this would not bar the United States Government, \n     as a direct purchaser, from having the requisite standing.\n       One potential obstacle to such a suit is whether the \n     Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (``FSIA'') provides OPEC, a \n     group of sovereign foreign nations, with immunity from suit \n     in U.S. courts. To date, there has been a ruling on this \n     issue in only one case. In International Association of \n     Machinists v. OPEC, 477 F. Supp. 553 (1979), the District \n     Court for the Central District of California held that the \n     nations which comprise OPEC were immune from suit in the \n     United States under the FSIA. We believe that this opinion \n     was wrongly decided and that other district courts, including \n     the D.C. District, can and should revisit the issue.\n       This decision in Int. Assoc. of Machinists turned on the \n     technical issue of whether or not the nations which comprise \n     OPEC are engaging in ``commercial activity'' or \n     ``governmental activity'' when they cooperate to sell their \n     oil. If they are engaging in ``governmental activity,'' then \n     the FSIA shields them from suit in U.S. courts. If, however, \n     these nations are engaging in ``commercial activity,'' then \n     they are subject to suit in the U.S. The California District \n     Court held that OPEC activity is ``governmental activity.'' \n     We disagree. It is certainly a governmental activity for a \n     nation to regulate the extraction of petroleum from its \n     territory by ensuring compliance with zoning, environmental \n     and other regulatory regimes. It is clearly a commercial \n     activity, however, for these nations to sit together and \n     collude to limit their oil production for the sole purpose of \n     increasing prices.\n       The 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in \n     Int. Assoc. of Machinists in 1981 (649 F.2d 1354), but on the \n     basis of an entirely different legal principle. The 9th \n     Circuit held that the Court could not hear this case because \n     of the ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a U.S. \n     court will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute \n     which would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign state.\n       The 9th Circuit itself acknowledged in its Int. Assoc. of \n     Machinists opinion that ``The [act of state] doctrine does \n     not suggest a rigid rule of application,'' but rather \n     application of the rule will depend on the circumstances of \n     each case. The Court also noted that, ``A further \n     consideration is the\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\n     availability of internationally-accepted legal principles \n     which would render the issues appropriate for judicial \n     disposition.'' The Court then quotes from the Supreme Court's \n     opinion in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 \n     (1964):\n\n       ``It should be apparent that the greater the degree of \n     codification or consensus concerning a particular area of \n     international law, the more appropriate it is for the \n     judiciary to render decisions regarding it, since the courts \n     can then focus on the application of an agreed principle to \n     circumstances of fact rather than on the sensitive task of \n     establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national \n     interest or with international justice.''\n\n       Since the 9th Circuit issued its opinion in 1981, there \n     have been major developments in international law that impact \n     directly on the subject matter at issue. As we discuss in \n     greater detail below, the 1990's have witnessed a significant \n     increase in efforts to seek compliance with basic \n     international norms of behavior through international \n     courts and tribunals. In addition, there is strong \n     evidence of an emerging consensus in international law \n     that price fixing by cartels violates such international \n     norms. Accordingly, a court choosing to apply the act of \n     state doctrine to a dispute with OPEC today may very well \n     reach a different conclusion than the 9th Circuit reached \n     almost twenty years ago.\n       You should also examine whether the anticompetitive conduct \n     of the international oil cartel is being effectuated by \n     private companies who are subject to the enforcement of U.S. \n     antitrust laws (for example, former state oil companies that \n     have now been privatized) rather than sovereign foreign \n     states. If such private oil companies are determined to in \n     fact be participating in the anticompetitive conduct of the \n     oil cartel, then we would urge that these companies be named \n     as defendants in an antitrust lawsuit in addition to the OPEC \n     members.\n     (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the Hague \n         based upon ``the general principles of law recognized by \n         civilized nations,'' which includes prohibiting oil \n         cartels from conspiring to limit production and raise \n         prices\n       In addition to such domestic antitrust actions, we believe \n     you should give serious consideration to bringing a case \n     against OPEC before the International Court of Justice (the \n     ``ICJ'') at the Hague. You should consider both a direct suit \n     against the conspiring nations as well as a request for an \n     advisory opinion from the Court through the auspices of the \n     U.N. Security Council. The actions of OPEC in restraint of \n     trade violate ``the general principles of law recognized by \n     civilized nations.'' Under Article 38 of the Statute of the \n     ICJ, the Court is required to apply these ``general \n     principles'' when deciding cases before it.\n       This would clearly be a cutting-edge lawsuit, making new \n     law at the international level. But there have been exciting \n     developments in recent years which suggest that the ICJ would \n     be willing to move in this direction. In a number of \n     contexts, we have seen a greater respect for and adherence to \n     fundamental international principles and norms by the world \n     community. For example, we have seen the establishment of the \n     International Criminal Court in 1998, the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994, and the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993. Each of \n     these bodies has been active, handing down numerous \n     indictments and convictions against individuals who have \n     violated fundamental principles of human rights. For example, \n     as of December 1, 1999 the Yugoslavia tribunal alone had \n     handed down 91 public indictments.\n       Today, adherence to international principles has spread \n     from the tribunals in the Hague to individual nations around \n     the world. Recently, the exiled former dictator of Chad, \n     Hissene Habre, was indicted in Senegal on charges of torture \n     and barbarity stemming from his reign, where he allegedly \n     killed and tortured thousands. This case is similar to the \n     case brought against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet \n     by Spain on the basis of his alleged atrocities in Chile. At \n     the request of the Spanish government, Pinochet was detained \n     in London for months until an English court determined that \n     he was too ill to stand trial.\n       The emerging scope of international law was demonstrated in \n     an advisory opinion sought by the U.N. General Assembly in \n     1996 to declare illegal the use or threat to use nuclear \n     weapons. Such an issue would ordinarily be thought beyond the \n     scope of a judicial determination given the doctrines of \n     national sovereignty and the importance of nuclear weapons to \n     the defense of many nations. The ICJ ultimately ruled eight \n     to seven, however, that the use or threat to use nuclear \n     weapons ``would generally be contrary to the rules of \n     international law applicable in armed conflict, and in \n     particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law.'' \n     The fact that this issue was subject to a decision by the \n     ICJ, shows the rapidly expanding horizons of international \n     law.\n       While these emerging norms of international behavior have \n     tended to focus more on human rights than on economic \n     principles, there is one economic issue on which an \n     international consensus has emerged in recent years--the \n     illegitimacy of price fixing by cartels. For example, on \n     April 27, 1998, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development issued an official ``Recommendation'' that all \n     twenty-nine member nations ``ensure that their competition \n     laws effectively halt and deter hard core cartels.'' The \n     recommendation defines ``hard core cartels'' as those which, \n     among other things, fix prices or establish output \n     restriction quotas. The Recommendation further instructs \n     member countries ``to cooperate with each other in enforcing \n     their laws against such cartels.''\n       On October 9, 1998, eleven Western Hemisphere countries \n     held the first ``Antitrust Summit of the Americas'' in Panama \n     City, Panama. At the close of the summit, all eleven \n     participants issued a joint communique in which they express \n     their intention ``to affirm their commitment to effective \n     enforcement of sound competition laws, particularly in \n     combating illegal price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market \n     allocation.'' The communique further expresses the intention \n     of these countries to ``cooperate with one another . . . to \n     maximize the efficacy and efficiency of the enforcement of \n     each country's competition laws.'' One of the countries \n     participating in this communique, Venezuela, is a member of \n     OPEC.\n       The behavior of OPEC and other oil-producing nations in \n     restraint of trade violates U.S. antitrust law and basic \n     international norms, and it is injuring the United States and \n     its citizens in a very real way. Consideration of such legal \n     action could provide an inducement to OPEC and other oil-\n     producing countries to raise production to head off such \n     litigation.\n       We hope that you will seriously consider judicial action to \n     put an end to such behavior.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Colleague: In light of the very serious problems \n     caused by the recent increase in oil prices, we know you will \n     share our view that we should explore every possible \n     alternative to stop OPEC and other oil-producing states from \n     entering into agreements to restrict oil production in order \n     to drive up the price of oil.\n       This conduct is nothing more than an old-fashioned \n     conspiracy in restraint of trade which has long been \n     condemned under U.S. law, and which should be condemned under \n     international law.\n       After some considerable research, we suggest that serious \n     consideration be given to two potential lawsuits against OPEC \n     and the nations conspiring with it:\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations,'' which includes prohibiting oil \n     cartels from conspiring to limit production and raise prices.\n       We ask you to sign the enclosed letter to President Clinton \n     which urges him to consider these two litigation options.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 2285--a bill \nthat is so flawed I can't believe the majority wants to end debate on \nit before the debate has even begun, with no committee hearings, no \nfloor debate, no bipartisan discussion over something as important as \nthe tax base for our highway and transportation infrastructure needs. \nThis is literally an ``Our Way or the Highway'' bill, and I will choose \nthe highway.\n  As a southerner, I represent a large number of farmers and about \n1,600 independent trucking firms. Eleven hundred of those firms are \none-truck operators; 250 operate 10 or fewer trucks. I've got at least \nseven of the largest trucking firms in the Nation based in my State, as \nwell as the world's largest retailer, which operates about 4,000 \ntrucks, and one of the largest food processors which operates about \n1,500. I am opposed to S. 2285 and should I have the opportunity, I \nwill vote against it.\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n  First of all, none of the truckers or farmers that operate in my \nState would receive any benefits from the bill being discussed today, \nor any of the other bills that are based on a reduction in Federal \nexcise taxes.\n  They are calling this proposal the ``federal fuels tax holiday'' I \ncan tell the Senate that if this bill passes, we won't be celebrating \nin Arkansas.\n  A key point that must have been overlooked by the authors of this \nbill is that some States like Arkansas, any reductions in Federal fuel \nexcise taxes automatically require a penny-for-penny increase in the \nState fuel excise tax.\n  If we could have had committee hearings on this bill, perhaps the \nentire body might know that my State, along with Oklahoma, Nevada, \nTennessee, and California all have provisions that will in some way \nnegate any decrease in the Federal tax by increasing the state tax.\n  Many States use the funds they receive from the Federal Government \ntransportation formulas to issue bonded debt. They depend on the gas \ntax to pay for these bonds and to fund their transportation needs.\n  Smartly, many of the States recognized that you can't always rely on \nthe promises you get from Washington. I am glad that the State \nlegislators of my State had the wisdom and the foresight to anticipate \nill-conceived notions by Congress such as the bill before us today that \nwould put our highway and transit programs at risk.\n  Further, even in those States that would not automatically increase \nexcise taxes, there is no guarantee that the consumers would see a \nprice decrease at the pump. These taxes are charged at the wholesale \nlevel.\n  The only thing this bill offers is a ``sense-of-the-Congress'' clause \nthat says to the big business: ``Here you go, have a huge tax decrease; \nby the way, we sure hope you guys will pass it on.''\n  Further, there is no credit in the bill for retail stocks. That means \nthat even if this tax reduction were to pass both Houses and make it \npast the President with lightening speed, the gas in retail inventories \nwould still be priced with the tax. There is no telling how long it \nwould take for the fuel that wasn't taxed to finally make it to \nconsumers.\n  One last thing about cutting the Federal excise taxes on fuels: these \nare the dollars that go into our highway trust fund. I know that this \nbill has some statutory hocus-pocus that takes the money out of general \nrevenues, but are we really protecting the highway trust fund, and \nSocial Security by hopping from trust fund to trust fund until we find \none that the voters aren't watching?\n  They say this bill is paid for out of the ``on-budget'' surplus. I \nask, where is that? We don't even have a budget resolution, let alone a \nsurplus. I think we should make sure that a surplus exists before \ndeciding to spend it. The bottom line is this bill isn't paid for and \nthe money is simply going to come out of debt reduction, education, and \nout of Medicare reform dollars that are so needed in the country.\n  I have spoken with the truckers in my state and they have told me \nthat they need help. And I want to help them in a way that is \nreasonable and will actually reach them. But the way this bill is \nstructured no relief will make it to them. If we really want to help \ntruckers and consumers effectively then we should have a package that \nhelps them right now and through the end of the fiscal year.\n  In the very short term, we should consider a suspension of the heavy \nvehicle use tax that is due on every big rig. This tax break would go \ndirectly to the people in need, and it would have a very quick impact.\n  This tax is due on July 1, but it can be paid quarterly. Suspending \nthe heavy vehicle use tax would equal about $550.00 in relief for every \ntruck on the road, and we wouldn't have to wait for the effects of \nmarket pricing to see relief at the consumer level.\n  Also, we should consider low-or no-interest loans to help small \nbusiness men and women make it through this price spike. In the \nintermediate months, truckers, and producers who have been pushed to \nthe edge could find help in load assistance until oil prices come down.\n  Finally, we should consider end-of-the-year formula tax credits that \nwould go directly to the consumers and could be directly tied to oil \nprices which, as I speak, are dropping.\n  We are all aware of the recent announcements that have been made by \nthe oil exporting countries. Prices are falling and the price spike is \ncoming down. While we all want to ensure that the high prices we have \nhad will not drive small business people into bankruptcy, our relief \npackage should be flexible enough to take falling prices into account.\n  Beyond the rash and reckless way that we have come to consider this \nbill, and beyond the abomination that it is, there remains the \nunderlying issue of our nation's energy policy. This knee-jerk bill is \na reaction to a host of problems and just because oil prices are \nstarting to come down we should not let this issue fall to the wayside.\n  There is no excuse for the lack of a comprehensive energy policy that \nwe suffer from in this country. The roller coaster ups and downs of oil \nprices in 1999 and 2000 are evidence that we have been completely \nreactive to market forces and have not established stable, long-term \nenergy policies.\n  It is obvious that no immediate, cost-effective government action \ncould eliminate U.S. dependence on foreign oil entirely, but there are \nthings that we should be doing to help reduce our dependence on oil as \nan energy source.\n  To help lessen the economic shocks that oil price spikes have \ncreated, we should couple short term relief provisions such as the ones \nI have spoken about with smart, stable, long-term, energy policies.\n  Through the use of petroleum supply enhancements such as energy \nconservation, use of renewables, and expanded U.S. production we could \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil. We must provide incentives to try \nto bring ourselves away from dependence on oil in general. We must set \nout a course to promote oil production at home, to promote the use of \nrenewable sources of energy, and to promote the more efficient and \ncleaner uses of the fossil fuels we are still using.\n  Mr. President, many of us in this body have been pushing for expanded \nuses of renewables for quite some time and we will continue to do so. \nThis spike in fuel prices demonstrates that we need to shift our \nemphasis from research to the practical use and application of \nrenewable sources of energy.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, this knee-jerk reaction to high oil prices \nrepresents a reckless abandonment of the priorities we brought to the \nCongress last year--Social Security, Medicare, paying down our national \ndebt, and educating our children.\n  I want to do whatever I can to help my constituents who are dependent \non diesel for their livelihoods, but if we adopt measures to eliminate, \nalbeit temporarily, gas taxes, we will not get the help to those who \nneed it.\n  When a core business segment of this nation is under duress we should \naddress that segment directly. We must get the help to the ground where \nit is needed. In our present situation, we should be pursuing targeted \nassistance in the forms of loan assistance, grants, and reasonable tax \nmeasures that actually get to the level of the consumer who need it the \nmost.\n  We can't afford to jeopardize funding for our roads, the stability of \nSocial Security and Medicare, or the long-term goal of paying down our \nenormous debt. This bill would do just that, Mr. President, and I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose the ``fuel tax holiday'' bill before the party \ngets out of hand, to ensure our roads will be funded and, more \nimportantly, that we go about it in a reasonable way and get relief to \nthe individuals who need it the most.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas, and I \nhope that other Senators pay close attention to her and her very \npersuasive remarks as to why legislation that will potentially come up \nin this body to repeal the 4.3-cent gasoline tax is a bad idea.\n  The long and short of it, as the Senator said, is that the reason for \nthe high gasoline prices is basically OPEC. OPEC made an announcement \nwhich will have the effect of lowering gas prices. I think the 4.3-cent \ntax is a phantom reduction. There will not be lower prices as a \nconsequence of the\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nproposal. I think the refineries will keep it and they won't pass it \non. There are a whole host of reasons. The main point that is worth \nconsidering is that we labored mightily in this body and in the other \nbody a couple years ago to pass a very significant highway program; we \ncalled it TEA 21. Was that significant? It said that for the first time \nall of the Federal gas taxes were going to the highway trust fund, and \nthe highway trust fund would be used only for highways. It was a \ncommitment: People who drive cars and trucks in our country and pay the \nFederal gas tax or diesel tax will know that tax is going to the \nhighway trust fund and it should stay in the trust fund, with the trust \nfund dollars to be allocated among the States to build and repair our \nhighways. That was it. It was that simple.\n  So if the bill that may come before this body, which the Senator was \naddressing, were to be enacted, it would break that trust, break that \ncommitment. It would open up the highway trust fund to potentially any \npurpose. It would just be the camel's nose under the tent. It would be \nthe first step down the slippery slope of taking trust fund money and \nusing it for other purposes. Why do I say that? Because part of the \namendment is to say, OK, let's replenish it with general revenue. We \nall know ``general revenue'' is a slippery slope around here. We don't \nknow how much general revenue there is going to be; therefore, the \nsolidarity of the dollars going into the trust fund and dollars coming \nout of the trust fund to pay for highway modernization and new highways \nhas to be kept sacrosanct. I hope the Senate rejects the position to \nrepeal the 4.3-cent gas tax. It is a bad idea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1946-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1946-S1947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LAUNCHING OUR COMMUNITIES' ACCESS TO LOCAL TELEVISION ACT OF 2000--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Frankly, I wasn't happy with the way we were \nabout to leave the last session of Congress, so I stood up on the floor \nand tossed a little bit of obstruction around until we got a firmer \ncommitment that by a certain date we would bring up legislation in this \nbody directed toward financing satellites or other entities so that we \ncould provide local-into-local coverage throughout our country. I am \nvery happy now that this bill is before us. As a consequence of the \ndeference of myself and others, we are now here.\n  Very simply, the need for this is extremely important. This chart \nshows markets that aren't now covered and will be covered under the \nbasic bill to be passed. There aren't very many of them. The red dots \ndepict areas where people can get local-into-local coverage. There are \n210 TV markets in our country. You can tell that the red dots don't \nnumber 210. In fact, they number something much less than that. I might \nsay that number 210 happens to be right up here--Glasgow, MT. Butte, I \nthink, is 167, and there is Billings. We have a bunch of TV markets in \nour State, but they are nowhere near where the read dots are.\n  With the passage of last year's bill, 67 markets will have coverage. \nOnly 67 of the 210 markets will eventually get coverage and have local-\ninto-local television coverage. Thirty-five percent of the homes in my \nState would receive video programming through satellite. Our State \nflower is the bitterroot, but we have a new State flower now, the \nsatellite dish, because we in Montana have the highest per capita \nutilization of satellite dishes--more than any other State in the \nNation. Montanans per capita have more satellite dishes. It is because \nMontana is so big. We are a rural State. There are only about 900,000 \npeople in our State, with about 147,000 square miles. You can see why \nsatellite dishes are so important. But because we are so rural and \nbecause so many other States are so rural, we are not getting local \nsatellite coverage. It stands to reason because the satellite companies \nare going to give the coverage to the greatest markets where they will \nmake the most money, as well they should. Companies are there to get \nthe highest rate of return. So they are going to go where they can make \nthe greater returns, and that is going to be the cities.\n\n  It is only fair that the rest of America also be wired in. That is \nwhy I think this bill is so important. It will take a few years to \naccomplish it, but at least we will get there.\n  What are the reasons for having it? One is to find out what your \nlocal team is doing.\n  Here is a chart. This is the University of Montana Grizzlies. Most \nfolks like to know how the home team did. If you don't get local-to-\nlocal satellite coverage, it is pretty hard to know. You might be able \nto find out for New York, Denver, or Florida. But when you are from a \nsmaller community and a smaller town, you only care about the local \nteam. You can't get it now with satellite coverage in my State of \nMontana and in most places.\n  Maybe it is not the local team. Maybe it is weather conditions. Is a \nstorm coming? What is the weather report? Our State sometimes has \nblizzards. Sometimes it snows--not very often. Most people think \nMontana is awfully cold; that we have a lot of snow. Montana is really \nnot very cold. It doesn't snow that much. But every once in a while it \nsnows. We kind of like to know every once in a while when it is going \nto happen. So we need local notice. Local-to-local is critical \nthroughout our country.\n  The final point I will make is demonstrated by this chart. This shows \nhow well the Rural Utilities Service, a branch of USDA, is already \nserving America--the telephone cooperatives, and with the power \ncooperatives around the State. RUS is a loan guarantor. It guarantees \nloans for wastewater proposals, for electric distribution, \ntransportation, telecommunications, telephone, and distance learning. \nIt guarantees loans to finance operations to build these \ninfrastructures all over the country.\n  The basic point is a very simple one. We have an organization in \nplace. It is serving America well. Why not allow the Rural Utilities \nService to, essentially, be the agency that provides the additional \nloan guarantees for satellites and to give assistance to rural areas?\n  The underlying bill before us sets up a board to do all of this. I \nsubmit that another board and another level of bureaucracy does not \nmake sense. We already have an organization that is doing it. Also, \nthis RUS organization has a very good record. In fact, in the last 50 \nyears, the Rural Utilities Service has not had one loan loss in its \ntelecommunications program--not one. That is indicated by the green \ndots scattered throughout the country.\n  When we finally pass this legislation, remember that we already have \nan agency doing a good job.\n  I also urge adoption of the pending amendment offered by Senator \nJohnson, which adds the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance \nCorporation as another lender in addition to FDIC-insured banks. I \nthink it is helpful to have that availability. We are more likely to \nget the financing.\n\n  I must also say that I hope we include in the underlying legislation \na provision which encourages the loan guarantors at the lending \ninstitutions to finance new satellite operations not only for local-to-\nlocal coverage but also to help in the availability of broader \nbandwidth and higher-speed Internet connections because we have the \nopportunity now while we are providing satellite service for local use \nto also say: OK, maybe we should also give some consideration to \nwireless, broad bandwidth, and higher-speed access to the Internet \nbecause clearly that is the way of the future. Many of the urban parts \nof our country have broad bandwidths. It is 10 times more expensive, \nbut they have it.\n  In addition, many companies are competing vigorously to provide this \nservice all across the country. They are doing it the good old American \nway--based on a profit motive. That is great. That is what built \nAmerica. But a consequence is that rural America often doesn't get near \nthe same coverage as urban America for the same reason, that satellite \ncompanies are not providing local-to-local to America; namely, because \nit doesn't pay nearly as well in rural America as it does in urban \nAmerica.\n  I am saying that whoever makes the decision, I hope it is not the \nboard. But\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\nif it is the board, give them incentives to provide financing and \nguarantee financing for satellite companies. It could be perhaps a \ncable company. It might even be a telephone company that would provide \nlocal-to-local cable service. But also they would be in a position to \nmore quickly provide broad bandwidth to the same area.\n  That is the sum and substance of what I hope we do. I think it makes \na lot of sense.\n  For those Senators who have some questions about some of these \npoints, I am more than willing to sit down and try to work out some of \nthe details. Some of the details can be worked out in conference as \nwell. But let us not let perfection be the enemy of good.\n  I think these are pretty good ideas. They are not perfect, but they \nare good. I urge my colleagues to work together to try to incorporate \nthese provisions.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last 3 months I have come to the \nfloor of the Senate on more than 20 occasions to talk about the need to \nassist the Nation's senior citizens and families under Medicare with \nhelp with the extraordinary costs so many of them are experiencing for \nprescription medicine. I am very pleased to report some very exciting, \npositive developments that have taken place in the last few hours on \nthis issue as a result of the bipartisan effort in the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I particularly want to commend my colleagues Senators Snowe and \nSmith. Senators Snowe and Smith have teamed up with me on a bipartisan \nbasis for more than 15 months to address this enormous need of the \nNation's older people.\n  Today in the Budget Committee we took a concrete, tangible step to \nset in place the kind of program that really will provide meaningful \nrelief for the Nation's older people. We did it in a way that will be \nconsistent with long-term Medicare reform, a view that is a view shared \nby Members on both sides of the aisle. It allows for universal coverage \nand a program that is voluntary. That is to ensure that older people \ncan make the choices that are good for them.\n  Specifically, what the Budget Committee did is provide legislation \nthat would allocate $20 billion during the next 3 years to put in place \na prescription drug program, and then make it possible to add another \n$20 billion in the next fiscal year, which would be fiscal year 2004-\n2005, as part of an effort to ensure solvency, long-term Medicare \nreform, and to do it in a way that would not cause an on-budget deficit \nin those later years.\n  I have believed for a long time that at a time when more than 20 \npercent of our Nation's older people are spending over $1,000 a year \nout of pocket on their prescription medicine, when we have millions of \nseniors with an average of 18 prescriptions a year, that it is \nimportant we put in place, on a bipartisan basis, meaningful relief for \nthe Nation's older people.\n  Today, on a bipartisan basis, the Budget Committee said the Finance \nCommittee should report a plan on or before September 1 of this year to \nhelp older people with their prescription drug medicine to ensure that \n$20 billion would be available for fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, \nand, accompanied by real reform of the Medicare Program, there could be \n$20 billion for fiscal years 2004 and 2005.\n  This required, frankly, compromise on both sides. For example, one of \nthe stipulations in what was done by the Budget Committee today was a \nstipulation that there could not be transfers of new subsidies from the \ngeneral fund to extend solvency. Frankly, some of my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle had supported those kinds of transfers in \nthe past.\n  I think after many months of debate, and certainly a lot of \nprognosticators saying it was not possible in this session of Congress \nto make real headway on the prescription drug issue, and, in fact, to \nget the job done, what the Senate Budget Committee showed this morning \nin a very significant breakthrough is that we are now on our way to \naddress the needs of older people. In fact, this language would be \nbinding. The language adopted by the Budget Committee, setting out the \nparameters for the adoption of a prescription drug program for the \nNation's elderly under Medicare, would be binding.\n  In addition to my two colleagues Senators Snowe and Smith, I would \nlike to single out a number of others on a bipartisan basis who helped \nus. Chairman Domenici, for example, was one who, in many conversations \nwith me on this issue, talked about the need to make this program \nconsistent with long-term Medicare reform and to make Medicare more \nsolvent in the future. That is an issue that has been highlighted by \nSenators Daschle, Lautenberg, and Conrad as well. But the fact that \nSenator Domenici emphasized that in the last couple of days helped us \nfind common ground this morning.\n\n  This is a vast improvement on what the House has thus far been able \nto accomplish on this issue of prescription drugs. Specifically, the \nSenate made it clear we could launch a prescription drug program that \nwould offer $40 billion of assistance to the Nation's older people, a \nprogram that would assist all senior citizens. So the Senate was able, \nthis morning, in the Budget Committee, on a bipartisan basis, to add a \nsignificant amount of additional relief. That was important.\n  The House did not address the solvency issue and that is what, in \nfact, the Senate did. In that sense it is a dramatic improvement. What \nwe did, in terms of the dollars on a bipartisan basis, is today we \nraised the amount the Senate would make available for the program to \n$40 billion. Originally that amount was $20 billion.\n  The fundamental point remains. We addressed this issue by adding more \nmoney than was originally envisaged in the mark that came out from the \nSenate. We were able to do it in a way that addressed the Medicare \nsolvency question. The House did not really touch the Medicare solvency \nquestion, and we think, on a bipartisan basis in the Senate this \nmorning, that was important.\n  Finally, we know the revolution in American health care has \nessentially bypassed the Medicare Program. A lot of these medicines \ntoday help older people to stay well. They help to lower blood \npressure. They help to lower cholesterol. They are medicines that \npromote wellness. They do not just take care of folks when they are \nsick. As a result of the work done today, we made a major step forward \nin modernizing this program and bringing it in line with the rest of \nthe American health care system.\n  I reported on the floor of the Senate recently a case of an older \nperson in Hillsboro, OR, who had to be hospitalized for 6 weeks because \nPart A of Medicare would pay his prescription drug bill and he could \nnot afford his medicine on an outpatient basis. Today, as a result of \nwhat the Senate Budget Committee did, that person will be in a position \nto get his medicine on an outpatient basis.\n  They will be able to get help because the Senate improved on what the \nHouse has been talking about by putting more of a focus on solvency, \nand\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\nwe were able to take the amount of the program up to $40 billion beyond \nwhat the original discussion had been in the Senate, just $20 billion.\n  Finally, we need to understand there is a long way to go from here. \nWe are going to have to defend what was done by the Senate Budget \nCommittee this morning on the floor of the Senate. Then we will have a \nconference with the House. I hope we will come out of that discussion \nwith the House ensuring there is $40 billion for the prescription drug \nprogram, that it is possible to have universal coverage, that it is \nvoluntary, that it is consistent with Medicare reform, and that it \ngives older people bargaining power in the private sector to get more \naffordable medicine.\n  There is a long way to go in the process. This morning's breakthrough \nwas just one step in the process. It was a chance to go forward in a \nway that is fiscally responsible--$20 billion for the first 3 years to \nas the first downpayment, as Senator Snowe has characterized it, on \nprescription drug relief, but then also to say there will be another \n$20 billion available in 2004 and 2005 when it is accompanied by \nreform.\n  We also work to ensure solvency, and for the first time, we put real \ntime constraints on getting a prescription drug benefit done .\n  As was pointed out yesterday in the Senate Finance Committee by \nSenator Breaux, there have been 14 hearings on the issue of Medicare \nreform and prescription drug coverage for older people. Senator Breaux, \nalong with Senator Frist, has a bipartisan bill supported by a number \nof Members of the Senate.\n  What we said this morning in the Budget Committee is that we want the \nFinance Committee, on or before September 1 of this year, to bring us \nlegislation in line with the binding language offered in the Senate \nBudget Committee under the Snowe-Wyden-Smith amendment.\n  Having come to the floor of the Senate on more than 20 occasions, as \nI related those stories about older people who had been put in \nhospitals because they could not afford their medicine on an outpatient \nbasis, older people who were taking two pills a day when they should \nhave been taking three, or breaking their Lipitor capsules--which deals \nwith cholesterol and heart problems--in half, I often thought as I left \nthe floor that we might not be able to make the kind of progress we \nmade today in the Budget Committee.\n  Today, the Budget Committee came together on a bipartisan basis to \nensure there would be sufficient funds to jump-start Medicare reform, \nprovide meaningful relief for the Nation's older people and their \nfamilies, while addressing the solvency question and the need for an \napproach to be consistent with long-term Medicare reform.\n  We have improved on what is being discussed in the House because they \ndo not have the same focus on solvency. I am very much looking \nforward--as we bring that legislation to the floor of the Senate and it \ngoes to conference and the work in the Finance Committee--to continue \nthe progress we saw this morning.\n  Suffice it to say, there were a number of moments today when it was \nlikely that it was all going to break down. Had the Budget Committee \nreported a significantly smaller sum than was finally agreed on, had we \nnot made the kind of changes in the Snowe-Wyden-Smith amendment, we \nmight not have been able to reach a bipartisan agreement on \nprescription drugs this year in the Congress. As a result of what \nhappened today in the Budget Committee and the important work that was \ndone on a bipartisan basis, we have laid the foundation for making sure \nthat before this Congress adjourns and goes home for the year, we have \nacted to help the Nation's older people.\n  For all of those seniors and for all the families who are walking an \neconomic tightrope, balancing their food costs against their fuel bills \nand their fuel bills against their medical bills, my admonition this \nafternoon is that we have a long way to go, but today we really made \nprogress.\n  Today, as a result of bipartisan work, we have an opportunity to \nensure that by fall, on or before September 1, as the amendment adopted \nin the Budget Committee requires, we have a proposal that is \nbipartisan, that is one which provides meaningful relief for older \npeople, that is voluntary, offers universal coverage, and is consistent \nwith long-term Medicare reform. We can have that kind of proposal on \nthe floor of the Senate this fall.\n  For the millions of seniors and families who are watching the \nCongress and looking to see if we can deliver on this issue, progress \nwas made today. I particularly commend Senator Snowe and Senator Smith. \nSenator Smith made a very constructive suggestion towards the end of \nthe markup when we had a debate about when the Budget Committee was \nseeking a product from the Finance Committee. Senator Smith offered a \nvery constructive suggestion. If we can continue to build on that \nbipartisan progress, we can get this job done.\n  I believe--and I will wrap up with this--this country can no longer \nafford to deny coverage for senior citizens' prescription needs under \nMedicare. I use those words deliberately. People ask if we can afford \nto offer the coverage. I am of the view that we cannot afford not to \noffer this coverage because the revolution in American health care is \nabout these new medicines that help people stay well.\n  I have pointed out repeatedly that one can spend $1,000 or $1,500 on \nanticoagulant medicines that help prevent strokes and can stop a stroke \nthat costs more than $100,000.\n  Today, we made very significant progress in ensuring that no longer \ndoes the revolution in American health care bypass the Medicare \nprogram. I look forward to defending what was done in the Budget \nCommittee on prescription drugs on the floor of the Senate when we get \nto the budget and working with the Finance Committee. Senators Moynihan \nand Roth have been very gracious in assuring there will be an \nopportunity for colleagues in both parties to contribute and offer \ntheir ideas and suggestions.\n  If we can continue to build on the progress that was made today in \nthe Budget Committee, we will get this done, and we will get it done \nbefore the end of this session. In my view, this will revolutionize \nAmerican health care and provide meaningful relief to older people and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

Mr. President, many of us worked very hard last year to \nreauthorize and update the Satellite Home Viewer Act.\n  Our principle accomplishment was to authorize satellite carriers to \nprovide local television stations to their subscribers. This change has \nalready spurred enormous growth in the satellite industry and is \nproviding growing competition to the cable industry.\n  Unfortunately, the satellite providers--Echostar and DirecTV--made it \nvery clear that their business plans did not contemplate serving rural \nareas. They were very busy, and they were very upfront in telling us \nthat they were focusing their energies on the top 40 television \nmarkets.\n  So it was clear to Senators like myself who represent rural States \nthat local-into-local was not going to be a reality unless we took \nadditional action to encourage coverage for the 50 percent of the \npopulation that could watch the service being offered in television \nads, but couldn't pick up the phone and order it.\n  We still see a lot of ``not available in Alaska and Hawaii'' fine \nprint on advertisements.\n  They plagued us during telephone days, and now they are plaguing us \nin this period of rapid extension of new technology.\n  That is where the idea was born to provide loan guarantees to help \nmake this service more available to more Americans.\n  All of us owe Senator Conrad Burns a debt of gratitude for pushing \nthis issue so hard and for drafting the measure that was included in \nlast year's\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\nsatellite bill. That provision was dropped.\n  While it was unfortunate that this provision was removed from the \nfinal bill, I am pleased that it is here today, albeit in another form.\n  It is my hope the Senate will move quickly to adopt this measure and \nwill resist accepting amendments that would threaten its ultimate \nenactment.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to say a couple of words about one \nof my oldest and best friends in the Senate, the senior Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Stevens.\n  Last week, Senator Stevens was named ``Alaskan of the Century.'' Most \nof us feel pretty fortunate if we get named for the day, or possibly \nfor the week, and sometimes even the month in our States. He was named \n``Alaskan of the Century.''\n  Well, my good friend, Ted Stevens, deserves that. He has a way about \nhim, as we all know. He keeps me humble. I might talk about the \nhardships of a cold winter day in Vermont. But then I see his eyebrows \ngo up when he explains to me that 40 degrees below zero is just \nbeginning to get nippy--it gets to 75 below in Fairbanks. At that \npoint, I know I am beat.\n  Ted Stevens is a tireless legislator, a respected leader. He helped \ncreate the State of Alaska. How many of us could actually say something \nlike that? He actually helped create a State with his tireless work and \nbrought it into the Union. He did this having already served his \ncountry in so many ways. He was in the Air Force in World War II, \nserved as a U.S. attorney in Fairbanks, and was also an Alaskan State \nrepresentative. And this was on top of so many other things he has \ndone. Today, of course, he serves with great distinction as one of the \nthree most senior Members of the Senate and chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Senator Stevens has consistently been a leader for our Nation's \ndefense issues and has chaired the Senate Rules Committee, Governmental \nAffairs Committee, and Ethics Committee among others.\n  Senator Stevens and I have served together for a long time. As \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee, both of us have worked to find \neconomic opportunities for the rural communities that so many states, \nincluding our own, share. Ted and I have also worked together through \nsome of this Nation's most challenging times. During the divisive days \nof the impeachment trial, Senator Stevens and I were chosen to fly to \nJordan together as representatives of one, united Senate mourning the \ndeath of King Hussein.\n  Senator Stevens is also a strong proponent of Title 9 and women's \nequality in sports. In fact, just this year he sponsored the Women in \nSports Awards luncheon where Monica Seles was honored for her \nexcellence on tennis courts throughout the world. I am sure that Ted, \nan avid tennis player, tried to set up a game with her himself.\n  While he is unquestionably a great legislator, Senator Stevens is \nalso a proud father of six children and has a beautiful wife, \nCatherine. Senator Stevens is an accomplished man with whom I am proud \nto serve in this United States Congress. Alaska, land of the aurora \nborealis and the Midnight Sun, has every reason to be proud of its \nsenior Senator and this award shows Alaskans' gratitude and respect for \nhis tireless work.\n  Ted, congratulations on your well-deserved recognition as Alaskan of \nthe Century.\n  Ted and his wife, Catherine, have long been friends of myself and my \nwife, Marcelle. I consider him very much a member of the old school--\nwhen he gives his word, that is it; go to the bank with it.\n  I have seen several pieces of complex and important legislation go \nthrough this body because Ted Stevens gave his word they would go \nthrough--a word that he never broke with either Republican or Democrat. \nThat is why Ted Stevens has gained so much respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1949-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1949-S1956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LAUNCHING OUR COMMUNITIES' ACCESS TO LOCAL TELEVISION ACT OF 2000--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was a conferee last year on the satellite \ntelevision bill. I worked very hard, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, to put in a provision that would have ensured the benefits \nof this bill would be shared by rural America through a loan guarantee \nprogram.\n  I appreciate the work of the Banking Committee under the leadership \nof Senator Gramm and Senator Sarbanes to report out a bill which \nprovides a strong framework in which to move forward with this program.\n  I appreciate the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, who worked out an agreement with the committee \nleadership that put the bill before the Senate today.\n  Senator Max Baucus of Montana introduced legislation with me last \nyear. He has now joined with me on some very constructive amendments \nwhich I hope can be accepted.\n  I am here today to stand with rural America. I am proud to be a son \nof rural America. I know that oftentimes the needs of this special part \nof our Nation must be heard on the Senate floor.\n  I am not trying to change the main thrust or the intent of this \ncommittee-reported bill. My amendments don't alter the structure of the \nbill. My amendments simply say that I want the board, which will have \nthe job of approving these loan guarantees for local-into-local \ntelevision, to look at one thing. If we are going to have loan \nguarantees for local-into-local television, we should give additional \nconsideration to the projects that can provide high-speed Internet \naccess and emergency Weather Service reports to rural America.\n  If rural America is going to have high-speed Internet access, it is \ngoing to have to rely on satellite service; cable companies are not \ngoing to put wire out for it. For most of those parts of the country, \nthey are not going to have the kind of fiber optics that might do it. \nBut they can do it with satellite service.\n  I hope we will not allow a digital divide between urban America and \nrural America. Give us the special access through the satellite system.\n  For example, say the board that is going to do the loan guarantees \nhas two equally balanced satellite systems that might give the same \nlevel of service, and at about the same cost, but one would offer high-\nspeed Internet access to rural families; I say give that one the loan \nguarantee.\n  In America, there is a growing disparity between the digital haves \nand have-nots as portions of our society get left behind at the same \nlightning pace at which Internet develops. Our amendment closes this \ndigital divide.\n  Having broadband, especially in rural areas, can provide \nopportunities to the handicapped, to the elderly, to education, and \neveryone, along with business opportunities and entertainment. Whether \nyou are sitting on the dirt road at my home in Middlesex, VT, whether \nyou are out in rural Utah, or whether you are in rural California, it \nmeans you can have the same kind of Internet business, the same kind of \naccess to information, and the same kind of access to educational \nopportunities.\n  My amendment would ensure that as long as the loan guarantee is to be \nmade, the high-speed Internet access ought to be financed under the \nloan guarantee program, if there is excess capacity.\n  All we say is, before the board gives a satellite company a loan \nguarantee to provide rural satellite service, ask, first and foremost, \nWill you provide high-speed Internet access for the people in rural \nAmerica? If you do, you have a better chance of being supported.\n  I want to provide a little history on this matter. A provision which \nwe offered to conferees last year would have provided up to $1.25 \nbillion in loan\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\nguarantees to help finance the delivery of local broadcast stations to \nrural America. I pushed for that amendment because certain satellite \ncompanies were concerned that they could not cost-efficiently provide \n``local-into-local'' satellite service to markets more rural than about \nthe top 60 to 70 markets. That meant that bigger cities would get the \nlocal broadcast television service but that rural areas, by and large, \nwould not.\n  Other Senators, not on the conference were also vitally interested in \nproviding this service to rural America. I know that Senator Burns and \nhis key staffer on this issue Mike Rawson worked long and hard to get \nthis language included in conference.\n  In addition, Senator Baucus introduced a bill which I cosponsored to \naddress these rural concerns after efforts to include it in the \nconference report failed.\n  I do not want to be misunderstood, I want to point out that the \nleaders of the satellite industry--such as Charlie Ergen of EchoStar \nwho is known for his creative and innovative ideas--want to provide \nthis local service.\n  I want to congratulate Charlie Ergen for his recent partnership with \niSKY which will offer consumers two-way wireless broadband access via \nsatellite along with satellite television service. This broadband \naccess will be 30 times faster than current dial-up speeds of 56k \naccording to news accounts. Charlie has often been a leader in this \narena and he has done it again.\n  I also want to point out that in Montana or my home state of Vermont, \nor in Alaska, or a Great Plains state, or elsewhere, receiving local \nbroadcast television over satellite is more than entertainment.\n  Local television provides local weather, local news about \nemergencies, and local public affairs programming. It is a way for \nresidents to better participate in government and to more effectively \ninfluence local government, school board or zoning decisions.\n  This bill that we are debating is indeed very important.\n  I need to emphasize a very important point. Section 336 of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 sets forth requirements for the rollout to \ndigital television. This bill in no way is intended to alter or change \nthose requirements.\n  Thus, it is imperative for the Board to only approve loans made to \nfinance a local television signal delivery system that will be forward \ncompatible and in compliance with the digital television rollout \nrequirements in the Communications Act.\n  It is thus common sense that applicants for loan guarantees under \nthis legislation must be able to show that the proposed signal delivery \nsystem will be forward compatible. Applicants should be required to \nshow how their proposed delivery system can be readily adapted to \ndeliver local television signals in a format compatible with the \ndigital rollout requirements. Without this, I do not see how the loans \ncould be other than risky.\n  This conversion to digital television also cannot be ignored. I have \nmet with Jim Goodmon, the CEO of Capitol Broadcasting, on this matter \nand appreciate his visionary role and his willingness to take the lead. \nDigital TV is more than just a crystal clear moving picture. Digital TV \ncan use multiple channels and datacasting on their single digital \nchannel to better serve the public. I have been advised that the same \ndigital bandwidth used to broadcast HDTV can also transmit as many as \nthree video channels and a data signal on the single digital channel.\n  Thus, during the recent floods that devastated North Carolina, WRAL-\nHDTV, a digital station in Raleigh, was able to simultaneously \nbroadcast on one digital channel: coverage of a basketball game; \ncontinuous local news on flood conditions; the continuous sweep of the \nlocal Doppler radar showing where the rainfall was the most severe and \nthe direction of the storm; and, a data broadcast alongside the video \nservices that enabled home computer access to specific flood, traffic, \nrainfall and emergency information. Jim Goodmon and his staff down in \nRaleigh did a great job during this crisis and I commend them.\n  Thus, I do not want loans under this bill to interfere with the \nrollout under the Communications Act. Rural America deserves digital \nservice along with urban America.\n  I want to raise an additional matter. I am concerned that additional \nsteps will be needed to assure full competition in rural areas and \nconvenience to consumers. In a nutshell, multiple providers of \nsatellite service may be needed in many areas to provide service to \nrural customers. However, if the set top boxes and satellite dishes are \nincompatible with these systems then competition will be reduced and \nconsumers will receive fewer services or have to purchase additional \nsatellite receivers at an additional cost of hundreds of dollars.\n  This same integration or interoperability problem exists regarding \nprogram and schedule information. Access to program and schedule \ninformation would enable third party satellite providers to create \nintegrated program guides. This would enhance consumer choices and \nprovide more competition.\n  Resolving these interoperability problems so that multiple satellite \nTV signals, offered by competitors, can be accessed by consumers in a \nconvenient and inexpensive way is in the public interest. The FCC \nshould use all its authority to resolve these matters.\n  In addition to the points I have just made, and the amendments I have \noffered, I want to point out improvements in the bill which I hope can \nbe addressed at conference. I believe that the three-person Board \nshould have more of an oversight and loan approval role and less of a \nday-by-day management role. The management of the program should be \nwith the Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service. For example, \nreferences to the Board on page 28 should be struck and the \nAdministrator and the Board should work out the regulations together.\n  Also, the Board should delegate responsibility for loan guarantees of \nup to $50 million to the Administrator.\n  It is also important, to assure that this bill is not biased toward \nthe cable industry, that spectrum rights be allowed to be purchased or \nleased with the guaranteed loans. If cable borrowers will be able to \npurchase cable and install that cable using the guaranteed loans then \nsatellite borrows should be able to use the loan proceeds for spectrum \nrights, which is their medium to deliver signals.\n  I also support the amendment offered by Senators Thomas and Johnson \nthat would allow the Federal Financing Bank and the National Rural \nUtilities Cooperative Finance Corporation to participate in these loan \nguarantee programs. They could offer borrowers a lower rate than \ncommercial banks and should not be excluded from this process.\n  In section 4(f) the full $1.25 billion in aggregate for all loans \nshould not be artificially limited by including other debt in the $1.25 \nbillion. In section 5(h) the Administrator, in consultation with the \nBoard, should establish and approve the credit risk premiums and \namounts.\n  To ensure that the Administrator can best protect the interests of \nthe United States the text on lines 3 through 10 of page 38 should be \nreplaced with the following: ``after exercising of rights and remedies \nby the Administrator any shortfall in the guarantee amount''. This \nwould allow the Administrator working with the Board to restructure a \nloan if that were the best way to protect the government's interest. I \nam very nervous about section 5.\n  The Administrator should have more responsibility to manage the \nprogram. Daily management by a 3-member board that does not meet daily \nwill not work very well. Also, section 5(l) appears to give state \ncourts jurisdiction over the United States.\n  I am also worried about that unless more flexibility is provided \nunder section 4(d)(2) and (3) that excellent loans for excellent \nprojects will be needlessly denied because of the timing of when \npaperwork is done, or when the FCC approves certain regulations, or \nwhen spectrum rights are obtained. Also, the unnecessarily constraining \ncollateral, security, insurance and lien requirements will make it very \ndifficult for the program to work well. These duplicative constraints \ndo not provide additional protection for the United States.\n  I will urge the conferees to provide a strong oversight role for the \nBoard, greater ability of the Administrator to manage the day-to-day \noperations, more flexibility for the Administrator, a more level \nplaying field with respect to cable TV, and other improvements.\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend my good friend and colleague \nfrom Vermont for his leadership on this issue, as well as Senator Gramm \nfrom Texas, and my colleague from Montana, Senator Burns, and others \nwho are addressing this issue. Frankly, there is a great need in rural \nAmerica. I compliment him and thank Senator Leahy for his work.\n  I am a cosponsor with Senator Leahy in his efforts not only to help \nbring faster local-to-local service via satellite to rural America but \nalso to help provide stimulus for more broad bandwidth coverage to \nrural America as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2900\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), for himself, Mr. \n     Leahy, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment numbered 2900.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, line 10, insert after ``local television \n     stations'' the following: ``, and related signals (including \n     high-speed Internet access and National Weather Service \n     broadcasts),''.\n       On page 30, strike line 9 and insert the following: ``means \n     by which local television broadcast signals, and related \n     signals (including high-speed Internet access and National \n     Weather Service broadcasts),''.\n       On page 33, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       (B) Additional considerations.--To the maximum extent \n     practicable, the Board should give additional consideration \n     to projects which also provide related signals (including \n     high-speed Internet access and National Weather Service \n     broadcasts).\n       On page 33, line 24, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(C)''.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside and that the previous amendment then pending be \nthe pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 2097, the \nLaunching of Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of 2000. I \ncommend the senior Senator from Texas, Chairman Gramm, for the great \nwork he has done to bring the bill to this point. The bipartisan effort \nhe has encouraged and the painstaking process by which he has produced \nthis bill is to be commended. He has done a tremendous job of watching \nit from the banking perspective to make sure we could have the loan \nguarantees and that there would be neither favoritism nor the potential \nof putting banks or other institutions in financial trouble. He spent a \ngreat deal of time and effort on it. I appreciate the willingness of \nall the members of the Banking Committee to work together to get this \nbill to this point.\n  As many of you will recall, last year during the appropriations \nprocess, this bill would have been a part of that, but there was a lot \nof concern about how loan guarantees should work, not just loan \nguarantees for satellite television but loan guarantees, and this is a \nlandmark effort to develop a pattern for banking loan guarantees.\n  Last November, Congress passed the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement \nAct to bring the law governing the direct broadcast satellite industry \nup to date and reflect the current state of technology. As part of that \nbill, Congress authorized, for the first time, satellite companies to \nretransmit local stations back into their local markets. However, due \nto satellite capacity, the two national direct broadcast satellite \ncompanies--DirecTV and Echostar--will only be able to serve the top 50 \nof 210 television markets. That is about 75 percent of the households \nin the Nation, but that leaves 160 markets, which is 25 percent of the \nNation--a very important part, as Wyoming is included in that--without \nsatellite-delivered local television stations. The two media markets in \nWyoming are ranked 197 and 199. Remember, we are serving the top 50 out \nof 210. So 197 and 199 are way down the list, meaning that without some \nsort of incentive, local television will probably not be available in \nWyoming.\n  The bill before us will provide that incentive. It establishes a \nFederal loan guarantee program to promote the delivery of local \ntelevision signals at places such as Wamsutter, WY. The bill provides \nthe criteria to protect the taxpayer to the maximum extent. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates this bill could cost American \ntaxpayers about $100 million less than previous versions. There is a \ncost involved, a potential cost.\n  The Banking Committee had to balance its need to protect the taxpayer \nand its need to provide a reasonable incentive to make investing in \nrural television service a worthwhile project for private risk capital. \nDuring the committee's deliberations on the bill, we looked at all the \nother existing government loan guarantees and examined what either made \nthe program successful or, in some cases, caused it to fail. We have \ntaken great care to ensure the loan program is fair and has the \ngreatest chance of achieving the goal of providing local television \nservice to rural America.\n  People rely on TV not just for entertainment but for news and weather \nand special warnings of impending disasters. Children rely on it for \neducational programming, and soon students will need improved access to \nthe information superhighway. The more rural a person is, the more that \nperson needs to have access to TV for critical information as well as \nfor entertainment. Almost 40 percent of Wyoming television households \nare satellite subscribers, the third highest penetration rate in the \nNation. People are not choosing satellite over cable or some other \nsystem but are satellite subscribers because it is the only way to \nreceive any sort of television programming.\n\n  Wyoming has television stations in only three cities: Casper, WY, \nabout 48,000 people; Cheyenne, 50,008; and Jackson, which fluctuates \nduring the season but I think is listed at about 6,500 people. The rest \nof the State is served by stations from out of State or by relay \ntransmitters that bring Wyoming stations to outlying towns.\n  Wyoming has vast open spaces. The borders on Wyoming are about 500 \nmiles on a side, with that big square out there. It gives us a little \ndifficulty with lapel pins because we are not recognizable.\n  We have low populations and lots of distances. We have high altitudes \nand low multitudes. We have tall mountains that make the best efforts \nby over-the-air broadcasters and cable companies even more difficult. \nFor households that are in remote areas of the State beyond the reach \nof cable and relay, satellite is the only reliable and cost-effective \nchoice.\n  But until now, satellite has had one distinct drawback. There was no \nway to get the news or other local programming through reliable access \nto a local Wyoming television station. It is doubtful that without some \nkind of Federal encouragement local television stations would be \navailable to rural households. This bill provides the proper incentive. \nIt gives equal opportunity throughout the United States. It is \nimportant to rural Americans, and I do urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to come back this afternoon--I\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\ntalked some this morning--to talk about this bill. It is a very \nimportant bill to us. It is one that provides an opportunity for us to \nhave local television in rural areas. There is great support for this \nidea. We are trying to find a way to put it into the proper perspective \nin terms of the lending of money to guarantee loans that will cause \nthis to happen--I agree with the chairman--where we have 80 percent of \na loan guaranteed by the Federal Government, but that the remaining 20 \npercent be done in the private sector without further guarantees by the \nFederal Government, by the taxpayers, so there is that sharing of risk \nand that incentive to continue to be very careful with these kinds of \nexpenditures. There is no question that this is a somewhat risky \noperation, something that is new and technically different.\n  The conversation we are having currently, of course, is to provide an \nopportunity for CFC, the Cooperative Finance Corporation, to be a \nparticipant. CFC was formed in 1969 by the Rural Electric Cooperatives \nand provides private capital. I have worked with it a great deal, \nhaving been manager of a rural electric association in Wyoming for a \nnumber of years.\n  CFC was not created by the Federal Government and does not receive \nFederal funds. This is a private corporation. CFC has 31 years of \nexperience in lending to rural electric systems, and since 1987 has \nprovided more than $3 billion to rural telecommunications projects.\n  Our Wyoming rural electrics, starting 15 years ago, were involved in \nbringing satellite TV to rural consumers and have been doing that from \na programming standpoint. Unfortunately, we could not get our local \nstations, and that is what this is all about. This is something the \nrural electrics have been involved in for some time.\n  CFC is AA rated. It has $16 billion in loan assets. Over 31 years, \nCFC has had only $77 million in losses and has loss reserves of $235 \nmillion.\n  This is a strong organization and one that is capable of doing this \nwork. Furthermore, it is owned and operated by citizens, by rural \npeople, by boards of directors of the rural electrics, by people who \nare elected to serve.\n  What we want is to give an equal opportunity for this unit to give \nloans and to participate as well as others.\n  CFC has backup lines of credit with 50 banks. These lines of credit \namount to about $5 billion. This is a large group. We have heard some \ninformation about the allegation that a loan loss by CFC will result in \nrate increases to 25 million consumers. I think that is very \nfarfetched. I do not believe it is accurate.\n  If CFC incurs a loss, CFC, as a private corporation, will incur the \nloss, with no liability to the Federal Government.\n  If CFC incurs a loss and its interest rates increase, rural utilities \nare free to borrow from other lenders, including banks and other \nfinance companies.\n  Co-ops are not responsible for repaying CFC losses or obligations. \nWhat we need to do, of course, is to ensure they are treated like \nothers in the private sector. But this idea that they somehow have a \nspecial advantage in that any losses can be passed on to rural electric \nconsumers in the electric business is not true. We have heard a great \ndeal about that.\n\n  The bottom line is, in the worst case scenario, CFC's rates could \nincrease and co-ops would then borrow from other entities.\n  CFC is a private cooperative. It is paternalistic to set up this \nprivate organization to have people governing under the rules of \nprivate sector and private enterprise and to suggest the Senate ought \nto design for them their rules. I reject that idea.\n  I am happy to say we are seeking to find some language that will \nsatisfy the need to move forward with this bill and also to provide an \nequal opportunity for CFC to participate without unwarranted \nsupervision. I am hopeful we can find that arrangement.\n  We ought to make that discipline work. I think we can, and I \ncertainly look forward to working with others this afternoon so we can \npass this bill and move toward rural communications and local-to-local \ncommunications.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Johnson amendment No. 2898.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, because an amendment is pending, rather \nthan ask it be set aside to offer another amendment, I will make a few \ncomments about something I intend to do. I am glad the distinguished \nchairman of the Banking Committee is here, so he has a chance to listen \nto some of the comments and maybe have a dialog on what I am attempting \nto do.\n  First, I congratulate the chairman of the Banking Committee and the \nSenator from South Dakota and all those on the Banking Committee who \nhave worked so hard to bring this legislation to the floor. It truly \naddresses a very important need for rural America, and that is the \nguarantee that people in rural America are not going to be treated as \nsecond-class citizens when it comes to their access to the information \nage.\n  This legislation addresses a problem of allowing companies that \nprovide satellite television and broadcast signals getting into rural \nparts of America and providing them the same type of quality \ninformation services that someone in the city of Washington, DC, or any \nof the large metropolitan areas of our country are already receiving \nbecause that is where the people happen to live.\n  The people in rural Texas or in rural South Dakota or the people in \nrural Louisiana are no less important than people in the large cities \nof America. Without this legislation, it is very clear that people in \nthese areas will not have access to this information because, in many \ncases, it is not economically feasible to spend large sums of money to \nprovide information to sparsely populated areas of our country. That is \nunfortunate, but that is recognizing the way things are.\n  The purpose of the legislation, as I understand it, is to lower the \noverall cost of bringing satellite and television broadcast to rural \nAmerica, something that has almost unanimous agreement and is in the \nnational interest. Without this legislation, people in rural areas \nwould simply not have the same advantages as we do in urban areas. \nClearly, this is very important.\n  One of my concerns, I say to the distinguished managers of the bill, \nis that when you look at what it costs to bring broadcast signals to \nrural America, it is not only a question of building satellites for \nrural areas and moving into these areas.\n  That represents about 45 percent of the cost of the actual satellite. \nBut getting the satellite, obviously, launched into space represents \nabout 37 percent of the total cost of bringing broadcast signals, \nthrough satellites, to any part of this country.\n  I think you have to agree that a significant cost associated with all \nof what we are trying to do today is actually launching the satellite \ninto space in order to bring the broadcast signals to all parts of the \nUnited States. Forty-five percent is the actual satellite cost; \ninsurance is 12 percent; the ground costs are another 6 percent. But a \nvery significant portion of the cost of bringing a satellite into \nworking condition is the cost of launching it. More than one-third, as \nI have said, of the cost of the satellite is expended when the actual \nsatellite is launched into space.\n  Clearly, it would further our goal of lowering the cost of bringing \nthese services to rural America if we could also lower the cost of \ntransportation, which is a very significant cost throughout our \ncountry.\n  Launch costs, obviously, are a very significant component of the \noverall satellite costs, but I think they can be reduced. That is why I \ntake the floor this afternoon to make a suggestion.\n  The authors of the legislation, again, who are to be commended for \ntheir vision, have clearly indicated that launch costs were on their \nmind when they crafted the bill.\n  I was looking at the legislation, and clearly the legislation, on \npage 30 of the actual bill that is pending before the Senate, talks \nabout the type of loans this bill envisions. It says:\n\n       . . . a loan may not be guaranteed under this Act unless--\n\n  It spells out what the ``unless'' is. But what it actually says is \nthat, in other words, it will be allowed if it does the following. In \nother words, a loan\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\ncan be guaranteed under the legislation pending before the Senate if:\n\n     the loan is made to finance the acquisition, improvement, \n     enhancement, construction, deployment, launch, or \n     rehabilitation of the means by which local television \n     broadcast signals will be delivered to an unserved area or \n     underserved area . . .\n\n  Therefore, the bill, as it is currently pending before the Senate, \ntalks about trying to make loans available to cover a number of things, \none of which specifically mentioned in the bill is the launch of \nsatellites designed to bring broadcast signals to rural parts of \nAmerica.\n  As I tried to point out initially, 37 percent of the whole cost of \nthis project is in the launching of the satellite. Obviously, without \nthe launching of the satellite into space, you, in fact, are not going \nto ever complete the rest of the project. I think it is very relevant, \nwhen the bill talks about a loan guarantee program, that the launch is \nlisted as one of the means by which broadcast signals are ultimately \nbrought to all parts of America.\n  I think, for that portion of the industry that launches the \nsatellites into space, the loan guarantee is very important. An \ninteresting thing that I would point out is, when you are in the launch \nsatellite business, when you are in the business of building a \nspaceship to, in fact, launch a vehicle, you have been competing \nagainst other countries where their governments do it. You are \ncompeting against industries that are totally financed by their \nrespective governments because it has been in their national interest \nto do so.\n\n  In the past, that is also what we have done in this country through \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration, where NASA has used \nthe shuttle to launch the satellites into space, and the taxpayer has \nbeen paying for the cost of those vehicles. But, clearly, NASA is \ngetting out of the business. We are trying to say to the private \nsector: We want you to move into this business. We want you to build \nthe launch vehicles. We want to create a new industry in the private \nsector, get the Government out of the business of launching broadcast \nsatellites, and let the private sector do it.\n  But one of the disadvantages our private sector has is that they are \ncompeting against other countries that are involved in doing this, and \nthey cannot compete on a level playing field. What we are suggesting is \nthat we help the U.S. industries become involved in this in a \ncompetitive fashion, which I think is very important.\n  U.S. companies that are having to compete against other countries are \nnot able to compete on a level playing field. Therefore, when the \ncountry of China or the country of France--highly subsidized by their \nGovernments--is trying to sell their launch vehicles to the United \nStates, obviously, they can do it at a price that makes our companies \nnot able to compete.\n  I think the authors of the bill are right on target. Some might say: \nThe Government should not be in the business of loan guarantees. It is \nnot a function of our Government. The exact opposite is true.\n  Historically, the U.S. Government has sought to assist the private \nsector by saying, we are going to help--we are not going to monopolize \nit; we are not going to do it, but we are going to help the private \nsector do it. One way we can help certain activities that are important \nto our country is by loan guarantee programs.\n  I point out, for the commercial shipbuilding industry--very important \nto my State and to the State of the Senator from Texas, as well as all \nthe States along the coast that have the shipbuilding industry--we have \nhad a title 11 shipbuilding guarantee program, in which companies have \nbeen able to go into the private market, borrow money from the private \nsector, from private banks, from private insurance companies, and \nhaving a certain portion of that loan guaranteed by the Federal \nGovernment. It allows them to get a better interest rate and allows \nthem to get financing for something that may not be able to be financed \notherwise.\n  Where we have tried it before, in the area of shipbuilding, it has \nworked very well. It has worked at a profit to the U.S. Government \nbecause the loans have been paid back. The Government has made money. \nThe work was done. The ships were built. The Loan Guarantee Program was \nan integral portion of it.\n  Currently, when you look at whether financial assistance is available \nin this area in the private sector, without any help from the \nGovernment, it is interesting to see what the comments are from those \nin the financial markets.\n  We have had hearings on this legislation before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. One of the companies that does the bulk of financing these \nlaunch vehicles is Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. When they testified \nbefore the Senate Commerce Committee, as the largest group of \ninvestment bankers in the country, they talked about the problem of \nbeing hampered by the inability to find the necessary private financing \nfor these types of ventures, particularly when they are, in fact, \ncompeting against other countries that are government-financed 100 \npercent.\n\n  They pointed out in their testimony that in some cases the cost of \nthe launch vehicles, and the insurance that goes with it, almost equals \nthe entire cost of the satellite itself. So if we want to help bring \nbroadcast signals to rural areas, we cannot just look at the satellite \nitself that needs to be constructed, you also need to look at the \nvehicles that would be built in order to launch those satellites into \nthe sky.\n  It was really interesting, colleagues, that last week we had the head \nof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, before our \ncommittee. Dan Goldin was testifying. I asked him a question about this \nconcept. He said the provision was very innovative. He said this \nprovision:\n\n       . . . would help small and big rocket companies to overcome \n     critical barriers so that we have technology that will allow \n     us to improve the reliability ten times and cut their cost by \n     a factor of ten. This will enable us to have private launch \n     services not involving the Government. This bill makes sense \n     to me.\n\n  This is the person who is the head of NASA saying that this idea of \nhaving a loan guarantee for the launch vehicles is something that makes \nsense to him, that it would allow us to increase the reliability by 10 \ntimes, and that it would allow us to decrease the cost by a factor of \n10, which is very significant.\n  Obviously, we should be looking for more reliable launch vehicles. We \nshould be looking at vehicles that cost a lot less. The Government \nshould not be in the business of building the launch vehicles, but we \ncan assist companies--small companies and large companies--by making it \neasier for them to get adequate private sector financing for these very \nimportant ventures. I have not offered an amendment, I say to the \ndistinguished Banking Committee chairman, because there is an amendment \npending at the current time, I did want to outline the concept of an \namendment I am prepared to offer, and will offer, as to the feasibility \nof saying that if you are going to have a loan guarantee program for \nthe actual satellite, there is a desperate need for a loan guarantee \nprogram for the vehicles that will be required in order to launch the \nsatellites.\n\n  We have in the past used foreign launch vehicles from France, China, \nand the Ukraine, using Ukraine launch vehicles because there is not an \nadequate supply of launch vehicles in this country. Those rockets and \nlaunch vehicles have been inadequate. They have been imperfect. They \nhave had failures and at a great expense to the satellite industry in \nthis country. How much better would it be if we were to have a viable, \ngrowing private industry in this country that were assisted by a loan \nguarantee program to enable them to get adequate financing in the \nprivate sector in order to launch the satellites for the purpose of \nbringing broadcast signals to rural areas as well as to urban areas in \nthe country.\n  Due to the fact that an amendment is pending, I will not be able to \noffer my amendment at this time. I yield the floor until such time as \nit is appropriate for me to offer an amendment. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Louisiana for \nraising the obvious point that one of the\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\ntechnologies that would be potentially subsidized under this bill is \nsatellite technology. If you are going to have a satellite, you have to \nput it into orbit. We have been for some time in the process of trying \nto commercialize space. There are companies now that are beginning to \nrespond to that potential with real investment and real potential.\n  The question the Senator from Louisiana asked was, Would not this be \na good time to address this additional problem? Personally, I believe \nthis is something that will have to be addressed and looked at. The big \ndifference is, on the loan guarantee proposal before us, we have had a \nseries of hearings. We have gone to great lengths to try to minimize \nthe potential exposure to the taxpayer. We have tried to call in \ntechnical expertise to be sure we understand what we are doing.\n  In terms of expanding this program now on the floor of the Senate to \nlaunch vehicles, I don't see how we could possibly get that job done. I \nthink this is, in terms of this bill, a bridge too far. I think it is \nsomething that will be looked at. I know, from having talked to them \npersonally, there are at least two private companies that are \ninterested in commercial launching to try to do in America what we are \ncontracting out to France and to China.\n  We have two problems in considering this today. One is that under \nunanimous consent, only relevant amendments are in order. This \namendment would be deemed to not be relevant, in my opinion.\n  Secondly, I could do my due diligence as chairman of the Banking \nCommittee to agree to an add-on loan guarantee on the floor of the \nSenate when we have not held a hearing, when we have not looked at it, \nwhen we know relatively little about the technology, the public/private \ncompetition, the economic feasibility of the project. We don't have any \nscoring from CBO as to what it would cost. It may very well be at some \npoint, someday, we will be in a position of looking at the proposal \nthat has been made by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. I don't \nbelieve we are at that point today.\n\n  Obviously, the Senator has a right to offer his amendment. I do not \nbelieve we should adopt his amendment today. I think we are already \ncarrying a pretty heavy load on this bill. In order for this to go \nforward as it is now written, the Appropriations Committee is going to \nhave to appropriate a quarter of a billion dollars. I believe we would \nhave a train that would be overloaded if we added this loan guarantee \nto it today.\n  I am not hostile to what the distinguished Senator from Louisiana is \ntrying to do. I simply do not know enough about it to make that \ndecision today on the floor.\n  Before I could get to the point of making a decision on it in the \nBanking Committee, we would have to meet with a lot of different \npeople, a lot of different competing technologies. We would have to \nmeet with NASA. We would have to analyze this in detail. We would have \nto do our due diligence. We would have to hold public hearings. We \nwould have to go through a markup in the Banking Committee to try to \nrefine it, as we have the bill that is now before us. We are just a \nlong way from that.\n  I am sorry I am not in a position of being able to support the \nSenator from Louisiana. As of today, I am not.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw amendment No. 2897. That will pull down my \namendment and pull down the Johnson amendment with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Bunning amendment, No. 2896.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nBunning amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe amendment be stacked after the first vote we have today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will address my remarks to some of the \npoints the Banking Committee chairman made, if he will give me his \nattention, regarding some of the concerns he raised in his comments \nabout the amendment I outlined but have not yet offered.\n  On the point the chairman raised, that we do not have a scoring on \nthe amendment, the scoring is very simple. It is $250 million. That is \nwhat is authorized. We don't authorize a nickel more or a nickel less. \nIt is not difficult to figure out the scoring and the cost of an \namendment that authorizes $250 million. It is $250 million, if that \namount is in fact appropriated.\n  He also said we needed to have hearings on this amendment. The \nCongress has had hearings on the amendment. We had hearings in the \nSenate Commerce Committee. We had people from industry testify. We had \nlarge and small companies testify. We had the head of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration testify. We had a sufficient \nnumber of people testifying about the pros and cons.\n  He raised the point that we should hear from NASA as to their \nopinion. I provided the opinion of NASA when I quoted from the \nstatement of the distinguished Administrator of NASA, Dan Goldin, in \nwhich he said this amendment could conceivably increase launch vehicle \nreliability by 10 times and decrease the cost by a factor of 10.\n  So there could not be a clearer statement. He concluded by saying: \n``This bill makes sense to me.'' You can't get a clearer statement from \nNASA as to what they think about the amendment. There could not be a \nclearer statement about the cost of the amendment other than the fact \nthat we authorize $250 million, not a nickel more, not a dime less but \n$250 million.\n  So it is very clear. One, we know what the costs are; two, we have in \nfact had hearings in the Senate on this question; three, we have heard \nfrom industry, both large companies and small companies; and finally, \nwe have heard from NASA, which said that it makes a great deal of sense \nto them, including the fact of reducing the cost of launching vehicles \nby a factor of 10. I don't know who else we can possibly ask to come \nbefore the Congress and address this question.\n  The final point--and I will not prejudge the ruling of the Chair--is \non the question of the relevancy. It is clear that the bill before the \nSenate right now covers the cost of launching satellites to bring \nbroadcast signals to rural America. It is in the bill. The bill clearly \nsays that the loan guarantees are for the acquisition, improvement, \nenhancement, construction, deployment, and launch of satellites--the \nmeans by which local television broadcast signals will be delivered. \nWell, launching a satellite is absolutely essential and totally \nrelevant to putting satellite broadcast signals into rural America. It \ncould not possibly even be more relevant to the bill before the Senate. \nThe bill itself talks about launching satellites.\n  My amendment provides a loan guarantee to launch satellites. If that \nis not relevant, I am not sure what would ever be relevant. We are not \ntalking about germaneness. We are talking about relevant to the bill \nbefore the Senate, and this is a loan guarantee for launching \nsatellites to bring broadcast signals to rural areas. My amendment \ncreates a loan guarantee program to launch satellites to bring \nbroadcast signals to rural America. It does it through a different \ndepartment, but obviously it has to be relevant. You don't have to have \nexactly the same language in an amendment as the bill for it to be \nrelevant. It has to be relevant to what the bill does that is pending \nbefore the Senate. I think the question of relevancy is very clear.\n\n  The fact that we have had hearings in this Congress on this specific \namendment, and the fact that we have had\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\nNASA testify in favor of this amendment and say it would reduce the \ncost by 10 times, reduce the liability by a factor of 10, and the fact \nthat we have had industry, both small and large companies, appear \nbefore Congress and testify as to their opinions on this means that we \nhave had hearings, we have the support, and it is certainly relevant, \nand I think it is the right public policy.\n  While I can't offer the amendment at this time because another one is \npending, we will do it at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, what is the current business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Kentucky, \nNo. 2896.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The yeas and nays have not been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have been ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Is it in order to ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside that amendment in order to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, people yell at me so much, \nI don't hear so good. Will the Senator repeat that?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am asking to set aside the pending amendment to offer \nmy amendment. Is that appropriate?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order to make that request.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside in order to offer my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2901\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Breaux) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2901.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Section 4(d)(2)(a) of S. 2097 is amended by striking the \n     word ``launch,''.\n       S. 2097 is amended by inserting the following Section 5A:\n\n     ``SEC. 5A. APPROVAL AND ADMINISTRATION OF LOAN GUARANTEES \n                   RELATING TO LAUNCH VEHICLES.\n\n       ``(a) Authority To Approve Loan Guarantees Relating to \n     Launch Vehicles.--To further the purposes of this Act \n     including to reduce costs necessary to facilitate access to \n     local television broadcast signals in unserved and \n     underserved areas, without unnecessarily creating a new \n     administrative apparatus, the Secretary of Transportation is \n     authorized, subject to the provisions of this Section, to \n     approve loan guarantees relating to space launch vehicles. \n     For this purpose, the credit assistance program established \n     in Section 1503 of Chapter 1 of Subtitle E of the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. No. \n     105-178, is expanded to include projects for the design, \n     development, and construction of space transportation systems \n     and infrastructure, including launch and reentry vehicles \n     subject to the licensing requirements of Section 70104 of \n     Title 49, United States Code.\n       ``(b) Funding.--To fund the cost to the Government of loan \n     guarantees provided under this Section for space \n     transportation systems and infrastructure projects, there is \n     authorized to be appropriated $250 million for Fiscal Year \n     2001, and such other sums as may be necessary for each of \n     Fiscal Years 2002 through 2005. From funds made available \n     under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation, for \n     the administration of the program, may use not more than $2 \n     million for each of Fiscal Years 2001 through 2005. For each \n     of Fiscal Years 2001 through 2005, principal amount of \n     Federal credit instruments made available for space \n     transportation systems and infrastructure projects shall be \n     limited to the same amounts set forth in Section 1503 of \n     Chapter 1 of Subtitle E of the Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century, Pub. L. No. 105-178.\n       ``(c) Regulatory Authority.--To carry out the provisions of \n     this Section, the Secretary shall, within 120 days after \n     enactment of this Act, adopt such regulations as he \n     reasonably deems necessary. Such regulations shall not be \n     inconsistent with the provisions of Section 5 of S. 2097, the \n     ``Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act \n     of 2000.''\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I made remarks earlier about the intent to \noffer this amendment. I will not repeat the arguments in favor of it. I \nwill only summarize by saying the Senate Commerce Committee had a \ncomplete and full hearing. The distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee is on the floor today. We had the privilege of hearing \nNASA Administrator Dan Goldin testify on this amendment, saying it \nwould save as much as 10 times the cost of a launch vehicle and improve \nthe reliability of those by a factor of 10. We are hearing from big \nlaunch companies and also small launch companies that are interested in \nthis industry, and trying to improve it.\n\n  We had testimony from people in the finance business who speak to the \ndifficulty of getting adequate financing in the private sector because \nof the questionable nature of the launch vehicle industry and \ntestifying to the fact that a loan guarantee program would be very \nhelpful.\n  The final point is that when you talk about bringing satellite \nbroadcast signals to rural America, you cannot just talk about the \n``big ball'' that, in fact, is the satellite. You also have to talk \nabout how you get the satellite into orbit around the country. Thirty-\nseven percent of the cost of bringing that broadcast signal to rural \nAmerica involves the cost of the launch vehicle.\n  Currently, the United States relies on China, France, Ukraine, and \nother countries that are not market-based countries but, rather, are \ncountries in which their industry is financed 100 percent by the \ngovernment. Our companies cannot compete unless we have a level playing \nfield.\n  Therefore, the concept of providing a loan guarantee program of a \ndefinitive amount of money we know will cost $250 million. That is the \nmoney authorized. It would have to go through the Appropriations \nCommittee to get the appropriations, but it could not be any more than \n$250 million to create a loan guarantee where they could go to the \nprivate sector and get a loan from the banks. Having a percentage of it \nguaranteed by the Federal Government is good, sound economic policy. It \nis good broadcast industry policy. It is a policy this country should \nembrace. In areas where we have done it before, as in shipbuilding, it \nhas worked very successfully.\n  I suggest this amendment is very relevant because the bill itself is \nclear that the Loan Guarantee Program ``is for the acquisition, \nimprovement, enhancement, construction, deployment and launch''--\nemphasizing launch--``rehabilitation or the means from which local TV \nbroadcast signals will be delivered to an unserved area or underserved \narea.''\n  It is clearly relevant, and both amendments are an effort to try to \nhelp through loan programs the delivering of broadcast signals to rural \nAmerica.\n  This is not a germaneness question. It is a relevancy question. If \nthis is not relevant, I don't know what would be relevant on an \namendment on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as I said before, I have some sympathy for \nthe Senator from Louisiana. I think this is obviously a very real issue \nto be considered. But the bottom line is we are on the floor with a \nbill that has been a year in the making having to do with our goal of \ntrying to see that everybody who lives in rural Texas or rural America \nhas access to their local news and local weather and to the local \ntelevision station.\n  You could write volumes about what we don't know about this subject, \neven though we have worked on it for a year, even though we have had \nextensive hearings, even though we have had innumerable private \nmeetings, and even though we have gone through a markup in committee \nwhere we have\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\ndebated it at some length and reached some consensus on it--not total \nconsensus.\n  The problem with the Breaux amendment is that this is an area, while \nit is obviously of importance in terms of one potential technology that \nmight be used in the bill--and that is a satellite--we in our bill are \nnot setting out technology as such. We are letting the marketplace \ndecide that. The point is we have had no hearings. We have heard from \nno one. We have not discussed, analyzed, or studied this in any detail. \nWe are not ready to make a decision on this today.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement entered into on November 18, no \namendment is in order which is not deemed to be relevant--not relevant \nto mankind, not relevant to any problem facing us in the future, or any \nopportunity but relevant specifically to the bill that is pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  I make a point of order that the amendment offered by Senator Breaux \nis not relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is \nnot relevant and the point of order is sustained.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take it that the Chair is not in the \nposition to give a reason behind the ruling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The program in the amendment is not what was \nenvisioned by the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I inquire of the Chair: Is that not an argument for the \nquestion of germaneness as opposed to the question of relevancy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Germaneness is a different test which is not \nat issue here.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Further parliamentary inquiry: Is not the statement of \nthe Chair relevant to a question on germaneness as opposed to a \nquestion of relevancy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The statement of the Chair was with regard to \nthe relevancy standard.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will not pursue it. Obviously, I accept the ruling of \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1956-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1956-S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, back in February of 1993, as we all \nremember so vividly, the World Trade Center in New York City was \nbombed. Over 1,000 people were wounded and 6 people were killed. Two \nyears later, the Federal building in Oklahoma was bombed; 168 people \ndied, including many children.\n  These two very tragic events highlight the potential threat this \ncountry is subjected to and, in fact, has been subjected to in the area \nof terrorism. The threat of terrorism was further reinforced with the \nevents in Africa where two of our embassies were bombed 3 years ago.\n  The Commerce, State, Justice, Appropriations Subcommittee, which I \nchair, directed the Attorney General to develop a plan to address \nterrorism which would be a Governmentwide plan, an interagency \ncounterterrorism plan. The Attorney General, in a very conscientious \neffort, put together a 5-year interagency counterterrorism and \ntechnology crime plan. It was an excellent proposal. This proposal was \nput together by the Attorney General 3 years ago. It basically became \nknown as the bible--for lack of a better or more descriptive word--as \nto how we should proceed in the area of developing a Governmentwide \nstrategy in order to address terrorism, something we hadn't done up \nuntil that point.\n  It wasn't just to focus on Federal Government agencies but, rather, \nit went beyond that and talked about how we needed to integrate the \nprivate sector and State and local governments in our efforts to \naddress terrorism. It had a large number of functions within it, a \nlarge number of areas that had to be addressed, as was obvious to those \nof us who took even a cursory look at the issue of terrorism.\n  Unfortunately, we, as a culture, were not ready to address terrorist \nacts because we are an open culture. The essence of our culture is \nfreedom, the ability of people to move freely among our society. It is \nvery difficult for us to deal with people who are willing to kill \nindiscriminately simply to make their points of view known. It requires \na lot of thought and effort for us as a nation to address a problem \nsuch as terrorism. That is why we asked for this 5-year plan to be \ndeveloped.\n  As part of this 5-year plan, one of the key things we believed we \nneeded to address was the fact that there really wasn't anyplace where \nall of the issues of terrorism were being brought together. There were \nsomething like 43 different agencies addressing some element of the \nterrorist threat. This was not counting the issues of State and local \ngovernment involvement and the issue of the private sector. For \ninstance, how would the private sector address a terrorist threat to \nour power grid and our telecommunications systems.\n  One of the first things deemed necessary to do was to develop a \ncentralized place where people could go, whether they happened to be in \nthe Federal Government, State and local government, or whether they \nhappened to be in the private sector, a centralized place where people \ncould go and find out how to approach the issue of preparing our Nation \nto be able to handle the terrorist threat. An office was designated to \nbe created called the National Domestic Preparedness Office, or the \nNDPO.\n  The NDPO was essentially to be a one-stop shopping center on the \nissue of how we address the threat of terrorism as a nation, a very \nimportant activity. It was to include participation by DOD, the \nDepartment of Defense, by FEMA, by HHS, Health and Human Services, by \nthe Department of Energy, by the Environmental Protection Agency, by \nthe Attorney General, and by the FBI. State and local authorities were \nto be included for participation in this office. It was to be a central \nagency which had all the players needed to be at the table--up and \nfunctioning and continually available as a resource to address the \nthreat of terrorism.\n  Unfortunately, this administration has treated the issue of terrorism \nas a stepchild. When there is a terrorist event, they react. In some \ninstances, they react arbitrarily and ineffectively, as they did in \nreaction to the African situation where they essentially ended up \ntargeting a facility in Sudan. It is still very much an issue, as to \nwhether the facility was actually producing any chemical weapons. Also, \nthey attacked a facility in Afghanistan. Rather than assisting our \nability of tracking down the terrorist Bin Laden, it made it obvious to \nhim that he could never again have a joint meeting of his terrorist \nforces. Thus, he scattered them to the wind and we have had much more \ntrouble tracking them down.\n\n  The response of this administration has been a PR response, to be \nquite honest, on the issue of terrorism at many levels. When it comes \nto actually substantively addressing the issue of terrorism, this \nadministration's response from the top has been woeful.\n  I will acknowledge, in fact I will cite and congratulate, that at the \nagency level there is an ongoing, aggressive, and very positive effort \nto address terrorism. But, for some reason, there is an unwillingness \nin the White House to genuinely focus on this issue in a way that \nproduces results.\n  One of the most glaring examples of that unwillingness to focus is \nthe fact that the NDPO--the office which was supposed to be the one-\nstop shopping center for people who wanted to get ready to address a \nterrorist event--hasn't really been allowed to wither on the vine \nbecause they never even planted the seeds to get the vine growing. The \noffice has not been funded. In fact, the travel funds which were \nsupposed to be applied to it have been cut off. The office has been \nunable to get reprogramming through OMB, even though the Attorney \nGeneral has requested on a number of occasions to get reprogramming \nthrough OMB to allow the office to function effectively.\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\n  The FBI Director has not been able to get reprogramming through OMB \nthat has allowed the office to function effectively. The State and \nlocal advisory groups which were supposed to be set up to bring the \nfirst responders--the local police, local fire, local health officials \nwho have the knowledge and the expertise to do the job right and do it \nin a coordinated way with the Federal Government--in to advise the NDPO \nhas not been energized in any effective way. We do not get the \nstandardization on equipment we need. We are not getting the leadership \nfrom the top that we need in the area of making the States and local \npeople as knowledgeable as we can.\n  I will say this: At least in the other areas where we are trying to \neducate first responders, such as our initiatives across this country \nin education, we are making progress. But the central management agency \nhas been ignored.\n  We understand the reprogramming that the NDPO needs in order to fund \nits activities effectively for this year will not be adequately \nfulfilled. So this agency has been allowed to simply sit there and has \nnot been energized. In fact, as I understand it, the person named \ndirector of the NDPO has recently, within the last week, asked to be \ntransferred out of the job. I do not know why he asked for that, but I \ncertainly can guess. I suspect it is because of the frustration of \ndoing a job where he was not getting the support he needed from the \nWhite House and from this administration to do it effectively.\n  Terrorism is not a political event. It should not be used for the \npurpose of initiating press conferences or trying to drive poll \nnumbers. This is an extraordinarily serious issue. We as a nation need \nto have a Government that doesn't approach this issue in a manner which \ninvolves something less than a total commitment. Yet that is the way it \nis being approached by this administration and its failure to fund, \norganize, and energize the National Domestic Preparedness Office.\n  This same problem was highlighted in a news story in the Wall Street \nJournal relative to another issue of terrorism. It was again requested \nby the subcommittee I Chair in this Congress that there be exercises--\nmuch like our military undertakes--to determine our readiness to deal \nwith a terrorist event. During the cold war days, if you were in the \nStrategic Air Command, every 6 months you knew, if you were on a \nStrategic Air Command air base, at some point during that 6 months you \nwere going to have a full-scale alert, and you were going to have to \nact as if you were in a confrontation with the Soviet Union.\n  That was the way we kept our forces current and that is how we found \nout the problems in our systems. It is the way it is still done in the \nmilitary. You have what amounts to war games in order to determine \nwhether or not you are ready to participate in a real, live event. \nWell, terrorism is war. It is war on our Nation, and we know there are \npeople out there who intend to exercise their ability to wage war on \nAmerica. They have already done it. We need to go through the exercises \nof determining whether or not the agencies that are going to be \nresponsible to protect the American people are ready to respond in the \ncase of a terrorist event.\n  So we asked the administration, to pursue exercises to determine \nwhether or not we are ready--mock exercises. These were to take place \nin three different communities across our country. Now, in a recent \nreport in the Wall Street Journal, it was stated that some of the top \nagencies that are involved in this exercise are basically taking a \nlaissez-fair attitude toward the exercise and are basically saying that \nthey may participate but participate at a very low level of operations, \nor they are going to participate with very low level personnel--not \nthat they won't be good personnel, but they won't be the personnel who \nhave the final responsibility in the event of a real terrorist event or \nattack on our country. That would be unfortunate.\n  The Attorney General, I understand, not directly but indirectly, \nbelieves she is getting commitments from the various agencies to \nfulfill their role of having senior personnel at DOD, DOE, HHS, EPA, \nFEMA, and State, and obviously the Attorney General and the FBI--senior \npersonnel--involved in these exercises, so that we know when we have a \nproblem, the people who can resolve them are physically there on site \nand can observe the problem and can participate in resolving and \ndeveloping a response to the problem.\n  Now, the Attorney General tells me, indirectly through my staff, that \nthe news story may not have been completely accurate. But the news \nstory quoted some sources and said certain agencies within the \nadministration were not going to be seriously committed to this \nexercise. That, again, in my opinion, shows the laissez-fair attitude \nthis administration has taken toward preparing this Nation to address a \nterrorist event.\n  As I said earlier, terrorism is not a partisan issue, not a political \nissue; it is a serious threat to our country. It has to be addressed \naggressively and professionally by the agencies that are responsible. \nThe Congress can only do so much. We have funded aggressively \nantiterrorism efforts. We have set up structures, working with the \nagencies to try to make sure that we have a coordinated response. We \nhave requested that the agencies involved participate in trying to make \nsure that they are as ready as possible for a horrific event. But all \nwe can do is fund and request. If we don't get cooperation and \nenthusiasm and commitment from this administration, then we will not \nhave success.\n  So I have come to the floor today to highlight what I am very \nconcerned about and what I think we should all be concerned about, \nwhich is whether or not there is a sincerity of effort occurring within \nthis administration to get us ready to address a potential terrorism \nthreat to the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto advise my colleagues why I think it is appropriate that we address \nsome relief for the American consumer with regard to the gasoline price \nspike that has occurred in this country. I am a cosponsor, with the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, and a number of others, of this \nimportant legislation that will give us an opportunity to take positive \naction in a meaningful way to put a brake on the ever-rising gasoline \nprices that American families face each day.\n  The American people should have a choice, whether they feel the \npriority is such that they should have relief from the gasoline tax. I \nemphasize a choice. I emphasize the American people, through their \nelected representatives on this floor, have to make a determination \nthat this is a priority because there is no free lunch around here. \nWhat we are talking about is a combined bill which would waive the \nFederal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents. That is a considerable tax. It is \neven larger when you add the State taxes to it.\n  When I said there is no free ride around here, what I meant was we \nhave agreed if we suspend the Federal gas tax for the balance of this \nyear, we will also make whole the highway trust fund. That alternative \nwill require that we find considerable funds. But if we guarantee we \nare going to find them, that means they are going to come through the \nbudget process, from surplus and other areas.\n  Is this a sufficient priority? There are those who feel very strongly \nthis jeopardizes the highway trust fund. In this bill itself, it says \nwe will hold the highway trust fund harmless. That is a mandate, in \neffect a promise, to hold it harmless. It does not say where the money \nis going to come from to offset it.\n  We are suspending it only for the balance of this year. I have been \nadvised by the budgeteers that this will not jeopardize any of the \ncontracts that are presently let for this construction year or next \nyear that propose to use highway trust fund moneys because those have \nalready, in effect, been designated, earmarked, and so forth. I am not \non the Budget Committee, but that is the advice I have been given.\n  I think Members should understand a little background here. It was in \n1993 that the Clinton administration proposed a significant tax on \nBtus. There was going to be a big tax increase on all Btus--British \nthermal units. It was going to be based on what you use. We debated \nthis issue at length and we voted down the increased Btu tax that the \nClinton administration proposed. However, there was a 4.3-cent-a-gallon \ngas tax that was also proposed at that time. It was hotly debated. That \n4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax was not designated for the highway trust \nfund. It was designated for the general fund. That is just where it \nwent.\n  Of interest to the Chair, perhaps, is how this happened. All the \nRepublicans voted against the tax; six Democrats joined us, and we had \na tie vote. Vice President Al Gore sat in the Chair as the Presiding \nOfficer of this body, where the Senator from Utah sits, and he broke \nthe tie. The Vice President has to wear the mantle. That is where the \n4.3-cent-a-gallon tax came from. He has to wear the mantle. It did \ndesignate the tax would go into the general fund. Later, when the \nRepublicans took control of this body, we changed the designation from \nthe general fund and we designated that 4.3 cents into the highway \ntrust fund.\n  It should again be noted what this legislation specifically provides \nbecause there is a lot of confusion over it. It says in order for the \n18.4 cents to be suspended, and this is regular gasoline, the price has \nto average $2 a gallon. Only then will it be suspended, and only for \nthe balance of this year. And the highway trust fund will be made \nwhole.\n  I know there are Members who feel uncomfortable about the highway \ntrust fund. But all I can do is make very clear what this bill \nprovides. It provides for full reimbursement of the highway trust fund. \nBut it is not a free ride. The money is going to have to come from \nsomeplace else.\n\n  The point I want to make, and the appeal to my colleagues and our \nstaffs who are listening, is about the real savings. America's \nconsumers cannot pass on this price increase. If you buy an airline \nticket, as my friend from Utah and I do occasionally, to go back to \nUtah or Alaska, you are paying a surcharge for fuel. You don't know \nwhat the tax is on the ticket because the airlines have so many \nconfusing fares you can't figure it out, but a $40 surcharge is in \nthere.\n  The trucker who comes to Washington, DC, who has a contract for \ndelivery, maybe he cannot pass it on; and the farmer, it is very \nunlikely he is going to pass it on; nor the fishermen in my State who \nfuel up their vessels, it is pretty hard for them to pass it on--but \nthe person who surely cannot pass it on is the American consumer, the \nmoms driving their kids to the soccer game. The family bought a utility \nsports vehicle for convenience. Maybe the SUV does not get too many \nmiles to the gallon. It might have a 40-gallon gas tank. When mom goes \nto the gas station and fills that up at nearly $2 a gallon, it shoots a \npretty good hole in a $100 bill.\n\n  The question before us is: Do we want to do something short term, or \ndo nothing, which is what the administration proposes. My colleagues \nheard the President yesterday. He said we have to develop more \ndependence on alternative fuels, we have to develop more resources \ndomestically. He does not tell you he is going to open up low-sulfur, \nhigh-Btu coal in Utah. No, he says he has made that wilderness, for all \npractical purposes.\n  He does not say he is going to encourage exploration on public lands \nin the Rocky Mountains so that oil and gas exploration can occur in \nthose States in the overthrust area where there is a tremendous \npotential for oil and gas in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, \nKansas, or Oklahoma, where the small strippers have almost gone out of \nproduction because they simply cannot produce at the low prices. They \nonly produce a few barrels a day. My colleague, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison, addressed that earlier today.\n  In our long-term package of proposals, there is relief for the \nstripper wells. There is relief to encourage exploration in the \noverthrust Rocky Mountain area. There is relief to provide OCS areas \nfor lease--we heard the Vice President say: If I am elected President, \nI am going to cancel all the OCS lease programs. He does not say where \nhe is going to get the oil to replace that produced under the leases.\n  Think about what this administration's policy is on energy. One does \nnot have to think very long because there is none. Clearly, our \nSecretary was sent over to OPEC almost on his knees to beg for \nproduction increases. OPEC said they were going to have a meeting on \nthe 27th. He was over there 3 weeks prior to that. The Secretary said: \nWe have an emergency in the United States. They said: We are going to \nmeet on the 27th. They met on the 27th. They did not do anything until \nthe 28th.\n  I have a chart which shows what they really did. They did this \nyesterday. Not many people are aware of the realities associated with \nwhat has happened to oil and the demand for oil in this country.\n  To the left of the chart in the red is the total global demand for \noil in the world today. It is about 76.3 million barrels per day. To \nthe right of the chart is the production and where it comes from: 45 \npercent from non-OPEC, 23 percent from OPEC, 5.6 percent other OPEC.\n  My point is, actual production is 75.3 million per day, but the \ndemand is 76.3 million per day. There is a 1 million-barrel-a-day \ndifference. There is a greater demand than supply. When there is this \nkind of situation, we have price spirals.\n  I want to point out and make sure everybody understands what happened\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\nyesterday with OPEC. I am really amazed, with the exception of the Wall \nStreet Journal and a few other folks, the media has not really delved \ninto this. When OPEC met last year, they decided they were going to \nproduce 23 million barrels a day. They promptly began to cheat. They \noverproduced. They produced 24.2 million barrels a day. The difference \nbetween what they said they were producing, 23 million barrels a day, \nand what they were actually producing, 24.2 million barrels a day, is \n1.2 million barrels a day. The difference between the 1.2 million \nbarrels and 1.7 million is 500,000 barrels a day. That is what they are \nactually producing.\n  Here it is. They were cheating 1.2 million barrels a day. As I said \nbefore, they started out with 23 million but were actually producing \n24.2. The difference between 1.2 and 1.7 is 500,000 barrels a day, and \nthat is exactly what we got. That is the actual new production. It is \nnot 1.7 million barrels a day, it is 500,000 barrels a day.\n\n  Let me take it one step further because this really excites me, and \nthat is, what our share of OPEC oil has been. Our share has been about \n16 percent. If we got another 500,000 barrels increase--remember, this \ndoes not go just to the United States, this goes to all the customers \nof OPEC all over the world. The U.S. share is about 16 percent. So that \namounts to about 79,000 barrels a day.\n  With the help of some of my staff and the AAA, we determined the \nimmediate metropolitan area of Washington, DC, uses 121,000 barrels a \nday. This means that with the 500,000 new barrels, we are not even \nstanding still.\n  I do not want to put too much of an arithmetic load on my colleagues, \nbut there is one more figure they ought to know about, and that is the \nlittle secret of the administration and the Department of Energy they \ndid not want you to hear. They did not want you to find out what was \nwritten between the lines of the OPEC agreement. Here it is. Buried in \nthe agreement is what they call a ``price band'' provision to keep the \nprices between $22 and $28 a barrel. We have seen prices for oil go up \nto $34. A year ago, that price per barrel was at $10 and $11.\n  This is a unique arrangement, but our friends in OPEC are unique in \ntheir craftsmanship of what is in their best interests. The arrangement \ncalls for producers to increase output 500,000 barrels--remember where \nyou heard it. That is the 500,000 that is the actual increase. They \nsaid:\n\n       The arrangement calls for producers to increase output \n     500,000 barrels per day on a pro rata basis if oil prices \n     remain above $28 for 20 consecutive days.\n\n  My friend, I am a businessman. I understand the fine print of an \nagreement, but I do not think the folks down at the White House do or, \nif they do, they do not want you to know about it. This agreement \nfurther states that OPEC will also cut from production--there it is, \ncut from production, cut from their 1.7 million-barrel promise, or \nreally the 500,000 barrels a day. They will cut from production by that \nsame amount if prices fall below $22 for more than 20 days. They have \nset a ceiling, and they have set, obviously, a cellar.\n  OPEC or the Clinton administration has made no acknowledgment of this \nin their announcements. Isn't that rather curious? We talk about \nsignificant relief. If we have this kind of a deal, I do not know from \nwhere the significant relief is going to come. Under this agreement, \none can easily see that the price of oil is going to hover around $28, \nmaybe as high as $34 per barrel for extended periods or until OPEC \nmeets again.\n  I urge those in the media and my colleagues, and particularly their \nstaffs who are a little bit curious, to read today's Oil Daily, page 2. \nIt is all spelled out under the headline ``OPEC Bases New Production \nStrategy on Price Band Experiment.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Oil Daily, Mar. 30, 2000]\n\n      OPEC Bases New Production Strategy on Price Band Experiment\n\n                   (By Toby Odone and Barbara Shook)\n\n       Buried in the furor over Iran's refusal to go along with \n     other Opec members in raising oil production is a highly \n     innovative price band mechanism, designed to keep prices \n     within a range of $22 to $28 per barrel for the Opec basket.\n       The arrangement calls for producers to increase output by \n     500,000 barrels per day on a pro-rata basis if oil prices \n     remain above $28 for 20 consecutive days. They also will cut \n     production by the same amount if prices fall below $22 for 20 \n     consecutive days.\n       Opec delegates were hailing the new accord as a \n     breakthrough that for the first time guarantees minimum \n     national revenues, making budget-setting and fiscal planning \n     less hazardous. In addition, it potentially provides the \n     market with the stability that producers and consumers, \n     primarily from the U.S., have been calling for loudly in the \n     past few months.\n       Nevertheless, should the nine countries that have adopted \n     the new policy adhere to its terms, the upper limit of the \n     new arrangement could see the price for West Texas \n     Intermediate (WTI) rise above $30. On several occasions, the \n     U.S. has said this level is too high, just as last year's $10 \n     was too low.\n       Even Iran, which is not party to the new quota accord, says \n     it would go along at least with the concept of the price band \n     mechanism. Its production level would be the same volume as \n     the base for the now rolled-back March 1999 agreement. \n     Adjustments, however, would be made as Iran reads the market, \n     not according to the Opec formula.\n       Opec made no mention of the new price-band mechanism in the \n     official communique issued early Wednesday after a marathon \n     six-hour negotiating session.\n       Word of its proposal was beginning to leak out, however, \n     even before the session ended, as delegation sources told \n     EIG's Energy Intelligence Briefing (EIB) that some \n     ``innovative and flexible'' new terms were under discussion. \n     Several ministers also referred obliquely to a price range \n     rather than a specific target such as the $21 that has been \n     on the Opec books since 1990. Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi \n     talked openly of a $20 to $25 price range.\n       The official communique also made no mention of the future \n     roles of non-Opec exporters Mexico, Norway, Oman, Angola, and \n     Russia. Opec simply thanked them for their assistance in \n     earlier efforts to stabilize markets.\n       On Wednesday, delegates told EIB that the non-Opec \n     countries appear to be released from their commitments to \n     shut in output.\n       Outside of the Opec Secretariat, Iran continued to express \n     its irritation with U.S. intervention in the organization's \n     proceedings.\n       ``Intervention was beyond expectation,'' an Iranian \n     delegate stated. None of the US's action was needed because \n     Opec and its allied nonmember exporters were aware of the \n     market and prepared to respond to increasing demand, he said.\n       ``We were here to accommodate the market. We came here to \n     increase production,'' he said, adding that he believes the \n     US has damaged its image by its interference with and \n     imposition of its position on a group of sovereign nations.\n       He also suggested that US actions both now and last year \n     put Opec in a bad light. ``We were discredited,'' he said. \n     ``When we cut the production we were blamed. When we \n     increased the production we were blamed.''\n       The Iranian delegate refused to criticize ministers of \n     other countries directly, but he did indicate strong \n     displeasure with what he said was a prearranged agreement \n     formulated by the US. ``We are not here to rubber-stamp \n     agreements,'' he said.\n       At the same time, he stressed, Iran is not trying to \n     undermine Opec as an organization. Iran would have supported \n     an increase of 1.7 million b/d if it had been accomplished in \n     two stages, starting with 1.2 million b/d. At the same time, \n     Iran will not give up any market share by withholding its \n     barrels. ``We would at least do the minimum that would have \n     been allocated,'' he said. Output will be adjusted up or down \n     as the market dictates.\n       One market that will not influence any Iranian action is \n     the US. ``The US should not have expected any more than what \n     we did because Iran does not have an interest in the US \n     market,'' he declared. ``Had it been a different situation, \n     Iran might have acted differently.''\n       Some observers questioned the whole scenario here, \n     wondering if Saudi Arabia and Iran weren't playing a high-\n     stakes international version of ``good cop, bad cop.''\n       They cited the high price range of the Opec basket relative \n     to WTI as one example of the bad-cop side, with the output \n     increase as the good cop angle. In the process, Saudi Arabia, \n     Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates could appear to be \n     cooperating. Iran, which had nothing to lose but the sale of \n     a few bushels of pistachios, could represent Opec's \n     continuing independence from outside pressure.\n       Most Opec ministers and their delegations left Vienna on \n     Wednesday fully expecting prices to stay firm, despite some \n     analysts' suggestions that discord in the organization might \n     herald a sharp sell-off. However, Opec insiders pointed out \n     that the new price mechanism may forestall countries' normal \n     inclination to cheat.\n\n                             NEW OPEC QUOTAS\n                           [Thousands of b/d]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Apr. 1    % chg.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlgeria.............................................       788       7.8\nIndonesia...........................................     1,280       7.8\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\n \nKuwait..............................................     1,980       7.8\nLibya...............................................     1,323       7.8\nNigeria.............................................     2,033       7.8\nQatar...............................................       640       7.9\nSaudi Arabia........................................     8,023       7.9\nUAE.................................................     2,845       7.9\nVenezuela...........................................     2,845       4.6\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total.........................................    21,069\nAssumed others:\n  Iran..............................................     3,623\n  Iraq..............................................     2,400\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, now they are experimenting on us with \nthis price band. That is a pretty dangerous precedent to set, but, \nnevertheless, we have become so beholden to OPEC, we are 56-percent \ndependent on OPEC.\n  The occupant of the chair remembers the Arab oil embargo in 1973. We \nhad gas lines around the block. A lot of people were unhappy. Oil was \nmore than $30 a barrel. We were excited here. We were concerned. We \nsaid: We will never allow exports to get to a level of more than 50 \npercent. We created something to ensure that we had some relief. We \ncreated the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We wanted to have a \n100-day supply. I think we have a 56-day supply in the SPR today.\n  Now some people say: We have an emergency. Take the supply out of the \nSPR. Think about that. It is very dangerous to use your reserve to \nmanipulate prices. You can only draw about 4 million barrels a day out \nof the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is located in the salt mines \nof Louisiana. If you take it out, remember, you have to refine it. Then \nwhat are you going to do for a fallback in a real emergency?\n  OPEC is watching what we do. If we pull down our Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, we become that much more vulnerable and, as a consequence, \nmore likely to be held hostage.\n  As we address what we are going to do this afternoon, again, I \nreiterate, is the priority here for a short-term fix for the American \nconsumer not at the expense of the highway trust fund but at the \nexpense of making it up through the budget process some other way? I \nthink that is a legitimate question.\n  When you pit what we are attempting to propose on this side of the \naisle, which is some kind of relief, to that proposed by the other side \nof the aisle, which is no immediate relief, the difference is clear. \nThe Administration suggests only that we develop alternatives, and that \nwe have conservation, all of which are worthwhile. But those goals are \nnot going to help mom today on her way home with the kids from the \nsoccer game when she has to fill up the sports utility vehicle and it \nis going to cost her $80. It is not going to help the farmer. It is not \ngoing to help my fishermen. It is not going to help the truckers. They \nwant relief today to stay in business.\n  We have that opportunity. We are going to make that choice. It is a \nchoice. It is a legitimate choice. It is a matter of determining where \nthe priorities of this body are.\n  We have a lot of options. We have some specific proposals for the \nshort term and the long term that I think deserve consideration. \nBecause if you look at the other side and the administration proposals, \nit is pretty hard to find anything this specific.\n  The American people are saying: Hey, we have a crisis. We have a \nproblem. The difficulty I have, to a large extent, is where we are \nseeking relief. We are not only limited to petitioning OPEC.\n  Let's take a look at our friend, Saddam Hussein, in Iraq. I have a \nchart that I think shows and tells more than I can say in a few words. \nThis shows the Iraqi oil exports to the United States. There is \nvirtually nothing in 1997.\n  But we all remember in 1991 we fought a war over there. We sent young \nAmerican men and women. We had 147 casualties in that war--147. We had \n423 who were wounded. We had 26 who were taken prisoner.\n  That war was in 1991. But what about the American taxpayer? What \nhappened? You remember, we have been enforcing the no-fly zone over \nthere. We have troops stationed around there. We have the fleet. We \nhave been keeping Saddam Hussein fenced in, if you will. The cost to \nthe American taxpayer has been $10 billion. That is what it has cost in \nthe last 9 years. The administration does not factor that in.\n  When we look at our fastest growing source of imported oil coming \ninto the United States, it is coming from our good friend, Saddam \nHussein. Incredible. I am indignant over it. I don't know about you and \nmy colleagues.\n  Last year, we imported 300,000 barrels a day from Iraq. This year we \nhave imported 700,000 barrels a day.\n\n  The day before yesterday the Department of Commerce issued a release \non sanctions for some of the technical parts that are needed within \nIraqi refineries to increase their production by an additional 600,000 \nbarrels a day. We are certainly cooperating with Saddam Hussein. Where \ndo the profits go? We suspect they probably go to the Republican Guard \nwho have something to do with keeping Saddam Hussein safe. It is \nquestionable if funds really go to the people of Iraq.\n  I was looking at some figures the other day. As we rely on the \nMideast, I think we should be reminded that what is happening here is \nwe are enriching the Mideast, the Arab oil empire.\n  As I said, in 1973 we were 36-percent dependent. Today we are 56-\npercent dependent. But the startling reality is--and you may not \nbelieve history teaches anything; some people say it does not teach \nmuch--but the forecast that the Department of Energy has publicly put \nout is that we will be importing 65 percent of our oil by the year 2015 \nto 2020.\n  Currently, we receive 46-percent of our oil from OPEC; that is, on \nthe 11 OPEC nations. Are these countries that we can depend on? How \nstable are they? What is the risk to Israel as a consequence of the \ndifficulties and distrust in that part of the world?\n  The U.S. has economic sanctions on 8 of the 11 OPEC countries. What \nfor? For human rights abuses, drug trafficking, terrorism, weapons of \nmass destruction. On the other three countries of OPEC, to name two, \nAlgeria and Indonesia, they are certainly among the least stable \nnations in the world.\n  Are we through there? I don't think so. Six OPEC nations even have \nState Department-issued travel warnings against them. I ask you, if it \nisn't safe for Americans to travel there, is it safe to rely and \nentrust our energy security to those countries?\n  I was looking at some material which I think I have here. It is kind \nof startling because I think we had some reference by Senator Lott who \nis concerned about our increasing support of Iraq and the realization \nthat Iraq is creating a missile capability. I wonder for whom those \nmissiles are designed. Mideast countries? Israel? Who is to say? But we \nare enriching and we are making possible the cash-flow that Saddam \nHussein has; otherwise he would not have the cash-flow.\n  As we look at that energy policy that I talked about, although it is \npretty hard to identify. It certainly is to import more. It does not \nsuggest we develop domestic resources in this country. We have the \ntechnology to do it safely. We know that.\n  There is a great hue and cry by the administration against opening up \nthe Arctic Coastal Plain. In my State of Alaska, we have been \ncontributing 20 percent of the total crude oil produced in the United \nStates for the last 23 years. We have a pipeline that is 800 miles \nlong. It has withstood earthquakes and it has withstood dynamite, shots \nfired at it.\n  We have an area in Alaska that I can show my colleagues on a chart \nrelative to the location and a brief description of where it is, \nbecause it is important that you understand a few things.\n  This morning I had an opportunity to speak on C-SPAN. One of the \ncallers asked: Senator, you would like to open up the Coastal Plain, \nbut why don't you put the rest of it in a wilderness or put it in a \nrefuge or something?\n  I will shortly have a chart to show you we have already done that. We \nhave 19 million acres in what we call the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. This is an area that alone is 19 million acres. It is about the \nsize of the State of South Carolina. We have already put 8 million \nacres in a permanent wilderness, 9.5 million acres in a refuge \npermanently. But we left for this body to determine whether we could \nsafely initiate exploration in what they call a 1002 area, which is 1.5 \nmillion acres. That is all.  The question is, Is this the time to bring \nin the environmental community to work with us to open it safely \nbecause we have an abundance of\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\ncapacity? This is the area I am talking about specifically. This is the \n19 million acres. This is the refuge, 9.5 million acres; this is the \nwilderness, 8 million acres; this is the Coastal Plain, 1.5 million \nacres. The footprint would be 2,000 acres, if the oil is there. We have \nthe pipeline right over there. The President vetoed this in 1995. If he \nhad approved it, we would have production today. We have an \navailability of 1 million barrels a day in this pipeline right now. We \nhave the overthrust belt, as I have indicated. We have OCS. We have the \nRocky Mountains. But there is no effort by the administration for \ndomestic production.\n\n  For those who wonder what it is really like up there and have never \nbeen there but are experts on it, who speak on the floor with profound \nknowledge and have never been to Alaska, let alone the Arctic, this is \nthe Arctic Slope of Alaska. This is a rig. This is what it looks like 8 \nmonths of the year. This is winter. It is a long winter. It is pretty \ndark. This is an ice road. This is an ice pad. They build it up with \nwater and ice so the footprint is minimum. Here is the same picture in \nthe summer. The summer should be 4 months, but it is really only about \n3. This is the tundra. That is the footprint. That is reality. It is \nawful hard to get people to come up and look at it and recognize it for \nwhat it is.\n  We are concerned about some of our friends, legitimately so. These \nare legitimate friends. They are going for a walk. Where are they \nwalking? They are walking on the pipeline. It is warm. They don't get \ntheir feet cut. Here are three bears, right at home. That is not a \nprop; that is real.\n  We have a few more friends; we are concerned about these friends. \nHere are some of our friendly caribou. There you have it. That is \nPrudhoe Bay. That is technology that is 30 years old. No guns allowed; \nyou can't shoot them. You can't run them down with a snow machine. When \nwe started Prudhoe Bay, we had 3,800 caribou. Now we have a herd of \nmore than 18,000. I don't know whether that convinces anybody that we \nhave a sensitivity about the environment, that we can work with our \ntechnology and do it right. If we get an opportunity for people to \nobjectively take a look at the job we have done, the technology we have \ndeveloped over the years, and the opportunity we have to contribute to \nthe energy security of this country as opposed to more dependence on \nimports, they usually agree with us.\n  That is where we are. I will conclude with a short rundown of the \nlong-term and intermediate relief that we have proposed within our \ncaucus to provide an opportunity to Members of this body to address \nwhat kind of relief they want. I have spoken to the gas tax. I have \nenunciated quite clearly that we do not have at risk the highway trust \nfund. That will be made whole. I have explained in detail that this \nmeasure would suspend the tax until the end of this year only, that it \nwould come on only if the average price of gasoline got to $2 a barrel, \nand that the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax originally did not go to the highway \ntrust fund, it went to the general fund.\n  I conclude with what we are going to present to this body in our \nlegislative package, which is some kind of a relief for the Northeast \non crude oil storage, for not only crude but heating oil. They have \nbeen hit very hard, and they are going to be hit harder when they \ngenerate electricity this summer. A lot of it is going to be generated \nfrom fuel oil. They are going to be paying perhaps a third to two-\nthirds more for electricity because that is what comes on the line \nlast. As a consequence, the costs associated with all other forms of \nenergy raise up to the last energy source that contributes to the power \npool, and that will be fuel oil.\n  We are also going to look at an effort to address the difficulty with \nthe stripper wells by establishing some kind of a bottom price level \nwhere, when oil gets very low, they can still stay in existence. Make \nno mistake about it, the strippers make a tremendous contribution. We \ncan't afford to lose them. They are all over Oklahoma. They are in \nKansas, in many States. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has legislation to \naddress their survival.\n\n  We have legislation for delay of rental payments, to allow expenses \nfor geological and geophysical costs, percentage depletion legislation, \nNOL carrybacks, marginal and inactive well tax credits, language to \naddress opening within the overthrust belt on public lands.\n  Obviously, we are interested in coal because coal can play a major \nrole in the power source needs of this country. This administration \nproposes to close eight coal-fired plants. They claim the management of \nthose plants is going to be held criminally liable because they have \nintentionally extended the life of these plants that were \ngrandfathered. That is the full employment act for the lawyers. They \nhave no idea of where they are going to pick up the power to substitute \nfor these plants.\n  We can address coal through technology, given the opportunity. The \nadministration doesn't have a plan for coal. What are they doing with \nnuclear? Nothing. They won't address the problem of what to do with the \nwaste. On the West Coast, they will not do anything about hydro. They \nare proposing to take the dams down. I don't know how many hundreds of \ntrucks a day are going to be on the highways of Oregon if they take \nthose dams down. Grain will be moved by truck rather than barge, \ncontributing to more gas usage and more pollution.\n  The Administration says, we are going to move to increased use of \nnatural gas. If you read the National Petroleum Institute figures, we \nare using 20 trillion cubic feet of gas now. In the next 15 years, we \nwould be up to 31. We don't have the infrastructure to deliver it. We \nwill have to invest $1.5 trillion for that infrastructure. But, the gas \nis not available for exploration because they won't let us have access \nto public lands. So gas is not the answer.\n  If you look at what we are attempting to do as opposed to what the \nother side has proposed, which is what? Alternative energy, \nconservation, some tax breaks--I am all for those things. But we have \nto do something right now. We have a plan. And if it is a priority and \ndeemed a priority by this body, then you have a choice. You have a \nchoice of whether to vote for the gas tax suspension for the balance of \nthis year, if you feel that is a priority or you don't. It will not \njeopardize the highway trust fund. Again, it is no free ride. We will \nhave to find that money someplace else.\n  I could go on at length, but I felt it necessary to make this \npresentation to ensure that we had a fair understanding of what we are \nproposing in our caucus for immediate, interim, and long-term relief \noptions against what you are hearing from the other side. I wanted you \nto know what we can do domestically to relieve our dependence on \nimported oil. And, I wanted to point out what the administration says \nwe got the other day compared to the reality of what we got when we \nread the fine print.\n  It appears that our negotiators got the short end of the so-called \nstick because that increase, again, was only 500,000 barrels a day. It \nhas a floor and a ceiling: a $28 ceiling; a $22 floor. If you think we \nwill see oil cheaper than that, it simply is not going to happen.\n  If any Members would like to discuss with me just what is in this \nhighway tax bill, please don't hesitate to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1961-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1961-S1968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LAUNCHING OUR COMMUNITIES' ACCESS TO LOCAL TELEVISION ACT OF 2000--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. What is the order of business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 2902.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 10 \nminutes in support of S. 2097.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized following Mr. Grams to speak out \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my strong \nsupport for S. 2097, the Launching Our Communities Access to Local \nTelevision Act of 2000. I also commend Senator Craig Thomas and Senator \nTim\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\nJohnson for the work they have done. They have been on the floor today \ntalking about this bill; more important, they have been working for \ndays, weeks, and even months trying to put this bill together. I really \nthank them and commend them for all the work and effort they put into \ngetting this bill to where it is today.\n  During the 106th Congress, few issues have generated as many phone \ncalls, letters, and e-mails to my office as those opinions expressed by \nrural Minnesotans concerned about the future of their satellite \ntelevision programs.\n  In recent months, Federal district court decisions terminating the \nsatellite signals of thousands of satellite subscribers and the \nuncertain status of the Satellite Home Viewer Act have caused \nunnecessary frustration and inconvenience for Minnesotans who depend \nupon satellite television for informational, education, and \nentertainment programming on a daily basis. For these reasons, I am \nvery pleased to have supported the enactment of legislation last year \nthat reauthorized the Satellite Home Viewer Act.\n  The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act has begun to encourage \ngreater competition between the satellite and cable industries while \nalso providing consumers in the top television markets with the benefit \nof ``local-into-local'' television programming. Additionally, this law \nhas protected existing satellite subscribers from having their distant \nnetwork signals terminated and reduced the copyright fees paid by \nsatellite providers. This reduction in copyright fees has helped to \nmake satellite service more affordable to consumers, particularly in \nrural areas.\n  I also recognize that millions of Americans in small, rural areas \nhave not begun to enjoy the local-into-local programming because \nsatellite carriers do not have the capability to provide this service \ninto small, rural areas immediately. In fact, two of the largest \nsatellite providers, DirecTV and Echostar, have testified that their \ncompanies will initially provide local-into-local service to households \nin the top 50-60 television markets. Thus, approximately 150 television \nmarkets such as the Duluth-Superior, Rochester, and Mankato television \nmarkets in Minnesota will not receive this programming as quickly as \nurban markets.\n  I firmly believe that Congress should ensure that rural America \nreceives the benefits of this technology and local-into-local \nprogramming. For these reasons, I have been working with my colleagues \non the Senate Banking Committee, industry groups, and consumers to pass \nthe ``LOCAL TV Act.'' This legislation would establish a $1.25 billion \nloan guarantee program to facilitate access to local television \nprogramming in rural Minnesota communities and throughout the country. \nImportantly, the LOCAL TV Act will help to facilitate local-into-local \nprogramming without mandating a specific technology to provide this \nservice and thereby encouraging competition and innovation by \nindependent cable companies and satellite providers.\n  I was very concerned that this legislation excludes several private \nlenders from providing the financing to ensure local-into-local \nprogramming throughout rural communities. Specifically, the LOCAL TV \nAct provides that the federal government will guarantee 80 percent of \nany loan that is provided by FDIC insured depository institutions. So \nfar, so good.\n  Mr. President, limiting the guarantee to 80 percent assures that \nwhichever lending institution provides the financing will have very \ngood reason to give the loan request extensive scrutiny to justify the \n20 percent of the loan which is not guaranteed and perhaps decide not \nto lend. This careful scrutiny would be less assured if we allowed 100 \npercent government loan guarantees.\n  I also support authorizing the FDIC insured lenders to have the \nopportunity to participate in the loan guarantee programs. However, the \nbill currently excludes certain private sector lenders which have \nsubstantial experience providing multi-million dollar loans in a coop \nenvironment and which have a track record of support for projects of \nthis size in rural areas.\n  For this reason, I have joined with Senators Johnson and Thomas to \nintroduce an amendment to this bill which will expand the list of \neligible lenders. Specifically, the Johnson-Thomas-Grams amendment \nrequires eligible lenders to have at least one issue of outstanding \ndebt that is rated in one of the three highest rating categories by a \nnational statistical rating agency. This provision will ensure that our \nexpanded list of lenders will have been subjected to rigorous \nmarketplace scrutiny. The process of achieving one of the three highest \ninvestment grade ratings involves an intense review of the lender's \ncapital strength, lending expertise, and loan loss experience.\n  The wording for this amendment is almost identical to wording which \nthis body utilized last fall when we passed S. 900, the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley bill. In that landmark legislation, the test of marketplace \nscrutiny was used to determine which of the top 50 national banks could \nconduct expanded activities in a bank subsidiary.\n  The theory we used was that marketplace discipline is an important \nthreshold in sorting the qualified from the unqualified. That same \napproach is being put in place here.\n  Lastly, our amendment also requires an eligible lender to have \nprovided financing with outstanding debt from the Rural Utilities \nService. This provision is important because the underlying bill \nauthorizes the Rural Utilities Service to be the administrator of the \nloan guarantee program.\n  The second part of this provision states that the approved lender \nmust demonstrate to the loan guarantee board that it has the expertise, \ncapacity and capital strength to provide financing pursuant to the act.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Johnson-Thomas-Grams amendment will \nstrengthen the LOCAL TV Act and ensure that rural Americans will soon \nenjoy the benefits of local television programming. I am pleased that \nChairman Gramm has been working to accommodate our concerns and \nstrengthen this legislation.\n  Mr. President, again, I commend and thank very much Senators Craig \nThomas and Tim Johnson for all their hard work in making this \nlegislation possible. I urge everybody's strong support of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask unanimous consent that the prior order to allow \nSenator Byrd to follow Senator Grams be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise, first of all, to support S. 2097, \nthe LOCAL TV Act of 2000.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment I had previously \noffered and on which the yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about the \nmistaken identity by the National Association of Broadcasters in \nrelationship to my amendment. What we have tried to do, and what this \nbill has successfully done, is allow most of the areas in the United \nStates to have access to dish or satellite television. But there are \nareas that have been excluded. I will give you an example of some of \nthose.\n  Areas are excluded when most of the television stations that are \nreceived instate are based out of the State. I use Kentucky as an \nexample. If you want to hear something in Kentucky and you don't live \nin Louisville or Lexington, or a couple of other smaller cities, such \nas Bowling Green and Paducah, you must get your television news, \nsports, entertainment, and everything, from out of State, a different \nADI, such as Cincinnati; Charleston-Huntington, WV; Knoxville, TN; \nNashville, TN; Evansville, IN; and on and on and on.\n  This bill does not adequately cover those areas because it says \ngenerally if you are brought in an ADI area that is covered by an out-\nof-State television station, you must accept that. There can be \nexceptions. But, living in Kentucky, I surely don't want to have to \nwatch Atlanta television, or Atlanta news, or, for that matter, \nCleveland, OH, news on my satellite dish. I know most Kentuckians don't \nwant that.\n  Of all the issues that have come before the Senate, this has been the \none on which I have received the most information. I received a paper \nput out\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\nby the National Association of Broadcasters that criticized my \namendment to allow all or at least require one of the local markets in \nKentucky to carry it on the dish or on the satellite. It said it \n``destroys the network affiliation relationship.'' But that is hogwash. \nIt does not destroy that. It just means that the people in certain \nareas don't want to watch New York television as the thing they get on \ntheir dish. If they are only going to go down to the first 60 major \nmarkets in this country, that is what we are going to have to do in \nmany of the rural areas.\n  This loan guarantee program that we have will cover an awful lot of \nother areas. But South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and \nplenty of areas in this country do not have major markets and don't \ncarry all four--ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX--and will no doubt not have the \ncoverage they might like to have in their area.\n  ``Undermines localism'' is another thing the National Association of \nBroadcasters has said about the amendment I just withdrew.\n  Am I going to watch a local station from Paducah and go down there \nand buy something that has been advertised on a Paducah station if it \nis carried on my dish? Of course not. I am going to go to my local \nstore, or wherever it might be, and buy the exact same thing that is \navailable in my local area. I can pick up a local station out of \nCincinnati with rabbit ears. I don't need a dish for that.\n  It ``creates two classes of satellite viewers''--no, it doesn't. We \nall pay almost the same amount for basic satellite television. My \namendment did not change that.\n  ``Flies in the face of both copyright and communication laws'' --not \nbeing a lawyer, and having dealt only with the prior law we passed last \nyear, I know full well it doesn't violate any of those provisions in \nthat law we had on the floor of the Senate.\n  Last, but not least, it says, ``it creates a huge regulatory \ndisparity.'' No other multichannel video provider has nearly such an \nextensive ``must carry'' requirement. We don't want them to carry every \nstation in Kentucky. We want them to carry one that has four of the \nmajor networks. That is what we want.\n  We will work it out later. I have talked with Senator Burns, who is \nmost expert on this, and I hope to work with Senator McCain on Commerce \nto get this done. This is not the time nor the place to fight this \nfight. I will fight it another day at a later date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think while we have looked as if there \nwas inaction and chaos all afternoon--it felt like it at various \nmoments--the truth is, we have done our work.\n  Senator Baucus has an amendment which I intend to accept. Senator \nHatch as a second-degree amendment. I will be supportive of both the \nsecond-degree amendment and first-degree amendment. We will accept \nthose.\n  Senator Johnson and I have worked out differences. We will accept \nthat amendment.\n  We will then be ready for a vote on final passage.\n  Senator Baucus may offer his amendment when he is ready. I have \nalready offered the amendment for Senator Hatch. If Senator Johnson \nwants to offer a second-degree amendment to it, he can. If not, if \nsomeone will pass it to me, I will do it.\n  We are putting everybody on notice that we are coming to the happy \nhour. We should be able to finish our bill in about 15 minutes. People \ncan start moving in this direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2900, As Modified\n\n            (Purpose: To make minor and technical changes.)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) for himself, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Robb, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Burns, and Mr. Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2900, as modified.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, line 10, insert after ``local television \n     stations'' the following: ``, and related signals (including \n     high-speed Internet access and National Weather Service \n     Warnings),''.\n       On page 30, strike line 9 and insert the following: ``means \n     by which local television broadcast signals, and related \n     signals (including high-speed Internet access and National \n     Weather Service Warnings),''.\n       On page 33, line 19, strike ``areas,'' and insert ``areas \n     and the number of States (including noncontiguous States),''.\n       On page 33, beginning in line 22, strike ``estimated cost \n     per household to be served.'' and insert ``efficiency in \n     providing service given the area to be served.''.\n       On page 33, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       (B) Additional considerations.--To the maximum extend \n     practicable, the Board should give additional consideration \n     to projects which also provide related signals (including \n     high-speed Internet access and National Weather Service \n     Warnings).\n       On page 33, line 24, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(C)''.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an amendment to which the chairman \nof committee has graciously stated he agreed. This is a modification of \nan earlier amendment I provided. This amendment essentially provides \nthat related signals, including high-speed Internet access and National \nWeather Service warnings, be included in the criteria when the board \ndecides which loans to guarantee in providing for local-into-local \nservice.\n  One of the modifications, frankly, is as follows: Including \nnoncontiguous States.\n  I chuckled a little bit because that is Alaska, which is wonderful. \nBut it also is a technical matter that makes it more likely it is not \nnecessarily constrained by otherwise constraining language.\n  The amendment basically says that, to the maximum extent practicable, \nthe board should give additional consideration to projects which also \nprovide related signals--again, including high-speed Internet access \nand National Weather Service warnings.\n  The whole point is, we have an opportunity to help provide broad \nbandwidth Internet service to rural America while we are now passing \nlegislation which gives incentives to provide more local-into-local \ntelevision coverage to rural America. I believe we should take \nadvantage of that opportunity and give a little boost and a little \npreference to those applicants who will provide that additional \ncapability.\n  I want to sort of chime in on the point the Senator from Texas was \nmaking about the floor looking as if we were not doing our work. There \nwas a group of Montana high school students here about 2 or 3 hours \nago. They asked me, Why aren't there more Senators on the floor and why \nare we not doing business? I explained to them, as the Senator from \nTexas essentially said, that a lot of work is not done directly in \ndebate but there are negotiations and kind of behind-the-scenes work \ngoing on to work things out. I compliment the Senator for his work in \nhelping us accomplish that objective.\n  Before I finish, I also want to pay particular compliments to not \nonly the Senator from Texas but to my colleague from Montana, Senator \nBurns. Senator Burns has been very active in helping provide both local \ncoverage and satellite coverage. I want to particularly note that; in \naddition, certainly managing a bill of this size, Senator Johnson as \nwell as Senator Leahy from Vermont.\n  There are a lot of people who worked on this. We are making progress. \nSometimes it is a little slow. It is not very expeditious, but that is \nthe nature of our democracy. I thank them.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus for working with us \non the amendment. We are supportive of the amendment and we accept it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased the amendment I cosponsored \nwas agreed to.\n  That amendment did three important things. First, it made clear that \nany plan put forward to provide local broadcast signals to rural areas \ntakes into account service to Alaska and Hawaii. Under my amendment \nthese non-contiguous States are elevated from afterthoughts to priority \nconsideration.\n  We also altered another priority in this bill that could have \ninadvertently penalized the most rural States. Originally the bill \nmandated that the cost\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nper household of providing service be a top priority.\n  Such a provision sounds good on its face but the high cost of service \nto outlying areas is one reason why the incumbent satellite and cable \nproviders are not serving our areas. My amendment doesn't remove cost \nas a factor, but it ensures that rural states aren't penalized when \nproposals are made.\n  Finally, this amendment includes language that would allow high-speed \ninternet access to also be supported by the loan guarantees.\n  I thank Senators Burns, Baucus and Leahy for their help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2900), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2902, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send a modification to the amendment I \npreviously sent forward on behalf of Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2902), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, strike lines 1 through 13 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       On page 50, line 23, strike ``10.'' and insert ``9.''.\n       On page 27, line 21, strike ``10'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``9''.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't think there is any further debate on this \namendment. I believe it is acceptable to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2902), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We just received a copy of the amendment Senator Johnson \nand I worked out. While he is reviewing it, let me make my concluding \nremarks.\n  We had a very difficult mandate, to take a bill from last year and \nmake it possible for people living in rural America to get their local \ntelevision station so they can receive local news, the local weather, \nthe local football game, all of which are critical to life in this \ngreat country that we know as the United States of America.\n  The problem from last year is that, with the confluence of interests \nthat would be affected, they put together a bill that was 100 percent \nloan guarantee, that did not have an effective way of protecting the \ntaxpayer. Therefore, the scoring by the Congressional Budget Office was \na potential default rate of about 45 percent.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we have now put together an alternative. We \nhave a loan board made up of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Agriculture, or \ntheir Senate-confirmed designees. We guarantee only 80 percent of the \nloan. We have an expanded ability to go behind shell corporations to \nget to real assets.\n  We have put together a bill aimed at protecting the taxpayer. It is a \nrisky business trying to come up with the technology and investing $1 \nbillion to get local television stations to rural America. A lot of \nthings can go wrong. This is a dangerous business we have undertaken.\n  Given that the Senate and the House of Representatives, by \noverwhelming numbers, decided this was something that needed to be \ndone, we committed in the Banking Committee to try to do right. We said \nthat the Committee would report a bill by the end of this month. In \nfact, we passed a bill unanimously in our Committee a month ago. I \nbelieve we have done as good a job as possible given the mandate we had \nand given the interest of the people who are both on the Committee and \nserve in the Senate.\n  I am proud of this bill, and now we have to go to conference. They \nhave divided jurisdiction in the House, and it will be a difficult \nconference.\n  My goal is to stay true to two principles: No. 1, we want to enhance \nthe chance that people who live in rural America, especially in \nisolated areas, can get their local television signal. Second, we want \nto be good stewards of the taxpayers' money. We want to guarantee to \nthe best of our ability not only that the loans will be made but that \nthey will be paid back. It does no good to make bad loans, because bad \nloans don't produce local TV signals. Bad loans simply cost the \ntaxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars and do no good.\n  I thank Senator Johnson who has been a leader on this. I thank Conrad \nBurns. More than anybody else, Conrad Burns is responsible for this \nbill passing the Senate today. He had the idea, he put together a \nproposal, and he worked with Members to put together a better proposal. \nHe has been the constant driving force for this to happen.\n  When ABC Saturday football comes on with the local football team, I \nhope people will think about Conrad Burns and the leadership he \nprovided in making it possible for them to view these shows.\n  We will dispense with this amendment by a voice vote. Anyone who \nwants to make a last-minute statement on this bill, please come to the \nfloor. We are very close to a vote on final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. First, I compliment my colleague, Senator Johnson, for \nthe extraordinary efforts he has made in reaching this compromise. I \ncompliment, as well, the Republican manager, Senator Gramm, for the \nwork that has gone into the agreement that we now have reached.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. I think we are going to \nsee a very strong vote. It is, in large measure, due to the \ncontributions and leadership of Senator Johnson and Senator Gramm. I \nhope we can dispose of both of these matters shortly.\n  It has been a long time coming. But it was worth the wait.\n  I want to thank my colleagues--especially Senator Johnson--for making \nessential improvements. Because of their patience and persistence, we \nare now--finally--on the verge of passing a bill that will give rural \nAmericans the same access to affordable local TV programming as \neveryone else in our nation.\n  Senator Johnson's amendment is the heart of this bill.\n  It will allow banks associated with rural cooperatives to lend coops \nenough money to build their own satellite facilities.\n  The reason this is so critical is because commercial satellite \nbroadcasters have made it absolutely clear: They have no interest in \nserving rural markets. They don't think it's worth their time or money \nto build satellite TV facilities for rural markets.\n  The same is true of many commercial banks.\n  If the only choice for rural communities was to borrow from \ncommercial banks to build satellite facilities, the communities--very \nlikely--would end up paying high interest rates.\n  Those high interest rates would drive up the costs of building the \nsatellite facilities.\n  That, in turn, would drive up the price rural Americans would be \nforced to pay for local TV programming.\n  Senator Johnson's amendment, though, means that banks associated with \nrural cooperatives can also make loans to build satellite facilities. \nThe coops will charge lower interest rates than commercial banks.\n  This is a huge victory for people in small towns and rural \ncommunities in South Dakota, and all across America.\n  The reason we fought so hard to get this bill right is because this \nis not just about entertainment. This is about public safety.\n  It is potentially about life and death.\n  Local stations provide local news and public affairs programming. \nThey also provide weather updates.\n  A year and a half ago, a tornado destroyed much of the town of \nSpencer, South Dakota. As devastating as that tornado was, it could \nhave been far worse. It could have claimed many lives.\n  One reason it did not may very well have been because Spencer is \nwithin the Sioux Falls local broadcast area.\n  People could turn on their TVs and see that the tornado was coming, \nand take cover.\n  But most South Dakota communities are outside both the Sioux Falls \nand the Rapid City broadcast areas.\n  Without Senator Johnson's amendment, it is doubtful that they would \nbe able to receive local weather or news reports.\n  Rural coops have a 60-year history of responsibly promoting economic \ndevelopment throughout rural America. By\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\nadding them to the pool of qualified lenders, we have greatly improved \nthis bill.\n  I commend Senator Johnson again for his leadership, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for his amendment and this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have had a discussion going on \nthroughout the course of this afternoon relative to the satellite \ntelevision legislation and an amendment that is necessary on this bill.\n  I commend Senator Gramm, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, \nand his staff, Senator Thomas, Senator Grams, Senator Burns, Senator \nSarbanes and his staff, and others who have worked diligently on this. \nWe have spent a lot of time on it.\n  I believe we are almost at the moment where we can offer a compromise \namendment and resolve this once and for all. We just received a copy of \nthe amendment. There are one or two points that are being checked with \ncounsel. Within literally minutes, we should be able to confirm the \nlanguage is exactly what we think it is.\n  I am appreciative of the bipartisan effort that went into making this \nlegislation a reality. The legislation last fall was a good bill. It \npermitted the broadcast of local signals to local areas, but we did \nneed the guarantee loan provisions to get into the smaller television \nmarkets.\n  It has just been confirmed to me the language is as we thought.\n  Again, I applaud Senator Gramm and others for their work in that \nregard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2903\n\n            (Purpose: To address certain lending practices)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], for himself, \n     Mr. Gramm, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Burns, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2903.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, strike line 22 and all that follows through \n     page 31, line 3, and insert the following:\n       ``(D)(i) the loan (including Other Debt, as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B))--\n       ``(I) is provided by any entity engaged in the business of \n     commercial lending--\n       ``(aa) if the loan is made in accordance with loan-to-one-\n     borrower and affiliate transaction restrictions to which the \n     entity if subject under applicable law; or\n       ``(bb) if subclause (aa) does not apply, the loan is made \n     only to a borrower that is not an affiliate of the entity and \n     only if the amount of the loan and all outstanding loans by \n     that entity to that borrower and any of its affiliates does \n     not exceed 10 percent of the net equity of the entity; or\n       ``(II) is provided by a nonprofit corporation, including \n     the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, \n     engaged primarily in commercial lending, if the Board \n     determines that such nonprofit corporation has one or more \n     issues of outstanding long term debt that is rated within the \n     highest 3 rating categories of a nationally recognized \n     statistical rating organization, and, if the Board determines \n     that the making of the loan by such nonprofit corporation \n     will cause a decline in the debt rating mentioned above, the \n     Board at its discretion may disapprove the loan guarantee on \n     this basis.\n       ``(ii)(I) no loan (including Other Debt as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B) may be made for purposes of this Act by \n     a government entity or affiliate thereof, or by the Federal \n     Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or any institution \n     supervised by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \n     Oversight, the Federal Housing Finance Board, or any \n     affiliate of such entities;\n       ``(II) any loan (including Other Debt as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B) must have terms, in the judgment of the \n     Board, that are consistent in material respects with the \n     terms of similar obligations in the private capital market;\n       ``(III) for purposes of subclause (i)(I)(bb), the term `net \n     equity' means the value of the total assets of the entity, \n     less the total liabilities of the entity, as recorded under \n     generally accepted accounting principles for the fiscal \n     quarter ended immediately prior to the date on which the \n     subject loan is approved;''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Thomas, Senator Burns, Senator Grams, and Senator \nGramm. We have worked throughout the afternoon to expand the universal \nqualified lenders without sacrificing taxpayer protections in the bill. \nThanks to the good faith on all sides, we have now allowed cooperative \nlending entities, such as the CFC and CoBank, to participate in the \nprogram while ensuring maximum protection of the taxpayer dollars.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, I know Senator Domenici wanted \nto vote on final passage and has to leave to attend a meeting. I do not \nthink anybody opposes the amendment on which we have worked out a \nconsensus. If the Senator wants a rollcall, obviously, we will have \none.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I appreciate there is a timeliness issue here, but I do \nthink it is important to have a rollcall on this amendment. This is a \nvery significant matter. This is going to the conference committee. I \nam hopeful we can expedite that matter.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment \nbe voted on immediately following a short statement by Senator Burns.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I can make my statement following the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We can do it quickly. I ask unanimous consent that after \nthe amendment is adopted, we proceed to third reading and that there be \nan immediate vote on passage of our bill, to be followed by the cloture \nvote on the gas tax legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I have a couple thank-yous, because this \nhas been an issue that has been worked out mostly because of the \ncooperation of a lot of folks.\n  Last year, as my colleagues know, we ran into that brick wall called \nTexas Gramm. Nonetheless, he has just been a champion of getting this \npiece of legislation to the floor and getting it worked out. We have a \nbetter bill. Under his guidance, under his recommendations, I think we \nhave a better bill. We have a better bill for the taxpayers. We have a \nbetter bill for the people who want to receive their local-into-local \nvia satellite.\n  I also thank Senator Johnson and the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Paul Sarbanes, and my colleague from Montana, who \nmade it stronger because they understand the infrastructure is going to \nbe broadband services in our rural areas. This is a giant step forward.\n  Also, I thank the leader, Senator Lott, who put this on the calendar \nand said it had to be one of the important things we pass this year in \nthis Congress. I appreciate his leadership. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from South Dakota wish to be \nrecognized?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I reiterate my request for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2903. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 49 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\n\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Boxer\n      \n  The amendment (No. 2903) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nvote in the series be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has today \npassed a bill that I tried to have passed along with the comprehensive \nsatellite reforms enacted a few months ago at the end of the last \ncongressional session. The reforms we authored are already bearing \nfruit. Satellite carriers are beginning to serve their customers local \ntelevision, which they had not done before. As part of our \ncomprehensive reform we developed a loan guarantee program to help \nensure that smaller markets would not be left behind in enjoying the \nbenefits of our reforms.\n  The chairman of the Banking Committee requested further time to \nreview and improve if possible the program, and we were able to work \ntogether to meet his concerns. The bill the Senate adopts today is \nsimilar in most respects to the legislation we developed last year, and \nI am pleased that we are finally able to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  I hope the House will act expeditiously on similar legislation, or \ntake up the Senate legislation as soon as possible. I have long \nchampioned the provision of local television signals by satellite \ncarriers for many reasons. First, it allows for more direct competition \nagainst cable customers alike, in the form of lower prices and better \nservices, as well as expanded choice. Second, I believe that local \ntelevision helps unite local communities by providing programming \nrelevant to that community. It is important that Utahns know what is \nhappening in their communities, and be able to participate in civic \naffairs as informed citizens. They need to know what the local weather \nforecast in New York. And they enjoy watching the local sports teams, \nor other Utah-related programming. Third, I think local television \nservice is more consistent with the current market relationships than \nbeaming the programming tailored to other communities into our local \ncommunities.\n  For these reasons, I pushed reforms to allow satellite companies to \ncarry local programming for a number of Congresses, culminating in our \npassage of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 last year. \nThe one piece of unfinished business from that package of reforms was \nthe loan guarantee program we adopt today. Under this legislation, \ngovernment-backed loans will be made available to ensure that those \nsmaller markets, the markets that most need local television delivery \nby satellite or other means, are not left behind. The satellite \ncarriers and cable companies understandably serve the larger markets \nfirst, where costs are lower and revenues potentially greater. \nHopefully with the adoption and eventual enactment of this legislation \ntoday, we will go a long way to help all our local communities enjoy \ntogether the programming most relevant to them, their local television \nsignals.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2097, the Launching \nOur Communities Access to Local Television Act of 2000. Enacting this \nlegislation will complete our work on the Satellite Home Viewer \nImprovements Act that we voted into law last fall. Simply put, the \nLOCAL TV bill is the last piece of the puzzle that will encourage \ncompetition to cable in all markets, not just the top 20 or 30 largest \nurban areas.\n  At the SHVIA Conference just this past year, we tried to tackle how \nto encourage ``local-into-local'' service into all areas, not just the \nbiggest and most lucrative TV markets. But we only had mixed success. \nSo it made sense to postpone the debate until this year. At the time, I \nwas not entirely comfortable with the precursor of this measure. But I \ndid then and I do now strongly support its goals. Today's package \ndevelops an approach that combines incentives and loan guarantees, \nwhich will pave the way for ``local-into-local'' service to reach into \nour rural areas. I am encouraged by the revisions that addressed the \nconcerns of Chairman Gramm and others.\n  For example, a loan guarantee must be approved by a board comprised \nof the Treasury Secretary, Federal Reserve Chairman, and the \nAgriculture Secretary. Such a board is unlikely to sign off on an \noverly risky proposition. Their review will help ensure fiscal \ndiscipline and prevent the taxpayer from being left on the hook for a \nbad deal. Furthermore, the government will not underwrite the entire \namount of the loan. Holding lenders to 20 percent of the amount \nfinanced will make them scrutinize a loan application long and hard \nbefore they extend credit under this program.\n  Moreover, we still allow market forces to make this program work. The \nLOCAL TV bill does not favor any particular technology. It is \ntechnologically neutral. Therefore, whether it is satellite, cable or \nan emerging technology, anyone with the entrepreneurial spirit to take \non the task of delivering local television signals to remote areas is \neligible for the program. By creating this incentive for all to \nparticipate, we permit the market to determine who will win a loan \nguarantee under this law.\n  Hopefully, and most importantly, this bill will help local-into-local \nget rolled out more ubiquitously to rural markets in Wisconsin around \nGreen Bay, Madison, Eau Claire, and Wausau and to other areas across \nthe country. This is a good thing for consumers and, very simply, \nthat's why I support passage of this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today first of all to commend those \nmembers on both sides of the aisle who have worked so hard to bring \nthis important loan guarantee bill to the floor. It is the final \npiece--and in my view, the key piece--of a lengthy effort to enact \ncomprehensive reform of our nation's satellite television laws.\n  Last year, we passed a bill that I was proud to cosponsor, the \nSatellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999. It restored service to \nthousands of Virginia households who had been cut off from their \nnetwork signals, and more importantly, allowed satellite television \ncompanies to finally provide local network services to consumers. My \nonly disappointment about the Act was that a last-minute deal removed a \nprovision which would have made it easier for viewers living outside of \nmajor metropolitan areas to get satellite broadcasts of their local \ntelevision stations.\n  As a result, the only market in Virginia that can receive local-into-\nlocal service is the metropolitan D.C. area, leaving over 94% of \nsatellite households in my state without this crucial service. The \nsatellite industry is not required to start offering local service to \nall their customers, and they've made it clear that they don't intend \nto do so, leaving many Americans without this important service.\n  I believe that every household in Virginia, and, indeed, across \nAmerica deserves the same quality local television service. This isn't \njust a matter of helping rural areas get the latest episodes of ``Who \nWants to Be a Millionaire?'' or ``NYPD Blue''--it's about ensuring that \nall consumers have access to vital local public safety information, \nschool closings, weather and news programming that we've come to rely \non.\n  There's no question that the market is out there for these services--\nI've been inundated with thousands of phone calls, letters and post \ncards from Virginians who want to subscribe to them. Unfortunately, \nmany companies and cooperatives who are interested in providing new \nlocal television services have held back because the financing can be a \nbit tricky.\n  The bill before us today will help to address this problem. By \nproviding loan guarantees that support new satellite services that \nserve rural areas of the country, we can help facilitate the \ntransmission of local television signals to areas of the country that \nare not able to receive this service. Earlier today, I joined Senators \nJohnson and Thomas in introducing an amendment that would significantly \nimprove the loan guarantee program by expanding it to include those \nentities that are most adept at providing rural utilities. I'm very \npleased that a modified\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nversion of this amendment has been accepted, and believe that it will \ngo a long way toward bringing affordable local television signals to \nunserved areas in Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I'd also like to talk for a moment about a second \namendment which I've cosponsored, along with Senators Baucus and Leahy, \nto address the issue of the emerging ``digital divide'' between urban \nand rural America. While many people generally think of Internet access \nas something that you get over telephone lines, consumers are \nincreasingly able to access the Internet at much faster speeds through \nthe same systems used to transmit cable and satellite television.\n  Our amendment simply clarifies that this new loan guarantee program \nshould look at ways that the same systems which are deployed in rural \nareas to deliver local television services can also be used to deliver \nnew broadband communications services. At a time when television and \nthe Internet are heading in a direction where they may soon converge, \nwe ought to have the foresight to look at ways that new communications \nsystems can support multiple services and technologies, particularly \nwhen the government is helping to finance the deployment of these \nsystems. This amendment has also been accepted.\n  Again, Mr. President, I strongly support the underlying bill, and \ncommend those on both sides of the aisle who have helped move it to the \nSenate floor. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure \nthat we take steps to further enhance the range of choices consumers \nhave in the marketplace.\n\n\n                      Administrative Procedure Act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Is it the case that the \nprogram established by S. 2097, the ``Launching Our Communities' Access \nto Local Television Act of 2000,'' would be subject to the \nAdministrative Procedure Act? For example, would the Board established \nby this Act be required to make its proposed rules and regulations \navailable for public comment and other relevant procedures under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator is correct. Public involvement must be an \nessential part of this program if it is to succeed. The Board \nestablished by S. 2097 falls within the definition of an ``agency'' \nunder section 552 of Title 5 of the United States Code (Administrative \nProcedure Act) and therefore will have its rulemaking subject to the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. All parties will have an opportunity to \nbe heard. This openness to public comment will help ensure that the \ninterests of those most likely to benefit from the loan guarantee \nprogram--television subscribers in unserved areas--will be represented. \nIn addition, an open rulemaking should help ensure that no applicant \nfor a loan guarantee will receive consideration apart from the merits \nof the proposed project.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the chairman for this clarification.\n\n\n   application of copyright and communications law to loan guarantee \n                               applicants\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it would be appropriate at this point to \nexplain our joint view regarding the application of copyright and \ncommunications law to those who provide local television signals with \nthe assistance provided under this Act. We all agree that the rights, \nobligations, and limitations that apply to applicants under this loan \nguarantee program ought to be the same as those providing similar \nservices without the assistance of the loan guarantee program. Congress \npassed comprehensive rules in this area just a few months ago at the \nend of the last session, and it is our joint intention to clarify that \nthose rules apply to applicants under this program just as they do to \nothers who take advantage of the reforms passed last year. To \nunderscore this position we have offered an amendment, and that \namendment has been accepted, that will clarify some confusion resulting \nfrom the manner in which section 8 of the underlying bill was drafted \nby dropping section 8 from the bill altogether. It is the general rule \nthat otherwise applicable law will apply absent a clear statement to \nthe contrary. Since the relevant sections of Title 17 and Title 47 \nwould apply, the attempt to list the provisions that apply in this \ncontext is superfluous, and to the extent that the drafting in current \nsection 8 could be read to be inconsistent with current law, it merely \ncauses needless confusion. It seems best, therefore, to simply drop the \nprovision and make a clear statement that currently applicable \ncopyright and communications law will apply to applicants under the \nloan guarantee program just as it does to those providing similar \nservices without loan guarantee assistance. Do my colleagues agree?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do agree. It was never the intention of those who \nworked on the broad satellite television reforms in the last session to \nestablish any different copyright or communications rules for loan \nguarantee applicants, but rather that they be governed by the same \nrules as all others in the market. If special rules were established \nfor loan guarantee applicants, the loan guarantee program would have \ncollateral effects on the market for subscription television services \nby causing a confusing disparity in the rules applicable to \ncompetitors, and possibly skew competition in unforeseen or \ninappropriate ways. I agree that it is important to clarify the \napplication of law in this way at that time. I would ask the managers \nof the bill if they agree with us and will commit to work through \nconference to the end of ensuring that the rules we adopted last year \nwill continue to apply to applicants and non-applicants alike?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I agree with my colleagues that we should clarify that \ncurrent copyright and communications law will apply to applicants and \nnon-applicants alike under our loan guarantee legislation. And I will \ncontinue to work, as I have heretofore, to ensure that our loan \nguarantee bill does not change the application of the rules passed last \nyear with regard to applicants or other non-applicant providers of \ntelevision services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, today's fuel prices are a daily reminder \nthat America is now at the mercy of foreign oil producing nations. \nHowever, before you blame your neighbor's SUV, your local fuel \ndistributors, the oil companies, the automakers, or any of the other \nusual scapegoats, consider this fact--America is one of the leading \nenergy producing countries in the world. This country has the \ntechnology, alternative resources and enough oil to be much more self-\nsufficient. America does not have to revert back to the practices of \nthe 1970s.\n  This country is faced with a very serious problem. Our nation's \nfarmers and truckers are being hit the hardest--simply because of this \nAdministration's lack of energy policy. In fact, Secretary Richardson \nrecently admitted that this Administration was caught napping when \nenergy prices began to rise. As a result, U.S. crude oil production is \ndown 17 percent since 1993, and consumption is up 14%. America now \nimports 56% of the oil consumed--compared to 36% imported at the time \nof the 1973 Arab oil embargo. At this rate the DOE predicts America \nwill be at least 65% dependent on foreign oil by 2020.\n  This Administration has close ties to radical environmentalists--\nenvironmentalists whose strong rhetoric and drastic actions appear more \nlike a new-age religion than a clarion call for good stewardship. It \nappears that the White House has spent eight years trying to slowly \nkill our oil, coal, natural gas and even our hydroelectric industries.\n  The Administration began this process in 1993 with an effort to \nimpose a $73 billion five-year energy tax to force the American people \naway from the use of automobiles and American industries away from \ntheir primary energy sources. The Clinton/Gore EPA is still attempting \nto shut down coal-fired electric generating plants in the South and \nMidwest. Meanwhile, the Administration is providing no offsets to this. \nIn fact, they have done nothing to increase the availability of \ndomestic natural gas, which is the clean alternative for coal in \nelectric plants. Federal land out West is expected to contain as much \nas 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, but the Administration \nrefuses to allow drilling. Similarly, the Administration will not allow \nexploration on federal land in Alaska, which is estimated to contain 16 \nbillion barrels of domestic crude oil.\n  None of these facts should be surprising. Vice President Gore has \nvowed to prohibit future exploration for oil or natural gas on our \nouter-continental-shelf. He has bluntly stated that the internal \ncombustion engine--the very mechanism which drove America's industrial \ndevelopment and led to the creation of our middle class--is a threat. \nMaybe that's why he embraces the Kyoto Protocol which would impose \nstaggering consumption restrictions on our economy, while exempting \nother countries. This treaty is so bad that my colleagues from Gore's \nown party joined the Senate leadership in voting against it 95 to zero. \nAl Gore may not depend on the internal combustion engine for his \nlivelihood, but a lot of folks beyond the Washington beltway do.\n\n  There has to be a solution to this problem. Even without tapping all \nof America's resources, this country still produces almost half of her \nfuel needs--far more than most industrial countries. In the long run, a \nnational energy policy that looks at all realistic alternative sources \nof energy must be developed. Congress must also provide incentives for \nindependent producers to keep their wells pumping. Tax credits for \nmarginal wells will restore our link to existing oil resources, \nincluding many in Mississippi. These solutions will be needed someday \nsoon.\n  In the short term, Congress can reduce or temporarily suspend federal \nfuel taxes, which, along with state excise taxes, account for an \naverage of 40 cents per gallon of gasoline. This would include the \n``Gore Fuel Tax'' ram-rodded by the President back in 1993 in a \ndecision so close that Al Gore headed to Capitol Hill to cast the tie-\nbreaking vote. Yes, the Vice-President is the very reason the 4.3 cent \ngas tax was implemented. Now, as the Administration continues to do \nnothing to remedy this crisis, the Congress can make a difference. \nRepealing the Gore Gas Tax immediately, and providing a complete \nfederal fuels tax holiday if prices reach a nationwide average of \n$2.00, will provide real relief for American consumers at the pump. \nThis can be done for the remainder of this year without touching one \ncent of the Highway Trust Fund, Social Security, or Medicare. This is a \nreal solution to a very real problem.\n  This reflects the leadership of a number of our colleagues on this \nimportant issue. One provision to suspend the diesel fuel tax has been \nchampioned by the senior Senator from Colorado, Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell. A trucker himself, Senator Campbell has led the way on ways \nto assist truckers and their families who are suffering from the rising \nprice of diesel fuel. He has met with the truckers who have traveled \ngreat distances to Washington to make their voices heard. Senator \nCampbell's unique insights and personal experiences have been helpful \nto the leadership in crafting this comprehensive gas tax bill.\n  This is not the 1970s. America has better technology, more efficient \nand cleaner automobiles as well as more energy options. The question \nis: how long will we hold these options and be held hostage to nations \nabroad or radical environmentalists at home? America can solve her \nenergy problems but Congress must act in the interests of our entire \nnation, rather than a select few.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to explain the procedural \nsituation we are in with regard to the motion to proceed on the so-\ncalled gas tax repeal. I could not be more strongly in opposition to \nthe repeal of the gas tax because of its potential to devastate our \nhighway and transit programs.\n  Nevertheless, I intend to support the motion to proceed this \nafternoon and I urge my colleagues on this side to do so for a couple \nof reasons.\n  First of all, it seems to me this ought to be a debate that we have \nearly next week. I think there are a lot of very important questions \nthat ought to be raised about the advisability of the repeal of the gas \ntax. I think Governors and those from industries that are involved in \nthe construction of our infrastructure this year ought to have the \nopportunity to be heard.\n  I will read for my colleagues some of the comments made by my \ncolleagues on the Republican side of the aisle with regard to the gas \ntax. I think they ought to be heard, as well.\n  Let me quote from Speaker Dennis Hastert, who on March 26, said:\n\n       But the problem is that this doesn't solve the problem. . \n     .that's just a little tick in what the cost of gas is. We \n     need to solve the real problems out there.\n\n  So said the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n  The House Transportation Committee chairman, Bud Shuster said:\n\n       Repeal of the fuel tax is the wrong way to go. [It's] \n     counterproductive because reducing a portion of the price \n     without reducing the underlying cost of crude oil makes it \n     easier for OPEC countries to keep prices high.\n\n  So says the chairman, the Republican chairman of the House \nTransportation Committee.\n  Here is what the House majority leader, Dick Armey said:\n\n       Let's not get bogged down on only one dimension of the \n     problem--a short-term dimension that offers scant relief. \n     Even if we repealed, that it would give little relief to \n     consumers.\n\n  Here is what my colleague, the very respected and distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, John Warner said:\n\n       Repealing the 4.3 cents will have little or no impact on \n     the price of fuel. It will, however, severely limit all of \n     our States' abilities to make needed surface transportation \n     improvements.\n\n  Here is what our colleague, Senator George Voinovich, said on March \n24:\n\n       Even with this repeal, there is no guarantee it is going to \n     bring down the cost at the pump. It defies common sense.\n\n  Here is what the GOP conference chair, J.C. Watts, said in the House \nof Representatives on March 19:\n\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\n\n       I don't know if the tax has any affect on fuel tax. Supply \n     and demand is driving price right now.\n\n  Finally, here is what Congressman Don Young said. He gets the award \nfor the bluntest assessment of the advisability of this particular \nlegislation.\n\n       Absolutely the dumbest thing ever thought of.\n\n  This ought to be debated. We ought to have a good discussion about \nits advisability. This is one of those rare occasions when I happen to \nbe on the same side as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the \nmajority leader on the House of Representatives, the conference chair \non the House of Representatives, Congressman Young from the House of \nRepresentatives, and some of my distinguished colleagues here in the \nSenate.\n  We ought to debate it. It ought to be amended. We don't oftentimes \nhave a vehicle that could be offered that will allow an opportunity to \ndebate energy and tax policy such as this. I am hoping we can offer \namendments to this bill and we would expect we would have the \nopportunity to do so. This is one of those rare occasions when many of \nour colleagues share the view expressed so powerfully and eloquently by \nour Republican colleagues.\n  I am not giving the credit they deserve to my Democratic colleagues \non the House side. I could come up with at least as long a list on that \nside.\n  We look forward to this debate. We are certainly not going to object \nat all to having the motion to proceed presented to us this afternoon.\n  We just want to get to the bill and have this debate. That is my \nreason for supporting the motion to proceed, to have a good debate, to \nensure the American people know what the implications of this \nparticular vote will be and the unusual coalition that has already been \ncreated in opposition to this repeal. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is not often that so many of my \ncolleagues come to the Senate floor in opposition to lowering a tax. \nThey do so and I join them today for good reason. The legislation to \nrepeal the 4.3 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline is a wolf in \nsheep's clothing.\n  In fact, several members on the other side of the aisle from House \nMajority Leader Dick Armey and Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, to \nHouse Transportation Chairman Shuster are opposed to this measure. The \nNational Governors Association has voiced its adamant opposition, as \nwell.\n  The proposal, S. 2285, is fiscally irresponsible and will not lead to \nlower gasoline prices for consumers. This measure could cause the state \nof Connecticut to lose more than $280 million to highway funds for FY \n2002 and 2003, in addition to hundreds of lost jobs as highway projects \nare put on hold or shelved indefinitely. Congress made a commitment to \nhelp states like Connecticut repair and maintain our highways and it \nshould not break that commitment.\n  Supporters of this legislation say they would tap the non-Social \nSecurity surplus to replace the lost tax revenues created by their \nproposal. That is a mistake. We should be directing the surplus to debt \nreduction, ensuring the solvency of Social Security, prescription \ndrugs, targeted tax cuts and investments in education and the \nenvironment.\n  The likelihood that any reduction in the Federal gasoline tax will \nreach consumers is unlikely. The tax is not imposed at the pump, but \nrather shortly after the gasoline leaves the refinery. The gasoline \ncould pass through several other entities before it reaches the pump \nand none of the middlemen would have to pass on the savings. The \nlegislation contains only a Sense of Congress that any benefits of the \ntax be passed on to consumers. Past experience in Connecticut has shown \nthat decreases in a fuel tax have not been passed on to motorists. In \n1997, gas prices shot up 11 cents in August despite a 3-cent cut in the \nstate gasoline tax that took effect on July 1.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that several states, including Arkansas, \nNevada, Oklahoma, California, and Tennessee, have laws that mandate an \nincrease in state gasoline taxes if the Federal rate decreases. \nObviously, a state's legislature can act to change its laws. But these \nlaws only underscore the complexity of gas pricing which the bill \nbefore us does not.\n  The cut could be another 18.3 cents per gallon for gasoline and more \nfor other oil-based fuels. The gasoline tax is dedicated revenue that \nwe use to maintain our highways. The loss of funds for highway \nimprovements and mass transit, the loss of jobs and the uncertainty--if \nnot unlikelihood--that a gas tax reduction would result in lower gas \nprices--make this bill unsound and unwise.\n  We all want to bring down the price of gasoline. Let's take \nresponsible steps to move in that direction. I commend the \nadministration for getting a commitment from the OPEC nations to \nincrease production. In addition, the administration has also proposed \ntax credits for energy-efficient homes and energy-efficient cars, \nfunding for the development of clean and renewable energy and the \nenactment of tax proposals to promote the use of alternative energy \nsources.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to \nproceed to invoke cloture on S. 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act \nof 2000, a bill introduced by Senator Lott which I have been pleased to \ncosponsor.\n  This legislation will repeal, until the end of this year, the 4.3 \ncent-per-gallon increase to the federal excise tax on gasoline, diesel, \nkerosene, and aviation fuel added by the Clinton Administration in \n1993.\n  Also, our legislation is set up so that should the national average \nfor regular unleaded gasoline prices breach the $2 mark, it would also \nrepeal, until the end of the year, the 18.3 cent-per-gallon federal \ngasoline tax; the 24.3 cent-per-gallon excise tax on highway diesel \nfuel and kerosene; the 4.3 cents per-gallon railroad diesel fuel; the \n24.3 cent-per-gallon excise tax on inland waterway fuel; the 19.3 cent-\nper-gallon for noncommercial aviation gasoline; the 21.8 cent-per-\ngallon for noncommercial jet fuel; and 4.3 cents-per-gallon for \ncommercial aviation fuel.\n  This will provide the nation with a vital ``circuit breaker'' in the \nmidst of the very real possibility of skyrocketing fuel costs as \nAmerica takes to the road this summer--and the legislation ensures that \nany savings will truly be passed on to consumers and not pocketed \nbefore customers can benefit from the savings at the pump.\n  Some of my colleagues say this will not amount to enough savings for \nthe consumers to even care about. Well, I guess my constituents in \nMaine are more thrifty than others, especially after a winter of paying \nthe highest prices in decades for both home heating oil and high gas \nprices at the pump.\n  At the same time, it allows reimbursement of the Highway Trust Fund, \nwhich is financed by the gasoline tax, and the Airport and Airways \nTrust Fund, financed by the aviation fuel tax. Both these funds are \nheld completely harmless, with any lost revenues to be replaced from \nthe budget surplus. No one should have any concerns about the impact \nthis bill would have on the progress of important highway and airport \nprojects because the impact would be zero.\n  This legislation takes a concrete step toward more reasonable fuel \nprices, helping to serve as a buffer for consumers who are already \nreeling from the high cost of gasoline and other fuels. Of course, I \nhope the provisions for temporary repeal of the full tax will not be \nnecessary. But if they are, they will provide immediate relief to \ntaxpayers and ensure that, if prices are skyrocketing, any savings in \nfuel costs will be passed on to consumers.\n  The retail price we pay for refined petroleum products for gasoline, \ndiesel fuel, and home heating oil, for instance, substantially depends \nupon the cost of crude oil to refiners. We have seen a barrel of crude \noil climb to over $35.00 recently from a price of $10.50 in February of \n1999. That is a 145 percent increase. And while OPEC agreed this week \nto only very modest increases in crude oil production, White House \nofficials say that the cost of gasoline at the pump will now decline in \nthe coming months, even though their own Economic Advisor Gene Sperling \nwas quoted in the Washington Post on March 29, as warning that ``there \nis still significant and inherent uncertainty in the oil market, \nparticularly with such low inventories, and we will continue to monitor \nthe situation very closely''.\n\n  Mr. President, while the Administration has ``monitored'' the \nsituation, crude oil prices have gone up and up,\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\nand our inventories went down. As a matter of fact, the Administration \nadmits that it was ``caught napping'' after OPEC decided to decrease \nproduction in March of 1999--and while they napped through a long \nwinter's sleep, prices for crude climbed as temperatures plummeted.\n  The effect on gasoline, diesel and home heating oil was predictable, \nand in fact was predicted. Last October--a half a year ago--the \nDepartment of Energy, in its 1999-2000 Winter Fuels Outlook, projected \na 44 percent increase in home heating oil bills. In a severe winter, \nthe agency estimated, an additional 28 percent increase in costs could \nbe felt for residential customers.\n  In other words, the Department of Energy itself predicted an increase \nof over 70 percent, but did nothing. In actuality, home heating oil \ncosts jumped from a fairly consistent national of 86 cents per gallon \nin the winter of 1998-99 to as high as $2.08 per gallon in Maine early \nlast month--an increase of well over 100 percent. And, in that same \ntime frame, conventional gasoline prices have risen 70 percent or \nhigher.\n  So now the Administration tells us that gasoline prices will most \nlikely go down by this summer because of the small production increases \nagreed to by OPEC. Well, even with an increase in OPEC quotas, there \nwill still be a shortfall in meeting worldwide demand for crude oil. \nApproximately 76.3 million barrels per day are needed to meet demand, \nbut the anticipated new OPEC production is estimated to be only 75.3 \nmillion barrels per day. So you'll have to excuse me if I'm a little \nhesitant accepting estimates from an Administration that seems to make \npredictions by gazing into a crystal ball. I want to at least make sure \nthat Americans have in their pockets what they would have otherwise \npaid in fuel taxes if the Administration underestimates prices once \nagain and gasoline hits $2.00 a gallon.\n  Beyond the pump, consumers are getting hit with extra costs directly \nattributable to high fuel costs. If you've paid to send an overnight \npackage lately, you probably noted that you were charged a fuel fee, \nbecause their cost of diesel fuel has increased by about 60 percent \nover the past year. And with a 150 percent increase in jet fuel, that \nairline ticket you buy today will probably include something you've \nnever seen before--a fuel charge of $20.00. How long will it be before \ncosts of other products will also be passed on the consumer?\n  And, consider the impacts to the nations' farmers. The New York Times \nreported just this past Wednesday that a farmer paying 40 cents a \ngallon more this year to fuel his diesel tractors and combines is \nadding as much as $240 a day to his harvesting costs. In my home state \nof Maine, we are at the peak season for moving last year's potato crop \nout of storage and to the large Eastern markets. But the industry can't \nget truckers to come into the State to move the potatoes because they \nare discouraged by the particularly high price of diesel in Maine.\n  The only help the potato industry has had recently in getting their \nproduct to market has certainly not been due to the energy policy of \nthis Administration, but to local truckers who have turned to hauling \npotatoes because the recent wet weather has kept them away from taking \ntimber out of the Maine woods.\n  Soon, we will enter the summer months, when tourism is particularly \nimportant to the economy of New England and to Maine in particular. \nWith gas prices climbing even higher, we need relief now, and that's \nwhat this bill provides.\n  Mr. President, the choices are clear--do nothing for the taxpayers \nwho are being gouged by failed energy policies, or do something by \nsupporting legislation that acts as a circuit breaker that gives \ncitizens a break at the gas pump, protects the Trust Funds that build \nour highways and airports, I urge my colleagues to support this bill \nand I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to the Gas Tax Repeal Act, S. 2285:\n         Trent Lott, Frank H.

Mr. President, sadly this week the Senate has lost \nanother member of our family. On Monday, Larry Harrison, a retired \nSenate staffer, passed away in Washington, DC. Before his retirement in \nJune of 1997, Larry had over 36 years of Federal service.\n  Most of my colleagues will remember Larry's hard work as a Chamber \nattendant. His dedication to the upkeep of the Chamber and the \nsurrounding rooms will be remembered. On Tuesday evening, former \nSenator Bob Dole fondly remembered Larry during the Leader's Lecture \nSeries.\n  Like many of the support staff who work for this institution, Larry \narrived at work long before the Senate convened and frequently left the \nChamber long after adjournment.\n  Many Senators will recall Larry's passion for golf. I certainly do. \nAs a matter of fact, Larry was one of the founders of the ``Cloakroom \nOpen.'' This golf tournament was organized by Larry to enable many of \nthe Senate staff who work around the Senate Chamber an opportunity to \nplay a round of golf together. It was a chance for a little camaraderie \nwithout the discussion of party or politics.\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\n  Many may know that Larry's step son, Mike Henry, also works for the \nSenate and has worked for the Senate for a long time. I have had the \npleasure of knowing Mike. I think highly of Mike and his family. Mike's \nwife, Cookie, also works for the House of Representatives. This is a \nfamily who has dedicated decades of service to the Congress and to the \nSenate.\n  I join with all of my colleagues in expressing sympathy to Larry's \nfamily and our hearts and prayers go out to them at this time. I know \nall Members will join me in saying, ``Thank you, Larry, for your \nservice, and keep hitting 'em straight.''\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate recently lost a very dear \nfriend. Larry Harrison, who worked in the Capitol for over 36 years \nprior to his retirement in 1997, died early this week. Larry's many \nyears of dedicated and distinguished work made him an institution \nwithin this institution. It was tough on all of us when he retired a \nfew years ago, but it is much more difficult to say goodbye to him \ntoday.\n  Larry served this country and the Senate in a variety of ways for \nnearly four decades. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, \nparticipating in the D-Day invasion at Normandy, and following the war \nworked for the Architect of the Capitol for five years. Larry returned \nto the Capitol to work for the Sergeant at Arms in 1967. He stayed \nthere until 1997, outlasting all but five of the Senators who were \nserving in this chamber when he started.\n  Larry had an extraordinary work ethic, and he committed himself to \nhis job with tremendous pride, energy, and humor. During his time in \nthe Capitol, Larry was responsible for maintaining the President's \nRoom, the Cloakroom, and the Senate Chamber. Somehow, he even found \ntime to operate a shoe shine station in the Senator's bathroom, and I \nknow I speak for everyone when I say that this place hasn't been the \nsame without Larry's friendly smile and kind voice.\n  When he retired in 1997, our loss was his family's gain. His wife, \nJean, and sons, Michael Henry, Albert Philips and Kevin Harrison got \ntheir husband and father back full-time. Sadly, their time with him has \nnow been cut all too short.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Larry Harrison's friends and \nfamily, especially his wife, Jean, and their three sons. Larry was a \ngood man, a caring husband, and great father. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1971-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I draw the attention of the Senate to \na timely Opinion-Editorial, written by former Ambassador Leonard \nWoodcock, that appeared in the March 9, 2000 Los Angeles Times. Long a \nchampion of workers' welfare and workers' rights, Ambassador Woodcock \nwas also the first United States Ambassador's to the People's Republic \nof China.\n  Ambassador Woodcock lays out, in a clear and well-reasoned manner, \npowerful arguments showing how the United States will benefit from \nestablishing permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China, and \nwhy it is in our interest to see China in the World Trade Organization \n(WTO). Equally important, the author forces those who profess a concern \nfor Chinese workers' rights to take a realistic look at how our \ndecision concerning China PNTR will help or harm workers in China.\n  I comment Ambassador Woodcock's thought-provoking commentary to all \nmy colleagues in the Congress and, even more, to all persons interested \nin understanding the basics of the U.S.-China PNTR debate. I ask \nunanimous consent that Ambassador Woodcock's Opinion-Editorial be \nprinted in the Congressional Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Evolution Doesn't Occur Overnight\n\n     WTO agreement: Organized labor should support it. It's in \n         both U.S. and Chinese interests.\n\n                         (By Leonard Woodcock)\n\n       The recent U.S.-China World Trade Organization bilateral \n     accession agreement appears to be good for workers in both \n     countries. I was privileged, as U.S. ambassador to China, to \n     sign the 1979 trade agreement that provided for most-favored-\n     nation trade status to China and have, as a private citizen, \n     been involved with this issue for many years.\n       American labor has a tremendous interest in China's trading \n     on fair terms with the U.S. The agreement we signed with \n     China this past November marks the largest single step ever \n     taken toward achieving that goal. The agreement expands \n     American jobs. And while China already enjoys WTO-based \n     access to our economy, this agreement will open China's \n     economy to unprecedented levels of American exports, many of \n     which are high-quality goods produced by high-paying jobs.\n       There is reason to fear unfair trade practices. Yet this \n     agreement actually provides better protections than our \n     existing laws allow. It stipulates 12 years of protections \n     against market surges and provides unusually strong anti-\n     dumping laws--which aim to counter unfairly priced imports--\n     for 15 years.\n       I have, therefore, been startled by organized labor's \n     vociferous negative reaction to this agreement. The reality \n     is that the U.S. as a whole benefits mightily from this \n     historic accord. The AFL-CIO argues that nothing in this \n     agreement demands that free trade unions be formed in China. \n     Yet the WTO does not require this of any of its 136 member \n     countries, and the WTO is the wrong instrument to use to \n     achieve unionization.\n       We should, instead, be asking a more important question. \n     Are Chinese workers better off with or without this \n     agreement? The answer is that this agreement, in a variety of \n     ways, will be enormously beneficial to Chinese workers.\n       On a subtle level, the changes the agreement requires of \n     China's economic system will work in favor of investment by \n     Western firms and take away some of the key advantages Asian \n     firms now enjoy in China. Every survey has demonstrated that \n     working conditions and environmental standards in plants \n     run by West European and North American firms are usually \n     better than those in Asian and in indigenous Chinese \n     firms.\n       The greater foreign presence also will expose Chinese \n     workers to more ideas about organization and rights. That is \n     perhaps one reason why almost every Chinese political \n     dissident who has spoken on this issue has called the United \n     States-China WTO agreement good news for freedom in China.\n       The trade deficit with China is a troublesome one to the \n     labor movement. We need to put it in perspective in two ways. \n     First, if we were to block access of goods from China to the \n     United States, this would not increase American jobs. That is \n     because the Chinese exports--mostly toys, tools, apparel, \n     cheap electronics, etc.--would be produced in other low-wage \n     countries, not in the United States. Yet if China stopped \n     buying from us, we would lose about 400,000 jobs, mostly \n     high-wage.\n       Second, a large portion of exports from ``China'' are goods \n     produced in the main in Hong Kong. Taiwan and Southeast Asia. \n     The major components are then shipped to China for final \n     assembly and packaging, but the entire cost of the item \n     (often only 15% of which was contributed in China) is \n     attributed to China's export ledger. Exports to the United \n     States from Hong Kong and Taiwan have declined over the past \n     decade almost as fast as imports from China have increased. \n     Yet the companies making the profits are in Hong Kong and \n     Taiwan, and they will simply shift their operations to \n     Vietnam or elsewhere if we close down exports from China.\n       Americans are broadly concerned about the rights and \n     quality of life of Chinese citizens. My perspective on this \n     serious issue is influenced by my experience in the U.S. In \n     my lifetime, women were not allowed the vote, and labor was \n     not allowed to organize. And, in my lifetime, although the \n     law did\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\n     not permit lynching, it was protected and carried out by \n     legal officeholders. As time passed, we made progress, and I \n     doubt if lectures or threats from foreigners would have moved \n     things faster.\n       Democracy, including rights for workers, is an evolutionary \n     process. Isolation and containment will not promote improved \n     rights for a people. Rather, working together and from within \n     a society will, over time, promote improved conditions. The \n     United States-China WTO agreement will speed up the \n     evolutionary process in China. American labor should support \n     it because it is in our interest, and it is the interests of \n     Chinese workers too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1972-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RYAN WHITE COMPREHENSIVE AIDS RESOURCES EMERGENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss a \nreauthorization bill introduced yesterday by Senators Jeffords and \nKennedy, the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000, S. 2311. This \nlegislation is very important in that it will help to continue to \nimprove the quality and availability of care for low-income, uninsured, \nand under insured individuals and families affected by AIDS and HIV \ndisease. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this initiative.\n  Ryan White died on April 8, 1990 at age 18. He was a prime example of \nsomeone whose own community rejected him when he was only 13 years old \nbecause of his health status. As a result of his courageous battle to \nattend public school in Indiana, we all learned and understood more \nabout AIDS. Ryan White played a major role in changing people's views \nconcerning the disease and AIDS patients. Through his actions, he \nconveyed the importance of education and awareness to combat the spread \nof this deadly disease. Even after his death, the story of his \ncourageous battle with AIDS continues to impact the common man. His \nlegacy lives on through the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  This reauthorization provides us the opportunity to improve this \nbipartisan legislation to adequately care for those persons affected \nwith AIDS and HIV. As noted by Ryan's mother, Jeanne, ``We have come a \nlong way since Ryan's death, but we still have so far to go.'' Although \nthe number of AIDS cases continues to decline each year, the number of \nHIV-positive individuals continues to grow at an alarming rate. This \nlegislation would expand the duties of the Planning Council, provide \nfor a Quality Management Program, establish requirements for heath care \nreferral relationships, fund early intervention services, and improve \nresources for infants, children, and women. Until a cure is found, the \nRyan White CARE Act will continue to be the ``payer of last resort'' \nfor thousands of individuals who otherwise cannot afford health care or \nbasic subsistence needs. In my home State of Rhode Island, $3,463,706 \nof Ryan White CARE funding was provided during fiscal year 1999 to \nensure access to life-sustaining drugs and other critical health and \nsocial services for those individuals affected with AIDS and HIV.\n  Because AIDS and HIV is a national problem, it deserves national \nattention. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to make further \nenhancements and improvements to the bill. Specifically, I understand \nmy colleague, Senator Bingaman, has been working on a provision that \nwould allow more states to have access to dental care grant funding \nunder Part F of the act. I believe this is a very important issue for \nindividuals with HIV and AIDS and hope this provision will be \nincorporated into the overall bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1972-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1972-S1973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANTI-DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the \ndramatically deteriorating situation in Belarus. As of Sunday, March \n26, more than 100 opposition activists remained in custody after a \nrally on Saturday that turned from a peaceful event into a \ndemonstration that saw police clubbing protesters with nightsticks, \nhitting journalists covering the event and sending armored cars into \nCentral Minsk. More than 500 people were detained, most of whom were \nnot formally charged until Monday. This is only one of the examples of \nhow, in Belarus, the Lukashenka regime continues to try to suppress the \nwill of the people.\n  In November, Senator Campbell and I introduced a resolution \ncondemning the Lukashenka regime and its actions towards the country. \nThe sad reality is that Belarus is being left behind while the rest of \nEurope is building a foundation of democratic governance, respect for \nhuman rights, and the rule of law.\n  Since 1996, President Lukashenka has been responsible for numerous \nunconstitutional steps. He unilaterally extended his term until 2001 \nafter he promised to hold democratic elections in 1999. He replaced the \n13th Supreme Soviet with a rubberstamp parliament and he rewrote the \ncountry's constitution.\n  Belarus has turned into a country where those who choose to \nparticipate in civil society by speaking truth to power must do so at \ngreat risk to their freedom, and even their lives, under Lukashenka's \nrule. Two prominent opposition figures--General Yuri Zakharenko and \nViktor Gonchar--as well as another associate, Anatoly Krasovsky, have \ndisappeared. Many of the people arrested on March 25 as well as other \npeaceful protesters were members of the opposition.\n  Belarus' economy is apparently imploding and neighboring countries, \nPoland, Lithuania, and Latvia, are concerned about regional \ninstability.\n  Our resolution condemns the arrest of opposition figures and the \ndisappearance of others; calls for a dialogue between Lukashenka and \nthe opposition; calls for the restoration of a democratically-elected \ngovernment and democratic institutions; calls on the U.S. President to \nfund travel by Belarusian opposition figures and non-governmental \norganizations in Belarus; and supports information flows into Belarus.\n  Belarus is not making progress. We must do what we can to sustain the \nremarkable progress of the other countries that have transformed \nthemselves into fully democratic market democracies, and encourage the \ndevelopment of a democracy in Belarus.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on March 25, Belarusian authorities \nharshly suppressed a pro-democracy demonstration in the capital of \nMinsk, arresting and detaining hundreds of peaceful protestors, \nincluding nearly 30 domestic and foreign journalists. Riot police, \ndeployed with dogs and armored personnel carriers, used excessive force \nagainst some peaceful demonstrators.\n  Among those detained and beaten was democratic opposition leader \nAnatoly Lebedka, Deputy Chairman of the 13th Supreme Soviet. Many of my \nSenate colleagues met Mr. Lebedka last September when I introduced him \nright here on the Senate floor. Mr. Lebedka was just in Washington \nearlier this month to testify at a Helsinki Commission hearing about \nthe deteriorating situation in Belarus.\n  Based on information I obtained from the State Department, I am \nadvised that Anatoly Lebedka was arrested by plainclothes police during \nthe demonstration, kept in detention, and reportedly beaten over the \ncourse of two days. He spent most of Monday in a police van outside the \ncourthouse awaiting trial, but was released at 5:00 p.m. His trial has \nbeen scheduled for April 4.\n  Mr. President, the harsh overreaction by the authorities to this \npeaceful demonstration represents a clear violation of the freedom of \nassociation, assembly, and information guaranteed both by the \nBelarusian constitution and OSCE agreements. In addition, the \nBelarusian authorities detained a U.S. citizen who is an accredited \ndiplomat and a member of the OSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group in \nBelarus, and who was observing the demonstration in line with his \nofficial responsibilities. This action also violates international \nconventions.\n  It appears that the green light for the most recent crackdown was \ngiven by Belarusian President Lukashenka, who praised the police for \ntheir actions. Reports indicate that earlier this month, he cautioned \nthat the riot police will ``beat the stuffing out'' of any protestor \nwho ``gets out of line.''\n  Unfortunately, the suppression by the Belarusian authorities of \npeaceful protest, along with the sentencing last week of a prominent \nmember of the opposition, does nothing to encourage a constructive \ndialogue with the democratic opposition that can lead Belarus\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\nout of its continuing constitutional impasse and end its self-imposed \ninternational isolation.\n  Mr. President, I call upon the Government of Belarus to thoroughly \ninvestigate reports of police brutality during the course of the \ndemonstration and subsequent detentions and take measures to ensure \nthat citizens are guaranteed their rights to engage in peaceful \nprotests, keeping with that country's OSCE commitments.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Durbin as an original cosponsor to \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 75 which we introduced last November. That \nresolution summarized many of the political problems facing the \ndemocratic opposition in Belarus expressing strong opposition to the \ncontinued egregious violations of human rights, the lack of progress \ntoward the establishment of democracy and the rule of law in Belarus, \nand calls on President Lukashenka to engage in negotiations with the \nrepresentatives of the opposition and to restore the constitutional \nrights of the Belarusian people.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss an \ninjustice to a group of Central American and Caribbean nationals who \nfor many years have resided in the United States. As I speak, a clock \nis ticking. A deadline to gain legal status in the United States is one \nday away. How did we get to this point?\n  In 1997 and 1998, Congress passed legislation to protect Central \nAmerican, Cuban and Haitian refugees from deportation. Action was \nneeded because of the passage of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Immigrant Responsibility Act which changed immigration rules \nretroactively. Under the Presidency of Ronald Reagan, the United States \noffered protection and legal status to many Central American nationals \nwho were fighting for Democracy in their home country, or fleeing the \nwar that ensued.\n  Similarly, during the Presidency of George Bush, Haitian nationals \nwere forced to flee after the overthrow of elected President Jean \nBertrand Aristide. They were offered protection and legal status in the \nUnited States.\n  By 1996, these Central American and Haitian nationals had been living \nin our nation for years, in the cases of Central Americans, often \nlonger than a decade. They established businesses, had families, bought \nhomes, and strengthened their communities.\n  Then, in 1996, with the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act, these Central American and Haitian \nIndividuals and families were made retroactively deportable. These \ndeportations would have occurred years and years after these nationals \nhad established full lives in the United States.\n  Congress protected their legal status here by passing the Nicaraguan \nAdjustment and Central American Relief Act in November of 1997 and the \nHaitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act in October of 1998 by making \ncertain sections of the 1996 immigration law non-retroactive.\n  Since 1997, we have waited for final regulations to guide applicants \nthrough the process of applying for relief under NACARA. Since 1998, we \nhave waited for final regulations to assist Haitian nationals with this \nprocess. And now, seven days before the application deadline, final \nregulations are issued. This is not an example of ``good government.''\n  Under legislation I introduced in February, the new deadline for \nrelief will be one year after the date the regulations became final. \nThis new deadline, March 23, 2001, reflects the added time needed by \nthe INS to develop regulation. This will not cover any additional \nindividuals who will then have rights to live in the United States. It \njust creates a more realistic, and fair deadline for individuals \nCongress has already passed legislation to protect.\n  We are now one day away from the deadline coming and going, and the \nSenate has yet to take action on this legislation. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will not be able to meet this week to approve this \nlegislation. We cannot purport to offer our constituents good and fair \ngovernment if we let this deadline come and go without the simple \naction of extending the deadline by one year. When I spoke on the \nSenate Floor earlier this year, I tried to put a human story with this \nlegislation. It's her story, and others, that should spur us to action \non this legislation.\n  Immigration attorneys in Florida are trying to help a young woman I \nwill call ``Francis.'' She is 22 years old this year. Her parents fled \nHaiti in the 1980's when she was very young. Her family settled in \nFlorida and she now has 3 U.S. citizen brothers and sisters.\n  Then tragedy struck her family. Her father died when she was seven. \nHer mother died when she was in her early teens. She finished high \nschool and is raising her younger brothers and sisters while working. \nShe is an orphan, protected by our 1998 legislation.\n  She is trying to pull the documents together to apply to stay in the \nUnited States, and not be separated from her U.S. citizen brothers and \nsisters--the only family she has left. The 1-year extension and the \nability to apply for relief under final regulations will make a huge \ndifference in the life of this young woman.\n  I ask for the Senate's quick action on this timely and important \nmatter. Many in the Senate worked diligently to protect Cuban, Haitian \nand Nicaraguan nationals in the original legislation. Let's not put \nthese families at risk by our failure to act now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1973-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1973-S1974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORKER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we often hear about some of the things \nthat are wrong with intercollegiate athletics and how they sometimes \ndetract from the top priority of our colleges and universities, which \nis educating students.\n  Let me point to an example of how excellence in undergraduate \neducation and excellence in intercollegiate athletics can go hand-in-\nhand, and it's from my home state of Iowa.\n  Iowa State University is experiencing one of its most successful \nyears ever in intercollegiate athletics.\n  This year, Iowa State made history by being the first university in \nthe Big 12 Conference or its predecessor conferences--the Big 8 and the \nSouthwest Conferences--to win four basketball trophies in one season--\nboth men's and women's regular season and conference tournament \nchampionships.\n  Both teams earned ISU record-high seedings in the NCAA Tournament, \nthe men took a second seed and the women took a third and both did well \nin the tournament. The men advanced to the ``Elite Eight'' and the \nwomen to the ``Sweet Sixteen'' after an ``Elite Eight' appearance last \nyear.\n  Marcus Fizer became the schools' first-ever consensus first-team All-\nAmerican, and Stacy Frese and Angie Welle of the women's team were also \nAll-America selections. Stacy Frese drew this honor for the second year \nin a row.\n  The Cyclone wrestling team--led by two-time NCAA champion and \ntournament MVP Cael Sanderson--finished second in the nation.\n  The women's gymnastics team won its first-ever Big 12 Conference \nChampionship.\n  These are just a few of Iowa State's 450 student-athletes, young \npeople who are getting an education while exhibiting their special \nathletic skills.\n  And just how are they using this opportunity?\n  Here are some examples from last year because the final stats from \nthis year aren't in, but I'm told they will be similar--or even better.\n  Of the 450 student athletes 168, or 40 percent, made the Athletic \nDepartment's Academic Honor Roll for maintaining a ``B'' or better GPA \nand nearly 100 earned academic All-Big 12 recognition.\n  This year, basketball player Paul Shirley, who majors in mechanical \nengineering, and Stacy Frese, a finance major, are again Academic All-\nAmericans.\n  Iowa State student-athletes also lead the Big 12 in the most \nimportant statistic--their graduation rate.\n  They are No. 1 in the Big 12 regarding their four-year graduation \nrates and No. 1 regarding their six-year graduation rates two of the \npast three reporting periods.\n  Iowa State student athletes are also No. 1 in terms of overall \ngraduation rate for student-athletes who stay in school for their \nentire eligibility with 9 of out 10 student athletes getting their \ndegree.\n  We are all very proud of the Cyclones this year for what they have \ndone in competition, and in the classroom. I hope I have the \nopportunity to come to the floor and offer the same statistics and \nfacts next year. Go Cyclones!\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1974-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1974-S1976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE MARRIAGE PENALTY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \nthe marriage penalty and progress that has been made today on getting \nthis important tax relief out across the country.\n  First, I applaud Chairman Roth for his work on this important issue. \nJust today, the Senate Finance Committee considered an important bill \nto provide marriage penalty relief. This bill would provide relief to \nmillions of American families--around 25 million--suffering under the \nburden of a marriage penalty.\n  The proposal considered by the Senate Finance Committee passed today. \nWe are now another step closer to getting this to the floor, which I \nbelieve will take place sometime during the week of April 11, to be \nable to consider providing this important tax relief to the American \npublic. I am delighted that that bill cleared through the Senate \nFinance Committee today.\n  The Senate Finance Committee used the House-passed version as a base, \nupon which it built an even broader and more inclusive bill. Our bill \nrestores fairness and equity to a Tax Code that has come to penalize \nthe institution of marriage in over 66 different ways. That is pretty \nimaginative, to find that many ways, but it is in there.\n  First, our bill eliminates the marriage penalty in the standard \ndeduction. I want to give the numbers. The standard deduction this year \nfor a single taxpayer is $4,400. However, for a married couple filing \njointly, the standard deduction is only $7,350--not even twice the \namount for single filers.\n  Our bill does a simple, clear, and just thing. Our bill doubles the \nstandard deduction by making it $8,800. This change in the tax law \nwould take place beginning in 2001, by immediately doubling the \nstandard deduction for joint filers. Our bill is fair. That is the fair \nthing to do. It is the right thing to do.\n  Second, our bill widens the 15-percent tax bracket. Under current \nlaw, the 15-percent tax bracket for a single taxpayer ends at an income \nthreshold of $26,250. I know these are a lot of numbers, but it is \nimportant to show the specifics of the Tax Code and where it penalizes \nmarriage and how we are fixing it.\n  For a married couple, their bracket is less than double this \nthreshold of $26,250. In fact, the threshold is $43,850 for a married \ncouple filing jointly--another penalty.\n  If our bill were fully phased in this year, it would mean that the \n15-percent bracket would extend upward to an income amount of $52,500. \nSo for a married couple filing jointly, instead of having a $43,850 \nthreshold level, it goes up to $52,500. It doubles what it is for a \nsingle filer. This is real marriage penalty relief and elimination. It \nis relief because even income earners above the current upper income \nthreshold for the 15-percent bracket--these are the upper income levels \nof the 15-percent bracket--will be able to fall down through\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\nthe brackets and thus lower their total tax liability. It is \nelimination because it doubles the bracket, thus eliminating the \nmarriage penalty in the 15-percent bracket. Again, what we are after is \nto make everything equal. If you have two single filers or if you have \na married couple both filing, they should pay the same amount in taxes. \nThat is what we are trying to get at with this marriage penalty \nelimination.\n\n  It will benefit those people hit by this marriage penalty. It is \ngoing to lower the taxes for America's families. That is important. It \nis also equitable.\n  Third, our bill applies the same principle of bracket widening to the \n28-percent bracket as well. We are just talking about the 15-percent \nbracket, doubling that $26,250 to $52,500 instead of the current level \nof $43,850 for a married couple. That is the 15-percent bracket, the \nupper end of it. We would also do it for the 28-percent bracket, the \n28-percent bracket as applied to singles earning between $26,250 to \n$63,550. That $63,550 is the upper level of the 28-percent bracket.\n  As in the 15-percent bracket, this amount is not double for joint \nfilers for married couples. You don't get a doubling amount. You \nactually get cut back from that. Under our marriage penalty relief \nbill, it is double. That level at which you can stay in the 28-percent \nbracket as a married couple filing joint would be exactly double what \nyou were as a single person. So again, we just make it equitable and \nfair. If it is two people filing singly or if it is a couple filing \njointly, it will be the same taxable event. That is fair. That is \nequitable.\n  Fourth, our bill increases the phaseout range for the earned-income \ntax credit. This is an important feature. Particularly for low-income \nfamilies with children, they can incur a significant marriage penalty \nbecause of current limits on the earned-income tax credit. If both \nspouses work, the phaseout of the EITC on the basis of their combined \nincome can lead to the loss of some or all of the EITC benefits to \nwhich they would be entitled as singles. In other words, if you have \ntwo people filing singly, they would be entitled to a certain amount of \nearned-income tax credit. But if you combine their incomes, you don't \nget the same amount of earned-income tax credit for the couple as you \ndo for two singles. Our bill fixes that problem as well.\n  The Senate Finance Committee proposal increases the beginning and \nending points of the phaseout range by $2,500. This change will be \neffective December 31, 2000. This will mean families who currently are \nineligible for the credit but within the $2,500 of eligibility will be \nable to receive the refundable EITC. This will reduce the marriage \npenalty EITC.\n  As I mentioned, the marriage penalty is 66 places in the Tax Code. We \nare getting at some of the most pernicious areas. For the earned-income \ntax credit, if you are a two-wage earner family and you should have \nboth been able to qualify for the EITC, once you get married you should \nhave the same amount of EITC available to your family. This \nparticularly applies to lower income families. It is an important thing \nthat we are doing. We fix this in our bill.\n  Our bill helps families at all income levels: low income, middle \nincome, on up.\n\n  Finally, our bill would permanently extend the provision that allows \nthe personal nonrefundable credits to offset both the regular tax and \nthe minimum tax. It is important that America's families receive the \nfull benefit of the tax cuts they were promised. This important change \nwill allow America's families to maintain the $500-per-child tax \ncredit, the Hope scholarship, the adoption credit, and many others that \nthey would not be able to unless we change this particular area of the \nmarriage penalty that applies as well.\n  Our bill provides fairness and equity. It provides hard-working \nAmerican families with the tax relief they deserve.\n  Those are some of the specifics of the bill. I think this is an \nexcellent bill in fixing some of these key areas of the marriage \npenalty. I think we have outlined previously the reasons for doing it. \nIt is not fair to tax people because they get married and make them pay \na penalty for the price of being married.\n  More important, marriage is important. We should send a positive \nsignal that this is a good thing. Stable families are important. Our \napproach also recognizes that every spouse has a great contribution \nthat they make. At the same time our approach reduces and eliminates \nthe marriage penalty for many filers, it sends an important signal to \nall of America that we recognize the institution of marriage and we \nintend to promote it as a fundamental building block of our society.\n  I am hopeful this bill is going to be considered on the floor with a \nreasoned debate and not be too burdened down with amendments that are \nnot germane and that we will be able to provide this marriage penalty \nrelief to the millions of Americans, around 25 million married couples, \nwho are currently adversely affected by the Tax Code.\n  There is more to do. The marriage penalty is in 66 different places. \nWe only get at a few of them, but we get at some important ones. \nToday's is an important step by the Finance Committee to report this \nbill out. I think it is a clear and an important step towards our \nultimate goal of getting this through the Senate, the conference \nbetween the House and the Senate, and to the President where I urge his \nsignature. We must pass this important bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Chair \nfor his important remarks on the details of the legislation that came \nout of the Senate Finance Committee today. That legislation takes a big \nstep forward and basically eliminates the marriage penalty that exists \nin our tax law today.\n  Chairman Roth has been a champion of improving our Tax Code. I am \npleased to see that he has moved this legislation. It is something I \nknow the Chair and I have advocated for a long time, as have many \nothers in this body. We need to look at our policy in America and see \nif it is actually affirming the values we hold dear: Particularly, are \nwe setting governmental policy in this country that damages families? \nIs that one of the reasons for the breakup of families in this country? \nI think it needs to be considered. I believe it is a matter of \nimportance.\n  Good public policy is what we are about. We need to spend more time \nasking ourselves what is going to happen when we pass certain \nlegislation. All of us agree that when you tax an item, a process, or \nan act, you get less of it. If you subsidize another act or process, \nyou get more of it. That is just fundamental economics on which almost \neverybody would agree.\n  What we have in the marriage penalty is an amazing event. In this \nGovernment, we have created, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, a tax burden of nearly $1,400 per married couple. If they are \nliving separately, they will pay $1,400 on average less than if they \nare married. That is an amazing event. I happen to know someone who got \ndivorced recently. When they divorced, they said their tax bill went \ndown $1,600. Had they divorced in December instead of January, they \nwould have had an extra $1,600 from that year's return. We have the \nincredible, amazing event in which Federal tax policy encourages family \nbreakup. It provides a bonus--$1,600 a year--as long as they remain \nsingle, for example. That is the kind of policy that we have created \nhere.\n\n  Likewise, people who marry are penalized. I know a young person that \nmarried recently. He and his wife both work. They believe it will cost \nthem over $1,000 a year to get married. This is $100 a month we are \ntalking about. We are talking about people being taxed an additional \n$100 a month for following through on an institution that this Nation \ntraditionally--before we got into this matter--venerated, and that is \nmarriage and family. So I think this is a big deal. It is a very big \ndeal. It is bad public policy. It is wrong. It is unfair. We should not \ncontinue this policy and we need to end it now. I believe we are on the \nroad to achieving that. I am excited about it. Some time ago, we \nrealized that we\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\nwere not increasing the deductions for families who had children and \nthat young families were struggling to raise children.\n  This tax bill doesn't deal with children, just marriage. We had a \nlong struggle, but we finally passed a $500 per child tax credit for \nyoung families trying to raise kids. For two kids, that is $1,000 a \nyear, and nearly $85 a month. Parents can buy shoes and clothes, take \nthe kids to the movies, buy something after ball practice at \nMcDonald's. That is real money to real American citizens. Now we are \ntalking here about another $100 a month, on average, or $110, $120 a \nmonth that married people are having to pay for the privilege of \ngetting married. That should not be. It is a punishing and unfair tax. \nFurthermore, it should not, in my view, be based on income. Just \nbecause you make a little more money than somebody else, why should you \nbe penalized for getting married? That doesn't make sense to me. This \nis not, in my view, a tax reduction issue so much as it is a fairness \nissue. Let's eliminate this unfairness. I am excited about what is \nhappening here. Families will be able to buy that new dress, buy tires \nfor their car, or fix the muffler, or get a new set of shocks, things \nthey may need on a monthly basis--things that families do on a regular \nbasis.\n  Also, I want to point out that this penalty is particularly \nnoticeable now that we have more married women working. The penalty is \neven worse when a married woman's income comes close to the amount of \nincome of the husband. So the husband and wife marry and there is this \nunexpected tax. You get whacked, and you wonder whether it is worth \nboth people working. It oftentimes hurts the woman more than the man. \nIn this country we would like to see equal opportunity in salaries, \nthat there not be a glass ceiling for women, and that they ought to be \nable to have the same salary opportunities. But the more likely, on a \nstatistical basis, that the woman receives the same salary as a man, \nthe more this penalty will fall on her. So I think it is clearly unfair \nto both men and women.\n  Mr. President, I want to say again that we are making a big step \ntoward ending a penalty, a tax, a detriment, a burden on an institution \nthat is critical to the salvation and strength of this country, which \nis marriage. We are taxing that, penalizing that, and we are \ndiscouraging marriage. We are subsidizing singleness and divorce, \nactually. That is not good public policy. I believe we can do better. \nOf course, it will have no impact on a single person. No burden will \nfall on them because of passing this bill. It will simply be leveling \nthe playing field and making it a more fair system. I thank the Senator \nfrom Kansas, and I thank Senator Roth and the others who have worked on \nthis legislation. We are moving forward. It is time to pass this bill, \nto give some relief and eliminate this unfair tax on marriage.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1976-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   MENTAL RETARDATION AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor ARC Minnesota, \nand the men and women who volunteer countless hours to improve the \nquality of life for children and adults with mental retardation and \ntheir families. March is officially this nation's ``Mental Retardation \nAwareness Month''--but the efforts of these individuals should be \ncelebrated year-round.\n  As legislators at the federal level, our support tends to come in the \nform of funding. It would be an understatement to say that children and \nadults with mental retardation and their families are faced with unique \nchallenges. Needs differ from family to family. For some, it may be \nspecialized education needs, and for others health care access. And as \na member of the Senate Budget Committee, I realize the vast array of \nprograms we've created to address the broad spectrum of needs--all of \nwhich compete for tax dollars.\n  That is why I have strenuously supported initiatives which provide \ngreater flexibility and control by individuals. Programs such as A+ \naccounts that help families meet unique educational needs that federal, \nstate and local programs cannot. Legislation like the Patients' Bill of \nRights Plus Act that expands medical savings accounts, ultimately \nproviding more flexible health care access--particularly benefitting \nthose that are uninsured.\n  Mr. President, while Mental Retardation Awareness Month is coming to \na close, it doesn't mean that Congress cannot move forward with \npolicies which provide unique solutions to the unique challenges faced \nby individuals with mental retardation and their families. I would urge \nmy colleagues to join me in commemorating the work of the 1,000 \nchapters of the ARC, in Minnesota and across this nation, with their \npledge to work towards this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1976-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DIABETES RESEARCH\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support increased \nresearch funding for diabetes, a devastating disease that afflicts 16 \nmillion Americans, one-third of whom do not even know that they have \nit.\n  Diabetes kills one American every three minutes, discriminating \nneither on the basis of age, race, or belief. It is a lifelong \naffliction, with severe consequences. This was made painfully clear to \nme by a meeting I recently had with a boy and his family from Montana.\n  Justin Windham, from Missoula, said to me: ``I want a cure for \ndiabetes because I don't want to have any long term effects like: going \nblind, kidney problems, or losing my legs. Also I would like to be able \nto eat whatever my friends eat and not feel left out.''\n  Justin, and the 16 million other Americans with diabetes, should be \nable to live their lives without fear of medical complications or the \npain of being ostracized. That is why Congress has a responsibility to \nfund diabetes research and prevention. I urge my colleagues to devote \nincreased resources for research on diabetes, so that our scientists \ncan find a cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1976-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1976-S1977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN MEMORY OF ION RATIU\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \naccomplishments of Ion Ratiu of Romania who passed away on the 16th of \nJanuary.\n  I had the honor of developing a close friendship with Ion. He was an \noutstanding politician, a very successful businessman, a philanthropist \nand, above all, a freedom fighter and a leader devoted to deepening \nrelations between Romania and the United States.\n  Born in Romania at the end of World War II, Ion Ratiu spent a good \npart of his life in the United Kingdom and the United States. Here in \nWashington he developed many friendships and many of us have benefited \nfrom the warm hospitality of his Georgetown home.\n  Those of us who had the pleasure of his friendship can only have been \nimpressed by the tremendous personal energy he directed against the \ndictatorship that dominated his homeland until the Velvet Revolutions \nof 1989. Ion was himself an incarnation of many elements of democracy's \npowerful arsenal. He was a journalist reporting on Romania's tragedy. \nHe was a protector and rescuer of its dissidents. He was the founder of \nthe ``Free Romania Movement.'' He was the unyielding proponent of human \nrights in Romania.\n  In addition to tearing down Communism and building democracy in \nRomania, Ion Ratiu was also one who contributed to the foundation of \ndeeper ties and links between Romania and the West, particularly the \nUnited States.\n  In London he led the British-Romanian Association for 20 years, and \nwith his wife and sons established the Romanian Cultural Center. Here \nin Washington, Ion endowed the Ion Ratiu Chair at Georgetown \nUniversity, a lighthouse for Romanian-American relations.\n  After the Romanian Revolution, Ion Ratiu was elected a member of \nnational Parliament in Bucharest. He even was a strong contender for \nthe Romanian presidency. Ion benefited from the respect of all his \ncolleagues in the Romanian Parliament. He was appreciated for his \ncommitment to democracy and unyielding efforts to earn for his country \nmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It was no \nsurprise for me that Ion, a member of the opposition, led his \nparliament's delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.\n  The Romanian nation is mourning and so are Ion Ratiu's friends in the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\nWe will remember his for the warm enthusiasm and gentle manners he \nbrought to every event. We will miss his soft and unique sense of \nhumor.\n  And, we will always be grateful to him for keeping the torch of \nliberty, democracy, and freedom alive and vibrant. Ion always stayed \ntrue to his principles and beliefs and to his love for Romania.\n  Ion Ratiu is truly one of the heroes of not only Romania, but also \nthe relationship between Romania and the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1977-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO STUART PRENTISS HERMAN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of \nStuart Prentiss Herman, a prominent California attorney who passed away \nrecently, in Los Angeles, at the young age of 57 after battling cancer.\n  Mr. Herman lived his life fighting injustice and discrimination \nwherever he found it. He was active in the civil rights movement of the \n1960's, and began his legal career in 1968 as a trial attorney in the \nCivil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice.\n  After his term as a federal attorney, Mr. Herman entered private \npractice. His legal work was devoted to labor and civil rights law, and \nhe was highly respected throughout the country as a litigator, a \nmediator, and an arbitrator of complex and significant cases, \nparticularly in the areas of racial discrimination and sexual \nharassment. In addition to his private practice, Mr. Herman was \ncommitted to providing legal services to the less privileged members of \nour society, and served on the Managing Committee of Bet Tzedek Legal \nServices, the Southern California Committee of the NAACP Legal Defense \nFund and the Board of Directors of the Western Law Center for \nDisability Rights.\n  He was also committed to preserving the quality of our legal system, \nhaving served on the California State Bar Complainants' Grievance Panel \nand the Los Angeles Police Commission's discipline panels, and our \njudiciary, having served on the Los Angeles County Bar Association's \nJudicial Evaluations Committee and on the U.S. Court of Appeals' Ninth \nCircuit Task Force on Judicial Reporting.\n  Stuart Prentiss Herman was an exemplary attorney, having truly \ndedicated his life to the pursuit of justice for all Americans.

Mr. President, I had the privilege of meeting \ntoday with a wonderful group of courageous and dedicated young people \nwho are members of Mayor Thomas Menino's Youth Council in Boston. This \ndiverse group of junior and senior high school students is in town for \ntheir annual trip to Washington to discuss issues that affect today's \nyouth. The group presented a letter signed by hundreds of Boston's \nyoung people, asking Congress to provide funding for youth summer jobs \nprograms.\n  Mayor Menino's Youth Council was established in 1994 to give young \npeople the opportunity to take an active role as advocates on issues \nthat directly affect their lives. These dedicated volunteers from each \nof the neighborhoods in Boston have reached out to their community. \nThey work closely with other organizations to hold monthly meetings and \nworkshops, and they sponsor forums where young people can express their \nconcerns and recommend solutions to elected officials.\n  This week these high school students are here to emphasize their \nsupport for increased funding for summer job programs. These programs \nprovide valuable job experience for youths who otherwise might not have \nthem. It helps them support their families and save money for college. \nLast summer, 500,000 young people were able to give back to their \ncommunity, serving in such worthwhile summer programs as day camps, \nchild care, care for the elderly, and cleaning city parks and \nrecreation areas.\n  Studies show that early work experience raises lifetime earnings by \nten percent. Clearly, our investment in these programs opens doors for \nthe future by providing experience, connections in the community, and \nan increased prospects for their lifelong earning potential.\n  I commend the efforts of these young people to create jobs, and to \nprepare students for worthwhile careers and the important choices that \nlie ahead. I look forward to working with them to build on this effort \nand make it even more effective. I also look forward to seeing these \nyoung activists become the leaders who will make a difference whatever \nchallenge they face. I hope that they will continue to inspire their \npeers and their representatives through their energy, dedication and \npassion on the issues that can make a difference in the lives of our \nnation's youth. I congratulate these future leaders, for they are truly \nshining examples to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1977-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1977-S1978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CARDINAL KUNG\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCardinal Kung, who passed away on March 12 in Stamford, CT, at the age \nof 98. Cardinal Kung was a historic figure in the Roman Catholic Church \nand a symbol of strength and hope for all of us who care about \nreligious freedom. In China, his native land, the Cardinal endured \nterrible persecution because of his unwillingness to surrender his \nreligious beliefs. My state, Connecticut, had the great honor and \nprivilege of welcoming him as a resident for the final years of his \nlife.\n  Born in Shanghai in 1901, and ordained a priest in 1930, Cardinal \nKung's heroic story began soon after the Communists took power in \nChina. In 1949, he became the Bishop of Shanghai and, in 1950, the \nApostolic Administrator of Soochow and Nanking. Resisting the new \nregime's attempt to control the Catholic Church, he refused to join the \ngovernment-sanctioned Catholic Patriotic Association, which cut ties to \nthe Vatican. Instead, Cardinal Kung remained loyal to the Pope and led \nthe devoutly Catholic Legion of Mary, which the Communists declared to \nbe counter-revolutionary.\n  After 5 years of tension, the Chinese Government in 1955 arrested \nCardinal Kung and several hundred other people involved in the \nunofficial Catholic Church. Dragged into a stadium in Shanghai for a \npublic confession, the Cardinal, with his hands tied behind his back, \ninstead courageously shouted: ``long live Christ the King, long live \nthe Pope.'' The security forces rushed him off the stage, and Cardinal \nKung was held in detention for another 5 years. When he was finally \nbrought to trial in 1960, the authorities convicted Cardinal Kung and \nsentenced him to life imprisonment for the so-called counter-\nrevolutionary activity of pursuing his Catholic faith.\n  Cardinal Kung was a prisoner of conscience whose plight became known \naround the world. He suffered 30 years of isolating imprisonment, \nduring which time he was denied visits from family and concerned \nrepresentatives of the international community, and other forms of \ncontact such as written correspondence. Despite this tortuous \nexperience, he refused to renounce his beliefs or give in to his \noppressors. In fact, when told that he could win his release by \ndenouncing the Pope and cooperating with the government-sanctions \nCatholic Patriotic Association, he responded: ``I am a Roman Catholic \nBishop. If I denounce the Holy Father, not only would I not be a \nBishop, I would not even be a Catholic. You can cut off my head, but \nyou can never take away my duties.'' The Vatican has recognized \nCardinal Kung's extraordinary devotion and sacrifice to the Roman \nCatholic Church. In 1979, while he was still serving his life sentence, \nPope John Paul II secretly elevated Kung to Cardinal, in pectore (in \nhis heart), and the Pope announced this to the world in 1991.\n  In 1985, after sustained pressure from his family, human rights \norganizations, and foreign governments, the Chinese Government moved \nCardinal Kung to house arrest, and in 1987 finally released him, though \nthey notably did not exonerate him. He soon traveled to the United \nStates for medical treatment and lived with his nephew, Joseph Kung, in \nConnecticut. In 1998, the Chinese Government refused to renew Cardinal \nKung's passport, effectively exiling him, and the Cardinal never \nreturned to his country.\n  Cardinal Kung's life demonstrates, I believe, the power of an \nindividual's\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\nfaith and will to resist the repression of the state, and thus \nreplenish the wellspring of human liberty for others. He refused to \nbend, to abandon his commitment to his Church, and his example inspired \nmillions of his countrymen to hold firm in their beliefs and to their \nrights. When the Communists took power, there were an estimated 3 \nmillion Roman Catholics in China. According to current Chinese \ngovernment statistics, there are now 4 million persons registered with \nthe official Catholic Church. However, according to China's unofficial \nCatholic Church, for whom Cardinal Kung was the greatest symbol, the \nnumber of underground Catholics has swelled to as many as 9-10 million.\n  It is no secret that religious persecution in China, including of \nunderground Catholics, continues. It is my hope that the spirit of \nCardinal Kung will endure and continue to inspire others in China and \naround the world to follow his courageous example. And that one day \nthere will be the complete religious freedom in China that Cardinal \nKung lived, worked, and prayed for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1978-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AMADOR VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL IN NATIONAL COMPETITION ON U.S. CONSTITUTION\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The primary goal of the program is to promote civic \ncompetence and responsibility among our nation's elementary and \nsecondary students.

The students testify as constitutional experts before a \npanel of judges representing several regions of the country and a \nvariety of appropriate professional fields. Their testimony is followed \nby a period of questioning by a simulated Congressional committee. The \njudges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to \napply their constitutional knowledge.\n  The class from Amador Valley High School is currently conducting \nresearch and preparing for the upcoming national competition in \nWashington.

Many New Yorkers have joined Ari's mother, Mrs. Devorah \nHalberstam, in calling on the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, to \nreclassify this hateful attack as an act of urban terrorism. Last May, \nat the request of the New York Congressional Delegation, the FBI and \nthe United States Attorney's Office agreed to review the case for \npossible evidence of Federal crimes such as terrorism, civil rights \nviolations, and firearms violations. This investigation is ongoing.\n  We look forward to the swift conclusion of the FBI and US Attorney's \nreview in the hope it will bring peace of mind to the family who has \nsuffered so greatly. Then, we shall hopefully, once and for all, learn \nwhat motivated Rashid Baz to commit such a senseless act of \nviolence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1978-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1978-S1980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GRAND RAPIDS STATE OF THE CITY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Americans are fed up with the \nintolerable levels of gun violence in this country. This violence has \nseeped into our homes, schools, churches and community centers.\n  In cities and counties across the nation, people are calling for \ncommon-sense gun legislation. Mayor John Logie, of Grand Rapids, \nMichigan, dedicated his State of the City speech to the issue of gun \nviolence and its traumatic effect on children. He asks us to take a new \nand different approach to the problem, an approach focused on \nprotecting our children. Mayor Logie suggests that there is ``no \ngreater cause behind which we can all join, than saving the lives of \nour young people.'' Major Logie is right: gun violence can be reduced. \nI hope this Congress can endorse his message and work to protect our \nchildren from senseless firearm injury and death.\n  I ask that the text of Mayor Logie's speech be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                           State of the City\n\n       We are at the start of a new millennium, or at least the \n     start of a new year, and thanks to the support of a majority \n     of the voters in each of the 80 of the City's 100 precincts, \n     for me the start of a new 4-year term in office, until \n     December 31, 2003. Even though that sounds like a long time \n     off, if it is anything like the last 8 years, it will \n     disappear all too quickly.\n       Last year in this speech I was able to talk about the \n     Common Good, about our accomplishments, and about the \n     positive aspects of our future. Sometimes, however, a series \n     of events occur, which make me feel that living in a \n     community like this one, if it can be aroused and focused, it \n     could provide leadership to this region, this State, perhaps \n     even the country. So here is the topic I want to talk about \n     today. On December 7th in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, a 13-year-\n     old seventh grader named Seth Trickey emptied a 9-millimeter \n     semi-automatic pistol, resulting in four of his classmates \n     being shot. Surrounded by 14 spent cartridges, he kept trying \n     to pull the trigger on the empty handgun until the police \n     arrived.\n       In Springfield, Oregon, 15-year-old Kip Kinkel gave a \n     report in science class about how to make a bomb. Then in \n     literature class he read from his journal about thinking \n     about killings. No one did anything until he later shot and \n     killed his parents and two classmates.\n       At Columbine High School, Eric Harris and Dylon Klebold, \n     used a saw-off shotgun, a rifle, and a semi-automatic pistol, \n     to slaughter 13 students and teachers. One of their \n     classmates, Patrick Ireland, recently featured in Life \n     magazine's Year in Pictures, was shot twice in the head and \n     once in the foot. One bullet passed through the left \n     hemisphere of his brain, which controls language, complex \n     thinking, and the right side of the body, causing massive \n     damage. It's still in his brain--too risky to remove, and \n     he's considered lucky, because he's alive. Recently a home-\n     made videotape was released in which Eric and Dylon talked \n     about how they hoped one day Hollywood directors would fight \n     for the right to tell their story, but they said they \n     couldn't decide whether Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino \n     should direct the film. Their callousness is unbelievable! \n     They talk openly on the tape about concocting their plan \n     under the noses of unsuspecting parents and friends. They \n     mention the time a clerk from Green Mountain Guns called \n     Harris's home. His father answered. ``The clips are in,'' the \n     clerk said. Wayne Harris told the clerk he hadn't ordered any \n     clips for a gun, but never asked the clerk if he had the \n     right phone number.\n       Barry Loukaitis, then 14, walked into his Moses Lake, \n     Washington Junior High School, wearing a black trenchcoat and \n     carrying a high-powered rifle. The coat also concealed two \n     fully stocked ammunition belts around his chest and a hip \n     holster carrying two low-caliber handguns, both owned by his \n     parents. Loukaitis burst into his Algebra classroom and began \n     spraying bullets. He shot first at a popular boy who had \n     taunted him, and then two other students and a teacher. When \n     it was over, using a line from a novel, he said, ``Sure beats \n     Algebra, doesn't it?''. All but one of the students died.\n       In Bethel, Alaska, a 16-year-old used a 12-gauge shotgun to \n     kill his principal and a classmate. In Pearl, Mississippi; \n     West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; Springfield, \n     Oregon; and Conyors, Georgia, this terrifying scene keeps \n     reoccurring with startling similarity and frightening \n     regularity. And of course, here in Michigan we have Nathaniel \n     Abraham, a convicted murderer at\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\n     age 11, and, in West Michigan, maybe just missed something of \n     this nature when Justin Walters pleaded no contest to ethnic \n     intimidation charges after he and another boy in Holland were \n     found to have allegedly compiled a hit list that targeted \n     minority students at their school.\n       In 1996, handguns were used to murder only 2 people in New \n     Zealand, only 15 in Japan, only 30 in Great Britain, and only \n     106 in our neighbor Canada. In that same year 9,390 handgun \n     murders occurred in this country. In fact, that is only part \n     of the approximately 33,000 firearm-related deaths in the \n     United States--roughly the same number of Americans as were \n     killed in the Korean War. Choose any 2 years in the 90's, and \n     guns in the United States killed more people than in all the \n     long years of the Vietnam War. Each week, more than 600 \n     people in the United States die from gun-related incidents. \n     Many of them are children. In 1997, half of the handgun \n     homicides were kids under 19. Every day in America, 12 young \n     people die of gunshot wounds. Even accidental shooting deaths \n     take a hideous toll: The rate for accidental gun deaths for \n     children under 15 in the United States is 9 times higher than \n     the rate for the other 25 industrial nations combined.\n       Before we can talk about creating solutions, I want to \n     suggest that we have to begin by taking a new and different \n     approach. The typical rhetoric around the issue of so-called \n     gun control almost always ends up with the people on the \n     Right declaring that the Second Amendment to the \n     Constitution's language about ``the right of the people to \n     keep and bear arms not being infringed'' is an automatic \n     license to own any firearm you want, protected from \n     governmental intrusion. And the people on the Left answer by \n     saying that what we have to do is outlaw guns entirely. But \n     the reality is that there are some 240 million guns in this \n     country, well over 90 million of them handguns, which are not \n     just going to go away.\n       The missing link to much more effective regulation has to \n     be keyed to our concern for our children. Has anyone missed \n     the point of this speech so far? That while we continue to \n     talk about this issue, to debate this issue, to fight over \n     gun ownership rights, children are dying everywhere in \n     America, including our own community. Whatever the \n     Constitutional rights of adults are, we have always had a \n     Constitutional basis to be more restrictive and more \n     protective about our children. As Mayor and a practicing \n     trial lawyer for more than 30 years, I suggest that this is a \n     point of entry into better solutions. By focusing on \n     protecting our children, we can avoid most, if not all of the \n     most divisive legal issues.\n       But first we have to slow down the Michigan Legislature. \n     Fifty-six weapons bills were introduced in Lansing in 1999. \n     Let me describe only two of them. One dealt with carrying \n     concealed weapons, or ``CCW.'' Here in Kent County, as in \n     most of the densely populated counties in Michigan, our \n     concealed weapons permit board is very conservative. Few \n     permits are issued, and then only for a very real need. \n     Other, more rural counties are sometimes more liberal in \n     their approach. Somehow this difference between urban and \n     rural counties has offended certain members of the \n     Legislature because of its ``lack of uniformity.'' So a \n     bill was rushed into both chambers to strip away that \n     local discretion and make Michigan a ``shall issue'' \n     state, which means that unless the applicant was nuts or a \n     convicted felon, he gets a permit. Overnight, virtually \n     any person wanting to carry a concealed weapon would be \n     able to do so. Not one big-city mayor or police chief in \n     Michigan supported this terrible idea. But if it hadn't \n     been for Eric Harris and Dylon Klebold in Littleton, \n     Colorado, the law would have been changed. Even this \n     bill's most ardent supporters didn't have the stomach to \n     pass this legislation after the slaughter at Columbine. \n     But, be assured it will resurface and be tried again.\n       Then there is HB 4379, which would not only block lawsuits \n     against the gun industry by state and local governments, but \n     also private organizations and individuals; and more \n     importantly to where I believe we have to go, it would \n     explicitly block state government from requiring safety locks \n     or warning labels on guns. This proposal had 58 sponsors in \n     the House of Representatives, more than enough to assure \n     passage in that chamber, unless they start receiving \n     different messages from all of us. We must say ``no'' to more \n     pro-gun manufacturer legislation.\n       Things are not any better in Washington. Last fall the \n     majority Whip in the House of Representatives, Congressman \n     Tom Delay, was quoted as saying, ``This House is a pro-gun \n     House.'' Last May the U.S. Senate passed a juvenile justice \n     bill and added an amendment requiring trigger-locking devices \n     to protect children. This was also the bill that by one vote, \n     51-50 with Vice President Gore casting the deciding vote, the \n     Senate agreed to regulate sales at gun shows. Well, that \n     piece of legislation is now languishing in the House-Senate \n     Conference Committee, where no one shows the political will \n     necessary to move it forward. Somehow we have to inspire \n     these people to do the right thing. We must begin to demand a \n     regulatory and statutory framework that protects our \n     children--even from themselves.\n       Here are some of the issues that we can and should begin \n     demanding receive serious consideration:\n       (1) Require background checks for all guns purchased at gun \n     shows. All dealers should be federally licensed, requiring \n     them to conduct a background check prior to selling a \n     firearm. There are now more than 4,000 annual gun shows \n     dedicated primarily to the sale or exchange of firearms. Our \n     friends at The Grand Rapids Press supported this requirement \n     in an editorial on September 29, 1999.\n       (2) Require trigger locks. Conservative Republican Governor \n     Christine Todd Whitman, on October 13, 1999, made New Jersey \n     the fourth state in the nation to prohibit the sale of any \n     new handgun without a trigger lock. In 1998 New York City \n     passed a local ordinance making sellers responsible for \n     issuing trigger locks. When that didn't get the job done, on \n     October 14, 1999, the city passed an ordinance punishing gun \n     owners with a year in jail if they fail to use trigger locks. \n     Chicago, San Francisco, and the State of Massachusetts all \n     have similar requirements. According to a Wall Street \n     Journal/NBC News poll last July, 94% of women and 81% of men \n     support requiring that guns have safety triggers. If we can \n     implement this rule without new state legislation, I will ask \n     the City Commission to do so. If not, I will lobby for the \n     necessary state law change to do so.\n       (3) California, in addition to outlawing ``Saturday Night \n     Specials,'' has passed a law limiting sales of handguns to \n     one per month. Republican Governor Bill Owens of Colorado has \n     endorsed raising the legal age to buy a gun from 18 to 21. To \n     keep firearms out of children's reach, he wants a law \n     requiring safe storage. Finally, he would make ``straw \n     purchases,'' the guys that buy in bulk for resale to anyone \n     including particularly, teenagers, illegal.\n       (4) The domestic production of large-capacity ammunition \n     clips, ones that carry more than 10 rounds, has already been \n     banned. But a loophole as large as the cargo hold of a \n     freighter still exists. The importation of these large-\n     capacity ammo clips needs to be outlawed as well.\n       (5) Seventeen states have passed Child Access Prevention \n     laws, so-called CAP laws. Florida, governed by Jeb Bush, was \n     the first state to pass such a law and has seen unintentional \n     shooting deaths drop by more than 50% in the first year. \n     These laws would make a gun owner responsible if a child \n     gains access to an improperly stored firearm and uses it to \n     kill or injure others. Almost 60% of students in grades 6 \n     through 12 have indicated that they know where to get a gun, \n     and a third of them said that they could get one within an \n     hour. The unlocked, loaded gun in the home should become a \n     thing of the past.\n       (6) And finally, technology is almost available for so-\n     called ``smart guns''--firearms equipped with an electronic \n     device to prevent anyone but the owner from firing it. When \n     you look at the billions of dollars that we spend annually to \n     fight and attempt to conquer diseases, would it not be \n     justified to fund and thereby advance the timetable for \n     research on this smart gun technology to bring it to the \n     marketplace sooner rather than later?\n       Whether or not we are in the 21st Century, we have \n     certainly turned a numerical milestone. This year begins, for \n     the first time, with a ``2.'' In my recent Third Inaugural \n     Address, I had an opportunity to look back at the 19th \n     Century's Last Will and Testament as it appeared in The Grand \n     Rapids Herald, on December 31, 1900. The Editor was Arthur \n     VandenBurg, who would later become our U.S. Senator. The Will \n     bequeathed inventions, books and reading, an honest ballot \n     box, the need for equal civil rights, care for the \n     disadvantaged, and concerns about armaments. I made the \n     observation that it appeared that 100 years later we were \n     still struggling with many of the same issues.\n       Gun violence being perpetrated by children, or at them, was \n     nowhere to be found in the years 1899 or 1900. It is a \n     product of the age we now live in--perhaps just the last 25 \n     years. I hope that what we have unfortunately found to be \n     true about the social problems which are still with us from \n     100 years ago, would not be true for this issue 100 years \n     from now. You know, one definition of insanity is doing the \n     same thing over and over again, and expecting different \n     results. We can, we should, and we must change our strategy \n     toward guns and children to achieve a better outcome.\n       I can think of no greater cause behind which we all can \n     join, than saving the lives of our young people. I have \n     attended the funerals for two of my brother Jim's three \n     children--one dead of natural causes, the other from a car \n     accident. Burying children, having their lives abruptly cut \n     off, is truly a tragedy.\n       Over the last 10 years, our community has grown in stature \n     in this West Michigan region, in this State, and even beyond. \n     Protecting our children is an issue that can and should \n     transcend party politics and conservative and liberal \n     ideologies. I am confident that we can make a difference. Let \n     us commit to doing so.\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1978-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1978-S1980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GRAND RAPIDS STATE OF THE CITY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Americans are fed up with the \nintolerable levels of gun violence in this country. This violence has \nseeped into our homes, schools, churches and community centers.\n  In cities and counties across the nation, people are calling for \ncommon-sense gun legislation. Mayor John Logie, of Grand Rapids, \nMichigan, dedicated his State of the City speech to the issue of gun \nviolence and its traumatic effect on children. He asks us to take a new \nand different approach to the problem, an approach focused on \nprotecting our children. Mayor Logie suggests that there is ``no \ngreater cause behind which we can all join, than saving the lives of \nour young people.'' Major Logie is right: gun violence can be reduced. \nI hope this Congress can endorse his message and work to protect our \nchildren from senseless firearm injury and death.\n  I ask that the text of Mayor Logie's speech be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                           State of the City\n\n       We are at the start of a new millennium, or at least the \n     start of a new year, and thanks to the support of a majority \n     of the voters in each of the 80 of the City's 100 precincts, \n     for me the start of a new 4-year term in office, until \n     December 31, 2003. Even though that sounds like a long time \n     off, if it is anything like the last 8 years, it will \n     disappear all too quickly.\n       Last year in this speech I was able to talk about the \n     Common Good, about our accomplishments, and about the \n     positive aspects of our future. Sometimes, however, a series \n     of events occur, which make me feel that living in a \n     community like this one, if it can be aroused and focused, it \n     could provide leadership to this region, this State, perhaps \n     even the country. So here is the topic I want to talk about \n     today. On December 7th in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, a 13-year-\n     old seventh grader named Seth Trickey emptied a 9-millimeter \n     semi-automatic pistol, resulting in four of his classmates \n     being shot. Surrounded by 14 spent cartridges, he kept trying \n     to pull the trigger on the empty handgun until the police \n     arrived.\n       In Springfield, Oregon, 15-year-old Kip Kinkel gave a \n     report in science class about how to make a bomb. Then in \n     literature class he read from his journal about thinking \n     about killings. No one did anything until he later shot and \n     killed his parents and two classmates.\n       At Columbine High School, Eric Harris and Dylon Klebold, \n     used a saw-off shotgun, a rifle, and a semi-automatic pistol, \n     to slaughter 13 students and teachers. One of their \n     classmates, Patrick Ireland, recently featured in Life \n     magazine's Year in Pictures, was shot twice in the head and \n     once in the foot. One bullet passed through the left \n     hemisphere of his brain, which controls language, complex \n     thinking, and the right side of the body, causing massive \n     damage. It's still in his brain--too risky to remove, and \n     he's considered lucky, because he's alive. Recently a home-\n     made videotape was released in which Eric and Dylon talked \n     about how they hoped one day Hollywood directors would fight \n     for the right to tell their story, but they said they \n     couldn't decide whether Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino \n     should direct the film. Their callousness is unbelievable! \n     They talk openly on the tape about concocting their plan \n     under the noses of unsuspecting parents and friends. They \n     mention the time a clerk from Green Mountain Guns called \n     Harris's home. His father answered. ``The clips are in,'' the \n     clerk said. Wayne Harris told the clerk he hadn't ordered any \n     clips for a gun, but never asked the clerk if he had the \n     right phone number.\n       Barry Loukaitis, then 14, walked into his Moses Lake, \n     Washington Junior High School, wearing a black trenchcoat and \n     carrying a high-powered rifle. The coat also concealed two \n     fully stocked ammunition belts around his chest and a hip \n     holster carrying two low-caliber handguns, both owned by his \n     parents. Loukaitis burst into his Algebra classroom and began \n     spraying bullets. He shot first at a popular boy who had \n     taunted him, and then two other students and a teacher. When \n     it was over, using a line from a novel, he said, ``Sure beats \n     Algebra, doesn't it?''. All but one of the students died.\n       In Bethel, Alaska, a 16-year-old used a 12-gauge shotgun to \n     kill his principal and a classmate. In Pearl, Mississippi; \n     West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; Springfield, \n     Oregon; and Conyors, Georgia, this terrifying scene keeps \n     reoccurring with startling similarity and frightening \n     regularity. And of course, here in Michigan we have Nathaniel \n     Abraham, a convicted murderer at\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\n     age 11, and, in West Michigan, maybe just missed something of \n     this nature when Justin Walters pleaded no contest to ethnic \n     intimidation charges after he and another boy in Holland were \n     found to have allegedly compiled a hit list that targeted \n     minority students at their school.\n       In 1996, handguns were used to murder only 2 people in New \n     Zealand, only 15 in Japan, only 30 in Great Britain, and only \n     106 in our neighbor Canada. In that same year 9,390 handgun \n     murders occurred in this country. In fact, that is only part \n     of the approximately 33,000 firearm-related deaths in the \n     United States--roughly the same number of Americans as were \n     killed in the Korean War. Choose any 2 years in the 90's, and \n     guns in the United States killed more people than in all the \n     long years of the Vietnam War. Each week, more than 600 \n     people in the United States die from gun-related incidents. \n     Many of them are children. In 1997, half of the handgun \n     homicides were kids under 19. Every day in America, 12 young \n     people die of gunshot wounds. Even accidental shooting deaths \n     take a hideous toll: The rate for accidental gun deaths for \n     children under 15 in the United States is 9 times higher than \n     the rate for the other 25 industrial nations combined.\n       Before we can talk about creating solutions, I want to \n     suggest that we have to begin by taking a new and different \n     approach.

We can, we should, and we must change our strategy \n     toward guns and children to achieve a better outcome.\n       I can think of no greater cause behind which we all can \n     join, than saving the lives of our young people. I have \n     attended the funerals for two of my brother Jim's three \n     children--one dead of natural causes, the other from a car \n     accident. Burying children, having their lives abruptly cut \n     off, is truly a tragedy.\n       Over the last 10 years, our community has grown in stature \n     in this West Michigan region, in this State, and even beyond. \n     Protecting our children is an issue that can and should \n     transcend party politics and conservative and liberal \n     ideologies. I am confident that we can make a difference. Let \n     us commit to doing so.\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1980-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1980-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3908.

A bill to prevent identity fraud in consumer credit \ntransactions and credit reports, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to send to the desk a bill \ncosponsored by Senator Kyl of Arizona and Senator Grassley of Iowa for \nreference to committee.\n  The bill is entitled the ``Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2000.''\n  The crime of identity theft has become one of the major law \nenforcement challenges of the new economy because vast quantities of \nsensitive personal information are now vulnerable to criminal \ninterception and misuse.\n  What is identity theft? Identity theft occurs when one person uses \nanother person's Social Security number, birth date, driver's license \nnumber, or other identifying information to obtain credit cards, car \nloans, phone plans, or other services in the potential victim's name. \nOf course, the victim does not know the theft has happened until he or \nshe receives bills for items he or she didn't buy; plans for which he \nor she didn't contract, and so on.\n  Identity thieves get personal information in a myriad of ways. They \nsteal wallets and purses containing identification cards. They use \npersonal information found on the Internet. They steal mail, including \npreapproved credit offers and credit statements. They fraudulently \nobtain credit reports or they get someone else's personnel records at \nwork.\n  All indications are that there is an alarming growth of this highly \ninvasive crime. I believe the time has come to do something about it. A \nnational credit bureau has reported that the total number of identity \ntheft inquiries to its Theft Victim Assistance Department grew from \n35,000 theft inquiries in 1992 to over one-half million in 1997. That \nis over a 1,400-percent increase. It is national. It touches every \nState and it impacts every area of our citizenry.\n  The United States Postal Inspection Service reports that 50,000 \npeople a year have become victims of identity theft since it first \nbegan collecting information on identity theft in the mid-1990s. In \ntotal, the Treasury Department estimates that identity theft annually \ncauses between $2 and $3 billion in losses from credit cards alone.\n\n  The legislation I introduce today, along with Senators Kyl and \nGrassley, tackles this issue. It makes it harder for criminals to \naccess another person's private information, it gives consumers more \ntools to uncover fraudulent activity conducted in their name, and it \nexpands the authority of the Social Security Administration to \nprosecute identity theft.\n  The Identity Theft Prevention Act makes it harder for criminals to \nsteal personal information. First, it closes a loophole in the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act that permits personal identifying information such \nas Social Security numbers, one's mother's maiden name, and birth date \nto be distributed without restriction to marketers. This sensitive \ninformation would be treated under this bill like any other part of the \ncredit report, with its disclosure restricted to businesses needing the \ndata for extensions of credit, employment applications, insurance \napplications, or other permissible purposes.\n  This bill codifies, also, the practice of placing fraud alerts on a \nconsumer's credit file and gives the Federal Trade Commission the \nauthority to impose fines against credit issuers that ignore the alert. \nToo many credit issuers are presently ignoring fraud alerts to the \ndetriment of identity theft victims.\n  Additionally, the bill requires credit bureaus to investigate \ndiscrepancies between their records and the address, birth date, and \nother personal information submitted as a part of an individual's \napplication for credit, so that telltale signs of fraudulent \napplications such as incorrect addresses are immediately flagged.\n  The bill improves how credit card companies monitor requests for new \ncredit cards or changes of address. For example, it requires that \ncredit card holders always be notified at their original address when a \nduplicate card is sent to a new address.\n  This legislation also gives consumers more access to the personal \ninformation collected about them, which is a critical tool in combating \nidentity theft. Currently, six States--Colorado, Georgia, \nMassachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, and New Jersey--have statutes that \nentitle consumers to one free personal credit report annually. This act \nmakes this a national requirement. Every consumer across this Nation \nwould have access to a free credit report. In addition, consumers could \nreview the personal information collected about them by individual \nreference services for a reasonable fee. With greater access to their \nown personal information, consumers can proactively check their records \nfor evidence of identity theft and uncover other errors.\n  We have worked with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission in \npreparing this legislation. I believe the staff of the FTC is \nsupportive of this bill. This bill is also supported by the Consumer \nFederation of America.\n  We try to empower victims in this bill. This legislation calls for \nmeasures to help identity theft victims recover from the crime. In \ncases of identity theft, all too often victims get treated as if they \nwere the criminals. Victims receive hostile notices from creditors who \nmistakenly believe they have not paid their bills. Victims' access to \ncredit is jeopardized, and they can spend years trying to restore their \ngood name.\n  This legislation calls upon the credit industry to assist victims in \nnotifying credit issuers of fraudulent charges by developing a single \nmodel credit reporting form. However, should the credit industry fail \nto implement these measures, the Federal Trade Commission would then be \nauthorized to take action.\n  Maureen Mitchell, an identity theft victim, recently described why \nthis assistance is needed at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Government Information, a \nsubcommittee on which I am ranking member. She said:\n\n       I have logged over 400 hours of time trying to clear my \n     name and restore my good credit. Words are unable to \n     adequately express the gamut of emotions that I feel as a \n     victim.\n\n  Another victim wrote to me:\n\n       I have spent an ungodly number of hours trying to correct \n     the damage that has been done by the individual who stole my \n     identity. Professionally, as a teacher and a tutor, my hours \n     are worth $35. I have been robbed of $5,250 in time. I have \n     been humiliated in my local stores because checks have been \n     rejected at the checkout. I am emotionally drained. I am a \n     victim and Congress needs to recognize me as such.\n\n  We try in this bill to do that.\n  This legislation targets the theft and misuse of another person's \nSocial Security number, a major cause of identity theft. While the \nSocial Security Administration has the ability to impose civil \npenalties for misusing a Social Security number to falsely obtain \ngovernment benefits, it has no authority over other offenses involving \nthe misuse of Social Security numbers. This bill gives them that \nauthority. The\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nIdentity Theft Prevention Act authorizes the Social Security \nAdministration to impose civil monetary penalties against any \nindividual who:\n  (1) knowingly uses another's Social Security number on the basis of \nfalse information provided by them or another person;\n  (2) falsely represents a number to be a Social Security number when \nit is not;\n  That means, makes up a number, which people do.\n  (3) alters a Social Security card; or\n  (4) compels the disclosure of a Social Security card in violation of \nthe law.\n  I think these provisions enable the Social Security Administration to \nthrow its full weight into the investigation and civil prosecution of \nidentity theft involving Social Security numbers.\n  In conclusion, I hope my colleagues find this bill worthy and pass \nit. This bill implements a number of practical, concrete measures to \nclose down the flow of private information to individuals with criminal \nintent. In this new technology-driven economy, consumers don't need to \nbe left vulnerable. They shouldn't be left without recourse to \npredators who are out to steal their good name.\n  I think we have a very practical solution. It is well thought out. It \nis well drafted. It has been worked out with the staff of the FTC. My \nhope is, when it goes to the Banking Committee, that committee would \ntake a good look at it and pass it. This is an increasing problem. \nThere is no reason to believe it will stop. Without Congress providing \nbasic protections to individuals who are the victims, it will continue \nto grow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 2329. A bill to improve the administration of the Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n legislation to improve the animal and plant health inspection service\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, the Wildlife Services Division of the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture needs assistance in expediting \nproper bird management activities. I am here today to introduce \nlegislation that accomplishes this goal.\n  Proper migratory bird management is important to the state of \nArkansas for a number of reasons. We are deemed ``The Natural State'' \ndue to the numerous outdoor recreational opportunities that exist in \nthe state. Fishing, hunting, and bird watching opportunities abound \nthroughout Arkansas. Maintaining proper populations of wildlife, \nespecially migratory birds, is essential for sustaining a balanced \nenvironment.\n  In Arkansas, aquaculture production has taken great strides in recent \nyears. The catfish industry in the state has grown rapidly and Arkansas \ncurrently ranks second nationally in acreage and production of catfish. \nThe baitfish industry is not far behind, selling more than 15 million \npounds of fish annually, with a cash value in excess of $43 million. I \nhave been a great supporter of this industry since my days in the House \nof Representatives and I am concerned about the impact the double \nbreasted cormorant is having on this industry. In the words of one of \nmy constituents, ``The double-crested cormorant has become a natural \ndisaster!'' I am pleased that the Fish and Wildlife Service has agreed \nto develop a national management plan for the double breasted \ncormorant. I am hopeful that an effective management program will be \nthe result of these efforts.\n  One of my first priorities since coming to Congress in 1992 has been \nto work to make government more efficient and effective. To \nspecifically address what I see as an inequity among government \nagencies regarding this issue, I am introducing a bill today that gives \nWildlife Service employees as much authority to manage and take \nmigratory birds as any U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employee. After \nall, Wildlife Services biologists are professional wildlife managers \nproviding the front line of defense against such problems. With this \nlegislation I would like to recognize the excellent job that Wildlife \nServices has done and is doing for bird management.\n  Currently, USDA-Wildlife Services is required to apply for and \nreceive a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before they \ncan proceed with any bird collection or management activities. This \nprocess is redundant and unnecessary. Oftentimes, Wildlife Services \nfinds that by the time a permit arrives, the birds for which the permit \nwas applied for are already gone. I hope that this legislation will \nlead to a more streamlined effort for management purposes and I urge \nboth agencies, USDA and the Fish and Wildlife Service, to work together \nto accomplish this goal.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Tim \nHutchinson, for joining me in this effort and look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that government is operating efficiently.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Robb, Mr. Nickles, \n        and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 2330. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe excise tax on telephone and other communication service; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             legislation to repeal the telephone excise tax\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today--along with Senator \nBreaux and others--to introduce a bill to repeal the telephone excise \ntax. It is a tax that is outdated, unfair, and complex for both \nconsumers to understand and for the collectors to administer. It cannot \nbe justified on any tax policy grounds.\n  The federal government has had the American consumer on ``hold'' for \ntoo long when it comes to this tax. The telephone excise tax has been \naround for over 102 years. In fact, it was first imposed in 1898--just \n22 years after the telephone itself was invented. So quickly was it \nimposed that it almost seems that Uncle Sam was there to collect it \nbefore Alexander Graham Bell could put down the receiver from the first \ncall. In fact, the tax is so old that Bell himself would have paid it!\n  This tax on talking--as it is known--currently stands at 3%. Today, \nabout 94% of all American families have telephone service. That means \nthat virtually every family in the United States must tack an \nadditional 3% on to their monthly phone bill. The federal tax applies \nto local phone service; it applies to long distance service; and it \neven applies in some cases to the extra amounts paid for state and \nlocal taxes. It is estimated that this tax costs the American public \nmore than $5 billion per year.\n  The telephone excise tax is a classic story of a tax that has been \nsevered from its original justifications, but lives on solely to \ncollect money.\n  In truth, the federal phone tax has had more legislative lives than a \ncat. When the tax was originally imposed, Teddy Roosevelt was leading \nthe Rough Riders up San Juan Hill. At that time, it was billed as a \nluxury tax, as only a small portion of the American public even had \ntelephones. The tax was repealed in the early 20th century but then was \nreinstated at the beginning of World War I. It was repealed and \nreinstated a few more times until 1941, when it was made permanent to \nraise money for World War II. In the mid-60s, Congress scheduled the \nelimination of the phone tax, which had reached levels of 10 and 25 \npercent. But once again, the demands of war intervened, as the \nelimination of the tax was delayed to help pay for Vietnam. In 1973, \nthe phone tax began to phase-out, but one year before it was about to \nbe eliminated, it rose up yet again--this time justified by the \nrationale of deficit reduction--and has remained with us ever since.\n  This tax is a pure money grab by the federal government--it does not \npass any of the traditional criteria used for evaluating tax policy. \nFirst, this phone tax is outmoded. Once upon a time, it could have been \nargued that telephone service was a luxury item and that only the rich \nwould be affected. As we all know, there is nothing further from the \ntruth today.\n  Second, the federal phone tax is unfair. Because this tax is a flat \n3%, it applies disproportionately to low and middle income people. For \nexample, studies show that an American family making less than $50,000 \nper year spends at least 2% of its income on telephone service. A \nfamily earning less than $10,000 per year spends over 9% of its income \non telephone service. Imposing a tax on those families for a\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nservice that is a necessity in a modern society is simply not fair.\n\n  Third, the federal phone tax is complex. Once upon a time, phone \nservice was simple--there was one company who provided it. It was an \neasy tax to administer. Now, however, phone service is intertwined with \ndata services and Internet access, and it brings about a whole new set \nof complexities. For instance, a common way to provide high speed \nInternet access is through a digital subscriber line. This DSL line \nallows a user to have simultaneous access to the Internet and to \ntelephone communications. How should it be taxed? Should the tax be \napportioned? Should the whole line be tax free? And what will we do \nwhen cable, wireless, and satellite companies provide voice and data \ncommunications over the same system? The burdensome complexity of today \nwill only become more difficult tomorrow.\n  As these questions are answered, we run the risk of distorting the \nmarket by favoring certain technologies. There are already numerous \nexceptions and carve-outs to the phone tax. For instance, private \ncommunications services are exempt from the tax. That allows large, \nsophisticated companies to establish communications networks and avoid \npaying any federal phone tax. It goes without saying that American \nfamilies do not have that same option.\n  With new technology, we also may exacerbate the inequities of the tax \nand contribute to the digital divide. For example, consider two \nfamilies that decide it's time to connect their homes to the Internet. \nThe first family installs another phone line for regular Internet \naccess. The second family decides to buy a more expensive, dedicated \nhigh speed line for Internet access. The first family definitely gets \nhit with the phone tax, while the second family may end up paying no \ntax at all on their connection. I can't see any policy rationale for \nthat result.\n  Speaking of complexity, let me ask if anyone has taken a look at \ntheir most recent phone bill. It is a labyrinth of taxes and fees piled \none on top of another. We may not be able to figure out what all the \nfees are for; but we do know that they add a big chunk to our phone \nbill. According to a recent study, the mean tax rate across the country \non telecommunications is slightly over 18%. That is about a 6% rise in \nthe last 10 years. In my little state of Delaware, the average tax rate \non telecommunications now stands at 12%. I can't control the state and \nlocal taxes that have been imposed, but I can do my part with respect \nto the federal taxes. I seek to remove this burden from the citizens of \nmy state--and all Americans across the country.\n  The technological changes in America have increased productivity and \nrevolutionized our economy. As members of Congress, we need to make \nsure that our tax policies do not stifle that economic expansion. We \nshould not adhere to policies that are a relic from a different time. \nIn 1987, even before the deregulation of the telecommunications market, \nthe Treasury Department concluded that there were ``no strong arguments \nin favor of the communications excise tax.''\n  In today's economy, the arguments for repeal are even stronger. \nEarlier this year, the National Governors Association issued a report \nconcluding that ``policymakers need to create a telecommunications tax \nstructure that more accurately reflects the new economic realities of \nthe market and to ensure that current state tax policy does not inhibit \ngrowth in the telecommunications industry.'' Moreover, the Advisory \nCommission on Electronic Commerce, which Congress established to study \nthe issue of Internet taxation, appears to have reached near unanimous \nagreement that the phone excise tax should be repealed.\n  Mr. President, it is time to end the federal phone tax. For too long \nwhile America has been listening to a dial tone, Washington has been \nhearing a dollar tone. This tax is outmoded. It has been here since \nAlexander Graham Bell himself was alive. It is unfair. We are today \ntaxing a poor family with a tax that was originally meant for luxury \nitems. And it is complex. Only a communications engineer can today \nunderstand the myriad of taxes levied on a common phone bill and only \nthe federal government has the wherewithal to keep track of who and \nwhat will be taxed. Mr. President, it is time we hung up the phone tax \nonce and for all. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its \nrepeal.\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith several of my colleagues on the Finance Committee to repeal the \ntelephone excise tax that originated during the Spanish American War. \nFiscal discipline in the past seven years has put us in a position that \nwe could not have imagined even a few short years ago. We now have \nopportunities to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, pay down our \nburgeoning national debt and make investments that keep our economy \nrolling. Along the way, we will have opportunities to correct \ninequities in the Tax Code. Currently, all users of telephone services \npay a 3% excise tax on their use. Repealing this tax will make phone \nservice and internet access more affordable for hardworking families. \nIn order to decrease the expanding digital divide, we must eliminate \npolicies that discourage families from connecting to the internet. \nWhile I continue to believe that the best use of our growing surplus is \nto pay down the debt and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, I am \npleased that we are entering a period where we can consider legislation \nthat will sustain our high technology growth at the same time that we \nare shrinking the digital divide.\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Roth, a bill that will repeal the \nfederal excise on telephone service. This tax is outdated, highly \nregressive and has lasted entirely too long.\n  The ``tax on talking'' was originally levied as a luxury tax to fund \nthe Spanish-American War. At the time, only a small number of wealthy \nindividuals had access to telephone service. Telephones are no longer \nluxuries that only the very wealthy can afford. They are basic fixtures \nin every American household. And with the creation of the Internet, \ntelephone service has become the lifeline of the new economy. This \nexpansion of telephone service and its many uses has revealed the \nregressive nature of the ``tax on talking.'' Today, it is low-income \nfamilies who are hit the hardest by this excise tax, since they pay a \nhigher percentage of their income on telephone service than higher \nincome families.\n  Mr. President, with the almost universal subscription to telephone \nservice, the repeal of this telephone tax would provide tax relief to \nvirtually every family in the United States. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this important piece of legislation. It is time we ended over \n100 years of Americans paying this regressive and unnecessary tax on \ntelephone service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 2331. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to \nrecalculate the franchise fee owned by Fort Sumter Tours, Inc., a \nconcessioner providing services to Fort Sumter National Monument, South \nCarolina; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               fort sumter national monument concessions\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation in an attempt to settle a long-standing dispute between the \nNational Park Service (NPS) and Fort Sumter Tours, Inc. (FST) regarding \nthe calculation of FST's Concessioner Franchise Fees.\n  Fort Sumter National Monument was established by Congress in 1948 and \nis located in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. Congress \ndirected that the National Park Service (NPS) ``Shall maintain and \npreserve it [the fort] for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of \nthe United States.'' (16 USC 450ee et. seq.)\n  Since 1962, the private concessioner, Fort Sumter Tours, Inc. (FST), \nhas provided visitors with service to this national monument. In 1985, \nFST was asked by NPS to acquire a new landside docking facility and \ninvest in a new boat that would cost FST over $1 million. In exchange \nfor these investments, an agreement was reached between FST and the NPS \nto provide a fifteen-year contract, with a franchise fee set by the NPS \nat 4.25 percent of gross receipts.\n  By statutory law all park concessionaires are required to pay a \nfranchise fee based upon a percentage of\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\ntheir gross receipts. In 1992 the NPS unilaterally attempted to \nincrease FST's franchise fee from 4.25 percent to 12 percent and a \ndispute has existed ever since. This increase was based upon a \nFranchise Fee Analysis (FFA) prepared by the NPS, which FST claims to \nbe inconsistent with Park Service guidelines existing at that time. I \nbelieve if errors have been made they need to be corrected.\n  While the Courts have ruled that the NPS has the authority to raise \nthe franchise fee, that is not the actual dispute. The actual dispute \nis whether the NPS calculated the increase in these fees appropriately. \nThis legislation provides for arbitration between FST and the NPS to \nsettle a dispute that has lasted for almost eight years. By the NPS's \nown account, FST has been a valuable service benefiting thousands and \nthousands of visitors to Fort Sumter National Monument. It is time for \nthe NPS and FST to settle their differences and move forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RECALCULATION OF FRANCHISE FEE.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Franchisee.--The term ``franchisee'' means Fort Sumter \n     Tours, Inc., a concessioner providing service to Fort Sumter \n     National Monument, South Carolina.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (b) Recalculation of Franchise Fee.--Not later than 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (1) recalculate the amount (if any) of the franchise fee \n     owed by the franchisee; and\n       (2) notify the franchisee of the recalculated amount.\n       (c) Arbitration.--\n       (1) In general.--If the amount of the franchise fee as \n     recalculated under subsection (a) is not acceptable to the \n     franchisee--\n       (A) the franchisee, not later than 5 days after receipt of \n     notification under subsection (b)(2), shall so notify the \n     Secretary; and\n       (B) the amount of the franchise fee owed shall be \n     determined through binding arbitration that provides for a \n     trial-type hearing that--\n       (i) includes the opportunity to call and cross-examine \n     witnesses; and\n       (ii) is subject to supervision by the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia in accordance \n     with the title 9, United States Code.\n       (2) Selection of arbitrator or arbitration panel.--\n       (A) Agreement on arbitrator.--For a period of not more than \n     30 days after the franchisee gives notification under \n     paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary and the franchisee shall \n     attempt to agree on the selection of an arbitrator to conduct \n     the arbitration.\n       (B) Panel.--If at any time the Secretary or the franchisee \n     declares that the parties are unable to agree on an \n     arbitrator--\n       (i) the Secretary and the franchisee shall each select an \n     arbitrator;\n       (ii) not later than 10 days after 2 arbitrators are \n     selected under clause (i), the 2 arbitrators shall select a \n     third arbitrator; and\n       (iii) the 3 arbitrators shall conduct the arbitration.\n       (3) Commencement and completion.--An arbitration proceeding \n     under paragraph (1)--\n       (A) shall commence not later than 30 days after the date on \n     which an arbitrator or arbitration panel is selected under \n     paragraph (2); and\n       (B) shall be completed with a decision rendered not later \n     than 240 days after that date.\n       (4) Applicable law.--\n       (A) Relevant time period.--The law applicable to the \n     recalculation of the franchise fee under this subsection \n     shall be the law applicable to franchise fee determinations \n     in effect at the beginning of the period for which the \n     franchise fee is payable.\n       (B) Previous decisions.--No previous judicial decision \n     regarding the franchise fee dispute that is the subject of \n     arbitration under this subsection may be introduced in \n     evidence or considered by the arbitrator or arbitration panel \n     for any purpose.\n       (5) Fees and costs.--If the franchisee is the prevailing \n     party in binding arbitration, the arbitrator or arbitration \n     panel shall award the franchisee reasonable attorney's fees \n     and costs for all proceedings involving the disputed \n     franchise fee consistent with--\n       (A) section 504 of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (B) section 2412 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (d) Bids and Proposals.--Until such date as any arbitration \n     under this Act is completed and is no longer subject to \n     appeal, the Secretary--\n       (1) shall not solicit or accept a bid or proposal for any \n     contract for passenger service to Fort Sumter National \n     Monument; and\n       (2) shall offer to the franchisee annual extensions of the \n     concessions contract in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 2332. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \npermit a producer to lock in a loan deficiency payment rate for a \nportion of a crop; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n              the loan deficiency payment flexibility act\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Loan \nDeficiency Payment Flexibility Act. The idea for this legislation came \nfrom Peter Kalenberg, a producer from Stewart, MN, and is an example of \nhow a good idea can be transformed into sound public policy. It is \nsupported by such organizations as the Minnesota Corn Growers, the \nMinnesota Farm Bureau Federation, and the Minnesota Wheat Growers \nAssociation. These and many other groups have recognized the need for \nthis legislation.\n  As you know, Loan Deficiency Payments, otherwise known as LDPs, were \na key component of the 1996 Farm bill and have helped cushion the blow \nof low commodity prices and restricted demand. However, producers in \nMinnesota and other northern states have questioned the fairness of how \nthe LDP is administered. States farther south are able to begin harvest \nbefore farmers in states such as Minnesota and are therefore able to \n``lock in'' a more favorable LDP. This has the potential of impacting \nmarket signals and driving down the futures price before harvest has \nbegun in northern states.\n  Mr. President, by taking the approach I am about to outline, I have \nensured that regions of the country that are currently able to utilize \nan earlier LDP are not placed at a disadvantage. The components of this \nlegislation are simple, yet provide a common-sense approach to a \nproblem faced by producers in states such as Minnesota.\n  My ``Loan Deficiency Payment Flexibility Act'' would correct this \ninequity by directing the Secretary of Agriculture to announce that \nharvest has begun on a particular commodity (i.e. corn or soybeans) and \nthat producers throughout the United States may now utilize the Loan \nDeficiency Payment. Essentially my bill does two things:\n  It establishes an earlier, more flexible starting date when all \nproducers would have the option of ``locking in'' that day's LDP. They \nwould be able to do so once throughout the duration of the harvest \nseason.\n  Allows a producer to lock-in an LDP for up to 85% of his or her \nactual yield. Because the LDP is ``locked in'' on paper, no payments \nare actually made until the crop is harvested and we avoid the problems \nposed by the old deficiency payment system due to unanticipated high or \nlow yields.\n  Although there is no guarantee that the LDP will be better in the \nearly summer versus the fall, my legislation will afford farmers the \nopportunity to evaluate the markets and base their decision on what \nbest fits their management plan.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2333. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \ngrant the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate the \nmanufacture, sale, and distribution of tobacco and other products \ncontaining nicotine, tar, additives, and other potentially harmful \nconstituents and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                TOBACCO REGULATORY FAIRNESS ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my distinguished colleague, Senator Bingaman, that we hope will \nmark the beginning of a dialogue on an issue that has tremendous \nimplications for our nation's public health, and more specifically, the \nhealth and well-being of our children. Today, we are introducing the \n``Tobacco Regulatory Fairness Act of 2000''.\n  The goal of this legislation is quite simple--to grant the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) the authority it needs to regulate the \nmanufacture, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of tobacco \nproducts.\n  A week ago, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the FDA does not have \nthe authority to regulate tobacco products, thus nullifying regulations \npromulgated by the agency in August 1996.\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\n While a slim majority of the court found that the agency lacked the \njurisdiction necessary to act on this class of products, the Justices \nin the majority and minority both opinions acknowledged the clear \nthreat unregulated tobacco products poses to public health. In the \nmajority opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stated that tobacco was \n``perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in the \nUnited States.'' Similarly, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a former \nprofessor of mine at Harvard University School of Law, pointed out in \nthe dissenting opinion that FDA's ability to regulate tobacco products \nclearly fit into its basic authority, ``the overall protection of the \npublic health.''\n  Although the court upheld the 1998 ruling by the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the decision does not dispute, and, \nin fact, it reaffirms that the FDA is the most appropriate agency to \nregulate tobacco products, given the general scope of its authority and \nits emphasis on protecting the public health. Now, it is a matter of \nCongress taking action to clearly give the FDA the long overdue \nauthority it requires.\n  So today, I introduce this legislation as a challenge to my \ncolleagues to do what is right--to debate and pass legislation that \nwill once and for all give FDA the tools it needs to enact regulations \nthat will help to protect children and others from the dangers of \ntobacco.\n  After the long and protracted debate in the Senate two years ago on \nthe McCain tobacco bill, I am sure that most of my colleagues are \nfamiliar with the numerous statistics that are often cited in relation \nto the dangers of smoking and its devastating impact on society in \nterms of health care costs, lost productivity, disability, and loss of \nlife. However, I believe these figures bear repeating. It is estimated \nthat today, some 50 million Americans are addicted to tobacco, and one \nout of every three long-term users will die from a disease related to \ntheir tobacco use.\n  The cost of tobacco use not only results in lives lost, but also has \na considerable toll on health care expenses. It is estimated that the \nhealth care costs associated with treating tobacco-related disease \ntotals over $80 billion a year--with almost half being paid for by \ntaxpayer financed health care programs.\n  We also know that tobacco addiction is clearly a problem that starts \nwith children: almost 90 percent of adult smokers started using tobacco \nat or before age 18. Each year, one million children become regular \nsmokers--and one-third of them will die prematurely of lung cancer, \nemphysema, and similar tobacco caused diseases. Unless current trends \nare reversed, five million kids under 18 alive today will die from \ntobacco related diseases.\n  In Rhode Island, while overall cigarette use is declining slightly, \nit has increased by more than 25 percent among high-schoolers. \nCurrently, over one-third of New England high school students under age \n18 use tobacco products. In Rhode Island, over one third of high school \nstudents smoke.\n  Indeed, tobacco use continues to permeate the ranks of the young. For \ndecades, the tobacco industry has ingeniously promoted its products. It \nhas done so with total disregard for the health of its customers. It \nhas relied upon cool, youthful images to sell its products. The tobacco \nindustry has taken an addiction that prematurely kills and dressed it \nup as a glamorous symbol of success and sex appeal.\n  By providing the FDA with the appropriate and unambiguous authority, \nwe can be assured that these products comply with minimum health and \nsafety standards. Tobacco should be regulated in the same way every \nother product we consume is regulated.\n  I will concede that there are some formidable challenges ahead--but \nthese challenges are not insurmountable. During the 1998 debate on the \nMcCain tobacco bill, a majority of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle agreed our country needed a national tobacco control policy. \nWhile we may not have succeeded then, we cannot and must not allow the \nprogress the FDA has made in limiting minors' access to tobacco be \nlost.\n  We all know that tobacco is a substance that not only reduces the \nquality of one's life in the short term, but with lifelong use results \nin untimely death. We have an opportunity this year to make a real \ndifference. Through the legislation I am introducing today, I call my \ncolleagues to action in the ongoing fight to protect the long term \nhealth of the children of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this commitment to enacting \nlegislation granting FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco Regulatory Fairness \n     Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause approximately \n     450,000 deaths each year in the United States.\n       (2) Cigarette smoking accounts for approximately \n     $65,000,000,000 in lost productivity and health care costs.\n       (3) In spite of the well-established dangers of cigarette \n     smoking and tobacco use, there is no Federal agency that has \n     any authority to regulate the manufacture, sale, \n     distribution, and use of tobacco products.\n       (4) The tobacco industry spends approximately \n     $4,000,000,000 each year to promote tobacco products.\n       (5) Each day 3,000 children try cigarettes for the first \n     time, many of whom become lifelong addicted smokers.\n       (6) There is no minimum age requirement in Federal law that \n     an individual must reach to legally buy cigarettes and other \n     tobacco products.\n       (7) The Food and Drug Administration is the most qualified \n     Federal agency to regulate tobacco products.\n       (8) It is inconsistent for the Food and Drug Administration \n     to regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of other \n     nicotine-containing products used as substitutes for \n     cigarette smoking and tobacco use and not be able to regulate \n     tobacco products in a comparable manner.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I am very proud to be here \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Jack Reed, to introduce the \nTobacco Regulation Fairness Act of 2000.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to join this effort, for it \nis time for Congress to take action. We must ensure that the Food and \nDrug Administration can regulate the manufacture, labeling, \nadvertising, distribution and sale of tobacco products.\n  While many are disappointed with last week's Supreme Court ruling on \nFDA regulation of tobacco products, the ruling reflects reality. \nCongress has not acted to give FDA the authority it needs to regulate \ntobacco products. The Supreme Court's decision underscores this fact \nand heightens the need for Congress to pass meaningful and \ncomprehensive legislation to ensure FDA authority over tobacco \nproducts.\n  This legislation is the key to preventing tobacco use by teenagers \nand adolescents and to preventing the sales of tobacco products to \nchildren. If we can prevent kids from smoking, we can head off a \ntremendous amount of human disease and suffering, medical costs, and \nloss of life. While even tobacco companies say that they are against \nkids smoking, we must look at the facts. According to the American \nCancer Society, in the course of this Congress, almost 600,000 children \nwill try tobacco products for the first time. Of those, nearly 200,000 \nwill become addicted to nicotine. Additionally, over more than 90,000 \npeople will die from tobacco related cancers.\n  In 1997, a study by the Center for Disease Control showed that \nchildren and adolescents were able to buy tobacco products 67 percent \nof the times they\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\ntried. The CDC found that most young smokers were able to buy their own \ncigarettes and were seldom asked for identification. While strides have \nbeen made in the past 2 years, it is imperative that change continue. \nThe bottom line is that the Supreme Court made its decision and \nCongress must act so that we can continue to make inroads into youth \nsmoking prevention.\n  Mr. President, this legislation designates the Food and Drug \nAdministration as the Federal agency that regulates the manufacture, \ndistribution and sale of tobacco products. This Act will serve to \nprovide the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority \nto promulgate regulations governing the manufacture, sale and \ndistribution of tobacco products. Additionally, the legislation also \nestablishes a federal minimum age of sale of tobacco products of 18 and \nrequire the label to state ``Federal Law Prohibits Sale to Minors.''\n  Mr. President, in 1989 and again in 1992, I introduced a bill to \nrequire the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the manufacture \nand sale of tobacco products. ``The Tobacco Health and Safety Act of \n1992'' had a companion bill with Representative Michael Synar in the \nHouse. These bills were very similar legislative attempts to regulate \ntobacco by bringing it under the jurisdiction of the Federal Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  I believed then and I believe now that the FDA is the appropriate \nregulatory entity to address this vital issue. To do anything else is \nunacceptable. It is time to give the FDA the full authority to regulate \nthe manufacture, sale, labeling, advertising, and promotion of tobacco \nproducts.\n  The bill we introduce today is a fair and equitable approach to the \nissue. It represents a strong commitment to health promotion and \ndisease prevention. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and work \nwith us to act upon this as a public health issue before we adjourn \nthis year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. L. CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2334. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nexpensing of environmental remediation costs for an additional 6 years \nand to include sites in metropolitan statistical areas.\n\n\n   legislation to extend expensing of environmental remediation costs\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. L. CHAFEE:\n  S. 2335. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nprogram to provide assistance in the remediation and restoration of \nbrownfields, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n         state and local brownfields revitalization act of 2000\n\n Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a pair of \nbills to enhance the pace and effectiveness of brownfields \nredevelopment throughout the country. The first bill, entitled the \n``State and Local Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2000'', will \nauthorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to remediate and restore \nbrownfield sites owned by state and local governments. The second bill, \nS. 2334, which I introduce with Senator Jeffords, will expand coverage \nof the federal brownfields tax incentive and extend it for an \nadditional six years. I also am adding my name as a co-sponsor to the \n``Small Business Brownfields Redevelopment Act of 1999'', S. 1408, \nauthored by Senator Jeffords. Along with these initiatives, I am \nannouncing my intention to develop broader legislation to remove \nbarriers to the redevelopment and restoration of brownfields.\n  Brownfields are abandoned, idled, or under-used commercial or \nindustrial properties at which development or expansion is hindered by \nthe presence, or potential presence of hazardous substantives. \nCountless numbers of brownfield sites blight our communities, pose \nhealth and environmental hazards, erode our cities' tax base, and \ncontribute to urban sprawl. In fact, in 210 cities surveyed by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, an estimated 21,000 brownfields sites covering \nmore than 81,000 acres were identified. But, we stand to reap enormous \neconomic, environmental, and social benefits with the successful \nredevelopment of brownfield sites. The redevelopment of brownfields \ncapitalizes on existing infrastructure, creates a robust tax base for \nlocal governments, attracts new businesses and jobs, mitigates urban \nsprawl, and reduces the environmental and health risks to communities.\n  Yet, many of these contaminated sites sit abandoned because of the \npresence of hazardous substances. Developers that would otherwise \nrestore these properties choose not to for fear of becoming tangled in \nliability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \nand Liability Act of 1980, commonly referred to as Superfund. I believe \nit is critical that Congress take action to ensure that the federal \ngovernment provides funding and incentives to recycle our nation's \ncontaminated land, remove barriers to development, and ally perceived \nfears associated with Superfund liability. The bills I am introducing \ntoday are a step toward resolving those concerns.\n  Let me take a moment to take a moment to explain each one.\n  The first bill I am introducing today is the ``State and Local \nBrownfields Revitalization Act of 2000.'' This legislation would \nauthorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to establish and implement a \nprogram to assist state, regional, and local governments in the \nremediation and restoration of brownfields sites tied to the quality, \nconservation, and sustainable use of the nation's waterways and \nwatershed ecosystems.\n  Additionally, this bill would provide authority to the Corps to \nconduct site characterization and planning, site design and \nconstruction, environmental restoration, and preparation for site \ndevelopment on brownfields sites owned by state, regional, or local \ngovernments. When selecting these projects, the Corps must consider \nwhether the project would improve public health and safety, encourage \nsustainable economic and environmental redevelopment in areas serviced \nby existing infrasture, and help cure or expand parks, greenways, or \nother recreational property.\n  Activities by the Corps would be contingent upon a 35 percent match \nin cash or in-kind contribution by the state, regional, or local \ngovernment. The bill limits the Corps to spending $3,250,000 on an \nindividual site. However, the Secretary of the Army could increase the \ncap to $5,000,000 if he determines that the size of the site or the \nlevel of contamination warrants additional funds. To carry out the \nprovisions of this Act, the bill authorizes annual appropriations of \n$100 million for fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n  I believe this bill would make a significant, positive contribution \nto the revitalization of our communities. Recently, I toured two sites \nalong the banks of the Woonasquatucket River in Providence. At the turn \nof the century these sites housed a woollen mill and a lace and braid \nfactory. They have been abandoned, but debris and contamination soils \nremain. They also threaten the river and the children that inevitably \nexplore these abandoned properties. City officials and local residents \nhave a wonderful vision for the cleanup of these sites that would \ncreate a bike path and a park along the Woonasquatucket River. This \neffort is integral to the success of the Woonasquatucket River Greenway \nProject, a public-private initiative to increase recreational and green \nspace in low-income neighborhoods, thereby promoting economic \nreinvestment in the area.\n  Despite selection of this project as a federal Brownfields Showcase \nCommunity and contributions totaling over $1 million by the City and \nState, the community is unable to complete remediation activities. And, \nbecause the area is intended for use as a local park and will not \ngenerate an income stream, the community cannot utilize a loan. In the \nmeantime, the area remains an eyesore. This bill would revitalize the \nneighborhoods surrounding the Woonasquatucket River, as well as many \nother projects around the country.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers is not new to brownfields redevelopment. \nThe Corps currently conducts pre-remedial activities at brownfields \nsites for EPA on a fee-for-service basis. However, current law \nprecludes it from carrying out the necessary cleanup activities. In \naddition, the Corps is limited to conducting activities for which EPA \nwill provide reimbursement. I believe that EPA's brownfields budget is \ninadequate\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nto complete the task at hand. My bill will address these deficiencies \nand spur revitalization at many sites.\n  The second bill (S. 2334), which I am introducing with Senator \nJeffords addresses two key deficiencies in current law. It would expand \nthe definition of a targeted area to include any brownfield site \nlocated within a metropolitan statistical area making the current tax \nincentives more useful; and extending it for an additional six years.\n  Under current law, parties that remediate brownfields sites in \ntargeted areas are eligible to expense, or deduct, the costs of \nenvironmental restoration in the year the costs are incurred. A \ntargeted area is any population census tract with a poverty rate of \nmore than 20 percent, any empowerment zone or enterprise community, or \nany site deemed to an EPA pilot project before February 1, 1997. This \ntax incentive is scheduled to expire at the end of 2001.\n  The vast underutilization of the existing tax incentive highlights \nthe need for a re-examination of the goals we are pursuing. As chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste \nControl, and Risk Assessment, I have heard complaints that parties \neager to utilize the existing federal tax incentive have not done so \nfor one of two reasons. The first reason is the limitation on the areas \ncovered by the incentive. Unless the project constitutes an early EPA \npilot project or lies within an impoverished community, the tax \nincentive does not apply. In addition, the tax incentive expires \nfrequently, which creates uncertainty.\n  Let me provide an example. Let us assume that a party is willing to \npurchase contaminated land and clean it up in order to redevelop the \nproperty. However, a party may be unable to make the acquisition and \ncomplete the remediation within one calendar year. Uncertain as to \nwhether the tax incentive will be reinstated in the next year may \ndiscourage the party from taking on the risk. To address this issue, \nthe bill extends the tax incentive until the end of calendar year 2007. \nI believe that this will provide certainty to those who see the wisdom \nin redeveloping these untapped properties of value.\n  In addition, I am pleased to add my name as co-sponsor to the Small \nBusiness Brownfield Redevelopment Act of 1999 (S. 1408) offered by \nSenators Jeffords, Moynihan, Schumer, Lautenberg, Lieberman, and Leahy. \nThis bill is an important component of my vision for brownfields \nredevelopment throughout the nation. S. 1408 provides $50 million to \nthe Small Business Administration to finance projects that assist \nqualified small businesses, or prospective small business owners, in \ncarrying out site assessment and cleanup activities at brownfields \nsites. I believe that this bill will assist small businesses in Rhode \nIsland and the country cleanup brownfield sites.\n  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that brownfields are a \ncritical national issue, because abandoned or underused properties dot \nevery community, large and small. The bills I have introduced and co-\nsponsored today are critical components of the bigger picture, but we \ncan do more. To complement these initiatives, I am announcing today \nthat I intend to work on legislation to provide funding through the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency for assessment and cleanup of \nbrownfields, and clarify liability to encourage the transfer of \nproperty. I would also like to provide assurances that while we work to \nfacilitate state cleanup programs, EPA will take action at a \nbrownfields site when necessary to protect human health and the \nenvironment.\n  As I have studied CERCLA and Rhode Island's Superfund sites, I have \nheard from many people of all political stripes that brownfields \nlegislation can be achieved on a bipartisan basis. They have urged us \nto address the issues as soon as possible. I have visited brownfields \nsites in Rhode Island and have seen the potential that exists to \nrevitalize our communities if we can provide sufficient funding, \nclarify liability issues, and remove other barriers to redevelopment. I \nam hopeful that if we work in a bipartisan manner, we will be \nsuccessful in passing brownfields legislation that the President can \nsign this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 2336. A bill to authorize funding for networking and information \ntechnology research and development at the Department of Energy for \nfiscal years 2001 through 2005, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   networking and information technology research and development of \n                          energy missions act\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nthe ``Networking and Information Technology Research and Development \nfor Department of Energy Missions Act,'' which is cosponsored by \nSenators Craig, Schumer, and Murray.\n  This bipartisan bill is in recognition of the critical contributions \nand future potential of computing programs within the Department of \nEnergy's Office of Science. These programs have played a key role in \nthe development of high performance computing, networking, and \ninformation technology. Some of their notable accomplishments have \nincluded: the establishment of the first national supercomputer center, \nthe development of mathematical algorithm libraries for high \nperformance computing, the development of a critical interface and \nother software packages to support high speed parallel interconnection \nof supercomputers, and the development of a fundamental component of \nhow information is routed on the internet. Recent recognition of the \nscientists supported by this program have included: the 1998 Fernbach \naward; the 1998 Gordon Bell prize; awards for the best overall paper as \nwell and the best of show award at the Supercomputing 1998 conference; \nthe best paper and a number of special awards at the Supercomputing \n1999 conference, the Maxwell prize in applied mathematics, and the 2000 \nNorbert Wiener Prize in applied mathematics.\n  The future potential of these programs is immense and not limited to \nthe computation, networking, and information sciences. There is also \ngreat potential for helping not only the mission needs of the \nDepartment of Energy but also the broader scientific community and the \npublic through increased understanding of biological systems, energy \nand environmental systems, chemical, physical, and plasma systems, and \nhigh energy and nuclear systems. This understanding is key to our more \nefficient and environmentally friendly production and utilization of \nenergy and material goods.\n  The notable features of the bill include: an authorization for \nincreased funding similar in scope to what is proposed in the House of \nRepresentatives for the National Science Foundation computational \nefforts; an open competition for funding; a collaborative program \nbetween DOE program offices; building partnerships between \nlaboratories, universities, and industry; a focus on solutions to \nnetworking and information technology problems that are critical to the \nachieving DOE missions; and management of funding provided to NNSA \nlaboratories administered by the sponsoring program of the Department. \nThis last provision is consistent with the legislation which created \nthe NNSA in that it maintains accountability for new money authorized \nby this bill in DOE civilian programs so that such funding will remain \nwithin the purview of civilian programs under the oversight of the \nauthorizing committee for this legislation, while maintaining the \nprinciple that funding at laboratories under the purview of the NNSA be \nconsistent with their general programmatic missions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``Networking and Information \n     Technology Research and Development for Department of Energy \n     Missions Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Department of Energy, especially in its Office of \n     Science research programs, has played a key role in the \n     development of high performance computing, networking and \n     information technology. Important contributions by the \n     Department include pioneering the concept of remote, \n     interactive\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\n     access to supercomputers; developing the first interactive \n     operating system for supercomputers; establishing the first \n     national supercomputer center; laying the mathematical \n     foundations for high performance computing with numerical \n     linear algebra libraries now used by thousands of researchers \n     worldwide; leading the transition to massively parallel \n     supercomputing by developing software for parallel virtual \n     machines; and contributing to the development of the Internet \n     with software that is now used in the TCP/IP system \n     responsible for routing information packages to their correct \n     destinations.\n       (2) The Department of Energy's contributions to networking \n     and information technology have played a key role in the \n     Department's ability to accomplish its statutory missions in \n     the past, in particular through the development of remote \n     access to its facilities.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals a refundable credit against income tax for the purchase of \nprivate health insurance, and to establish State health insurance \nsafety-net programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE FAIR CARE FOR THE UNINSURED ACT\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, in introducing the Fair Care for \nthe Uninsured Act of 2000, legislation aimed at ensuring that all \nAmericans, regardless of income, have a basic level of resources to \npurchase health insurance.\n  As we all know, the growing ranks of uninsured Americans--currently \n44 million and increasing at a rate of 100,000 per month--remains a \nmajor national problem that must be addressed as Congress considers \nimprovements to our healthcare delivery system. The uninsured are three \ntimes as likely not to receive needed medical care, at least twice as \nmore likely to need hospitalization for avoidable conditions like \npneumonia and diabetes, and four times more likely to rely on an \nemergency room or have no regular source of care than Americans who are \nprivately insured.\n  The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act represents a major step toward \nhelping the uninsured obtain health coverage through the creation of a \nnew tax credit for the purchase of private health insurance, a concept \nwhich enjoys bipartisan support.\n  This legislation directly addresses one of the main barriers which \nnow inhibits access to health insurance for millions of Americans: \ndiscrimination in the tax code. Most Americans obtain health insurance \nthrough their place of work, and for good reason: workers receive their \nemployer's contribution toward health insurance completely free from \nfederal taxation (including payroll taxes). This is effectively a $120 \nbillion per year federal subsidy for employer-provided health \ninsurance. By contrast, individuals who purchase their own health \ninsurance get virtually no tax relief. They must buy insurance with \nafter-tax dollars, forcing many to earn twice as much income before \ntaxes in order to purchase the same insurance. This hidden health tax \npenalty effectively punishes people who try to buy their insurance \noutside the workplace.\n  The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act would remedy this situation by \ncreating a parallel system for working families who do not have access \nto health insurance through the workplace. Specifically, this \nlegislation creates a refundable tax credit of $1,000 per adult and up \nto $3,000 per family (indexed for inflation), for the purchase of \nprivate health insurance; would be available to individuals and \nfamilies who don't have access to coverage through the workplace or a \nfederal government program; enables individuals to use their credit to \nshop for a basic plan that best suits their needs which would be \nportable from job to job; and allows individuals to buy more generous \ncoverage with after-tax dollars. And of course the states could \nsupplement the credit.\n  This legislation complements a bipartisan consensus which is emerging \naround this means for addressing the serious problem of uninsured \nAmericans: Instead of creating new government entitlements to medical \nservices, tax credits provide public financing to help uninsured \nAmericans buy private health insurance. Representative Dick Armey has \nbeen a leader in this field for some time now, having introduced last \nyear similar legislation in the House of Representatives. And just \nrecently, Senators Jeffords and Breaux introduced their own version of \nhealth insurance tax credit proposal here in the Senate. I applaud \ntheir efforts for advancing this important public policy initiative.\n  A tax credit for the purchase of insurance would make it possible for \nmany more people to obtain insurance, thereby helping to lower the \ntotal cost of insurance. In reducing the amount of uncompensated care \nthat is offset through cost shifting to private insurance plans, and in \nsubstantially increasing the insurance base, a health insurance tax \ncredit will help relieve some of the spiraling costs of our health care \ndelivery system. It would also encourage insurance companies to write \npolicies geared to the size of the credit, thus offering more options \nand making it possible for low income families to obtain coverage \nwithout paying much more than the available credits.\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\n  It is time that we reduced the tax bias against families who do not \nhave access to coverage through their place of work or existing \ngovernment programs, and to encourage the creation of an effective \nmarket for family-selected and family-owned plans, where Americans have \nmore choice and control over their health care dollars. The Fair Care \nfor the Uninsured Act would create tax fairness where currently none \nexists by requiring that all Americans receive the same tax \nencouragement to purchase health insurance, regardless of employment.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in endorsing this \napproach to provide people who purchase health insurance on their own \nsimilar tax treatment as those who have access to insurance through \ntheir employer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Reed, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Levin, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Moynihan, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2338. A bill to enhance the enforcement of gun violence laws; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nthe effective national firearms objectives for responsible, commonsense \n                       enforcement (enforce) act\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Kennedy, Durbin, Lautenberg, Reed, \nTorricelli, Levin, Robb, Moynihan, Boxer, Dodd, and Mr. Daschle, the \nEffective National Firearms Objectives For Responsible, Commonsense \nEnforcement Act. This bill, I believe, bridges the gap between those \nwho reflexively support the gun lobby and those who strongly support \ngun control.\n  The ENFORCE Act is the culmination of years of research into gun \ntracing and gun trafficking. It is the next phase in stopping gun \nviolence. It is a bill and an approach to gun crime that works smarter \nand works harder.\n  This bill works smarter by ridding us of many of the laws that have \nshielded illegal gun traffickers and dirty gun dealers from \nprosecution. It uses the latest in gun tracing data and ballistics \ntechnology to make it possible for law enforcement to zero in on the \nbad apples, throw the book at them, and leave the rest alone. It works \nharder by finally giving ATF the street agents they need to crack down \non high crime gun dealers and to prosecute more gun crimes.\n  Let me outline a few provisions in this legislation. First, this bill \nwill fund 500 new ATF agents and inspectors to crack down on dirty gun \ndealers. These new agents will target high-crime gun dealers who supply \nfirearms to criminals and juveniles and crack down on violent gun \ncriminals and illegal gun traffickers at gun shows, gun stores, and on \nthe streets.\n  ENFORCE will also give ATF the authority to investigate high crime-\ngun stores. Under current law, the ATF is only allowed to conduct one \nunannounced inspection of a licensed dealer a year. The bill would \nallow the ATF to conduct four compliance inspections annually of \nlicensed firearms dealers, importers, and manufacturers.\n  In addition, this legislation will authorize funds to hire an \nadditional 1,000 local, state and federal prosecutors to expand the \nProject Exile program in high gun-crime areas. In cases where federal \nlaw enforcement authorities defer to state prosecutors, this funding \nwould ensure that state prosecutors have sufficient resources. \nFurthermore, ENFORCE authorizes funding for federal prosecutors and gun \nenforcement teams to coordinate efforts with local law enforcement and \nto determine where federal prosecution is warranted.\n  ENFORCE will also create a comprehensive ballistics DNA testing \nnetwork. The Act would triple current funding for ballistics testing \nprograms to support the deployment of 150 ballistics imaging units, \nhelping to link bullets and shell casings to the crime-guns they were \nfired from.\n  ENFORCE will expand to 50 cities and counties the Youth Crime Gun \nInterdiction Initiative (YCGII), which would dramatically increase \ntracing of crime guns to find sources. Participating cities and \ncounties' law enforcement agencies would submit and share identifying \ninformation about crime guns and conduct law enforcement investigations \nregarding illegal youth users of firearms and illegal traffickers of \nfirearms to youth. The Secretary of the Treasury would provide an \nannual report on the types and sources of recovered crime guns and the \nnumber of investigations associated with YCGII.\n  The bill would also fund $10 million for smart gun technology \nresearch and development. New state-of-the-art innovations could limit \na gun's use to its owner or other authorized users--and could therefore \nprevent accidental shooting deaths of children, detect gun theft, and \nstop criminals from seizing and using the guns of police officers \nagainst them.\n  ENFORCE is a comprehensive package of measures that will strengthen \nthe enforcement of existing gun laws and target high crime-gun dealers \nto reduce gun violence and to keep firearms out of the hands of \nchildren and criminals. The gun lobby has been calling for more \nenforcement. This is as tough and effective an enforcement bill as ever \ndrafted. Gun rights and gun control supporters ought to step up to the \nplate and pass it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S1996-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1996-S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 309\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Alabama \n(Mr. Shelby) was added as a cosponsor of S. 309, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that a member of the uniformed \nservices shall be treated as using a principal residence while away \nfrom home on qualified official extended duty in determining the \nexclusion of gain from the sale of such residence.\n\n\n                                 S. 622\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n(Mr. Bayh) was added as a cosponsor of S. 622, a bill to enhance \nFederal enforcement of hate crimes, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 784\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

and\n       (D) investigate fully atrocities committed in Chechnya, \n     including those alleged in Alkhan-Yurt and Grozny, and \n     initiate, where appropriate, prosecutions against those \n     accused;\n       (5) the President of the United States of America should--\n       (A) affirm respect for human rights, democratic rule of \n     law, and international accountability as a foundation of \n     United States foreign policy;\n       (B) affirm respect for human rights, democratic rule of \n     law, and international accountability as a condition for \n     continued United States-Russian cooperation;\n       (C) conduct a full and comprehensive review of United \n     States foreign policy toward the Russian Federation with \n     respect to its conduct in Chechnya, and its implications for \n     United States-Russian relations;\n       (D) promote peace negotiations between the Government of \n     the Russian Federation and the leadership of the Chechen \n     Government through third-party mediation by the OSCE \n     Assistance Group in Chechnya, the United Nations, or other \n     appropriate parties;\n       (E) publicly and openly support societal forces in the \n     Russian Federation working to preserve democracy there, \n     including empowering human rights activists and promoting \n     programs designed to strengthen the independent media, trade \n     unions, political parties, and other institutions of a \n     democratic civil society there; and\n       (F) take further, more tangible steps to demonstrate to the \n     Government of the Russian Federation that the United States \n     strongly condemns its conduct in Chechnya and its \n     unwillingness to find a just political solution to the \n     conflict there, including--\n       (i) sponsoring a Resolution at the 56th annual meeting of \n     the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, \n     Switzerland, expressing the Commission's serious concern \n     about reports of very grave violations of human rights and \n     humanitarian law in Chechnya, and including provisions, such \n     as the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry, to \n     investigate accusations of violations of the Geneva \n     Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in \n     Time of War, and other international humanitarian law;\n       (ii) supporting the appointment of a United Nations Special \n     Rapporteur for Chechnya; and\n       (iii) placing the war in Chechnya at the top of the agenda \n     of all high-level diplomatic meetings involving the United \n     States and the Russian Federation; and\n       (6) the President of the United States should not reverse \n     actions taken under paragraph (5)(f) until the Government of \n     the Russian Federation has--\n       (A) acted forcefully and effectively to end human rights \n     violations by Russian soldiers in Chechnya;\n       (B) provided full and unimpeded access into and around \n     Chechnya to international monitors to assess and report on \n     the situation there and to investigate alleged atrocities and \n     war crimes;\n       (C) granted international humanitarian agencies full and \n     unimpeded access to Chechen civilians, including those in \n     refugee, detention, and ``filtration'' camps, or any other \n     facility where citizens of Chechnya are detained; and\n       (D) begun to investigate fully atrocities committed in \n     Chechnya, including those alleged in Alkhan-Yurt and Grozny, \n     and initiated, where appropriate, prosecutions against those \n     accused.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the \ncontinuing war in Chechnya and to remind the international community \nthat our lack of vigorous and sustained action to respond to the \nconflict there could be too easily interpreted by the Russian \nGovernment as indifference to it. We must act to again remind the newly \nelected President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, that he is \nresponsible for the conduct of Russian troops in and around Chechnya \nand has an obligation to ensure compliance with international \nhumanitarian law and human rights norms; and we must act to urge the \nGovernment of the Russian Federation and the leadership of the Chechen \nGovernment to immediately cease military operations in Chechnya and to \nseek a negotiated just settlement to the conflict there.\n  Today I am offering a Resolution which urges the Administration to \nsponsor a Resolution condemning the Russian Federation's conduct in \nChechnya at the annual United Nations Human Rights Commission meeting \nthat is currently underway in Geneva, Switzerland, to support the \nappointment of a U.N. Special Rapporteur for Chechnya, and to place the \nwar in Chechnya at the top of the agenda of all high-level diplomatic \nmeetings involving the United States and the Russian Federation. The \nUnited States must publicly and actively affirm respect for human \nrights, democratic rule of law and international accountability as a \nfoundation of United States policy and not simply pay them lip service.\n  Sunday night we watched as acting President Vladimir Putin was \nelected President of the Russian Federation. As the President of a \nfully sovereign state I do not question President Putin's authority to \ncombat what it perceives as terrorism on its own soil and to ensure the \nintegrity of its borders, nor do I dismiss credible reports of grave \nviolations of human rights on both sides of this war. I do, however, \ncondemn the continuing indiscriminate use of force by the Russian \nmilitary in Chechnya and the blatant disregard it continues to show for \ninternational humanitarian law there.\n  Last month the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard evidence and \ntestimony reporting that Russian forces in Chechnya have caused the \ndeaths of countless thousands of innocent civilians and the \ndisplacement of well over 250,000 innocents; forcibly relocated \nrefugee populations; and committed widespread atrocities including \nsummary executions, arbitrary detentions, torture, and rape. While they \nclaim to have begun to open up access to the region, the Russian \ngovernment continues to effectively deny international organizations \nfull and unimpeded access into Chechnya to assess and report on the \nsituation there, to investigate alleged atrocities and war crimes, and \nto provide humanitarian relief.\n\n  I am not alone in my concern about the situation in Chechnya. Last \nNovember both the House and Senate passed resolutions expressing grave \nconcern regarding the armed conflict in the North Caucasus region of \nthe Russian Federation and condemning the violence in Chechnya. On \nFebruary 24 of this year, the Senate unanimously agreed to Senate \nResolution 262, calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in \nChechnya, and Senate Resolution 261, regarding the detention of the \njournalist Andrei Babitsky. Finally, just a few weeks ago on March 9, \nSenate Resolution 269, regarding relations with the Russian Federation \ngiven its conduct in Chechnya, was referred to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  We have all read editorials on Chechnya in the news media written by \nour own colleagues, witnessed a joint conference on Chechnya by the \nCommonwealth of Independent States Inter-parliamentary Assembly and the \nEuropean Parliament, heard claims by a leading Russian human rights \nactivist who is also a member of the Russian Parliament offering fierce \ncriticism of the Russian government's efforts in Chechnya, and listened \nas just this past week at the annual meeting of the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission meeting in Geneva, Secretary Albright objected to the \nindiscriminate use of force against civilians in Chechnya and \nproclaimed that allegations of Russian human rights violations are \nserious and must be addressed urgently. In a phone call to congratulate \nPresident Putin on his victory in the Presidential election, President \nClinton expressed his hope that Mr. Putin would carry out impartial and \ntransparent investigations of reported human rights violations in \nChechnya and provide prompt and full access for international \norganizations and the press. But, Mr. President, even after all this \ncommentary, and numerous meetings designed to press the Russians to \nchange course, the situation has changed hardly at all.\n  I fully support Secretary Albright's decision to address the \nallegations of gross human rights abuses by Russian soldiers in \nChechnya in her address to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, and the \nPresident's raising this issue again in his phone call to President \nPutin, but the grave situation in Chechnya demands that we do more. The \nannual meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights provides a\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\nmajor forum for addressing human rights concerns and for expressing \ninternational commentary on the human rights performance of all \nnations. The Government of the Russian Federation must be held \naccountable for its conduct in Chechnya and should be forced to defend \nitself against allegations of grave human rights violations there, in \nthe full light of public scrutiny.\n  The administration should bring a resolution expressing the \nCommission's serious concern about reports of gross human rights abuses \nand other violations of humanitarian law in Chechnya, including \nprovisions urging the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry to \ninvestigate violations of the Geneva Convention and other international \nhumanitarian law. It must also support the appointment of a United \nNations Special Rapporteur for Chechnya to assess and report on the \nsituation there, and place the war in Chechnya at the top of the agenda \nof all high-level diplomatic meetings involving the United States and \nthe Russian Federation.\n  Mr. President, it is high time the United States expressed its \ncommitment to human rights, democratic rule of law, and international \naccountability through concrete action. We must send a message to the \nRussian Federation, as well as the international community, that \nrespect for these important principles will be a condition for \ncontinued cooperation with the United States. We must demand concrete \naction by the Government of the Russian Federation to end human rights \nviolations by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, to investigate, where \nappropriate, those accused of violations, and to ease the suffering of \ncivilians there. We must not be diverted by verbal commitments by the \nRussian leadership that never come to fruition. We need to exercise our \nleadership now. The international community and the people of Chechnya \ndeserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S2000-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2000-S2007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   LAUNCHING OUR COMMUNITIES' ACCESS TO LOCAL TELEVISION ACT OF 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             BAUCUS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENTS NOS. 2892-2893\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Robb) submitted two \namendments intended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. 2097) to \nauthorize loan guarantees in order to facilitate access to local \ntelevision broadcast signals in unserved and underserved areas, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 2892\n\n       On page 25, line 10, insert after ``local television \n     stations'' the following: ``, and related signals (including \n     high-speed Internet access and National Weather Service \n     broadcasts),''.\n       On page 30, strike line 9 and insert the following: ``means \n     by which local television broadcast signals, and related \n     signals (including high-speed Internet access and National \n     Weather Service broadcasts),''.\n       On page 33, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       (B) Additional priority.--Among projects receiving a \n     priority under subparagraph (A), the Board should also give \n     an additional priority to projects which also provide related \n     signals (including high-speed Internet access and National \n     Weather Service broadcasts).\n       On page 33, line 24, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(C)''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2893\n\n       On page 25, strike line 10 and all that follows through \n     page 33, line 25, and insert the following:\n     signals of local television stations, and related signals \n     (including high-speed Internet access and National Weather \n     Service broadcasts), for households located in unserved areas \n     and underserved areas.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Smith) proposes an amendment \nnumbered 2904.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the \nSenate is taking up today an important piece of legislation that will \nenhance our ability to protect the Nation's most valuable shoreline \nhabitats. This bill, S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act, is a great tribute, I think, to not only our \nleadership in the Senate but also to our late colleague, Senator John \nChafee. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and move it forward \nquickly, to get it into law.\n  S. 835 is an example of environmental policy based on partnership and \ncooperation--not on this top-down mandate, overburdensome Federal \nregulation, but a partnership and a cooperative effort. It shows you, \nwhen you have a partnership and have a cooperative effort and don't try \nto impose regulations, what you can do. This bill is a good example of \nthat. It promotes working together in a partnership situation with the \nStates, with local programs, and with the private sector.\n  This bill will make it possible to restore 1 million acres of habitat \nwith almost no cost to the taxpayer. Environmental success is what this \nis, and it is the kind of environmental success that I am very proud to \nsupport. This bill is yet one more of the many legacies of our friend \nand late colleague, Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island. He was the \nprincipal sponsor and a longtime champion of the estuary system in this \ncountry.\n  Last October, under his chairmanship, the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works reported out S. 835 by a voice vote. For the past 5 \nmonths, his son, Senator Lincoln Chafee, has carried forward the effort \nin the Senate and helped me immensely to get where we are today with \nthis legislation. I am grateful for his leadership. I know it was a \nspecial matter for him to lead on this issue and on this bill because \nof what his father had done on its behalf. So I am pleased to be a part \nof this effort, pleased as the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to bring this matter to the Senate for final passage.\n  To understand how important this act is for protecting the \nenvironment, one has to understand what estuaries are and how valuable \nthey are to our society.\n  An estuary is a bay, a gulf, a sound, or an inlet where fresh water \nfrom rivers and streams meet and mixes with saltwater from the ocean, \nor put simply, it is where the river meets the sea.\n  Examples of estuaries are coastal marshes, coastal wetlands, maritime \nforests, sea grass, meadows, and river deltas.\n  Estuaries represent some of the most environmentally and economically \nproductive habitats in the entire world.\n  Estuaries are critical for wildlife. Approximately 50 percent of the \nNation's migratory songbirds are linked to coastal estuary habitat, \nwhile near 30 percent of North American waterfowl rely upon coastal \nestuary habitat for wintering grounds. Threatened and endangered \nspecies depend upon estuaries for their survival.\n  Estuaries also play a major role in commercial and recreational \nfishing as well. Approximately 70 percent of the commercial fish catch, \nand 80 to 90 percent of recreational fish catch, depend in some way on \nestuaries. Obviously these fish swim up into those estuaries and spawn, \nand those small fish work their way back into the oceans.\n  You may not realize it, but estuaries also contribute significantly \nto the quality of life that many of us enjoy as Americans. Over one-\nhalf of the entire population of the United States lives near a coastal \narea.\n  Traditionally, a great majority of Americans visit estuaries every \nyear to swim, to fish, to hunt, to dive, to bike, to learn, or just to \nview the beauty of the marshes and the wildlife.\n  For many States, this tourism provides enormous economic benefit, and \nit does in New Hampshire, as well as almost every State in the Union.\n  In fact, the coastal recreation and tourism industry is the second \nlargest employer in the Nation serving 180 million Americans each year.\n  These many attributes of estuaries are especially important to me \nbecause of the rich coastline of New Hampshire. We only have 18 or 19 \nmiles of it, but it is rich. New Hampshire estuaries contribute to \ndynamic habitat, and they contribute to the beauty of the State as well \nas the economy. Recreational shell fishing alone in New Hampshire \ncontributes an estimated $3 million annually to the State and local \neconomy. New Hampshire is in the forefront of the national effort to \nidentify and protect sensitive estuary habitats.\n  The New Hampshire Great Bay, Little Bay and Hampton Harbor, and their \ntributary rivers joined the National Estuary Program in July 1995 as \npart of the New Hampshire Estuaries Project.\n  The Great Bay estuary has a rich cultural history. Its beauty and \nresources attracted the Paleo Indians in the area nearly 6,000 years \nago. It was also the site of a popular summer resort during the 1800s, \nas well as a shipyard.\n  As a Senator from New Hampshire, I am proud to be involved in this \nhistorical and ecological resource, and to preserve it for future \ngenerations.\n  What we do in environmental matters we should do not for the next \nelection, and not for somebody's business bottom line, but for the next \ngeneration--for the generations of our grandchildren and their \ngenerations to come.\n  That is why we make these decisions to preserve these estuaries so \nthat 1,000 years from now our descendents can say: We can see an \nestuary because those guys stood up when it counted and they saved them \nfor us.\n\n  That is a great legacy.\n  Unfortunately, though, many of the estuaries around the United \nStates, including those in New Hampshire, have been harmed by excessive \nurbanization of surrounding areas. According to the EPA's National \nWater Quality Inventory, 38 percent of the surveyed estuary habitat is \nimpaired. S. 835 is a tremendous step to establishing a much needed \nrestoration program.\n  What does S. 835 do? It does not duplicate any existing efforts, but \ninstead it builds upon current restoration projects by establishing a \ncommunity-driven, incentive-based program while expanding EPA's ability \nto provide grants for conservation management plans.\n  It has a national strategy because a national strategy is vital in \norder to coordinate current and future restoration efforts among both \nFederal, State, and local programs. Sometimes estuaries have no State \nborders. They move across the borders of States and towns.\n  We have a collaborative council to accomplish this goal. S. 835 \nestablishes this council. It is chaired by the Secretary of the Army \nwith the participation of the Under Secretary for Oceans and \nAtmosphere, the Department of Commerce, the Administrator of EPA, and \nthe Secretary of Interior.\n  It will be authorized to distribute $315 million over 5 years to \ncommunity groups to implement restoration projects.\n  It establishes criteria to select projects; for example, quantity and \nquality of the habitat to be restored; criteria to minimize the Federal \nshare; criteria to address sources of pollution that would otherwise \nagain impair the\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nrestored habitat; and, criteria that fosters the development of cost-\neffective and innovative technologies.\n  This bill encourages local communities and the private sector to \ndevelop partnerships to implement restoration activities. Decisions of \nhow to restore these estuaries are made by the local communities.\n  Another key feature of the bill is that it ensures accountability \nthrough ongoing monitoring and evaluation. NOAA maintains a database of \nrestoration projects. Information and lessons learned from one project \ncan be incorporated into other restoration projects.\n  The council will publish the biannual report to Congress detailing \nthe progress made under the act. It allows Congress and the public to \nknow about the successes and failures of the projects and strategies \nunder this section.\n  S. 835 includes important provisions dealing with the National \nEstuaries Program, the Chesapeake Bay Region Program, and the Long \nIsland Sound.\n  I know that these provisions have been of particular importance to \nSenators Warner and Lieberman, and no doubt they will be addressing the \nimportance of these programs on the floor very soon.\n  However, I want to acknowledge the important role that the National \nEstuaries Program has played in raising national awareness on the value \nof these habitats.\n  The National Estuaries Program, established in 1988, demonstrates \nwhat we can accomplish when the Federal Government, the State \ngovernment, and the local government work together in partnership \nwithout all of the friction and without all the confrontation.\n  Participation in the program is voluntary, and it emphasizes \nwatershed planning and community involvement.\n  I have met with so many people at the local and State level on so \nmany of these environmental projects who are knowledgeable, smart, and \nwell-educated people who know these issues very well. They don't need \nto be dictated to by the Federal Government.\n  To date, 28 conservation plans under this program have been prepared \nfor designated estuaries. I am pleased that New Hampshire is in the \nprocess of developing its own conservation plan.\n  Unfortunately, though, the program does not have sufficient resources \nto adequately address all habitat restoration. Until now, in fact, only \nthe development of a plan could be funded--not their implementation. S. \n835 will change that.\n  This bill will increase the authorization for the program from $12 \nmillion to $25 million annually for 2001 and 2002.\n  Let me close by saying that there is overwhelmingly bipartisan \nsupport for this bill. It represents an approach to environmental \npolicy that should be the basis for solving environmental problems by \ndealing with these issues through cooperation, not confrontation. And \nthat is what this bill is all about.\n  Decisions that affect local communities are to be made by local \ncommunities. They use taxpayer dollars wisely and effectively.\n  This bill represents the sixth report by the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee since I became its chairman just a few months ago.\n  I include also the reauthorization of the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation Establishment Act, and a wetlands bill in Louisiana.\n  It is only the sixth in what I hope will be a long line of good, \nsolid, strong, bipartisan environmental bills.\n  We all breathe the same air. We all like to drink clean water. We all \nlike to walk the land and to have that land be clean and to enjoy the \nwildlife.\n  I have never been able to figure out why Democrats perhaps would like \nto do that more than Republicans, or vice versa. This is nonpartisan. \nThis is bipartisan.\n  This is good legislation, and many of these initiatives were very \nimportant to our beloved former colleague, John Chafee.\n  I thank Senator Baucus and my other committee colleagues, as well as \nSenators Lott and Daschle, for helping us to continue the tradition of \nbipartisan action on environmental matters. That is so much a part of \nthe legacy of John Chafee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 835, the \nEstuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act. Senator John H. Chafee was \nthe sponsor of this bill; indeed, it was one of his top environmental \npriorities this Congress. Like the many supporters of this bill, I \nbelieve this legislation is needed to turn the tide and start restoring \nthe valuable estuarine habitats that are literally disappearing along \nour Nation's coasts. I hope all of my colleagues in the House and \nSenate will join me in working towards its timely enactment.\n  I would like to briefly discuss the importance of estuaries to the \nhundreds of different animals that live in or near these waterbodies. \nEstuaries are defined as waterbodies where the river's current meets \nthe sea's tide. These waterbodies are truly unique areas where life \nthrives. The food chain begins in estuaries, and many of them produce \nmore harvestable human food per acre than the best Mid-western \nfarmland. An astonishing variety of life, including animals as diverse \nas lobsters, whooping cranes, manatees, salmon, otters, bald eagles, \nand sea turtles all depend on estuaries for their survival. The San \nFrancisco Bay area alone is home to approximately 255 bird species, 81 \nmammal species, 30 reptile species and 14 amphibian species. And we \ncannot forget the importance of estuaries to the human species. As you \nlook around the country--some of our most beloved cities: Boston, New \nOrleans, San Francisco, New York, Seattle--are located alongside \nestuaries.\n  While some may disagree, I would have to strongly argue that the most \nprecious estuary is Narragansett Bay, located in my home State of Rhode \nIsland. Rhode Island is ``the Ocean State;'' The anchor adorns our \nState flag; and we have an official State shell, the Quahog. And, we \nare known for our sailing, seafood and beaches. Tourism, fishing and \nother bay-related businesses fuel the regional economy. As a Rhode \nIslander, it is clear that our welfare depends on a clean, healthy, and \nproductive bay.\n  The bottom line is that we are not doing enough for these valuable \nresources. The combination of development and pollution in our coastal \nareas has resulted in a widespread decline in estuary habitat. \nEstuaries are national treasures, and they deserve a national effort to \nprotect and restore them.\n  The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act answers the growing \nchallenge of estuary restoration. It sets a goal of restoring one \nmillion acres of estuary habitat by the year 2010. This bill emphasizes \nthe crucial ingredients of successful habitat restoration projects: \neffective coordination among different levels of government; continued \ninvestment by public and private sector partners; and, most \nimportantly, active participation by local communities.\n  Some of the key provisions of the bill are: a $315 million \nauthorization over 5 years for habitat restoration projects; creation \nof a council to help develop a national strategy for habitat \nrestoration; and a cost-sharing requirement to help leverage Federal \ndollars. S. 835 also promotes ongoing restoration efforts by \nreauthorizing the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Long Island Sound \nEstuary Program.\n  And, the bill makes a significant and necessary change in the EPA's \nNational Estuary Program. Up until now, the 28 designated estuaries of \nnational significance--including Narragansett Bay--could only use \nFederal funds to develop conservation and management plans. This bill \namends the program to allow NEP grants to be used to implement the \nconservation measures included in those plans, and it doubles the \nauthorization for the National Estuary Program. Indeed, a central theme \nof this legislation is the need to carry out projects within existing \nplans and get moving with on-the-ground restoration activities.\n  Responding effectively to the growing threats to our bays, sounds and \nother coastal waters presents a tremendous challenge: Federal resources \nare scarce, the need is great, and the pressure on these areas is \nintensifying. Yet, I am encouraged by the enormous support--at the \nlocal, State and Federal levels--for taking action to arrest the \ndeterioration of our estuaries, and to reverse the trend through \nrestoration projects. And, these restoration\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nprojects do work. Simply by storing the flow of saltwater to a marsh, \nor dredging a salt pond to its original depth, we allow nature a chance \nto revive and flourish.\n  As the former Mayor of Warwick, RI, I have experienced first hand the \ncomplexity of restoring estuary habitat degraded by pollution. The City \nof Warwick surrounds Greenwich Bay, which contains some of the most \nproductive shellfish beds in Rhode Island. In 1992, bacterial \ncontamination closed the entire area to shell fishing. My city \nresponded with the Greenwich Bay Initiative, an ongoing effort to \nrestore the estuary. With help from the State, the Federal Government \nand the private sector, we rehabilitated sewer systems, installed \nmarina pump-out stations, reduced agricultural runoff and acquired \nsensitive land for open space conservation.\n  A lot of progress has been made towards restoring the health of the \nGreenwich Bay, but considerable work remains to be done. The challenge \nof estuary restoration is even greater at the national level. With the \naid of the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act, we can revive \nour most precious and productive estuary resources. When you consider \nthis bill, please remember that the beginnings of the food chain that \nsustain life on Earth dwell in the marshes and tidal pools that we seek \nto protect. I hope my colleagues will support this important bill.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express how pleased I am \nthat we will be passing S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act of 1999. This legislation, introduced by our former \ncolleague Sen. John Chafee, will reauthorize the National Estuary \nProgram at $25 million annually and will allow these funds to be used \nto help implement and develop estuary management plans. It will also \nset a goal of restoring 1 million acres of estuary habitat over the \nnext decade.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation because it \nwill help us restore and protect our nation's estuaries. Too many of \nour estuaries are endangered by various forms of pollution or from \noveruse and development. In North Carolina, we are still dealing with \nthe effects of last year's devastating hurricane season; the full \neffect on places like the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds are still being \nevaluated. This legislation will enable estuaries like the Albemarle \nand Pamlico Sounds to implement the restoration and management plans \nthat were developed several years ago. This legislation will help make \nthem healthier, more ecologically productive estuarine habitats.\n  Estuaries are home to a remarkably diverse wildlife population, and \nthey provide a ``safe haven'' for plant and animal species, many of \nwhich are endangered. They are essential habitats for many young fish \nspecies who need clean and healthy estuaries to spawn. They are also an \nimportant resting spot for many migratory bird species.\n  Estuaries are critical not only to environmental health, but to \neconomic health as well. They support commercial activities, such as \nshipping and fishing. They are a source of drinking water for coastal \nareas. They also provide recreation opportunities for residents and \nvisitors who want to boat, fish, or birdwatch.\n  In my state of North Carolina, our estuaries are of vital importance. \nNorth Carolina's estuarine system is the second largest in the \ncontinental United States, encompassing more than 2.2 million acres. \nOur coastal waters produce more than half the fish caught on the East \nCoast. North Carolina is also home to one of the last bay scallop \nfisheries in the United States. This industry depends upon submerged \naquatic seagrasses that are extremely sensitive to pollution and they \nmust be protected. Our estuary system is also home to large number of \npelicans, who years ago were nearly extinct but have now rebounded \ndramatically in their restored habitat. Nearly ten percent of North \nCarolina's coastal estuaries have been designated as ``Outstanding \nResource Waters'' by the state Environmental Management Commission. \nThese waters are some of the most valuable in the state, indeed in the \nnation. I believe we must fight hard to protect them for the future. \nThis legislation will help us do that.\n  The National Estuary Program has enabled nearly thirty estuaries to \ndevelop restoration and management plans--including the Albemarle and \nPamlico Sounds in North Carolina. This legislation is an important \ncomponent to insuring the continued good health of these estuaries, and \nI am extremely pleased to see it pass the Senate.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I'd like to say a few words about the man who \nintroduced this legislation, our friend and colleague, Senator John \nChafee. Senator Chafee was able to be a nonpartisan voice of reason on \na great many issues. I miss him dearly. This legislation is a tribute \nto his perseverance and ability to develop legislation that we all \nrecognize as a benefit to our nation as a whole. I thank him for his \ndedication, and I am pleased that Senator Lincoln Chafee is on hand for \nthe passage of this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement be placed in the Record \nfollowing the remarks of Senator Chafee on this legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 835, the \nEstuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1999. This legislation \nis absolutely vital to the future health of our nation's estuaries, \nincluding our largest and most productive estuary--the Chesapeake Bay, \nand Maryland's Coastal Bays, and I am proud to be an original co-\nsponsor of this measure.\n  H.L. Mencken once called the Chesapeake Bay a ``great outdoor protein \nfactory,'' a description which, perhaps more than any other, \nunderscores the critical importance of protecting and restoring \nestuarine ecosystems. Estuaries provide habitat to more than three-\nquarters of the fish and shellfish harvested in the United States. They \nare home to thousands of species of plants and animals, including many \nendangered and threatened species. They support millions of American \njobs and play a vital role in the quality of life that our citizens \nenjoy. But the health and productivity of our estuaries are being \ndegraded or destroyed by the tremendous increase in shoreline \npopulation and development, increasing point and non-point source \npollution and other activities. It is estimated that, over the past \ncentury, some estuaries have lost up to 90 percent of their original \nhabitat.\n  The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act seeks to reverse \nthese trends by setting the goal of restoring 1 million acres of \nestuarine habitat by the year 2010. It authorizes federal funding \ntotaling $315 million over the next 5 years for the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, in cooperation with NOAA, EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, to carry out estuary habitat restoration projects and provides \nincentives for local communities to participate in creative \npartnerships. It also reauthorizes the National Estuary Program and, \nfor the first time, enables EPA to provide grants to implement \nconservation and management plans as well as design the plans.\n  Also incorporated in this measure is S. 492, the Chesapeake Bay \nRestoration Act (CBRA), which I introduced together with Senators \nWarner, Robb, Mikulski and Santorum to reauthorize and enhance EPA's \nChesapeake Bay Program. Mr. President, the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) \nwas established in 1983 with the signing of the Chesapeake Bay \nAgreement which formally bound the Federal Government and the States to \nwork together to restore and protect the Bay. It is the oldest EPA \ngeographic program and the first estuary in the nation to be targeted \nfor restoration as a single ecosystem. EPA's participation in the CBP \nwas formally authorized in the Water Quality Act of 1987. The Act \nauthorized $3 million annually to support the activities of the \nAgency's Chesapeake Bay Program Office in Annapolis, Maryland which \ncoordinates Federal and State efforts to restore and protect the Bay \nand $10 million annually for matching Interstate Development grants.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Program has evolved considerably in the years \nsince it was first established and has become a model for other \nestuaries around the country and around the world. The Bay Program has \npioneered a wide range of pollution control initiatives, including \nbiological nutrient removal technology implemented at 42 wastewater \ntreatment facilities; various agricultural nonpoint source controls, \nsuch as nutrient management and integrated pesticide management being \nimplemented\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\non nearly two million acres of agricultural land; and implementation of \na basinwide ban on phosphate detergents and a national ban on \ntributylin. The Bay Program has also been a leader in establishing a \nlarge volunteer monitoring program; creating a sophisticated computer \nmodeling program; identifying atmospheric deposition of nitrogen as a \nsignificant pollution source for east coast estuaries; conducting an \nextensive habitat restoration program including the opening of hundreds \nof miles of prime spawning habitat to migratory fish through the \nconstruction of fish passages; and the restoration of submerged aquatic \nvegetation to support the filtering of nutrients as well as habitat for \nthe Bay's living resources. The CBP has also spawned landmark state \nlegislation such as nutrient management of farms, growth management and \nforest conservation and critical area protection.\n\n  The 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement expanded initial restoration \nefforts by targeting nutrient overenrichment as the Bay's major \nproblem, and establishing the goal to reduce by 40%, nutrients flowing \ninto the Bay by 2000. The pact included 28 other specific commitments \nto address key issues in living resources, water quality, population \ngrowth and development, public information and public access. The 1992 \nAmendments to the Agreement moved the Program upriver, committing the \n40% nutrient reduction goal to the ten major tributaries to the Bay, as \nwell as committing to retain the 40% nutrient reductions as a permanent \ncap to be extended beyond 2000.\n  There are signs that the general degradation of Chesapeake Bay has \nebbed, and actual restoration has begun. However, numerous problems \nremain. Rapid population growth and development are expected in the \nareas of the Bay watershed closest to its waters. Loadings of nitrogen \nand sediments to the Bay remain high. Toxic sediment and water column \ncontaminants are a problem in specific regions of concern and some \nother Chesapeake Bay locations. Of great concern are recent outbreaks \nof Pfiesteria-like organisms and the occurrence of lesions from other \nsources on striped bass and other commercial and recreationally \nimportant finfish in the Bay. Important food chain species and \npopulations of forage fish are also declining.\n  In order to address these problems and continue restoration efforts, \nthe CBRA reauthorizes and increases funding for EPA's Chesapeake Bay \nProgram from the current level of approximately $20 million to $30 \nmillion a year. It encourages and assists Chesapeake Bay Agreement \nsignatories in meeting nutrient reduction, water quality, toxics \nreduction and prevention and habitat restoration goals, and requires \nthat federal facilities within the watershed comply with nutrient \nreduction and other Agreement goals. The legislation also creates a new \nsmall watersheds program designed to help local groups preserve and \nrestore stream corridors. The initiative would make ``seed grants'' and \ntechnical assistance available to local governments, nonprofit \norganizations and citizens' groups involved in river and stream-\nrestoration projects. It is my hope that the legislation will enable \nthe Chesapeake Bay Program to continue its leadership and technology \ntransfer to other groups participating in the National Estuary Program, \nparticularly in the areas of nutrient reduction through new \ntechnologies, such as biological nutrient removal; air deposition of \nnitrogen to estuarine and coastal waters; computer modeling; and \nenvironmental indicators with an emphasis on measuring improvements to \nliving resources.\n  Mr. President, in my judgement, the provisions contained in S. 835, \nwill pay significant dividends in the years ahead by helping to \npreserve and enhance our nation's estuaries, while at the same time \nimproving the quality of life for our citizens. I want to commend the \nChairman and ranking member of the Committee, Senators Smith and \nBaucus, for moving this legislation to the Senate floor. In my \njudgement, the legislation is a real tribute and fitting legacy to the \nformer Chairman of the Committee and author of the legislation, John \nChafee. I also want to express my appreciation to the co-sponsors of \nthe Chesapeake Bay bill, Senators Warner, Mikulski, Robb and Santorum \nfor their assistance. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis measure.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Estuary \nHabitat Restoration Partnership Act, S. 835. When our late colleague, \nSenator John Chafee, introduced this bill, he did so because he \nunderstood the tremendous importance of estuaries to our national \neconomy and environment. At the same time, Senator Chafee was concerned \nabout the considerable challenges the nation's estuaries face, such as \nhabitat loss, concentration of upstream pollutants, and coastal \ndevelopment. S. 835 would enable us to move forward as a nation in \naddressing those challenges, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly happy to be here today because this \nlegislation, if passed, would have a real impact on the estuary nearest \nand dearest to my own heart, the Long Island Sound. Title 3 of the bill \nreauthorizes the Long Island Sound Office through 2005 and \nsignificantly increases the funding authorization. Last fall, with the \nConnecticut and New York delegations, I introduced S. 1632 to \nreauthorize the Office and provide significant new funding to implement \ncritical conservation and restoration projects which will directly \nimprove the health of the Sound. I am grateful to my colleagues for \nincluding that reauthorization in the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act.\n  Having grown up on the coast of Connecticut, I am well aware of the \nimportance of Long Island Sound to the region's economic health and \nquality of life. Water-quality-dependent activities such as commercial \nand recreational fishing, boating, and swimming contribute an estimated \n$5 billion to the regional economy each year. The Sound is the leading \nproducer of oysters along the east coast. In addition, despite the many \nindustrial facilities and residential developments along its shoreline, \nthe Sound is recognized nationally for its distinctive habitat types, \nincluding tidal wetlands, tidal flats, beaches, dunes, bluffs, rocky \ntidal areas, eelgrass, kelp beds, and natural and artificial reefs.\n  However, the Sound does experience many of the same challenges as \nother estuaries--residential, commercial, and industrial development \nhave increased pollution and removed or altered habitat, and excess \nnutrients have resulted in low levels of dissolved oxygen in the waters \nof the Sound.\n  The Long Island Sound estuary program predated the National Estuary \nProgram (NEP). As early as 1985, Congress recognized Long Island Sound \nas a national treasure when it appropriated funding for the Long Island \nSound Study to research, monitor, and assess the water quality of the \nSound. When the National Estuary Program was created in 1987, the Long \nIsland Sound became a charter member. In the intervening years, Federal \nand state government, business, labor, environmental groups, and local \ncommunities in Connecticut and New York have come together to make a \nsignificant commitment to cleaning up the Sound. More recently, in \n1994, the Governors of Connecticut and New York and the Administrator \nof the EPA jointly adopted the Long Island Sound Comprehensive \nConservation and Management Plan (CCMP) which incorporated the results \nof the Long Island Sound Study. Since 1985, Federal, state, and private \nfunds have been well spent on researching the existing conditions of \nthe Sound and identifying conservation and restoration needs.\n  These efforts bode well for the health of the Long Island Sound; \nhowever, much work remains to be done. Last fall, the Long Island Sound \nlobster fishery experienced a severe die-off, with losses in some ports \nas high as 90 percent. Preliminary research suggests that a combination \nof environmental stresses may have caused this dramatic collapse.\n  The time has come to move from identifying to implementing the \nconservation and restoration projects which will directly improve the \nwater quality and habitat of the Long Island Sound. The Estuary Habitat \nRestoration Partnership Act would help make this possible by leveraging \non-the-ground restoration work with Federal funding and by creating \nmarket-based incentives for the private sector to work with community-\nbased organizations and local governments on restoration efforts. This \nis an important\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nbill for my state and our country, and I look forward to seeing it pass \nthis body.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any additional statements \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the \nSenate is taking up today an important piece of legislation that will \nenhance our ability to protect the Nation's most valuable shoreline \nhabitats. This bill, S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act, is a great tribute, I think, to not only our \nleadership in the Senate but also to our late colleague, Senator John \nChafee. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and move it forward \nquickly, to get it into law.\n  S. 835 is an example of environmental policy based on partnership and \ncooperation--not on this top-down mandate, overburdensome Federal \nregulation, but a partnership and a cooperative effort. It shows you, \nwhen you have a partnership and have a cooperative effort and don't try \nto impose regulations, what you can do. This bill is a good example of \nthat. It promotes working together in a partnership situation with the \nStates, with local programs, and with the private sector.\n  This bill will make it possible to restore 1 million acres of habitat \nwith almost no cost to the taxpayer. Environmental success is what this \nis, and it is the kind of environmental success that I am very proud to \nsupport. This bill is yet one more of the many legacies of our friend \nand late colleague, Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island. He was the \nprincipal sponsor and a longtime champion of the estuary system in this \ncountry.\n  Last October, under his chairmanship, the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works reported out S. 835 by a voice vote. For the past 5 \nmonths, his son, Senator Lincoln Chafee, has carried forward the effort \nin the Senate and helped me immensely to get where we are today with \nthis legislation. I am grateful for his leadership. I know it was a \nspecial matter for him to lead on this issue and on this bill because \nof what his father had done on its behalf. So I am pleased to be a part \nof this effort, pleased as the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to bring this matter to the Senate for final passage.\n  To understand how important this act is for protecting the \nenvironment, one has to understand what estuaries are and how valuable \nthey are to our society.\n  An estuary is a bay, a gulf, a sound, or an inlet where fresh water \nfrom rivers and streams meet and mixes with saltwater from the ocean, \nor put simply, it is where the river meets the sea.\n  Examples of estuaries are coastal marshes, coastal wetlands, maritime \nforests, sea grass, meadows, and river deltas.\n  Estuaries represent some of the most environmentally and economically \nproductive habitats in the entire world.\n  Estuaries are critical for wildlife. Approximately 50 percent of the \nNation's migratory songbirds are linked to coastal estuary habitat, \nwhile near 30 percent of North American waterfowl rely upon coastal \nestuary habitat for wintering grounds. Threatened and endangered \nspecies depend upon estuaries for their survival.\n  Estuaries also play a major role in commercial and recreational \nfishing as well. Approximately 70 percent of the commercial fish catch, \nand 80 to 90 percent of recreational fish catch, depend in some way on \nestuaries. Obviously these fish swim up into those estuaries and spawn, \nand those small fish work their way back into the oceans.\n  You may not realize it, but estuaries also contribute significantly \nto the quality of life that many of us enjoy as Americans. Over one-\nhalf of the entire population of the United States lives near a coastal \narea.\n  Traditionally, a great majority of Americans visit estuaries every \nyear to swim, to fish, to hunt, to dive, to bike, to learn, or just to \nview the beauty of the marshes and the wildlife.\n  For many States, this tourism provides enormous economic benefit, and \nit does in New Hampshire, as well as almost every State in the Union.\n  In fact, the coastal recreation and tourism industry is the second \nlargest employer in the Nation serving 180 million Americans each year.\n  These many attributes of estuaries are especially important to me \nbecause of the rich coastline of New Hampshire. We only have 18 or 19 \nmiles of it, but it is rich. New Hampshire estuaries contribute to \ndynamic habitat, and they contribute to the beauty of the State as well \nas the economy. Recreational shell fishing alone in New Hampshire \ncontributes an estimated $3 million annually to the State and local \neconomy. New Hampshire is in the forefront of the national effort to \nidentify and protect sensitive estuary habitats.\n  The New Hampshire Great Bay, Little Bay and Hampton Harbor, and their \ntributary rivers joined the National Estuary Program in July 1995 as \npart of the New Hampshire Estuaries Project.\n  The Great Bay estuary has a rich cultural history. Its beauty and \nresources attracted the Paleo Indians in the area nearly 6,000 years \nago. It was also the site of a popular summer resort during the 1800s, \nas well as a shipyard.\n  As a Senator from New Hampshire, I am proud to be involved in this \nhistorical and ecological resource, and to preserve it for future \ngenerations.\n  What we do in environmental matters we should do not for the next \nelection, and not for somebody's business bottom line, but for the next \ngeneration--for the generations of our grandchildren and their \ngenerations to come.\n  That is why we make these decisions to preserve these estuaries so \nthat 1,000 years from now our descendents can say: We can see an \nestuary because those guys stood up when it counted and they saved them \nfor us.\n\n  That is a great legacy.\n  Unfortunately, though, many of the estuaries around the United \nStates, including those in New Hampshire, have been harmed by excessive \nurbanization of surrounding areas. According to the EPA's National \nWater Quality Inventory, 38 percent of the surveyed estuary habitat is \nimpaired. S. 835 is a tremendous step to establishing a much needed \nrestoration program.\n  What does S. 835 do? It does not duplicate any existing efforts, but \ninstead it builds upon current restoration projects by establishing a \ncommunity-driven, incentive-based program while expanding EPA's ability \nto provide grants for conservation management plans.\n  It has a national strategy because a national strategy is vital in \norder to coordinate current and future restoration efforts among both \nFederal, State, and local programs. Sometimes estuaries have no State \nborders. They move across the borders of States and towns.\n  We have a collaborative council to accomplish this goal. S. 835 \nestablishes this council. It is chaired by the Secretary of the Army \nwith the participation of the Under Secretary for Oceans and \nAtmosphere, the Department of Commerce, the Administrator of EPA, and \nthe Secretary of Interior.\n  It will be authorized to distribute $315 million over 5 years to \ncommunity groups to implement restoration projects.\n  It establishes criteria to select projects; for example, quantity and \nquality of the habitat to be restored; criteria to minimize the Federal \nshare; criteria to address sources of pollution that would otherwise \nagain impair the\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nrestored habitat; and, criteria that fosters the development of cost-\neffective and innovative technologies.\n  This bill encourages local communities and the private sector to \ndevelop partnerships to implement restoration activities. Decisions of \nhow to restore these estuaries are made by the local communities.\n  Another key feature of the bill is that it ensures accountability \nthrough ongoing monitoring and evaluation. NOAA maintains a database of \nrestoration projects. Information and lessons learned from one project \ncan be incorporated into other restoration projects.\n  The council will publish the biannual report to Congress detailing \nthe progress made under the act. It allows Congress and the public to \nknow about the successes and failures of the projects and strategies \nunder this section.\n  S. 835 includes important provisions dealing with the National \nEstuaries Program, the Chesapeake Bay Region Program, and the Long \nIsland Sound.\n  I know that these provisions have been of particular importance to \nSenators Warner and Lieberman, and no doubt they will be addressing the \nimportance of these programs on the floor very soon.\n  However, I want to acknowledge the important role that the National \nEstuaries Program has played in raising national awareness on the value \nof these habitats.\n  The National Estuaries Program, established in 1988, demonstrates \nwhat we can accomplish when the Federal Government, the State \ngovernment, and the local government work together in partnership \nwithout all of the friction and without all the confrontation.\n  Participation in the program is voluntary, and it emphasizes \nwatershed planning and community involvement.\n  I have met with so many people at the local and State level on so \nmany of these environmental projects who are knowledgeable, smart, and \nwell-educated people who know these issues very well. They don't need \nto be dictated to by the Federal Government.\n  To date, 28 conservation plans under this program have been prepared \nfor designated estuaries. I am pleased that New Hampshire is in the \nprocess of developing its own conservation plan.\n  Unfortunately, though, the program does not have sufficient resources \nto adequately address all habitat restoration. Until now, in fact, only \nthe development of a plan could be funded--not their implementation. S. \n835 will change that.\n  This bill will increase the authorization for the program from $12 \nmillion to $25 million annually for 2001 and 2002.\n  Let me close by saying that there is overwhelmingly bipartisan \nsupport for this bill. It represents an approach to environmental \npolicy that should be the basis for solving environmental problems by \ndealing with these issues through cooperation, not confrontation. And \nthat is what this bill is all about.\n  Decisions that affect local communities are to be made by local \ncommunities. They use taxpayer dollars wisely and effectively.\n  This bill represents the sixth report by the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee since I became its chairman just a few months ago.\n  I include also the reauthorization of the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation Establishment Act, and a wetlands bill in Louisiana.\n  It is only the sixth in what I hope will be a long line of good, \nsolid, strong, bipartisan environmental bills.\n  We all breathe the same air. We all like to drink clean water. We all \nlike to walk the land and to have that land be clean and to enjoy the \nwildlife.\n  I have never been able to figure out why Democrats perhaps would like \nto do that more than Republicans, or vice versa. This is nonpartisan. \nThis is bipartisan.\n  This is good legislation, and many of these initiatives were very \nimportant to our beloved former colleague, John Chafee.\n  I thank Senator Baucus and my other committee colleagues, as well as \nSenators Lott and Daschle, for helping us to continue the tradition of \nbipartisan action on environmental matters. That is so much a part of \nthe legacy of John Chafee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 835, the \nEstuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act. Senator John H. Chafee was \nthe sponsor of this bill; indeed, it was one of his top environmental \npriorities this Congress. Like the many supporters of this bill, I \nbelieve this legislation is needed to turn the tide and start restoring \nthe valuable estuarine habitats that are literally disappearing along \nour Nation's coasts. I hope all of my colleagues in the House and \nSenate will join me in working towards its timely enactment.\n  I would like to briefly discuss the importance of estuaries to the \nhundreds of different animals that live in or near these waterbodies. \nEstuaries are defined as waterbodies where the river's current meets \nthe sea's tide. These waterbodies are truly unique areas where life \nthrives. The food chain begins in estuaries, and many of them produce \nmore harvestable human food per acre than the best Mid-western \nfarmland. An astonishing variety of life, including animals as diverse \nas lobsters, whooping cranes, manatees, salmon, otters, bald eagles, \nand sea turtles all depend on estuaries for their survival. The San \nFrancisco Bay area alone is home to approximately 255 bird species, 81 \nmammal species, 30 reptile species and 14 amphibian species. And we \ncannot forget the importance of estuaries to the human species. As you \nlook around the country--some of our most beloved cities: Boston, New \nOrleans, San Francisco, New York, Seattle--are located alongside \nestuaries.\n  While some may disagree, I would have to strongly argue that the most \nprecious estuary is Narragansett Bay, located in my home State of Rhode \nIsland. Rhode Island is ``the Ocean State;'' The anchor adorns our \nState flag; and we have an official State shell, the Quahog. And, we \nare known for our sailing, seafood and beaches. Tourism, fishing and \nother bay-related businesses fuel the regional economy. As a Rhode \nIslander, it is clear that our welfare depends on a clean, healthy, and \nproductive bay.\n  The bottom line is that we are not doing enough for these valuable \nresources. The combination of development and pollution in our coastal \nareas has resulted in a widespread decline in estuary habitat. \nEstuaries are national treasures, and they deserve a national effort to \nprotect and restore them.\n  The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act answers the growing \nchallenge of estuary restoration. It sets a goal of restoring one \nmillion acres of estuary habitat by the year 2010. This bill emphasizes \nthe crucial ingredients of successful habitat restoration projects: \neffective coordination among different levels of government; continued \ninvestment by public and private sector partners; and, most \nimportantly, active participation by local communities.\n  Some of the key provisions of the bill are: a $315 million \nauthorization over 5 years for habitat restoration projects; creation \nof a council to help develop a national strategy for habitat \nrestoration; and a cost-sharing requirement to help leverage Federal \ndollars. S. 835 also promotes ongoing restoration efforts by \nreauthorizing the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Long Island Sound \nEstuary Program.\n  And, the bill makes a significant and necessary change in the EPA's \nNational Estuary Program. Up until now, the 28 designated estuaries of \nnational significance--including Narragansett Bay--could only use \nFederal funds to develop conservation and management plans. This bill \namends the program to allow NEP grants to be used to implement the \nconservation measures included in those plans, and it doubles the \nauthorization for the National Estuary Program. Indeed, a central theme \nof this legislation is the need to carry out projects within existing \nplans and get moving with on-the-ground restoration activities.\n  Responding effectively to the growing threats to our bays, sounds and \nother coastal waters presents a tremendous challenge: Federal resources \nare scarce, the need is great, and the pressure on these areas is \nintensifying. Yet, I am encouraged by the enormous support--at the \nlocal, State and Federal levels--for taking action to arrest the \ndeterioration of our estuaries, and to reverse the trend through \nrestoration projects. And, these restoration\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nprojects do work. Simply by storing the flow of saltwater to a marsh, \nor dredging a salt pond to its original depth, we allow nature a chance \nto revive and flourish.\n  As the former Mayor of Warwick, RI, I have experienced first hand the \ncomplexity of restoring estuary habitat degraded by pollution. The City \nof Warwick surrounds Greenwich Bay, which contains some of the most \nproductive shellfish beds in Rhode Island. In 1992, bacterial \ncontamination closed the entire area to shell fishing. My city \nresponded with the Greenwich Bay Initiative, an ongoing effort to \nrestore the estuary. With help from the State, the Federal Government \nand the private sector, we rehabilitated sewer systems, installed \nmarina pump-out stations, reduced agricultural runoff and acquired \nsensitive land for open space conservation.\n  A lot of progress has been made towards restoring the health of the \nGreenwich Bay, but considerable work remains to be done. The challenge \nof estuary restoration is even greater at the national level. With the \naid of the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act, we can revive \nour most precious and productive estuary resources. When you consider \nthis bill, please remember that the beginnings of the food chain that \nsustain life on Earth dwell in the marshes and tidal pools that we seek \nto protect. I hope my colleagues will support this important bill.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express how pleased I am \nthat we will be passing S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act of 1999. This legislation, introduced by our former \ncolleague Sen. John Chafee, will reauthorize the National Estuary \nProgram at $25 million annually and will allow these funds to be used \nto help implement and develop estuary management plans. It will also \nset a goal of restoring 1 million acres of estuary habitat over the \nnext decade.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation because it \nwill help us restore and protect our nation's estuaries. Too many of \nour estuaries are endangered by various forms of pollution or from \noveruse and development. In North Carolina, we are still dealing with \nthe effects of last year's devastating hurricane season; the full \neffect on places like the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds are still being \nevaluated. This legislation will enable estuaries like the Albemarle \nand Pamlico Sounds to implement the restoration and management plans \nthat were developed several years ago. This legislation will help make \nthem healthier, more ecologically productive estuarine habitats.\n  Estuaries are home to a remarkably diverse wildlife population, and \nthey provide a ``safe haven'' for plant and animal species, many of \nwhich are endangered. They are essential habitats for many young fish \nspecies who need clean and healthy estuaries to spawn. They are also an \nimportant resting spot for many migratory bird species.\n  Estuaries are critical not only to environmental health, but to \neconomic health as well. They support commercial activities, such as \nshipping and fishing. They are a source of drinking water for coastal \nareas. They also provide recreation opportunities for residents and \nvisitors who want to boat, fish, or birdwatch.\n  In my state of North Carolina, our estuaries are of vital importance. \nNorth Carolina's estuarine system is the second largest in the \ncontinental United States, encompassing more than 2.2 million acres. \nOur coastal waters produce more than half the fish caught on the East \nCoast. North Carolina is also home to one of the last bay scallop \nfisheries in the United States. This industry depends upon submerged \naquatic seagrasses that are extremely sensitive to pollution and they \nmust be protected. Our estuary system is also home to large number of \npelicans, who years ago were nearly extinct but have now rebounded \ndramatically in their restored habitat. Nearly ten percent of North \nCarolina's coastal estuaries have been designated as ``Outstanding \nResource Waters'' by the state Environmental Management Commission. \nThese waters are some of the most valuable in the state, indeed in the \nnation. I believe we must fight hard to protect them for the future. \nThis legislation will help us do that.\n  The National Estuary Program has enabled nearly thirty estuaries to \ndevelop restoration and management plans--including the Albemarle and \nPamlico Sounds in North Carolina. This legislation is an important \ncomponent to insuring the continued good health of these estuaries, and \nI am extremely pleased to see it pass the Senate.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I'd like to say a few words about the man who \nintroduced this legislation, our friend and colleague, Senator John \nChafee. Senator Chafee was able to be a nonpartisan voice of reason on \na great many issues. I miss him dearly. This legislation is a tribute \nto his perseverance and ability to develop legislation that we all \nrecognize as a benefit to our nation as a whole. I thank him for his \ndedication, and I am pleased that Senator Lincoln Chafee is on hand for \nthe passage of this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement be placed in the Record \nfollowing the remarks of Senator Chafee on this legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 835, the \nEstuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1999. This legislation \nis absolutely vital to the future health of our nation's estuaries, \nincluding our largest and most productive estuary--the Chesapeake Bay, \nand Maryland's Coastal Bays, and I am proud to be an original co-\nsponsor of this measure.\n  H.L. Mencken once called the Chesapeake Bay a ``great outdoor protein \nfactory,'' a description which, perhaps more than any other, \nunderscores the critical importance of protecting and restoring \nestuarine ecosystems. Estuaries provide habitat to more than three-\nquarters of the fish and shellfish harvested in the United States. They \nare home to thousands of species of plants and animals, including many \nendangered and threatened species. They support millions of American \njobs and play a vital role in the quality of life that our citizens \nenjoy. But the health and productivity of our estuaries are being \ndegraded or destroyed by the tremendous increase in shoreline \npopulation and development, increasing point and non-point source \npollution and other activities. It is estimated that, over the past \ncentury, some estuaries have lost up to 90 percent of their original \nhabitat.\n  The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act seeks to reverse \nthese trends by setting the goal of restoring 1 million acres of \nestuarine habitat by the year 2010. It authorizes federal funding \ntotaling $315 million over the next 5 years for the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, in cooperation with NOAA, EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, to carry out estuary habitat restoration projects and provides \nincentives for local communities to participate in creative \npartnerships. It also reauthorizes the National Estuary Program and, \nfor the first time, enables EPA to provide grants to implement \nconservation and management plans as well as design the plans.\n  Also incorporated in this measure is S. 492, the Chesapeake Bay \nRestoration Act (CBRA), which I introduced together with Senators \nWarner, Robb, Mikulski and Santorum to reauthorize and enhance EPA's \nChesapeake Bay Program. Mr. President, the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) \nwas established in 1983 with the signing of the Chesapeake Bay \nAgreement which formally bound the Federal Government and the States to \nwork together to restore and protect the Bay. It is the oldest EPA \ngeographic program and the first estuary in the nation to be targeted \nfor restoration as a single ecosystem. EPA's participation in the CBP \nwas formally authorized in the Water Quality Act of 1987. The Act \nauthorized $3 million annually to support the activities of the \nAgency's Chesapeake Bay Program Office in Annapolis, Maryland which \ncoordinates Federal and State efforts to restore and protect the Bay \nand $10 million annually for matching Interstate Development grants.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Program has evolved considerably in the years \nsince it was first established and has become a model for other \nestuaries around the country and around the world. The Bay Program has \npioneered a wide range of pollution control initiatives, including \nbiological nutrient removal technology implemented at 42 wastewater \ntreatment facilities; various agricultural nonpoint source controls, \nsuch as nutrient management and integrated pesticide management being \nimplemented\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\non nearly two million acres of agricultural land; and implementation of \na basinwide ban on phosphate detergents and a national ban on \ntributylin. The Bay Program has also been a leader in establishing a \nlarge volunteer monitoring program; creating a sophisticated computer \nmodeling program; identifying atmospheric deposition of nitrogen as a \nsignificant pollution source for east coast estuaries; conducting an \nextensive habitat restoration program including the opening of hundreds \nof miles of prime spawning habitat to migratory fish through the \nconstruction of fish passages; and the restoration of submerged aquatic \nvegetation to support the filtering of nutrients as well as habitat for \nthe Bay's living resources. The CBP has also spawned landmark state \nlegislation such as nutrient management of farms, growth management and \nforest conservation and critical area protection.\n\n  The 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement expanded initial restoration \nefforts by targeting nutrient overenrichment as the Bay's major \nproblem, and establishing the goal to reduce by 40%, nutrients flowing \ninto the Bay by 2000. The pact included 28 other specific commitments \nto address key issues in living resources, water quality, population \ngrowth and development, public information and public access. The 1992 \nAmendments to the Agreement moved the Program upriver, committing the \n40% nutrient reduction goal to the ten major tributaries to the Bay, as \nwell as committing to retain the 40% nutrient reductions as a permanent \ncap to be extended beyond 2000.\n  There are signs that the general degradation of Chesapeake Bay has \nebbed, and actual restoration has begun. However, numerous problems \nremain. Rapid population growth and development are expected in the \nareas of the Bay watershed closest to its waters. Loadings of nitrogen \nand sediments to the Bay remain high. Toxic sediment and water column \ncontaminants are a problem in specific regions of concern and some \nother Chesapeake Bay locations. Of great concern are recent outbreaks \nof Pfiesteria-like organisms and the occurrence of lesions from other \nsources on striped bass and other commercial and recreationally \nimportant finfish in the Bay. Important food chain species and \npopulations of forage fish are also declining.\n  In order to address these problems and continue restoration efforts, \nthe CBRA reauthorizes and increases funding for EPA's Chesapeake Bay \nProgram from the current level of approximately $20 million to $30 \nmillion a year. It encourages and assists Chesapeake Bay Agreement \nsignatories in meeting nutrient reduction, water quality, toxics \nreduction and prevention and habitat restoration goals, and requires \nthat federal facilities within the watershed comply with nutrient \nreduction and other Agreement goals. The legislation also creates a new \nsmall watersheds program designed to help local groups preserve and \nrestore stream corridors. The initiative would make ``seed grants'' and \ntechnical assistance available to local governments, nonprofit \norganizations and citizens' groups involved in river and stream-\nrestoration projects. It is my hope that the legislation will enable \nthe Chesapeake Bay Program to continue its leadership and technology \ntransfer to other groups participating in the National Estuary Program, \nparticularly in the areas of nutrient reduction through new \ntechnologies, such as biological nutrient removal; air deposition of \nnitrogen to estuarine and coastal waters; computer modeling; and \nenvironmental indicators with an emphasis on measuring improvements to \nliving resources.\n  Mr. President, in my judgement, the provisions contained in S. 835, \nwill pay significant dividends in the years ahead by helping to \npreserve and enhance our nation's estuaries, while at the same time \nimproving the quality of life for our citizens. I want to commend the \nChairman and ranking member of the Committee, Senators Smith and \nBaucus, for moving this legislation to the Senate floor. In my \njudgement, the legislation is a real tribute and fitting legacy to the \nformer Chairman of the Committee and author of the legislation, John \nChafee. I also want to express my appreciation to the co-sponsors of \nthe Chesapeake Bay bill, Senators Warner, Mikulski, Robb and Santorum \nfor their assistance. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis measure.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Estuary \nHabitat Restoration Partnership Act, S. 835. When our late colleague, \nSenator John Chafee, introduced this bill, he did so because he \nunderstood the tremendous importance of estuaries to our national \neconomy and environment. At the same time, Senator Chafee was concerned \nabout the considerable challenges the nation's estuaries face, such as \nhabitat loss, concentration of upstream pollutants, and coastal \ndevelopment. S. 835 would enable us to move forward as a nation in \naddressing those challenges, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly happy to be here today because this \nlegislation, if passed, would have a real impact on the estuary nearest \nand dearest to my own heart, the Long Island Sound. Title 3 of the bill \nreauthorizes the Long Island Sound Office through 2005 and \nsignificantly increases the funding authorization. Last fall, with the \nConnecticut and New York delegations, I introduced S. 1632 to \nreauthorize the Office and provide significant new funding to implement \ncritical conservation and restoration projects which will directly \nimprove the health of the Sound. I am grateful to my colleagues for \nincluding that reauthorization in the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act.\n  Having grown up on the coast of Connecticut, I am well aware of the \nimportance of Long Island Sound to the region's economic health and \nquality of life. Water-quality-dependent activities such as commercial \nand recreational fishing, boating, and swimming contribute an estimated \n$5 billion to the regional economy each year. The Sound is the leading \nproducer of oysters along the east coast. In addition, despite the many \nindustrial facilities and residential developments along its shoreline, \nthe Sound is recognized nationally for its distinctive habitat types, \nincluding tidal wetlands, tidal flats, beaches, dunes, bluffs, rocky \ntidal areas, eelgrass, kelp beds, and natural and artificial reefs.\n  However, the Sound does experience many of the same challenges as \nother estuaries--residential, commercial, and industrial development \nhave increased pollution and removed or altered habitat, and excess \nnutrients have resulted in low levels of dissolved oxygen in the waters \nof the Sound.\n  The Long Island Sound estuary program predated the National Estuary \nProgram (NEP). As early as 1985, Congress recognized Long Island Sound \nas a national treasure when it appropriated funding for the Long Island \nSound Study to research, monitor, and assess the water quality of the \nSound. When the National Estuary Program was created in 1987, the Long \nIsland Sound became a charter member. In the intervening years, Federal \nand state government, business, labor, environmental groups, and local \ncommunities in Connecticut and New York have come together to make a \nsignificant commitment to cleaning up the Sound. More recently, in \n1994, the Governors of Connecticut and New York and the Administrator \nof the EPA jointly adopted the Long Island Sound Comprehensive \nConservation and Management Plan (CCMP) which incorporated the results \nof the Long Island Sound Study. Since 1985, Federal, state, and private \nfunds have been well spent on researching the existing conditions of \nthe Sound and identifying conservation and restoration needs.\n  These efforts bode well for the health of the Long Island Sound; \nhowever, much work remains to be done. Last fall, the Long Island Sound \nlobster fishery experienced a severe die-off, with losses in some ports \nas high as 90 percent. Preliminary research suggests that a combination \nof environmental stresses may have caused this dramatic collapse.\n  The time has come to move from identifying to implementing the \nconservation and restoration projects which will directly improve the \nwater quality and habitat of the Long Island Sound. The Estuary Habitat \nRestoration Partnership Act would help make this possible by leveraging \non-the-ground restoration work with Federal funding and by creating \nmarket-based incentives for the private sector to work with community-\nbased organizations and local governments on restoration efforts. This \nis an important\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nbill for my state and our country, and I look forward to seeing it pass \nthis body.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any additional statements \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to comment for a \nmoment on some of the things that happened today. Yesterday, I \nintroduced legislation to provide permanent residency to Elian Gonzalez \nbecause I wanted to try to diffuse what I think is a very volatile \nsituation in south Florida. I believe Elian Gonzalez should be allowed \nto go to custody court and allow his family--all of his family from \nCuba, not just Juan Gonzalez--to come here so they could be free from \nany encumbrances or any threats or hostility toward them by Fidel \nCastro. They can sit down as a family, the way a family should, and try \nto work out the fate of Elian Gonzalez. If that could not be worked \nout, that it go to custody court.\n  Regretfully, we couldn't get enough people to support this action. So \nwe have postponed any action. Some have objected and caused a series of \ndelays which did not provide the opportunity for me to have a vote here \ntoday, which I regret. It is my sincere hope that the Attorney General \nover the next several days will not move to do something that I think \nwould be not only silly but dangerous and not in the best interests of \nElian Gonzalez--trying to drag this boy from his home in Miami and send \nhim off to Cuba.\n  I believe Senators should go on record and say how they feel about \nthis. I have heard some say, I don't want to be involved in a custody \nbattle. I don't either. That is not the job of a Senator. We are asking \nin this resolution, not to have a Senator interfere with a custody \nbattle, but to allow a custody proceeding to occur.\n  Right now, this is an immigration situation. Elian Gonzalez didn't \ncome here the way most people immigrate to the United States or \nimmigrate into the United States. He came here floating on a raft, \npicked up by fishermen after his mother died trying to get him here to \nfreedom.\n  He deserves his day in court. He deserves to be heard, like any child \nin America. I want that to happen worse than anything. I want all 100 \nSenators to speak on this. I hope that happens. I want to let Janet \nReno, the Attorney General, know that I urge her to take the time to \nthink this thing through, meet with Elian Gonzalez, talk with the \nfamily, and understand that it is in the best interests of this child \nthat his family, all of his family, come here from Cuba--that is what \nmy legislation does--on permanent residency status. They can go back \nanytime they want to. They are not provided citizenship. They can come \nhere of their own free will without Castro's influence. They can make a \ndecision about this little boy. That is the right thing to do.\n  I want to acknowledge a statement today made by the Vice President of \nthe United States, Al Gore, regarding Elian Gonzalez. He has today \nsupported this action that I have advocated, along with Senator Mack \nand Senator Graham of Florida, to have permanent residency status for \nElian Gonzalez and\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\nhis family. I commend the Vice President for what he did. It was a very \ncourageous action. He parted ways with his own administration to say \nthat this is the right thing to do. You have to give credit where \ncredit is due, and he gets all the credit in the world from me for \nhaving made that decision. I ask unanimous consent that his statement \nof March 30, today, regarding Elian Gonzalez, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Statement by Al Gore Regarding Elian Gonzalez, March 30, 2000\n\n       From the very beginning, I have said that Elian Gonzalez's \n     case is at heart a custody matter. It is a matter that should \n     be decided by courts that have the experience and expertise \n     to resolve custody cases--with due process, and based on \n     Elian's best interests.\n       It now appears that our immigration laws may not be broad \n     enough to allow for such an approach in Elian's case. That is \n     why I am urging Congress to pass legislation that is being \n     sponsored by Senators Bob Graham and Bob Smith--which would \n     grant permanent resident status to Elian and his family so \n     that this case can be adjudicated properly. I know that \n     Congressman Bob Menendez has introduced similar legislation \n     in the House as well.\n       Let us be clear that the real fault in this case lies with \n     the oppressive regime of Fidel Castro. Elian should never \n     have been forced to choose between freedom and his own \n     father. Now we must take action, here on our own shores, to \n     make sure that Elian's best interests are served.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will read a couple lines:\n\n       From the very beginning, I have said that Elian Gonzalez's \n     case is at heart a custody matter. It is a matter that should \n     be decided by the courts that have the experience and \n     expertise to resolve custody cases--with due process, and \n     based on Elian's best interests.\n\n  My sentiments exactly.\n\n       Let us be clear, the real fault in the case lies with the \n     regime of Fidel Castro. Elian should never have been forced \n     to choose between freedom and his own father. Now we must \n     take action, here on our own shores, to make sure that \n     Elian's best interests are served.\n\n  That is a very powerful statement. I commend the Vice President for \nmaking it. I hope the Vice President now can work with some of his \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who have been opposing this \nopportunity to have the permanent residency status on Elian Gonzalez.\n  This bill is a perfect solution for those who are not prepared to \ngrant full citizenship for this boy. This is a compromise, not full \ncitizenship, and it is not sending him back to Cuba. It is a \ncompromise. It is one on which I have worked for a long time. It is the \nperfect solution for those who are concerned that the Senate would be \nstepping into a custody matter. This bill makes this a custody case, as \nI just said. It removes the issue from the pro-Cuba or anti-Cuba \npolitics. It allows the issue to be settled by a judge who has the \nexpertise in family custody matters to resolve the status of Elian \nwithout any intimidation or any threats from Fidel Castro.\n  As I have stated, this is a decision the Attorney General has made. I \napplaud the Vice President's endorsement, and I hope and plead with him \nto pick up the telephone, call some of his former colleagues, and urge \nthem to support this legislation or urge Janet Reno to pull back from \nthis insistence that Elian Gonzalez not have permanent residency \nstatus.\n  I will have more to say on this when we return on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/30/senate-section/article/S2021-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 3, 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.
