Tewell, the Fifth \nAvenue Presbyterian Church, New York, NY, offered the following prayer:\n  Will you pray with me.\n  Our Lord and our God, in this era of violence and moral confusion, we \nask Your richest blessings to be poured out on the United States of \nAmerica. We thank You for the destiny that You have given to us to be a \nliving illustration of the righteousness and justice that You desire \nfor all nations. Today we pray for the women and men in the United \nStates Senate who work for long hours fulfilling their enormous \nresponsibilities. They sometimes expend an incredible amount of energy \non an issue, only to see it voted down. So often the good things they \ntry to do meet with stubborn resistance. Their physical stress is \naggravated as emotions are stretched and strained in this pressure \ncooker of responsibility.\n  Gracious God of love, protect the Senators from going beyond their \nhuman limitations where burnout brings discouragement. Make them wise \nin their responsibilities to their families, themselves, and most of \nall to You. Grant them the humility to remember their need for Sabbath \nrest, daily relaxation, and spiritual renewal. Most of all, O God, \nteach the Members of the Senate and all leaders in our Nation to wait \nupon You and thus renew their strength. May we put You first in our \nlives by remembering the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``They \nthat wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up \nwith wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary, they shall \nwalk and not faint.'' We pray in the strong name of the One who was \nnever in a hurry, yet finished the work He came to do. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6159-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof the defense authorization bill and immediately begin debate on the \nAllard amendment regarding the Civil Air Patrol. A vote in relation to \nthe Allard amendment has been ordered for 10 a.m. I understand \ndiscussions are still continuing with regard to that amendment. Other \namendments will be offered, I am sure. They are pending. I am sure \nSenators will want to have them offered and considered one way or \nanother today. There will be votes throughout the day.\n  It is the intention of the managers--and certainly my intention--to \ncomplete action on this bill. I urge the managers to complete action \nduring today, not tonight. There are a number of Senators who are \nplanning on proceeding to their States tonight, late tonight, or early \nin the morning, so we really need to get this legislation completed.\n  I commend the managers on both sides of the aisle for the work they \nhave done, but I do think we need to get a definite list of amendments \nlocked in. Otherwise, I am sure some Senators will continue to think of \nideas they may want to have addressed. If Senators have amendments they \nwant to have considered today, they need to see the managers during \nthis next vote. After that, we hope to limit the amendments, limit the \ntime, get the votes, and complete this work. This is very important \nlegislation that needs to be completed and must be completed before \ntonight.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6159-6", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, this Amendment will give the Department of \nDefense the ability to significantly strengthen the dental benefits for \nover 270,000 of our nation's military retirees and their family \nmembers.\n  The TRICARE retiree dental program began on February 1, 1998 and is \nan affordable plan paid for exclusively by retiree premiums. According \nto the Department, the enrollment in the program has exceeded all \nprojections. While current law covers the most basic dental procedures, \nthe Department of Defense does not have the flexibility to expand their \nbenefits without a legislative change. Our nation's military retirees \nhave expressed a desire to both the Department and the contractors for \nmore services, and are willing to pay a reasonable price for these \nextra benefits.\n  Currently, the retiree dental program is limited to an annual \ncleaning, filings, root canals, oral surgeries and the like. This \namendment would change the law to allow, but not mandate, the \nDepartment the opportunity to offer an expanded list of benefits such \nas dentures, bridges and crowns, which are needs characteristic of our \nnation's retired military members. If the Department decided to offer \nthese service, they would continue to be paid for by member premiums.\n  In conclusion, I would ask the support of all my colleagues for this \nimportant amendment to allow the Department to give the needed dental \nservices to our valued military retires. Thank you for the time.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 414\n\n (Purpose: To provide $6,000,000 (in PE 604604F) for the Air Force for \n the 3-D advanced track acquisition and imaging system, and to provide \n                               an offset)\n\n       On page 29, line 12, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 14, decrease the amount by $6,000,000.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n           3-d advanced track acquisition and imaging system\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of additional funds \nto be made available for Air Force Research, Development, Test and \nEvaluation in the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of Defense Authorization \nmeasure to be used to complete development of a state-of-the-art 3 \ndimensional optical imaging and tracking instrumentation data system.\n  The 3 Data System is a laser radar system that provides high fidelity \ntime, space, positioning information (TSPI) on test articles during \nflight. The instrumentation can be applied to air, ground, and sea \ntargets. Additionally, it will provide the potential capability for \nover-the-horizon tracking from an airborne platform or pedestal mounted \nground platform. It includes a multi-object tracking capability that \nwill allow simultaneous tracking of up to 20 targets throughout their \nprofile. The system will enable testing of advanced smart weapon \nsystems; force-on-force exercises where multiple aircraft and ground \nvehicle tracking is involved; over water scoring of large footprint \nautonomous guided and unguided munitions; and enable an improvement to \nexisting aging radar presently in service. It is mobile and can support \ntesting at other major ranges and locations in support of other \nService's requirements.\n  The Air Force has identified the 3-Data System as having high \nmilitary value as it will enable the effective evaluation of the \nperformance of advanced weapon systems to be utilized in future \nconflicts. The Air Force has informed me that precision engagement is \none of the emerging operational concepts in Joint Vision 2010. The 3-\nData system would provide a capability to effectively evaluate the \nperformance of advanced precision guided munitions and smart weapons \nprior to their use in a wartime environment. It would also directly \nsupport ongoing activities abroad through Quick Reaction Tasking that \nmay require a multiple object tracking device to evaluate engagement \nprofiles. This requirement is documented through 46th Test Wing \nstrategic planning initiatives, developmental program test plans, and \nmunitions strategic planning roadmaps.\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\n  The Air Force is presently attempting to meet this requirement \nthrough existing radar systems and optical tracking systems which \ncannot track multiple objects to the fidelity levels required and which \nrequire extensive post-mission data reduction times. This system will \nprovide the capability to effectively track multiple targets \nsimultaneously.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Committee for their willingness to support \nthis amendment. The 3-Data System will play a important role in \nenabling the Air Force to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of \nmultiple smart weapons and their delivery systems during their \ndevelpoment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 415\n\n    (Purpose: To amend a per purchase dollar limitation of funding \nassistance for procurement of equipment for the National Guard for drug \ninterdiction and counter-drug activities so as to apply the limitation \n                  to each item of equipment procured)\n\n       In title III, at the end of subtitle D, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 349.

Mr. President, my amendment is co-sponsored by the Senate \nMajority Leader, Senator Lott. On February 23, 1999, the Senate voted \n87 to 11 in favor of this same amendment during consideration of S. 4.\n  My amendment will repeal the current statute that reduces retirement \npay for regular officers of a uniformed service who chose to work for \nthe federal government.\n  The uniformed services include the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine \nCorps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service and the National \nOceanographic and Atmospheric Agency.\n  If a retired officer from the uniform services comes to work for the \nSenate, his or her retirement pay is reduced by about 50 percent, after \nthe first $8,000, to offset for payments from the Senate.\n  The retired officer can request a waiver but the executive, \nlegislative and judicial branches of government handle the waiver \nprocess differently on a case by case basis.\n  The current dual compensation limitation is also discriminatory in \nthat regular officers are covered but reservists or enlisted personnel \nare not covered by the limitation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has recently looked at the current \ndual compensation limitation and it is estimated that around 6,000 \nmilitary retirees lose an average of $800 per month because of this \nprohibition.\n  I have been unable to find one good reason to explain why we should \nwant our law to discourage retired members of the uniformed services \nfrom seeking full time employment with the Federal Government.\n  Our laws should not reduce a benefit military retirees have earned \nbecause they chose to work for the federal government.\n  My amendment would fix this inequity, it would give retired officers \nequal pay for equal work from the federal government and it would give \nthe federal government access to a workforce that currently avoids \nemployment with the Federal Government.\n  I am pleased the managers of the bill have agreed to accept my \namendment and I thank them for their support for this important \namendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 418\n\n(Purpose: To establish as a policy of the United States that the United \nStates will seek to establish a multinational economic embargo against \n any foreign country with which the United States is engaged in armed \n                   conflict, and for other purposes)\n\n       In title X, at the end of subtitle D, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1061.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment to \nS. 1059, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, \nwhich seeks to protect the men and women of our reserve military \ncomponents. The 1998 National Defense Authorization Act provided health \ncare coverage for Reservists and Guardsmen incurring injury, illness or \ndisease while performing duty in an active-duty status. However, it \noverlooked those servicemen and women performing duty in ``inactive \nduty'' status, which is the status they are in while performing their \nmonthly ``drill weekends.''\n  This problem was dramatically illustrated recently when an Air Force \nReserve C-130 crashed in Honduras, killing three crewmembers. One of \nthe survivors was unable to work for over a year due to the serious \nnature of his injuries. While he was reimbursed for lost earnings, this \nserviceman was only eligible for military medical care related to \ninjuries sustained in the crash. His family lost their civilian health \ninsurance and was ineligible to receive medical from the military. Had \nhe been on military orders of more than 30 days, both he and his family \nwould have been eligible for full military medical benefits for the \nduration of his recovery.\n  My dear colleagues, this is unacceptable. We must plug this loophole \nso that these tragic circumstances are not repeated.\n  Why is it so important that we look out for our Guardsmen and \nReservists? It is because our military services have been reduced by \none-third, while worldwide commitments have increased fourfold, leading \nto a dramatic increase in the dependence on our reserve components to \nmeet our worldwide commitments. Like their active duty counterparts, \nthey are dealing with the demands of a high operations tempo; yet they \nmust meet the additional challenge of balancing their military duty \nwith their civilian employment.\n  Members of the Guard and Reserve have been participating at record \nlevels. Nearly 270,000 Reservists and Guardsmen were mobilized during \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Over 17,000 Reservists and \nGuardsmen have answered the Nation's call to bring peace to Bosnia. \nAnd, recently, over 4,000 Reservists and Guardsmen have been called up \nto support current operations in Kosovo. The days of the ``weekend \nwarrior'' are long gone.\n  In addition to significant contributions to military operations, \nmembers of the reserve components have delivered millions of pounds of \nhumanitarian cargo to all corners of the globe. Closer to home, they \nhave responded to numerous state emergencies, such as the devastating \nfloods that struck in America's heartland last year. The men and women \nof the Reserve Components are on duty all over the world, every day of \nthe year.\n  Considering everything our citizen soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines have done for us, we must not turn our backs on them and their \nfamilies in their times of need. Please join me in supporting this \namendment providing for those who provide for us.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 428\n\n    (Purpose: To refine and extend Federal acquisition streamlining)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 807.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and Senator \nLieberman, the Committee's ranking minority member, and Senators Warner \nand Levin, the chairman and ranking minority member of the Armed \nServices Committee. Senator Lieberman and I thank the Armed Services \nchairman and ranking member for their cooperation and assistance in \npreparing this amendment which will benefit not only the procurement \nprocess within the Department of Defense, but other agencies across the \nFederal government as well.\n  The amendment which we offer today began as a request from the \nAdministration and others to include additional procurement-related \nreforms to those enacted over the past several years and those already \nincluded in S. 1059. Our amendment includes five provisions, as \nfollows: (1) Streamlined Applicability of Cost Accounting Standards; \n(2) Task Order and Delivery Order Contracts; (3) Clarification to the \nDefinition of Commercial Items; (4) Two-year Extension of Commercial \nItems Test Program; and (5) Extension of Interim Reporting Rule on \nContracts with Small Business. I ask unanimous consent that a joint \nstatement of sponsors explaining the amendment be placed in the Record \nimmediately following my statement. This statement represents the \nconsensus view of the sponsors as to the meaning and intent of the \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Joint Statement of Sponsors\n\n\n       1. Streamlined Applicability of Cost Accounting Standards\n\n       In recent years, Congress has enacted two major acquisition \n     reform statutes--the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of \n     1994 (FASA) and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. These statutes \n     changed the trend in government contracting toward \n     simplifying the government's acquisition process and \n     eliminating many government-unique requirements. The goal of \n     these changes in the government's purchasing processes has \n     been to modify or eliminate unnecessary and burdensome \n     legislative mandates, increase the use of commercial items to \n     meet government needs, and give more discretion to \n     contracting agencies in making their procurement decisions.\n       Since the early 1900's, the Federal government has required \n     certain unique accounting standards or criteria designed to \n     protect it from the risk of overpaying for goods and services \n     by directing the manner or degree to which Federal \n     contractors apportion costs to their contracts with the \n     government. The Cost Accounting Standards (CAS standards) are \n     a set of 19 accounting principles developed and maintained by \n     the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board, a body created by \n     Congress to develop uniform and consistent standards. The CAS \n     standards require government contractors to account for their \n     costs on a consistent basis and prohibit any shifting of \n     overhead or other costs from commercial contacts to \n     government contracts, or from fixed-priced contracts to cost-\n     type contracts.\n       FASA and the Clinger-Cohen Act took significant steps to \n     exempt commercial items from the applicability of the CAS \n     standards. Nonetheless, the Department of Defense and others \n     in the public and private sectors continue to identify the \n     CAS standards as a continuing barrier to the integration of \n     commercial items into the government marketplace. Advocates \n     of relaxing the CAS standards argue that they require \n     companies to create unique accounting systems to do business \n     with the government in cost-type contracts. They believe that \n     the added cost of developing the required accounting systems \n     has discouraged some commercial companies from doing business \n     with the government and led others to set up separate \n     assembly lines for government products, substantially \n     increasing costs to the government.\n       This provision carefully balances the government's need for \n     greater access to commercial items, particularly those of \n     nontraditional suppliers, with the need for a strong set of \n     CAS standards to protect the taxpayers from overpayments to \n     contractors. The provision would modify the CAS standards \n     to streamline their applicability, while maintaining the \n     applicability of the standards to the vast majority of \n     contract dollars that are currently covered. In \n     particular, the provision would raise the threshold for \n     coverage under the CAS standards from $25 million to $50 \n     million; exempt contractors from coverage if they do not \n     have a contract in excess of $5 million; and exclude \n     coverage based on firm, fixed price contracts awarded on \n     the basis of adequate price competition without the \n     submission of certified cost or pricing data.\n       The provision also would provide for waivers of the CAS \n     standards by Federal agencies in limited circumstances. This \n     would allow contracting agencies to handle this contract \n     administration function, in limited circumstances, as part of \n     their traditional role in administering contracts. The \n     sponsors note that waivers would be available for contracts \n     in excess of $10 million only in ``exceptional \n     circumstances.'' The ``exceptional circumstances'' waiver may \n     be used only when a waiver is necessary to meet the needs of \n     an agency, and i.e., the agency determines that it would not \n     be able to obtain the products or services in the absence of \n     a waiver.\n\n\n               2. task order and delivery order contracts\n\n       FASA authorized Federal agencies to enter into multiple \n     award task and delivery order contracts for the procurement \n     of goods and services. Multiple award contracts occur when \n     two or more contracts are awarded from one solicitation. \n     Multiple award contracting allows the government to procure \n     products and services more quickly using streamlined \n     acquisition procedures while taking advantage of competition \n     to obtain optimum prices and quality on individual task \n     orders or delivery orders. FASA requires orders under \n     multiple-award contracts to contain a clear description of \n     the services or supplies ordered and--except under specified \n     circumstances--requires that each of the multiple vendors be \n     provided a fair opportunity to be considered for specific \n     orders.\n       Concerns have been raised that the simplicity of these \n     multiple-award contracts has brought with it the potential \n     for abuse. The General Accounting Office and the Department \n     of Defense Inspector General have reported that agencies have \n     routinely failed to comply with the basic requirements of \n     FASA, including the requirement to provide vendors a fair \n     opportunity to be considered for specific orders. While \n     performance guidance was established by the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy (OFPP) in 1996, the regulations \n     implementing FASA do not establish any specific procedures \n     for awarding orders or any specific safeguards to ensure \n     compliance with competition requirements.\n       This provision would require that the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation provide the necessary guidance on the appropriate \n     use of task and delivery order contracts as authorized by \n     FASA. It also would require that the Administrator of OFPP \n     work with the Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration (GSA) to review the ordering procedures and \n     practices of the Federal Supply Schedule program administered \n     by GSA. This review should include an assessment as to \n     whether the GSA program should be modified to provide \n     consistency with the regulations for task order and delivery \n     order contracts required by this provision.\n\n\n         3. clarification to the definition of commercial items\n\n       FASA included a broad new definition of ``commercial \n     items,'' designed to give the Federal government greater \n     access to previously unavailable advanced commercial products \n     and technologies. However, the FASA definition of commercial \n     items included only a limited definition of commercial \n     services. Under FASA, commercial items include services \n     purchased to support a commercial product as a commercial \n     service. This language has been interpreted by some to mean \n     that these ancillary services must be procured at the same \n     time or from\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\n     the same vendor as the commercial item the service is \n     intended to support.\n       This provision would clarify that services ancillary to a \n     commercial item, such as installation, maintenance, repair, \n     training, and other support services, would be considered a \n     commercial service regardless of whether the service is \n     provided by the same vendor or at the same time as the item \n     if the service is provided contemporaneously to the general \n     public under similar terms and conditions.\n\n\n         4. two-year extension of commercial items test program\n\n       Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 provided the \n     authority for Federal agencies to use special simplified \n     procedures to purchases for amounts greater than $100,000 but \n     not greater than $5 million if the agency reasonably expects \n     that the offers will include only commercial items. The \n     purpose of this test program was to give agencies additional \n     procedural discretion and flexibility so that purchases of \n     commercial items in this dollar range could be solicited, \n     offered, evaluated, and awarded in a simplified manner that \n     maximizes efficiency and economy and minimizes paperwork \n     burden and administration costs for both government and \n     industry. Authority to use this test program expires on \n     January 1, 2000.\n       The Administration has reported that, due to delays in \n     implementing the test program, the data available from the \n     test program is insufficient to assess the effectiveness of \n     the test, and additional data is required to determine \n     whether this authority should be made permanent. This \n     provision would extend the authority to January 1, 2002.\n       The provision also requires the Comptroller General \n     to report to Congress on the impact of the provision. The \n     sponsors note that the shortened notice period authorized \n     under the test program may have a different impact on \n     competition, depending on the complexity of the commercial \n     items to be procured. For this reason, the sponsors expect \n     the Comptroller General's report to address the extent to \n     which the test authority has been used, the types of \n     commercial items procured under the test program, and the \n     impact of the test program on competition for agency \n     contracts and on the small business share of such \n     contracts. The Comptroller General's report also should \n     assess the extent to which the test program has \n     streamlined the procurement process.\n\n\n5. extension of interim reporting rule on contracts with small business\n\n       Section 31(f) of the OFPP Act, as amended by FASA, requires \n     detailed reporting of contract activity between $25,000 and \n     $100,000 in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This \n     requirement gives the government the ability to track the \n     impact of acquisition reform on the share of contracts in \n     this dollar range that are awarded to small businesses, small \n     disadvantaged businesses and woman-owned small businesses.

Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the \nGrassley-Domenici amendment on financial management reforms at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The bill before us today provides the first major increase in defense \nspending since 1985.\n  The increase in defense spending authorized in this bill was \ninitially approved by the Budget Committee back in March.\n  As a Member of the Budget Committee, I voted for the extra 8 billion \ndollars for national defense.\n  That may come as a surprise to some of my colleagues.\n  In the past, I have opposed increases in the defense budget. Now, I \ndon't. My colleagues must be wondering why.\n  I would like to explain my position.\n  I support this year's increase in defense spending for one reason and \none reason only.\n  The Budget Committee--and now the Armed Services Committee--are \ncalling for financial management reforms at DOD.\n  The Committees are telling DOD to bring its accounting practices up \nto accepted standards, so it can produce ``auditable'' financial \nstatements--as required by the Chief Financial Officers Act.\n  This is music to my ears.\n  We should not pump up the DOD budget without a solid commitment to \nfinancial management reform.\n  The Committees are telling DOD to do what DOD is already required to \ndo--under the law.\n  The Budget Committee's report on the Concurrent Resolution for FY \n2000 contained strong language on the need for financial management \nreform at the Pentagon.\n  While the Budget Committee's language is not binding, it sends a \nclear, unambiguous message to the Pentagon: clean up your books--now!\n  The Armed Services Committee reached the same conclusions--\nindependently.\n  The Armed Services Committee has cranked up the pressure a notch. The \nCommittee has taken the next logical step.\n  The bill before us today contains much more than a strong message.\n  It mandates financial management reform.\n  If adopted in conference, the language in this bill would become the \nlaw of the land.\n  And with it, I hope we are able to generate more pressure for \nfinancial reform at the Pentagon.\n  The legislative language on financial management reform is reflected \nin several provisions in Title X [ten] of the bill.\n  Mr. President, if financial reforms were not in the bill, I would be \nstanding here with a different kind of amendment in my hand.\n  I would be asking my colleagues to support an amendment to cut the \nDOD budget.\n  Fortunately, that's not necessary.\n  It's not necessary because the Armed Services Committee has seen the \nlight and seized the initiative.\n  The Armed Services Committee is demanding financial management \nreforms at the Pentagon.\n  First, I would like to thank my friend from Virginia, Senator \nWarner--the Committee Chairman--for recognizing and accepting the need \nfor financial management reform at the Pentagon.\n  I would also like to thank my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe--\nChairman of the Readiness Subcommittee--for putting some horsepower \nbehind DOD financial management reform.\n  His hearing on DOD Financial Management on April 14th helped to \nhighlight the need for reform and set the stage for the corrective \nmeasures in the bill.\n  But above all, I would like to thank the entire Armed Services \nCommittee for taking time to listen to my concerns and for addressing \nthem in the bill in a meaningful way.\n  I hope the Committee's efforts to strengthen internal controls--when \ncombined with mine--will improve DOD's ability to detect and prevent \nfraud and better protect the peoples' money.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not contain all the new financial \nmanagement controls that I wanted. There had to be give-and-take along \nthe way.\n  I remain especially concerned about the need for restrictions on the \nuse of credit cards for making large payments on R and procurement \ncontracts.\n  The Committee has assured me that there will be a good faith effort \nto examine this issue before the conference on this bill is concluded.\n  Based on information to be provided by the Department and the General \nAccounting Office and Inspector General, the final version of the bill \nmay include: (1) a dollar ceiling on credit card transactions; and (2) \nstrict limits on using credit cards to make large contract payments.\n  I hope that is possible.\n  There will be no improvement in the dismal DOD financial management \npicture without reform--and some pressure from this Committee and the \nother committees of Congress.\n  We need to lean on the Pentagon bureaucrats to make it happen.\n  Without reform, the vast effort dedicated to auditing the annual \nfinancial statements will be a wasted effort.\n  The bill before us will hopefully establish a solid foundation--and \ncreate a new environment--where financial management reform can begin \nto happen.\n  In doing what we are doing, I hope we are providing the Pentagon with \nthe wherewithal to get the job done.\n  The reforms in the bill are not new or dramatic.\n  In my mind, it's basic accounting 101 stuff: DOD needs to record \nfinancial transactions in the books of account as they occur. Now, \nthat's not complicated or difficult, but it's the essential first step. \nAnd it's not being done today.\n  The Committee is telling DOD to get on the stick and do what it's \nalready supposed to be doing--under the law. And it calls for some \naccountability to help get the job done.\n  The language in this bill--I hope--will get DOD moving toward a \n``clean'' audit opinion.\n  I hope that's where we are headed.\n  And there is another important reason why DOD financial reform is \nneeded today.\n  As I stated right up front, we are looking at the first big increase \nin defense spending since 1985.\n  I think this Committee needs to be on the record, telling the \nPentagon to get its financial house in order.\n  If the Pentagon wants all this extra money, then the Pentagon needs \nto fulfill its Constitutional responsibility to the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  First, it needs to regain control of the taxpayers' money it's \nspending right now.\n  And second, it needs to be able to provide a full and accurate \naccounting of how all the money gets spent.\n  DOD must be able to present an accurate and complete accounting of \nall financial transactions--including all receipts and expenditures. It \nneeds to be able to do this once a year--accurately and completely.\n  The GAO and IG auditors should be able to examine the department's \nbooks and its financial statements and render a ``clean'' audit \nopinion.\n  That's the goal.\n  I want to see us reach that goal reached in my lifetime.\n  Mr. President, I would like to extend a special word of thanks to the \nentire Armed Service Committee for helping me with my DOD financial \nmanagement reform initiative.\n  I would like to thank the committee for helping to push the Pentagon \nin the right direction--toward sound financial management practices.\n  I would like to thank the Committee Chairman, Senator Warner, and his \nSubcommittee Chairman, Senator Inhofe, for throwing their weight behind \nthe effort.\n  I would like to thank them for working with me and helping me craft \nan acceptable piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, in my mind, DOD financial management reform is \nmandatory as we move to larger DOD budgets.\n  Higher defense budgets need to be hooked up to financial reforms--\njust\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nlike a horse and buggy--one behind the other. They need to move \ntogether.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 431\n\n(Purpose: To authorize $4,500,000 for research, development, test, and \n    evaluation, Defense-wide, relating to a hot gas decontamination \n    facility, and to reduce by $4,500,000 the amount authorized for \n  chemical demilitarization activities to take into account inflation \n              savings in the account for such activities)\n\n       On page 18, line 13, strike ``$1,169,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,164,500,000''.\n       On page 29, line 14, strike ``$9,400,081,000'' and insert \n     ``$9,404,581,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 432\n\n  (Purpose: To provide $3,500,000 (in PE 62633N) for Navy research in \n      computational engineering design, and to provide an offset)\n\n       On page 29, line 11, increase the amount by $3,500,000.\n       On page 29, line 14, decrease the amount by $3,500,000.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 433\n\n (Purpose: To extend certain temporary authorities to provide benefits \n    for Department of Defense employees in connection with defense \n                workforce reductions and restructuring)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1107.

Mr. President, I thank our chairman, Senator Warner, \nand the ranking member, Senator Levin, for agreeing to this very \nimportant amendment. As a new member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I was a little taken aback by the way the Committee launched \ninto major legislation at the very start of this session. I am glad \nthat we did. From the very start of the year, it was clear that we had \na very real problem in retention that threatened to reach crisis \nproportions. Furthermore, this crisis was looming just when our country \nmost needed every talented soldier, sailor, and airman that we could \nkeep in the service.\n  The structural reasons behind the retention shortfalls have already \nbeen well documented on the floor; a booming economy, long deployment, \nand a lack of predictability for family life have all taken their toll. \nHowever, what I have found very frustrating is that we have no sense of \npriority behind these problems. Are soldiers leaving because the pay is \ntoo low, or because the retirement package is insufficient? Do we need \nto address operations tempo first, or health care? The evidence is all \nanecdotal. We have a strong sense of the universe of problems, but no \nqualitfiable data on their relative importance.\n  As it stands, each service is responsible for exit surveys which are \nconducted on a voluntary basis when a person separates from the \nmilitary. These surveys are not standardized, do not seek the same \ninformation, nor are they scientifcally tested. In short, they are not \nmuch better than the anecdotal evidence that we collect by word of \nmouth. The dimensions of our difficulties in retention demand that we \nhave much better information. For that reason, I have introduced this \namendment to the Defense Authorization bill, which will give us the \ndata that we need to assess the steps Congress needs take in coming \nyears to stem this tide.\n  The amendment instructs the Secretary of Defense to develop and \nimplement a survey of all military personnel leaving the service \nstarting in January 2000 and ending six months later. The survey will \nprovide uniformity of data, and be scientifically tested so as to give \nas some real feedback as to why our men and women are leaving the \nservice. Additionally, there are specific issues of content that the \nsurvey must address, namely: the reasons for leaving military service, \nplans for activities after the separation, affiliation with a Reserve \ncomponent, attitude toward pay and benefits, and the extent of job \nsatisfaction during their tenure.\n  I believe that the answers to these questions are vital to the \nSenate's role in addressing retention and other readiness concerns. The \nfuture of our all-volunteer force depends on our ability to continue to \nrecruit and retain the manpower necessary to support our national \nsecurity priorities. To do so, we need forward thinking policy which \nmakes the most of our scarce resources and protects the quality of life \nof our armed services. This amendment will give us the data and \nintellectual framework to begin such policy. Again, I thank Senators \nWarner and Levin for accepting it.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 434\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to carry out an exit \n survey on military service for members of the Armed Forces separating \n                         from the Armed Forces)\n\n       In title V, at the end of subtitle F, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 582.

This award, after these many years, will \ncorrect an oversight and provide Mr. Rascon with the recognition he has \nearned. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of Representative \nLane Evans, who I am working with on this issue and who has worked to \nhelp correct the oversight that prevented the awarding of the Medal of \nHonor to Mr. Rascon.\n  To best understand the courage exhibited by Mr. Rascon, I would like \nto quote an excerpt from the study ``The Military Contributions of \nImmigrants'' published by Empower America, the American Immigration Law \nFoundation, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, Heroes and \nHeritage, the Japanese American Veterans Association, and Veterans of \nForeign Wars of the U.S. The study describes in detail Mr. Rascon's \nactions on March 16, 1966:\n\n       Alfred Rascon was born in Chihuahau, Mexico and immigrated \n     to the United States with his parents in the 1950s. He served \n     two tours in Vietnam, one as a medic, and was known as \n     ``Doc.'' When Rascon volunteered for the service he was not a \n     citizen but still a lawful permanent resident. He was 17 \n     years old but tricked his mother into signing his papers so \n     he could enlist.\n       On March 16, 1966, bullets flew and grenades exploded, and \n     Rascon's platoon found itself in a maelstrom of North \n     Vietnamese firepower. When an American machine gunner went \n     down and someone called for a medic, Rascon, 20 at the time, \n     ignored his orders to remain under cover and rushed down the \n     trail amid a hail of enemy gunfire and grenades. To better \n     protect the wounded soldier, Rascon placed his body between \n     the enemy machine gun fire and the soldier. Rascon turned. He \n     was shot in the hip. Although wounded, he managed to drag the \n     soldier off the trail. Rascon soon discovered the man he was \n     dragging was dead.\n       Specialist 4th Class Larry Gibson crawled forward looking \n     for ammunition. The other machine gunner was already dead and \n     Gibson had no ammunition with which to defend the platoon. \n     Rascon grabbed the dead soldier's ammo and gave it to Gibson. \n     Then, amid relentless enemy fire and grenades, Rascon hobbled \n     back up the trail, snared the dead soldier's machine gun and, \n     most importantly, 400 rounds of additional ammunition.\n       The pace quickened and the grenades dropped. One ripped \n     open Rascon's face. It didn't stop him. He saw another \n     grenade drop five feet from a wounded Neil Haffy. He tackled \n     Haffy and absorbed the grenade blast himself, saving Haffy's \n     life.\n       Though severely wounded, Rascon crawled back among the \n     other wounded and gave them aid. A few minutes later, Rascon \n     saw Sergeant Ray Compton being hit by gunfire. As Rascon \n     moved toward him, another hand grenade dropped. Instead of \n     seeking cover Rascon dove on top of the wounded sergeant and \n     again absorbed the blow. That time the explosion smashed \n     through Rascon's helmet and ripped into his scalp. He saved \n     Compton's life.\n       When the firefight ended, Rascon refused aid for himself \n     until the other wounded were evacuated. So bloodied by the \n     conflict was Rascon that when soldiers placed him on the \n     evacuation helicopter, a chaplain saw his condition and gave \n     him last rites. But Alfred Rascon survived.\n       Today, Rascon, now 50, lives in Howard County, Maryland. \n     The soldiers who witnessed Rascon's deeds that day \n     recommended him in writing for a Medal of Honor. Years later, \n     these soldiers were shocked to discover that he had not \n     received one. The men continue to this day to seek full \n     recognition and the awarding of the Medal of Honor for \n     Alfred Rascon.\n       Perhaps the best description of Alfred Rascon's actions \n     came 30 years later from fellow platoon member Larry Gibson: \n     I was a 19-year-old gunner with a recon section. We were \n     under intense and accurate enemy fire that had pinned down \n     the point squad, making it almost impossible to move without \n     being killed. Unhesitatingly, Doc [as he was called] went \n     forward to aid the wounded and dying. I was one of the \n     wounded. Doc took the brunt of several enemy grenades, \n     shielding the wounded with his body . . . In these few words \n     I cannot fully describe the events of that day. The acts of \n     unselfish heroism Doc performed while saving the many \n     wounded, though severely wounded himself, speak for \n     themselves. This country needs genuine heroes. Doc Rascon is \n     one of those.''\n       Rascon was once asked why he acted with such courage on the \n     battlefield even though he was an immigrant and not yet a \n     citizen. Rascon replied, ``I was always an American in my \n     heart.''\n\n  Mr. President, the approach of Memorial Day is a proper occasion for \nus to reflect on what it means to live in a nation that can attract \nyoung men and women who were not even born here to volunteer and, if \nnecessary, die for their adopted country. It is an occasion to reflect \non what it means to live in a nation where to this day the children of \nimmigrants volunteer and serve.\n  Today, over 60,000 active military personnel are immigrants to his \ncountry. This desire to serve is consistent with our history. More than \n20 percent of the recipients of our highest military award, the \nCongressional Medal of Honor, have been immigrants. Indeed America \nremains free because in no small part she has been blessed with many \nAmerican heroes willing to give their lives in her defense.\n  During his last year in office, Ronald Reagan traveled out to a high \nschool in Suitland, MD. Surrounded by students he was asked about \nAmerica and what it means to be an American. President Reagan looked \nout at the young people and responded:\n\n       I got a letter from a man the other day, and I'll share it \n     with you. The man said you can go to live in Japan, but you \n     cannot become Japanese--or Germany, or France--and he named \n     all the others. But he said anyone from any corner of the \n     world can come to America and become an American.\n\n  We owe a debt to all those people, wherever they or their parents \nwere born, who have kept our Nation free and safe in a dangerous world. \nAnd we owe a continuing debt of gratitude to those today who serve, \nguarding our country, our homes and our freedom. Like all good things, \nfreedom must be won again and again. I hope all of us will remember \nthose, immigrants and native born, who have won freedom for us in the \npast, and stand ready to win freedom for us again, if they must. May we \nnever forget our debt to the brave who have fallen and the brave who \nstand ready to fight.\n  I believe the awarding of the Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon is \nrichly deserved. This award will demonstrate America's appreciation of \nAlfred Rascon's valor in combat and recognize his extraordinary service \nto this country. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 437\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the return of veterans memorial objects to \n         foreign nations without specific authorization in law)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section and renumber the remaining sections accordingly:\n\n     ``SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON THE RETURN OF VETERANS MEMORIAL \n                   OBJECTS TO FOREIGN NATIONS WITHOUT SPECIFIC \n                   AUTHORIZATION IN LAW.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding section 2572 of title 10, \n     United States Code, or any other provision of law, the \n     President may not transfer a veterans memorial object to a \n     foreign country or entity controlled by a foreign government, \n     or otherwise transfer or convey such object to any person or \n     entity for purposes of the ultimate transfer or conveyance of \n     such object to a foreign country or entity controlled by a \n     foreign government, unless specifically authorized by law.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Entity controlled by a foreign government.--The term \n     ``entity controlled by a foreign government'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 2536(c)(1) of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       (2) Veterans memorial object.--The term ``veterans memorial \n     object'' means any object, including a physical structure or \n     portion thereof, that--\n       (A) is located at a cemetery of the National Cemetery \n     System, war memorial, or military installation in the United \n     States;\n       (B) is dedicated to, or otherwise memorializes, the death \n     in combat or combat-related duties of members of the United \n     States Armed Forces; and\n       (C) was brought to the United States from abroad as a \n     memorial of combat abroad.''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, amendment No. 437 to S. 1059, the Defense \nAuthorization bill, prohibits the return to a foreign country of any \nportion of a memorial to American veterans without the express \nauthorization of Congress.\n  I would not have thought that an amendment like this was necessary, \nMr. President. It would never have occurred to me that an \nadministration would even briefly consider dismantling part of a \nmemorial to American soldiers who died in the line of duty in order to \nsend a piece of that memorial to a foreign country; but a real \npossibility of just that happening exists in my state of Wyoming \ninvolving what are known as the ``Bells of Balangiga.''\n  In 1898, the Treaty of Paris brought to a close the Spanish-American \nWar.\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nAs part of the treaty, Spain ceded possession of the Philippines to the \nUnited States. At about the same time, the Filipino people began an \ninsurrection in their country. In August 1901, as part of the American \nefforts to stem the insurrection, a company of 74 officers and men from \nthe 9th Infantry, Company G, occupied the town of Balangiga on the \nisland of Samar. These men came from Ft. Russel in Cheyenne, WY--\ntoday's F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n  On September 28 of that year, taking advantage of the preoccupation \nof the American troops with a church service for the just-assassinated \nPresident McKinley, a group of Filipino insurgents infiltrated the \ntown. Only three American sentries were on duty that day. As described \nin an article in the November 19, 1997 edition of the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       Officers slept in, and enlisted men didn't bother to carry \n     their rifles as they ambled out of their quarters for \n     breakfast. Balangiga had been a boringly peaceful site since \n     the infantry company arrived a month earlier, according to \n     military accounts and soldiers' statements. The quiet ended \n     abruptly when a 23 year old U.S. sentry named Adolph Gamlin \n     walked past the local police chief. In one swift move, the \n     Filipino grabbed the slightly built Iowan's rifle and smashed \n     the butt across [Gamlin's] head. As PFC Gamlin crumpled, the \n     bells of Balangiga began to peal.\n       With the signal, hundreds of Filipino fighters swarmed out \n     of the surrounding forest, armed with clubs, picks and \n     machete-like bolo knives. Others poured out of the church; \n     they had arrived the night before, disguised as women \n     mourners and carrying coffins filled with bolos. A sergeant \n     was beheaded in the mess tent and dumped into a vat of \n     steaming wash water. A young bugler was cut down in a nearby \n     stream. The company commander was hacked to death after \n     jumping out a window. Besieged infantrymen defended \n     themselves with kitchen forks, mess kits and baseball bats. \n     Others threw rocks and cans of beans.\n       Though he was also slashed across the back, PFC . . . \n     Gamlin came to and found a rifle. By the time he and the \n     other survivors fought their way to the beach, 38 US soldiers \n     were dead and all but six of the remaining men had been \n     wounded.\n\n  The remaining soldiers escaped in five dug-out canoes. Only three \nboats made it to safety on Leyte. Seven men died of exposure at sea, \nand other 8 died of their wounds; only 20 of the company's 74 members \nsurvived.\n  A detachment of 54 volunteers from 9th infantry units stationed at \nLeyte returned to Balangiga and recaptured the village. They were \nreinforced a few days later from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry \nRegiment. When the 11th Infantry was relieved on October 18 by Marines, \nthe 9th Infantry took two of the church bells and an old canon with \nthem back to Wyoming as memorials to the fallen soldiers.\n  The bells and canon have been displayed in front of the base flagpole \non the central parade grounds since that time. The canon was restored \nby local volunteers and placed under a glass display case in 1985 to \nprotect it from the elements. The bells were placed in openings in a \nlarge specially constructed masonry wall with a plaque dedicating the \nmemorial to the memory of the fallen soldiers.\n  Off and on since 1981, there have been some discussions in various \ncircles in Cheyenne, Washington, and Manila about the future of the \nbells, including the possibility of returning them to the Philippines. \nMost recently, the Philippine government--having run into broad \nopposition to their request to have both bells returned to them--has \nproposed making a copy of both bells, and having both sides keep one \ncopy and one original. Opposition to the proposal from local and \nnational civic and veterans groups has been very strong.\n  Last year, developments indicated to me that the White House was \nseriously contemplating returning one or both of the bells to the \nPhilippines. 1998 marked the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris, \nand a state visit by then-President Fidel Ramos--his last as \nPresident--to the United States. The disposition of the bells was high \non President Ramos' agenda; he has spoken personally to President \nClinton and several members of Congress about it over the last three \nyears, and made it one of only three agenda items the Filipino \ndelegation brought to the table. Since January 1998, the Filipino press \nhas included almost weekly articles on the bells' supposed return, \nincluding several in the Manila Times in April and May which reported \nthat a new tower to house the bells was being constructed in Borongon, \nSamar, to receive them in May. In addition, there have been a variety \nof reports vilifying me and the veterans in Wyoming for our position on \nthe issue, and others threatening economic boycotts of US products or \nother unspecified acts of retaliation to force capitulation on the \nissue.\n  Moreover, inquiries to me from various agencies of the administration \nsoliciting the opinion of the Wyoming congressional delegation on the \nissue increased in frequency in the first 4 months of 1998. I also \nlearned that the Defense Department, perhaps in conjunction with the \nJustice Department, prepared a legal memorandum outlining its opinion \nof who actually controls the disposition of the bells.\n  In response, the Wyoming congressional delegation wrote a letter to \nPresident Clinton on January 9, 1998, to make clear our opposition to \nremoving the bells. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of that letter be inserted at this point in the Record. In \nresponse to that letter, on May 26, I received a letter from Sandy \nBerger of the National Security Council which I think is perhaps one of \nthe best indicators of the direction the White House was headed on this \nissue.\n  To head off any move by the administration to dispose of the bells, I \nand Senator Enzi introduced S. 1903 on April 1, 1998. The bill had 18 \ncosponsors, including the distinguished Chairmen of the Committees on \nArmed Services, Foreign Relations, Finance, Energy and Natural \nResources, Rules, Ethics, and Banking; the Chairmen of five \nSubcommittees of the Foreign Relations Committee; and five members of \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  While time has passed since this issue came to a head last April, Mr. \nPresident, my deep concern that the administration might still dispose \nof the bells has not. The administration has not disavowed its earlier \nintent to seek to return the bells--an intent derailed by the \nintroduction of S. 1903 last year. In addition, despite article IV, \nsection 3, clause 2 of the Constitution, which states that the \n``Congress shall have the power to dispose of . . . Property belonging \nto the United States,'' the Justice Department has issued an informal \nmemorandum stating that the bells could possibly be disposed of by the \nPresident pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2572.\n  I continue to be amazed, even in these days of political correctness \nand revisionist history, that a U.S. President--our Commander in \nChief--would appear to be ready to ignore the wishes of our veterans \nand tear down a memorial to U.S. soldiers who died in the line of duty \nin order to send part of it back to the country in which they were \nkilled. Amazed, that is, until I recall this President's fondness for \nsweeping apologies and what some might view as flashy P.R. gestures. \nConsequently, Senator Enzi and I decided to pursue the issue again in \nthe 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, to the veterans of Wyoming, and the United States as a \nwhole, the bells represent a lasting memorial to those 54 American \nsoldiers killed as a result of an unprovoked insurgent attack in \nBalangiga on September 28, 1901, In their view, which I share, any \nattempt to remove either or both of the bells--and in doing so actually \nphysically dismantling a war memorial--is a desecration of that memory.\n  This amendment will protect the bells and similar veterans memorials \nfrom such an ignoble fate. The bill is quite simple; it prohibits the \ntransfer of a veterans memorial or any portion thereof to a foreign \ncountry or government unless specifically authorized by law. I would \nlike to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Committee [Senator \nWarner] for his assistance, and that of his staff, in moving this \namendment forward.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 438\n\n(Purpose: To authorize emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal \n                               year 1999)\n\n       In title X, at the end of subtitle A, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1009.

If I might just briefly before I yield the floor for \nSenator Harkin, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Enzi as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 20 minutes. Is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Chair please advise the Senator when he has used \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to speak about the \nCivil Air Patrol, a unique group of volunteer civilian airmen and \nothers, who support this nation in a variety of ways.\n  CAP members represent a cross-section of America and include pilots, \nemergency medical technicians, and teachers who use their professional \nskills to provide emergency services, youth programs, and aerospace \neducation. Its more than 60,000 senior and cadet members are located in \nsmall towns and large cities across this country. Day in and day out, \nits aircrews fly search and rescue, disaster relief, counter-drug and \nAir Force operational support missions while teachers and others run a \nyouth program for thousands of cadets and support aerospace education \nprograms in hundreds of schools.\n  CAP began its service to the nation under very unusual circumstances. \nAs World War II approached, civilian pilots began to look for ways to \nhelp with the expected war effort. They organized together as an air \narm of the Office of Civil Defense and, in the first months of the war, \nthey were quick to respond as ships were torpedoed within sight of \nland. During a period when we lacked the Army and Navy aircraft needed \nto patrol thousands of square miles off our coasts looking for German \nsubmarines, the CAP was there.\n  Flying their own aircraft, sometimes using automobile inner tubes for \nlife preservers, CAP pilots did what the military could not, find enemy \nsubmarines in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. They spotted so many \nsubmarines, in fact, that they finally convinced the military that they \nshould be armed. At first they simply carried the bombs on their laps \nand dropped them out the door of the aircraft, later they improvised \nhomemade bomb aiming sights and put bomb racks under their Beech, \nFairchild, Sikorsky, and Stinson aircraft. It was over a year and a \nhalf before the military could accomplish this mission without CAP's \nhelp.\n  By July of 1943, CAP pilots had flown over 24 million miles on anti-\nsubmarine combat missions and had spotted and reported the location of \n173 submarines to the military. CAP itself attacked 57 of those \nsubmarines and sank or damaged two. Hundreds of survivors from sunk \nships and military\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\naircraft crashes (at sea) were rescued as part of CAP's anti-submarine \npatrol efforts. Twenty-six CAP volunteer lives and 90 aircraft were \nlost on these civilian-flown combat missions.\n  CAP's World War II service also set the foundation for its modern day \nservice to America. During the war, CAP became a part of the Army Air \nForce and flew hundreds of thousands of hours nationwide on border \npatrol, search and rescue, forest fire watch, target-towing, courier \nflights, and military training exercises. It began its cadet program to \nhelp the military recruit young Americans and to teach them about \naviation. These were invaluable missions that contributed greatly to \nthe war effort. Many of the same missions and the tradition of service \nestablished then, continues today.\n  Today, CAP again flies support missions off the coast of America in \nsupport of another kind of war, the war against drugs. Since 1985, CAP \nhas flown hundreds of thousands of hours in support of the U.S. \nCustoms, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, and other federal and local law \nenforcement agencies. CAP aircrews fly reconnaissance, communications \nrelay, and transport missions which take place over water along the 12-\nmile territorial limit, along the nation's borders, and in most of the \n50 states.\n  The cost to the taxpayer is very little as CAP aircraft are flown by \nvolunteer aircrews for about $55 a hour. Aircrew members donate their \ntime, often using their own personal leave from work to fly these \nmissions. They provide essential support to the government, which would \ncost the taxpayer, even if the government had the pilots and aircraft \nto use, up to $2,000 an hour. In 1998 alone, Civil Air Patrol flew \n41,721 hours in support of counter-drug efforts.\n  CAP also flies and conducts more traditional missions. While it is \nthe official auxiliary of the Air Force, it also performs numerous \nemergency services missions, youth programs and aerospace education \nprograms in support of states and local communities across this nation. \nIt's pilots routinely fly about 85 percent of all the search and rescue \nhours flown in the United States. Whether searching for a lost child in \na state park or looking for downed military aviator, Civil Air Patrol \nis there. In 1998, Civil Air Patrol conducted 3,155 search and rescue \nmissions and saved 116 lives. CAP also supports local communities and \nstates during time of disaster. In 1998, during a period lasting weeks, \nhundreds of CAP members in drought-stricken Florida and Texas flew \nemergency fire watch while others maintained airborne communications \nrelay stations, around the clock, supporting fire fighters on the \nground. As recently as three weeks ago, when the Oklahoma tornadoes \nkilled 45, CAP aerial and ground units quickly joined with community \nand state disaster relief efforts. Other emergency and humanitarian \nmissions include flood surveillance, tornado and hurricane \nreconnaissance, blood collection and distribution flights, and the \nemergency airlift of medical material.\n  Over 26,000 young people participate in CAP's growing cadet program \nwhere they not only have opportunities to fly, but they too learn \ndiscipline, leadership and public service skills. Not only are many of \nthese cadets model citizens but they help their communities and states \nduring times of emergency. Indeed, during CAP's emergency operations \ncadets operate many of its radios and make up the bulk of its ground \nrescue units. The cadet program also includes local unit activities, \nphysical fitness, leadership laboratories, aerospace education, and \nmoral leadership. A wide range of annual special cadet activities \ninclude nationwide flight encampments where cadets each summer, working \nwith adult flight instructors, learn how to fly powered aircraft and \ngliders. In 1998, 180 young men and women learned how to fly at these \nencampments. CAP also conducts nearly 200 aerospace education workshops \nthat reach over 5,000 educators annually and routinely provides Air \nForce ROTC and CAP cadets in a series of orientation flights--over \n17,500 in 1998--to introduce them to modern aviation.\n  It is impossible to adequately capture the essence of the Civil Air \nPatrol in just a few short words, however, I hope it is clear that the \nCAP is a unique organization that touches Americans at all levels. \nWhile it is the official auxiliary of the Air Force, it is also a \nbenevolent, civilian non-profit corporation chartered by Congress to \nsupport emergency service and educational organizations such as the \nAmerican Red Cross, all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico as well as thousands of local communities \nacross the nation. Its more than 50,000 members, 1,700 squadrons, 535 \nlight aircraft and thousands of communications stations stand ready to \nsupport not only the Air Force and other Federal agencies but all the \ncitizens of the United States, no matter where they live. Civil Air \nPatrol does this valuable humanitarian and public service mission 24 \nhours a day, 365 days a year with little or no fan fare. Its volunteers \ndeserve our thanks and appreciation.\n\n\n                           Air Force Proposal\n\n  I rise in support of the Allard amendment to ensure civilian \nleadership of the Civil Air Patrol and to require studies of proposals \nto improve its operations.\n  The Air Force has proposed a take-over the governance of CAP. The \nDefense Authorization bill includes this proposal. It is not warranted, \nnor will it necessarily address alleged problem with CAP.\n  I am joining with Senator Allard  and a long, bipartisan list of \ncosponsors to offer an alternative that has Congress make a more \nconsidered decision.\n  The Air Force has proposed some huge and abrupt changes to the \noperations and governance of the Civil Air Patrol. The Air Force wants \nto place themselves in control of the CAP Board and operations. The \nproposal would put an Air Force Reserve Major General in charge of \nHeadquarters, place an oversight Board--appointed by the Air Force--in \ncontrol of CAP and replace a lot of the civilian staff with Air Force \nuniformed staff. This represents a major change to the CAP. It \nrepresents a higher financial cost to the taxpayer. It also represents \nplacing a civilian volunteer nonprofit organization under the control \nof the Air Force.\n  Strangely, the Armed Services Committee has adopted the Air Force \nproposal. I say strangely, because the Committee adopted the language \nwith very little review or discussion. There has been no hearings on \nthe Air Force proposal.\n  The Air Force is citing allegations of financial mismanagement and \nsafety lapses as the reasons for the change. While the Air Force has \ntold the press there are series problems with CAP, they have yet to \nmake clear the evidence to support the allegations. There has been no \nreport by the Air Force Inspector General, no report by the DOD IG, nor \nby the GAO. The Air Force did write a report a year ago arguing for an \nadoption of a new financial management process--the adoption of an OMB \ncircular--but CAP is waiting for the OMB to review the plan.\n  The Civil Air Patrol leadership has rejected the allegations. We \ndon't need to rush to a hasty decision. In fact, I have talked to \nboth Acting Secretary Peters of the Air Force and CAP leadership. Both \nwant to get together upon my behest to discuss any differences and \nthink through any proposals. I would like to invite other Senators to \nattend if they so desire.\n\n  The Senator from Oklahoma described many allegations of CAP missteps. \nAll I heard were allegations. In fact, many were made by unnamed former \nmembers. Where is the evidence? Where is the formal review? Where are \nthe hearings? Are we going to base legislation on unchecked \nallegations?\n  Let me address just one allegation made by the Air Force and repeated \nby the Senator from Oklahoma--the infamous CAP cruise, which has been \npurported as the worst of CAP's missteps.\n  I have looked into the matter and here is what I have found. It is \ntrue that, in 1998 the southeast region had a meeting aboard a ship \ninstead of at a hotel. CAP regions have meetings regularly with the \nregion wings deciding on the location. Let's look at a few more facts.\n  First, no CAP member used federal dollars to pay for the cruise. \nNone. That's right, the volunteer members of CAP all pay their own way \nout of their own pockets. It is true that some CAP headquarters staff \nattended that meeting and were reimbursed for the cost.\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\nThis has long been the normal practice for staff--who are paid federal \nemployees, not members--to get reimbursed. This is the normal federal \npractice as far as travel expenses relating to work. The Air Force had \nno criticism of the staff attendance, but said that staff members \nreceived unauthorized reimbursement.\n  But here is the key point: the reimbursement was approved by the Air \nForce before the event. The Air Force has about thirty Air Force staff \noverseeing operations and financial matters at headquarters, at the CAP \nheadquarters in Alabama. Before the event, these Air Force staff, at \nthe headquarters, approved the event for reimbursement.\n  In other words, the Air Force already had authority to oversee CAP \nfinancial matters, exercised the authority and approved the \nreimbursement. Where is the lack of Air Force control?\n  The Air Force has also pointed to safety concerns. Although we only \nhave allegations, I talked to the CAP Commander, Jay Bobich about them. \nI asked if there is a need for a safety officer. His response was \nfairly open. He doesn't know about the incident cited--again, they are \nfrom letters from unknown sources--but would welcome an Air Force \nsafety officer. The Air Force can place one at the headquarters without \nthis legislation and always could, but perhaps the Air Force did not \nthink it was a serious concern.\n  Let me also turn to an important down-side to the Air Force proposal: \ncost. The Air Force proposes to use many more uniformed military \npersonnel to run CAP headquarters, replacing the civilian employees. I \ndon't have to point out the financial implication to my colleagues. \nUniformed Air Force personnel simply cost more. In fact, the Air Force \nis even talking about placing a 2-star general instead of the current \ncivilian director. This alone is a $60,000 difference that the \ntaxpayers would have to bear.\n  Rather than simply take the Air Force proposal, we should require the \nDOD Inspector General to do a study of the allegations. I have already \nstarted the GAO on a study. We should also require an Inspector General \nstudy. This way, we in Congress, can make an informed decision that \nconsiders all possible alternatives.\n  I must pose a question to my colleagues. Why would anyone make a \nlasting decision to make major changes to an important organization \nusing unilateral input--in this case from the Air Force? Right or \nwrong, would it not be better to have an unbiased and factual \ndetermination, and then make a judgment based on the facts?\n  Our amendment simply requires that we take some time to look at the \nAir Force proposal on CAP, examine other potentially better proposals, \nand have the IG and GAO make recommendations. Let's not rush to a hasty \njudgment without the facts.\n  Mr. President, I want to give my disclaimer and talk about my own \ninvolvement in the Civil Air Patrol. I have been involved in the Civil \nAir Patrol for about the last 15 years. I am at present the commander \nof the Congressional Civil Air Patrol Squadron. I go out and fly \nmissions. I fly with the Civil Air Patrol quite regularly. So I just \nwanted to lay it out that I am very much involved with the Civil Air \nPatrol and have been involved most of the time I have been in the \nSenate.\n  It is a proud and good organization. I am just going to give a little \nbit of the background: More than 60,000 senior and cadet members, all \nacross America, in small towns, large cities, flying every day in \nsearch and rescue missions. Almost 85 percent of all the search and \nrescue missions in America are done by the Civil Air Patrol. We have \nyouth programs for thousands of cadets around America.\n  This organization started in World War II when German submarines were \nsinking our ships off the coast, sometimes within sight of land. We \ndidn't have the Army and Navy aircraft to patrol, so, flying their own \nsmall aircraft, sometimes using automobile inner tubes as their life \npreservers, the CAP pilots did what the military could not--they found \nthe enemy submarines in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. They spotted \nso many submarines. In fact, they finally convinced the military they \nshould be armed. At first they actually carried bombs on their laps in \nthe plane. They would see a submarine, and they would throw them out \nthe window on top of the submarine, on top of the German U-boat. By \nJuly of 1943, CAP pilots had flown over 24 million miles on \nantisubmarine combat missions. They had spotted and reported the \nlocation of 173 submarines to the military and the CAP itself attacked \n57 of those submarines and sank or damaged two of them. I wanted to lay \nthat out as a kind of proud history of the Civil Air Patrol.\n\n  Since that time, under civilian control, the Patrol has had a great \ncadet program to recruit young people into its program. Many of the \npilots we have had in the Air Force, the Navy, came out of the Civil \nAir Patrol. It is just an invaluable youth program. One time I came \nover here to talk to a youth group from the Cleveland, OH, Civil Air \nPatrol squadron, all young African Americans, male and female, taken \nout of the inner city. They had uniforms. They were given discipline. \nThey had summer programs. It was just a wonderful thing to see, this \ncadet program instilling good American values in these young people.\n  Again, I point that out as a way of saying that this is a very proud, \nvery good organization, one that has done a lot of good. As I said, 85 \npercent of all search and rescue is done by the Civil Air Patrol. In \n1998, we conducted 3,155 search and rescue missions and saved 116 \nlives.\n  We also support communities and States in times of disaster. In 1998, \nduring a period lasting weeks, when we saw all the fires in Florida and \nTexas, hundreds of CAP members flew emergency fire watch, while others \nmaintained airborne communication relay stations.\n  Three weeks ago during the terrible Oklahoma tornadoes that killed 45 \npeople, CAP was there with aerial and ground units and quickly joined \nwith community and State disaster relief efforts. I can tell you that \nin 1993, during the terrible floods we had in the Midwest, in Iowa, the \nCivil Air Patrol was there day after day after day helping with \nlogistics, helping with communication, helping fly aircraft over rivers \nto warn of propane tanks floating downstream.\n  All of these things are done by volunteers. The people flying these \nplanes don't get paid a dime.\n  One other thing that most people don't know about is the drug \ninterdiction efforts by the Civil Air Patrol. This was something that I \nhad a proud involvement with back in the 1980s. We changed the law to \ngive the Civil Air Patrol the authority to join with the DEA and others \nto fly drug interdiction, both off our coasts and looking for drugs \nwithin the continental United States.\n  At that time, if I am not mistaken, much of what was being done in \nthat regard was done by the National Guard. They were charging over \n$1,100 an hour for that. The Civil Air Patrol did it for about $80 an \nhour. Why? Because it was all volunteers. In fact, many of the flying \nvolunteers took their own cameras with them, paid for their own film, \npaid for developing, which pictures they then turned over to the DEA.\n  Again, I point that out because I am very proud of the Civil Air \nPatrol, very proud of their history, proud of what they have been doing \nrecently, proud of what they are doing yet today to help our States, \nour local communities, and the great cadet programs they have \nto instill good values and discipline among so many young people in \nAmerica.\n\n  Now what do we have? In front of us we have this provision that was \nput into the bill. I understand it was voice voted in committee. We \nhave had no hearings on it, not one hearing. Yet, this provision would \nbasically allow the Air Force to completely take over the Civil Air \nPatrol.\n  The Air Force has always had a relationship with the Civil Air \nPatrol--quite frankly, a pretty decent relationship. But because of \nsome unfounded allegations, all of a sudden we have this provision in \nthe bill that basically would allow the Air Force to take it over.\n  Well, what the Allard and Harkin amendment--joined by so many \nothers--says is, what we have are allegations. When you have \nallegations, the best thing to do is to have the GAO investigate and do \na study, have the inspector general's office investigate\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\nthese allegations. Let's find out where the truth lies. That is what \nour amendment says.\n  The world is not going to end in the next year if we do not make this \nmassive change to let the Air Force take over the Civil Air Patrol. \nWhat we need to do is to approach it in a logical manner. That is what \nthe Allard-Harkin amendment does.\n  It simply says, GAO, IG, do an investigation, report back by February \n15 of the year 2000, next year, in time for the next cycle. I am also \ngoing to ask the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee if they would have hearings on this, bring in the Air Force, \nbring in the Civil Air Patrol. Let's find out if there are any bases to \nthese allegations.\n  I called the present commanding officer of the Civil Air Patrol, Jay \nBobick, last night. I talked to him about some of the allegations that \nwere made on the record by my friend from Oklahoma. Quite frankly, I \ngot a completely different story.\n  There have been allegations of financial mismanagement and safety \nlapses, but there is no evidence to support it. There has been no \nreport by the Air Force inspector general, no report by DOD, nor by \nGAO. The Civil Air Patrol leadership rejects these allegations.\n  We don't need to rush to a hasty decision. I talked personally to \nboth the Acting Secretary of the Air Force and to the CAP leadership. I \nasked them if we could get them both together in the same room, across \nthe table from each other, and talk to one another. I said I would be \nthere. Senator Allard would be there. Anybody else is invited to come, \ntoo. Let's get these two entities together, and let's talk it out, just \nsee what is the basis of this problem. I think that is the proper way \nto proceed.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma described many of the allegations of CAP \nmissteps. Some were made, as I understand, in the record by unnamed \nformer members. Again I ask, where is the evidence? Where is the formal \nreview? Where are the hearings? Are we going to base this legislation \non unchecked allegations by unnamed former members?\n  I must say at the outset, I know of some former members of the Civil \nAir Patrol who are still upset because they were run out because they \nwere mismanaging things. Now they are coming back, writing letters, and \ndoing things like that. Well, OK, if they want to do that, that is \nfine. But let's check into it.\n  We heard last night about the infamous CAP cruise, I say to my friend \nfrom Oklahoma, a CAP cruise to wherever it was, the Bahamas or Nassau, \nsome place like that, purported as one of the worse CAP missteps, I \nlooked into the matter, and here is what I found.\n\n  It is true that in 1998 the southeast region--that is basically \nFlorida, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee; I may have missed a \ncouple States--had a meeting. They had it aboard a ship instead of at a \nhotel.\n  I point out the Civil Air Patrol regions have meetings regularly \nwithin the region and all the wings come together and they decide on \nthe location. They decided on having it on a ship.\n  Let's look at the facts. First, no Civil Air Patrol member used \nFederal dollars to pay for that cruise, not one. They paid for it out \nof their own pockets, volunteer members. It is true that some of the \nCivil Air Patrol headquarters staff at Maxwell Air Force Base attended \nthe meeting. They were reimbursed for the cost. But this has long been \nthe normal practice. They are paid Federal employees. They are not \nvolunteer members. When they go to meetings like this, they get \nreimbursed.\n  Now, we were told they were reimbursed. They got the meals free on \nthe ship, but they then got reimbursed for that.\n  This, I was told, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, is not so. What \nthey got reimbursed for was breakfast and lunch on the way to the ship, \nand they got reimbursed for breakfast and lunch or lunch and dinner on \nthe way back, which is normal, accepted Federal practice. They were not \nreimbursed for any of the meals while they were on the ship. Anyway, \nthat is what I have been told.\n  I point this out, also, to my friend from Oklahoma: The Air Force had \nno criticism of this. In fact, another key point: The Air Force has \nabout 30 staff overseeing operations and financial matters at \nheadquarters at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.\n  Before this cruise took place, the southeast region sent it up to the \nAir Force for approval. Guess what. The Air Force approved the cruise \nbefore it ever took place. That is true. The reimbursement and the \ncruise were approved by the Air Force before it ever took place. In \nother words, the Air Force already had the authority to oversee Civil \nAir Patrol financial matters. They exercised that authority and they \napproved it.\n  So I ask, where is the lack of Air Force control? They had it. And \nnow we have allegations that they took this cruise, but the Air Force \napproved it in the first place.\n  Well, now I hear there are some safety concerns. Again, we only have \nallegations. I talked to Mr. Bobick about them. I asked if there is a \nneed for a safety officer, an Air Force safety officer. I say to my \nfriend from Oklahoma that his response was fairly open. He didn't know \nabout the incident cited. Again, these are letters from unknown \nsources, unsubstantiated. But he said they would welcome an Air Force \nsafety officer. He pointed this out, I say to my friend from Oklahoma. \nThe Air Force can place a safety officer at the headquarters without \nthis legislation. They always could. They could tomorrow. Why haven't \nthey? Perhaps the Air Force didn't think it was a very serious matter.\n  Yes, I want to point out that the Air Force could--today, if they \nwant--place a safety officer at headquarters in Alabama. They have \nnever done so. I am not saying they should not, but I am saying let's \nget some studies down here and have some hearings on this before we run \noff and do something without even knowing what the facts are.\n  I want to make just one other observation. Prior to 1995, we had some \n170-plus--I will leave myself a little room--Air Force personnel at \nMaxwell running the Civil Air Patrol. The Air Force, as I have stated, \ndidn't want to do any more. We replaced them with civilians over a \nperiod of time. We replaced 170-some Air Force personnel--they drew \nthem down--with I think about 104 civilians. They pay less and we are \nactually saving the taxpayers money.\n  Now, I understand the Air Force is talking about placing a two-star \ngeneral as the executive director of the Civil Air Patrol instead of \nthe civilian we have there now. I asked for a cost estimate on that. It \nwould cost about $60,000 more per year to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask, where is the sense in doing this? Again, I am not going to say \nwe should not make some changes in the Civil Air Patrol. I believe some \nchanges are warranted. I have been involved in this a long time. I am \nnot going to say I have all the knowledge on exactly how to do it, but \nI believe we ought to bring the Air Force and Civil Air Patrol together \nand hammer this thing out. We need hearings, a GAO investigation, an IG \ninvestigation, and then let's do it in a logical manner, in a manner \nwhich really is going to keep the civilian nature of the Civil Air \nPatrol and even make it better than it is today. I believe that can be \ndone.\n  That is why I am so strongly supportive of the Allard amendment. I \nthink it takes that kind of a commonsense, logical approach to improve \nand make the Civil Air Patrol even better in the next century.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado and the Senator from \nVirginia are the only ones who have time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am controlling time for the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will yield myself a couple of minutes and I will \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  First of all, I don't disagree with many of the things the Senator \nfrom Iowa is saying. The only thing I disagree with is, we have much \nbetter\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\nproof than he is implying in terms of mismanagement.\n  I find something very interesting, and that is a letter that went out \nlast night over the web site from one of the prominent members, named \nCameron Warner, to all his fellow members. In this letter he makes it \nvery specific that we at CAP have problems--problems at the top--and \nthey are going to have to be addressed. He goes on to say that if we \ndon't do something about it, those things that we said yesterday on the \nfloor of the Senate as to ``60 Minutes'' coming in and looking at all \nthese abuses could actually be a reality. So here is a request from \nmembers of the CAP saying they want to clean up this act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            A Sad Commentary\n\n                         (By Cameron F. Warner)\n\n       Dear CAP Membership: Folks, today as I watched the debate \n     about CAP v. USAF take place on the Senate floor. I couldn't \n     help but think how sad all of this truly is. Just listen to \n     the subject matter. All this dirty laundry about CAP being \n     aired out on the Senate Floor in front of the American \n     public. Today, the image of CAP took a giant step in the \n     wrong direction relative to public perception. How \n     embarrassing to say the least! Years of good work and \n     wonderful acts by members being tarnished by the actions of a \n     few. Indeed, this is a dark day in the history of CAP.\n       It is a personal heartbreak to see just where the \n     leadership of Bobick and Albano have taken CAP. Here is CAP, \n     center stage on the United States Senate floor for all to \n     see, but not for all it's good deeds or accomplishments. \n     Quite the contrary! Rather, we have United States Senators on \n     the Senate floor talking about all the wrong doings of \n     leadership and the bad management of CAP. Sen. Inhofe talks \n     about FBI investigations of CAP. Ask yourself, how bad does \n     that sound to the American public? How does that really sound \n     to you?\n       The Allard amendment was not resolved as earlier thought, \n     so the debate will continue early tomorrow morning with a \n     vote to follow. For those of you who are interested, live \n     Senate coverage will air on CSPAN2 first thing in the \n     morning. No matter what the outcome, it will only get worse \n     for CAP and CAP will end up the big loser. Tomorrow is but \n     one battle, not the entire war. The longer this goes on and \n     the more public this becomes, the worse CAP will look in the \n     public eye no matter how you cut it. Don't be surprised if \n     Sen. Warner's concerns about the 60 Minutes bad press \n     possibility becomes a reality. CAP will not be portrayed in a \n     positive light at all.\n       How sad that this is right where Bobick, Albano, the NEC \n     and NB have lead CAP at the end of this century! Today is \n     tomorrow's history. Good work, guys!\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the other thing I want to mention is that \nwe all love the CAP. There isn't a person in the 100 Members here who \nhas worked closer with them than I have. I was a flight instructor, and \nI have been involved with these people. We love them. We don't want \nsomething to happen where all of a sudden we find out bad things are \ngoing on and the Air Force says we can't be responsible for it, dump \nthe program. We all want to save the CAP.\n  Third, I don't buy the argument when they say we are using our own \nmoney. It is 95 percent paid for by public funds. But it is always easy \nto say these funds were the ones that were the 5 percent. I am not \ncriticizing anybody for saying that, because I hear that all the time \non the floor of the Senate.\n  I have no problem with accepting this amendment. I think we can \nprobably do it by voice vote. I would like to address these things \ntogether. The Senator from Iowa and I have talked, and certainly the \nSenator from Colorado also shares the concern that there could be \nmismanagement that has to be stopped, and this is actually the request \nof the members of the CAP.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to reiterate how \nimportant the Civil Air Patrol is to States such as Colorado, \nparticularly in the mountainous regions. They have played such a vital \nrole when we have had downed aircraft in the Mountain States. They have \nbeen a nonprofit civilian organization ever since 1946, and they have \nbeen designated since 2 years after that as an auxiliary. After all, it \nis the Civil Air Patrol, not the Defense Air Patrol or the Air Force \nAir Patrol. This is the Civil Air Patrol, and it is volunteers. That \nhas been its focus. That is the strength of the organization. I think \nany effort at this point to put it under the control of the Air Force \nis premature.\n  I am glad to hear that my colleague from Oklahoma has recognized the \nfact that we can do a GAO study to look at the budget aspects of some \nof the discrepancies that supposedly come out; and then if we can get \nthe inspector general to go in and look at how the management side of \nit is handled and get concrete recommendations back to the Senate, then \nwe can go ahead and have some hearings next year. That makes good sense \nto me. I hope we can accept that plan and move forward.\n  So if they want to go with a voice vote, that is acceptable to me, \nwith the idea that we have a GAO study and we have an inspector general \nstudy, and then we have some hearings and get the facts laid out.\n  I think Senator Harkin, my colleague from Iowa, has made a good \nsuggestion, that we need to get both of them in the same room to talk \nabout these differences. I think there is all sorts of room to correct \nsome misunderstandings between the Air Force and Civil Air Patrol. I \nthink we can do it in an honest manner.\n  So I think the Allard amendment is reasonable. I think it has a \nreasonable approach, and I urge my colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee to work with us on the Allard amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add another cosponsor to the amendment, \nSenator Rod Grams of Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, do I have 4 or 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes remain.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think maybe we are going to reach a good resolution on \nthis and accept the amendment. I have no problems with a voice vote. \nThat is fine. I know the Senator from Oklahoma is sincere. We have \ntalked about this. He has been involved in the Civil Air Patrol for a \nlong time. I believe we can work this out. Again, I hope we can do it \nin a logical approach.\n  I have to chide my friend from Oklahoma a little bit here on reading \na letter on the web. I say to my friend that I know there are probably \ndisgruntled people in the CAP, like in the Air Force or anywhere \nelse. We are going to get those kinds of letters.\n\n  Again, I just repeat for the sake of emphasis that the best way to do \nthat is to get the IG to look into the darned thing and see what type \nof basis there is on that. I just want to add in my little time \nremaining that I really want to examine, perhaps, this oversight board.\n  The Air Force wanted to have a military oversight board. I personally \ndon't think that is the way to go. For the Civil Air Patrol, I agree, \nthe present structure of the board is not right. I want to say that \npublicly to my friend from Oklahoma. That is not right. But I hope to \nwork with him in thinking about an oversight board that would be more \nakin to the civilian oversight board of the academies or something like \nthat, or maybe Congress would appoint some and the President would \nappoint some where we would have a blend of civilians with the \nbackground that would give them the kind of knowledge they need to have \nan oversight of the Civil Air Patrol.\n  I hope that might be a better way of proceeding on an oversight board \nto keep it in civilian hands, but to do it in the way that is not the \npresent structure of how the board is set up, which I, quite frankly, \nthink invites a lot of problems, the way the board is set up with the \ncommander. I am willing to work on that. I think we can work that out, \nbut to have some kind of a civilian oversight board.\n  Again, I appreciate the debate we have had. I think we all are very \njustly proud of the Civil Air Patrol and what they have done in the \npast. I really believe that in the future, with drug interdiction, with \nnational disasters, the Civil Air Patrol will continue to play a vital \nrole in our society. Plus, I also want to work with my friend from \nOklahoma and my friend from Colorado.\n  I have been trying for a long time to beef up the cadet program in \nthe Civil Air Patrol. We need to strengthen the cadet program. These \ninner-city kids especially are looking for things to do. They need some \norder. They need some structure and discipline in their lives.\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\n This is what the Civil Air Patrol can do for them. It will help build \nup our summer camps where these kids get to go for a couple of weeks. \nThey can learn some technology and get some discipline and order in \ntheir lives. They can wear a uniform of which they can be proud. \nBelieve me. I think we ought to do more to strengthen and to build up \nthe cadet program in the Civil Air Patrol. I think it would be one of \nthe best things we could do for the future of our country.\n  Again, I appreciate all the work that Senator Allard has done on \nthis. I have talked to so many Democrats on my side who are supporting \nthe Allard amendment. I believe there is overwhelming support on both \nsides for this approach.\n  Again, if we want to have a voice vote on it, that is fine with me.\n  I thank my colleague from Colorado.\n  I thank my friend from Oklahoma. I think he has done a service here \nby at least highlighting the problem and pointing out that we have to \ndo something. We may have disagreed a little bit on how to do it, but \nthat is normal. I think now we are set on a course that is really going \nto improve and make the Civil Air Patrol even better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa last \nexpired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree with a lot of the things the \nSenator from Iowa is saying. I felt that we were in a position where we \ncouldn't do nothing. We had the accusations out there. I think, quite \nfrankly, ``60 Minutes'' has had more publicity out of this than the CAP \nhas. However, that is the reality. Any time there are accusations like \nthis and 95 percent of the taxpayers' money is being spent, we have a \nresponsibility for oversight. I think we will be able to do that. I \ncertainly have no objection to working on this and making it happen.\n  I also say, since I have a minute remaining, that I am particularly \nconcerned, because 2 weeks ago I was thinking about this ACP while \nflying an airplane which had an engine blow, and I wasn't sure I was \ngoing to be able to land safely gliding into the airport. I could very \nwell have been their product a couple of weeks ago.\n  I yield the remaining time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to summarize briefly before \nwe go to a vote. I think the Allard amendment is a reasonable plan. It \nsets out the process in which we can gather our facts through a GAO \nreport, and I am sure the report from the Inspector General, then hold \nsome hearings and make some reasonable decisions. We all, I think, \nagree that we need to understand the problem before we can come to some \nsatisfactory conclusion. I think the plan does that.\n  I urge the Members to vote aye. I yield any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 396) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to ask my colleagues whether \nor not they are ready to go to an amendment right this second, or \nwhether I could have 3 minutes as if in morning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, can I get more clearly in mind the amount \nof time the Senator needs?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague that I think I can do everything \nin 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is it related to the bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have a Senator that is anxious to address a matter on \nthe bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have the floor, but I know we want to \nmove forward.\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, we are going to go forward \nwith the Kennedy amendment. Is that correct? Can I ask unanimous \nconsent that after we dispense with the Kennedy amendment I have 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, allow the managers to represent to the \nSenator that we will find a window in which the Senator from Minnesota \ncan address the matter not related to the bill. But we have good \nmomentum on this bill. I would like to ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts as to what his desire is.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to submit the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will send the amendment to the desk and speak probably \nfor 4 or 5 minutes on it. I think my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, may \nwant to talk for a similar period of time. We are prepared. There is \nvirtual support for it, and no opposition. Then we would obviously like \nto get a vote on it and have it at a time that is suitable with the \nmanagers any time during the course of the day.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might inquire, Mr. President, of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, he said get the vote. Would a voice vote be suitable?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This issue is sufficiently important, Mr. President, \ndealing with Libya that I think it is advantageous to the Secretary of \nState and on the whole issue of Qadhafi that we have a strong vote in \nthe Senate. We would be glad to accommodate leaders to vote at any time \nduring the course of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, here is a schedule that the ranking member \nand I are considering; that is, to have the debate by the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from New Jersey. That would take, say, 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will only take about 4 or 5. I believe \nthat is what the Senator from New Jersey desires. But I have not heard \nfrom him this morning. I think we could at least present the amendment, \nand I will speak briefly. I am trying to get the Senator from New \nJersey here at the present time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I would suggest the following: The Senator from \nMinnesota is very anxious and very patient to try to get 5 minutes to \naddress the Senate on a matter other than the bill. I am perfectly \nwilling, as this manager, to grant him 5 minutes within which time the \nSenator can contact Senator Lautenberg. Then that will be followed, as \nsoon as the Senator from Minnesota has concluded his remarks, with 20 \nminutes of debate on the Kennedy amendment, with, let's say, 12 minutes \nunder the control of the Senator from Massachusetts, and 8 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Brownback.\n  Then we will proceed to a record vote on the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator wanted to modify 10 minutes on our side, \nthat is fine. Senator Lautenberg indicated he only wanted 5 minutes, so \nthat would be fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that modification agreeable?\n  Mr. WARNER. I withhold the request momentarily, because I am just now \ninformed that Senator Feingold is ready, in which case we would stack \nthe votes to make it convenient, if we can determine the time the \nSenator from Wisconsin desires.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have two amendments. It is perfectly acceptable to \nhave the votes stacked after they are presented. The only issue is the \ntime agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator desires a record vote on both amendments?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do. In terms of time on my side for the presentation, \n30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could the Senator identify which amendment that is?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The first amendment is the so-called cost cap amendment \nwhich I ask for a total of 30 minutes on my side; the other is the \namendment having to do with contract specifications, and we only need \n15 minutes on my side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the Senator possibly reduce 30 minutes to 20 \nminutes?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That would be difficult. We started off with 45 minutes \nand we are going down. It is a very complicated issue.\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate that, but it is a subject that I think is \npretty well known. The Senator has raised it very conscientiously \nthrough the years. We have the necessity to get this bill completed by \nearly afternoon. If the Senator could grant us 20 minutes on the first \namendment, say 10 minutes on the second amendment, then I ask for only \n5 minutes on each amendment on this side.\n  Excuse me, I am told on the first amendment the Senator from \nWisconsin would have 20 minutes; on this side, we would have 15 \nminutes; is that agreeable?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is pretty tough, but I will agree to it and \nproceed accordingly.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the first amendment.\n  As to the second amendment, the amount of time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fifteen minutes; we would take 10 minutes on this side.\n  So that concludes those two amendments.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts is agreeable now. The Senator \nhas 10 minutes equally divided and the Senator from New Jersey----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Ten minutes on our side. There is no opposition to this.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will reserve 5, in the event someone is in opposition.\n  We have three amendments: two from the Senator from Wisconsin, one \nfrom the Senator from Massachusetts. Has the Senator decided who goes \nfirst?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate going first because we will be very brief.\n  Mr. WARNER. Preceding these amendments, we want to accommodate the \nSenator from Minnesota for just 5 minutes. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will proceed as follows: 5 minutes allocated to the \nSenator from Minnesota to address the Senate; followed by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, with 10 minutes under his control; 5 minutes under \nthe control of the Senator from Virginia, if necessary. That will \nrequire a record vote, and it will be stacked. We will then proceed to \nthe Feingold amendments, the first one with 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Wisconsin, 15 under the control of the \nSenator from Virginia; then to the second Feingold amendment, 15 \nminutes under the control of the Senator from Wisconsin and 10 minutes \nunder the control of the Senator from Virginia. That will be two record \nvotes.\n  So we will have three record votes in approximately about an hour's \ntime. We will add no amendments in order to any of the three amendments \nthat we just recited.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I understand \nthe three votes will not only be stacked at the end of the debate on \nthe third amendment but that we would vote on them in the order in \nwhich they are presented; is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Virginia \nfor his graciousness, together with both of my colleagues, Senator \nKennedy and Senator Feingold.\n\n\n                                 Kosovo\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, to have \nprinted in the Record a very eloquent, powerful and important piece \nwritten by President Jimmy Carter, entitled, ``Have We Forgotten the \nPath to Peace?'' from the New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 27, 1999]\n\n                  Have We Forgotten the Path to Peace?\n\n                           (By Jimmy Carter)\n\n       After the cold war, many expected that the world would \n     enter an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Those who \n     live in developed nations might think this is the case today, \n     with the possible exception of the war in Kosovo. But at the \n     Carter Center we monitor all serious conflicts in the world, \n     and the reality is that the number of such wars has increased \n     dramatically.\n       One reason is that the United Nations was designed to deal \n     with international conflicts, and almost all the current ones \n     are civil wars in developing countries. This creates a \n     peacemaking vacuum that is most often filled by powerful \n     nations that concentrate their attention on conflicts that \n     affect them, like those in Iraq, Bosnia and Serbia. While the \n     war in Kosovo rages and dominates the world's headlines, even \n     more destructive conflicts in developing nations are \n     systematically ignored by the United States and other \n     powerful nations.\n       One can traverse Africa, from the Red Sea in the northeast \n     to the southwestern Atlantic coast, and never step on \n     peaceful territory. Fifty thousand people have recently \n     perished in the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and almost \n     two million have died during the 16-year conflict in \n     neighboring Sudan. That war has now spilled into northern \n     Uganda, whose troops have joined those from Rwanda to fight \n     in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). The \n     other Congo (Brazzaville) is also ravaged by civil war, and \n     all attempts to bring peace to Angola have failed. Although \n     formidable commitments are being made in the Balkans, where \n     white Europeans are involved, no such concerted efforts are \n     being made by leaders outside of Africa to resolve the \n     disputes. This gives the strong impression of racism.\n       Because of its dominant role in the United Nations Security \n     Council and NATO, the United States tends to orchestrate \n     global peacemaking. Unfortunately, many of these efforts are \n     seriously flawed. We have become increasingly inclined to \n     sidestep the time-tested premises of negotiation, which in \n     most cases prevent deterioration of a bad situation and at \n     least offer the prospect of a bloodless solution. Abusive \n     leaders can best be induced by the simultaneous threat of \n     consequences and the promise of reward--at least \n     legitimacy within the international community.\n       The approach the United States has taken recently has been \n     to devise a solution that best suits its own purposes, \n     recruit at least tacit support in whichever forum it can best \n     influence, provide the dominant military force, present an \n     ultimatum to recalcitrant parties and then take punitive \n     action against the entire nation to force compliance.\n       The often tragic result of this final decision is that \n     already oppressed citizens suffer, while the oppressor may \n     feel free of further consequences if he perpetrates even \n     worse crimes. Through control of the news media, he is often \n     made to seem heroic by defending his homeland against foreign \n     aggression and shifting blame for economic or political woes \n     away from himself.\n       Our general purposes are admirable: to enhance peace, \n     freedom, democracy, human rights and economic progress. But \n     this flawed approach is now causing unwarranted suffering and \n     strengthening unsavory regimes in several countries, \n     including Sudan, Cuba, Iraq and--the most troubling example--\n     Serbia.\n       There, the international community has admirable goals of \n     protecting the rights of Kosovars and ending the brutal \n     policies of Slobodan Milosevic. But the decision to attack \n     the entire nation has been counterproductive, and our \n     destruction of civilian life has now become senseless and \n     excessively brutal. There is little indication of success \n     after more than 25,000 sorties and 14,000 missiles and bombs, \n     4,000 of which were not precision guided.\n       The expected few days of aerial attacks have now lengthened \n     into months, while more than a million Kosovars have been \n     forced from their homes, many never to return even under the \n     best of circumstances. As the American-led force has expanded \n     targets to inhabited areas and resorted to the use of anti-\n     personnel cluster bombs, the result has been damage to \n     hospitals, offices and residences of a half-dozen \n     ambassadors, and the killing of hundreds of innocent \n     civilians and an untold number of conscripted troops.\n       Instead of focusing on Serbian military forces, missiles \n     and bombs are now concentrating on the destruction of \n     bridges, railways, roads, electric power, and fuel and \n     fresh water supplies. Serbian citizens report that they \n     are living like cavemen, and their torment increases \n     daily. Realizing that we must save face but cannot change \n     what has already been done, NATO leaders now have three \n     basic choices: to continue bombing ever more targets until \n     Yugoslavia (include Kosovo and Montenegro) is almost \n     totally destroyed, to rely on Russia to resolve our \n     dilemma through indirect diplomacy, or to accept American \n     casualties by sending military forces into Kosovo.\n       So far, we are following the first, and worst, option--and \n     seem to be moving toward including the third. Despite earlier \n     denials by American and other leaders, the recent decision to \n     deploy a military force of 50,000 troops on the Kosovo border \n     confirms that the use of ground troops will be necessary to \n     assure the return of expelled Albanians to their homes.\n       How did we end up in this quagmire? We have ignored some \n     basic principals that should be applied to the prevention or \n     resolution of all conflicts;\n       Short-circuiting the long-established principles of patient \n     negotiation leads to war, not peace.\n       Bypassing the Security Council weakens the United Nations \n     and often alienates permanent members who may be helpful in \n     influencing warring parties.\n       The exclusion of nongovernmental organizations from \n     peacemaking precludes vital ``second track'' opportunities \n     for resolving disputes.\n       Ignoring serious conflicts in Africa and other \n     underdeveloped regions deprives these people of justice and \n     equal rights.\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\n       Even the most severe military or economic punishment of \n     oppressed citizens is unlikely to force their oppressors to \n     yield to American demands.\n       The United States' insistence on the use of cluster bombs, \n     designed to kill or maim humans, is condemned almost \n     universally and brings discredit on our nation (as does our \n     refusal to support a ban on land mines).\n       Even for the world's only superpower, the ends don't always \n     justify the means.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will read the relevant section:\n\n       Our general purposes are admirable: to enhance peace, \n     freedom, democracy, human rights and economic progress. But \n     this flawed approach is now causing unwarranted suffering and \n     strengthening unsavory regimes in several countries, \n     including Sudan, Cuba, Iraq and--the most troubling example--\n     Serbia.\n       There, the international community has admirable goals of \n     protecting the rights of Kosovars and ending the brutal \n     policies of Slobodan Milosevic.

Today there is a report in the Washington \nPost that we are going to be going after telephone systems, \ncommunications, in Yugoslavia, as well as bombing electrical grids. \nThis ends up targeting the people there.\n  Slobodan Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal. He has \ncommitted brutal crimes against the Kosovars. But the citizens of \nYugoslavia have not been the ones who have committed these crimes.\n  I come to the floor to say to all of my colleagues, I hope you have \ntime to read President Carter's piece. I believe we are severely \nundercutting our own moral authority by targeting the civilian \ninfrastructure. I think we are making a terrible mistake by doing so. I \ncome to the floor of the Senate to speak out against this and to make \nit clear that this goes far beyond what we said was our original goal \nof these airstrikes and our military action--which was to degrade the \nmilitary capacity of Milosevic.\n  Now this infrastructure is being targeted. Too many civilians are \nbeing targeted. As a Senator, I call into question these airstrikes. I \nthink Jimmy Carter has done a real service for the country by writing \nthis piece, putting the emphasis on diplomacy, putting the emphasis on \na diplomatic solution to this conflict.\n\n\n                      Veterans Accountability Day\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues \nabout a nationwide event which is going to be taking place the Memorial \nDay weekend.\n  This is going to be an accountability day.

WELLSTONE. Let me urge colleagues during this recess to attend \nthese sessions with the veterans community. This is an important voice. \nThey have many important concerns to raise with us. I hope the Democrat \nand Republican Senators will make sure they meet with veterans as we \nmove forward in this whole budget debate and appropriations. Right now \nthe message is that the veterans should not expect timely care, the \nveterans can do with less health care, the veterans are not a top \npriority. We have to change that.\n  The veterans are organizing and the veterans are going to put the \npressure on us and I hope we will respond.\n  I thank my colleagues for their graciousness and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 442\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the continuation \n                      of sanctions against Libya)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment for myself and the \nSenator from New Jersey and others to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONTINUATION \n                   OF SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On December 21, 1988, 270 people, including 189 United \n     States citizens, were killed in a terrorist bombing on Pan Am \n     103 Flight over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n       (2) Britain and the United States indicted two Libyan \n     intelligence agents, Abd al-Baset Ali al-Megrahi and Al-Amin \n     Khalifah Fhimah, in 1991 and sought their extradition from \n     Libya to the United States or the United Kingdom to stand \n     trial for this heinous terrorist act.\n       (3) The United Nations Security Council called for the \n     extradition of the suspects in Security Council Resolution \n     731 and imposed sanctions on Libya in Security Council \n     Resolutions 748 and 883 because Libyan leader Colonel Muammar \n     Qadhafi refused to transfer the suspects to either the United \n     States or the United Kingdom to stand trial.\n       (4) The United Nations Security Council Resolutions 731, \n     748, and 883 demand that Libya cease all support for \n     terrorism, turn over the two suspects, cooperate with the \n     investigation and the trial, and address the issue of \n     appropriate compensation.\n       (5) The sanctions in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 748 and 883 include--\n       (A) a worldwide ban on Libya's national airline;\n       (B) a ban on flights into and out of Libya by other \n     nations' airlines; and\n       (C) a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, and \n     certain oil equipment to Libya, and a blocking of Libyan \n     Government funds in other countries.\n       (6) Colonel Muammar Qadhafi for many years refused to \n     extradite the suspects to either the United States or the \n     United Kingdom and had insisted that he would only\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\n     transfer the suspects to a third and neutral country to stand \n     trial.\n       (7) On August 24, 1998, the United States and the United \n     Kingdom agreed to the proposal that Colonel Qadhafi transfer \n     the suspects to The Netherlands, where they would stand trial \n     under a Scottish court, under Scottish law, and with a panel \n     of Scottish judges.\n       (8) The United Nations Security Council endorsed the United \n     States-United Kingdom proposal on August 27, 1998 in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1192.\n       (9) The United States, consistent with United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions, called on Libya to ensure the \n     production of evidence, including the presence of witnesses \n     before the court, and to comply fully with all the \n     requirements of the United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions.\n       (10) After years of intensive diplomacy, Colonel Qadhafi \n     finally transferred the two Libyan suspects to The \n     Netherlands on April 5, 1999, and the United Nations Security \n     Council, in turn, suspended its sanctions against Libya that \n     same day.\n       (11) Libya has only fulfilled one of four conditions (the \n     transfer of the two suspects accused in the Lockerbie \n     bombing) set forth in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 731, 748, and 883 that would justify the lifting \n     of United Nations Security Council sanctions against Libya.\n       (12) Libya has not fulfilled the other three conditions \n     (cooperation with the Lockerbie investigation and trial; \n     renunciation of and ending support for terrorism; and payment \n     of appropriate compensation) necessary to lift the United \n     Nations Security Council sanctions.\n       (13) The United Nations Secretary General is expected to \n     issue a report to the Security Council on or before July 5, \n     1999, on the issue of Libya's compliance with the remaining \n     conditions.\n       (14) Any member of the United Nations Security Council has \n     the right to introduce a resolution to lift the sanctions \n     against Libya after the United Nations Secretary General's \n     report has been issued.\n       (15) The United States Government considers Libya a state \n     sponsor of terrorism and the State Department Report, \n     ``Patterns of Global Terrorism; 1998'', stated that Colonel \n     Qadhafi ``continued publicly and privately to support \n     Palestinian terrorist groups, including the PIJ and the PFLP-\n     GC''.\n       (16) United States Government sanctions (other than \n     sanctions on food or medicine) should be maintained on Libya, \n     and in accordance with U.S. law, the Secretary of State \n     should keep Libya on the list of countries the governments of \n     which have repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 in light of Libya's ongoing \n     support for terrorists groups.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should use all diplomatic means necessary, \n     including the use of the United States veto at the United \n     Nations Security Council, to prevent the Security Council \n     from lifting sanctions against Libya until Libya fulfills all \n     of the conditions set forth in United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 731, 748, and 883.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  This is an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators Lautenberg, \nBrownback, Gordon Smith, Moynihan, Schumer, Torricelli, Mikulski, and \nKyl. This amendment states the sense of the Congress that UN Security \nCouncil sanctions against Libya should not be lifted until Libya meets \nall conditions specified in UN Security Council Resolutions 731, 748, \nand 883, and urges the Secretary of State to use all diplomatic means \nnecessary to prevent sanctions from being lifted before these \nconditions are met.\n  On December 21, 1988, 270 people, including 189 U.S. citizens, were \nkilled in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am 103 Flight over Lockerbie, \nScotland. In 1991, Britain and the United States indicted two Libyan \nintelligence agents and sought their extradition from Libya to the \nUnited States or the United Kingdom to stand trial for this despicable \nact. Libyan leader Qadhafi refused to transfer the suspects, and the \nUnited Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya.\n  The sanctions in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 748 and \n883 include a worldwide ban on Libya's national airline; a ban on \nflights into and out of Libya by other nations' airlines; a prohibition \non supplying arms, airplane parts, and certain oil equipment to Libya, \nand a blocking of Libyan Government funds in other countries.\n  The Security Council demanded that Libya cease all support for \nterrorism and terrorist groups, turn over the two suspects, cooperate \nwith the investigation and the trial, and address the issue of \nappropriate compensation for the victims' families before sanctions \ncould be lifted.\n  Last month, after years of intensive diplomacy, a compromise was \nfinally reached, and Colonel Qadhafi transferred the two suspects to \nThe Netherlands, where they will be tried under a Scottish court, under \nScottish law, before a panel of Scottish judges. The United Nations \nSecurity Council, in turn, suspended its sanctions against Libya that \nsame day.\n  On or before July 5, the United Nations Secretary General will issue \na report to the Security Council on the issue of Libya's compliance \nwith the remaining conditions. I hope he will recommend that the \nsanctions against Libya should not be permanently lifted.\n  It is clear that Libya has only fulfilled one of the four \nconditions--the transfer of the suspects accused in the Lockerbie \nbombing--in the UN Security Council resolutions. Libya has not ceased \nits support for terrorist groups. The State Department's ``Patterns of \nGlobal Terrorism: 1998'' clearly states that Colonel Qadhafi \n``continued publicly and privately to support Palestinian terrorist \ngroups . . .'' In addition, because the trial has not begun and is \nexpected to last at least several months, it would be premature to \nconclude that Libya has fulfilled the other remaining conditions.\n  The amendment I am offering expresses our view that the United \nNations Security Council should not permanently lift the sanctions \nagainst Libya, until Libya has fulfilled all of the remaining \nconditions in the Security Council resolutions. It also calls upon the \nSecretary of State to use all diplomatic means necessary, including the \nuse of our veto at the U.N. Security Council, to prevent the Security \nCouncil from lifting sanctions against Libya until Libya fulfills all \nof the conditions.\n  The Secretary of State has steadfastly and commendably maintained a \nvigilant stand against Libya, and this amendment will provide the \nstrong support of Congress for using all diplomatic means necessary, \nincluding the use of the veto, to block the lifting of the sanctions.\n  Mr. President, it would be a gross injustice to the Pan Am 103 \nfamilies, who have suffered so much in this ordeal, to reward Libya for \npolicies it has not fulfilled. We must all remain vigilant and make \nsure that justice is served in all of its aspects in the Lockerbie \nbombing trial. We must remain vigilant and make sure that Libya \nceases--not just in words, but in deeds--its support for terrorist \ngroups.\n  I know of no opposition to this amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my colleague, Senator \nLautenberg, be able to retain his 5 minutes on this.\n  It is the intention, if I could ask the floor managers, to ask for \nthe yeas and nays at the appropriate time for all the amendments. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Can we get the yeas and nays on the Kennedy amendment now? \nMr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Massachusetts has requested, and I surely \nhave no objection, that the remainder of his time be saved and reserved \nuntil some point either during or after the conclusion of the Feingold \namendments. If that is agreeable with the Senator from Wisconsin, I \nthink that would accommodate Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have no objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want to clarify, the votes would still all be stacked \nat the end of that period; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that point? My friend from \nVirginia is attempting, if the Senator from Virginia is able to do \nthis, to see if we cannot have the votes begin at a slightly later time \nthan would previously be indicated by the way in which the three \namendments are stacked. Since the\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\nSenator from Virginia is the manager, if he is willing, we could give \nthat preliminary alert.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Democratic leader \nhas a commitment at the White House. We were not aware of that at the \ntime this was established. We want to accommodate the minority leader, \nand therefore we will at this time vacate the order of the timing of \nthese three votes until we can establish another time. But I would want \nthe Senate to know that time would be right around 12 to 12:30.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be very accommodating.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent to vacate that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will continue with the debate and conclude all \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask to be informed by the Chair at a \npoint when I have consumed 15 minutes of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 443\n\n       (Purpose: To limit the total cost of the F/A-18 E/F \n     aircraft program.)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 443.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, after line 25, insert the following:\n       (c) Limitation on Total Cost.--(1) For the fiscal years \n     2000 through 2004, the total amount obligated or expended for \n     production of airframes, contractor furnished equipment, and \n     engines under the F/A-18E/F aircraft program may not exceed \n     $8,840,795,000.\n       (2) The Secretary of the Navy shall adjust the amount of \n     the limitation under paragraph (1) by the following amounts:\n       (A) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     attributable to economic inflation occurring since September \n     30, 1999.\n       (B) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     attributable to compliance with changes in Federal, State, or \n     local laws enacted after September 30, 1999.\n       (C) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     resulting from aircraft quantity changes within the scope of \n     the multiyear contract.\n       (3) The Secretary of the Navy shall annually submit to \n     Congress, at the same time the budget is submitted under \n     section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, written \n     notice of any change in the amount set forth in paragraph (1) \n     during the preceding fiscal year that the Secretary has \n     determined to be associated with a cost referred to in \n     paragraph (2).\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is a straightforward, \ncommon sense measure that establishes greater accountability in the \nNavy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program.\n  The Navy and Boeing say they need $8.8 billion over the next five \nyears to procure the Super Hornet. Specifically, they say the $8.8 \nbillion would procure the airframe, contractor furnished equipment, and \nengines. My amendment simply sets a cost cap that holds them to that \namount. My amendment doesn't terminate the funding; it doesn't hold \nthat money up; it doesn't even restrict use of the money. My amendment \njust holds them to the amount that they say they need.\n  I would like to discuss the spectacular medicocrity of the Navy's F/\nA-18E/F, or Super Hornet, aircraft program, and to raise concerns about \nthe poor decisions that have been made with regard to this \nbreathtakingly expensive program.\n  President Eisenhower warned us four decades ago about the inexorable \nmomentum of the military-industrial complex. Today we face the \nmilitary-industrial-congressional complex that plods forward with a \nrelentlessness that Ike, for all his foresight, could not have \nimagined. I have long feared that the Super Hornet is not the future of \nnaval aviation, but rather a step backward. The Super Hornet just isn't \nworth the cost. It's as simple as that.\n  The Pentagon wants to spend 45 billion of our tax dollars to buy the \nSuper Hornet for the Navy. But the plane isn't as good, in some \nrespects, as the one they currently use, and may have design problems \nthat could cost billions more to fix. ``Super'' is not the way to \ndescribe this plane--``superfluous'' really is.\n  For very limited gain, the American taxpayers are getting hit with a \n100 percent premium on the sticker price.\n  At this point in the program's development and testing, my colleagues \nmay be asking why I continue to tilt at this windmill. I continue this \neffort in part because pilots' lives may be placed at risk in the E/F \nfor the next 25 to 30 years. I come to the floor today to point out not \njust the failings of the Super Hornet but the failed decision-making \nprocess that has brought us to this point--a point where both the \nPentagon and Congress continue to approach a 21st century reality with \na Cold War mentality.\n  Exhibit A for this failed decisionmaking process is the Defense \nDepartment's current strategy for its aviation programs. The Super \nHornet is just one overpriced piece of this strategy, which carries an \nalmost $350 billion price tag. Here is the real kicker: The strategy \nwill not even adequately replace our existing tactical aviation fleet.\n  This strategy has been roundly criticized. It has been criticized by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, members \nof the congressional Armed Services Committees, the Cato Institute, and \ndefense experts such as President Reagan's Assistant Secretary of \nDefense, Lawrence Korb.\n  The Navy's Super Hornet is just the crown jewel in this misguided \ntactical aviation acquisition strategy.\n  The story of the Super Hornet is one of huge sums of money spent with \nreally very disappointing returns. The plane's failings have been \nexpensive and alarming. These problems do not just empty our \npocketbook; they could endanger our pilots.\n  I want to discuss what the Navy has described as the ``pillars'' of \nthe Super Hornet program. These are the performance parameters that the \nNavy touts as justifications for this expensive program. But these \npillars have become problems.\n  First and foremost is the plane's range. The Navy argues that the \nSuper Hornet will fly significantly farther than the Hornet. But these \nimprovements have yet to be proven in reality. What is worse, initial \nSuper Hornet range predictions have actually declined as flight data \nhas been gathered. By continuing to base range predictions on actual \nflight test data, the Super Hornet range in the interdiction role \namounts to an 8-percent improvement over the Hornet, and this is not \nparticularly impressive.\n  Adding to the range shortcoming is the wing-drop problem. When the \nSuper Hornet is in air-to-air combat, when it most needs to maintain \nits precise ability to position itself, the plane can lose wing lift, a \nproblem beyond the pilot's control that essentially causes the plane to \nroll out of position.\n  We have been wrestling with the wing problem for a couple of years \nnow, and it still is not resolved. Potential fixes for the wing-drop \nproblem will decrease range, but since we do not know which solution \nthe Navy will employ, the actual decrease is not yet known.\n  Also affecting the range, believe it or not, is the potential of \nbombs colliding with each other or with the aircraft. The Navy's \nsolution increases drag, thus resulting in a deficiency that would \npreclude the aircraft from carrying external fuel tanks. If the \naircraft does not carry the two 480-gallon tanks, it will not be able \nto meet its required range specification. The Navy and its contractor \nnow have little choice but to redesign the wing pylons.\n  A second pillar of the program is survivability. Since the inception \nof the Super Hornet program, the Navy has asserted that the aircraft \nwill be more survivable than the current Hornet. Based on operational \ntests, however, survivability issues now comprise the majority of the \nprogram's deficiencies, as identified by the Procurement Executive \nOffice for Tactical Aircraft. A chief survivability problem is that the \nplane's exhaust will actually burn through its decoy tow line. The \ntowed decoy is designed to attract enemy missiles away from the \naircraft. Obviously, losing a decoy will not increase survivability.\n  A third pillar put forth is growth space, or space availability to \naccommodate new systems. When the Navy\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\nwas pitching the Super Hornet to Congress, they said the Hornet just \ndid not provide enough space to accommodate additional new systems \nwithout removing existing capability. We were told that the Super \nHornet would have a 21 cubic feet of growth space versus less than a \nfew feet in the Hornet. But now, GAO actually reports that the Super \nHornet has only 5.46 cubic feet of usable growth space. The Navy's F/A-\n18 upgrade roadmap shows that most of the upgrades planned for the \nSuper Hornet are already planned to be installed on the Hornet as well.\n\n  The remaining pillars are that of payload and bringback. The Navy \nclaims that the Super Hornet would provide greater payload and \nbringback than the Hornet. Increased payload should mean the Super \nHornet is able to carry more weapons and fuel, and increased bringback \nshould mean that the Super Hornet should return from its mission \ncarrying more of its unused weapons than the Hornet, so pilots do not \nhave to lessen their load for the trip home by dropping missiles \nunnecessarily. That is what payload and bringback should mean, but with \nthe Super Hornet, the reality falls short of expectation.\n  Flight tests have revealed additional wing stations that allow for \nincreased payload may cause noise and vibration that could damage \nmissiles. In response to this glitch, the Navy is determining whether \nthe missiles need to be redesigned. The Navy also plans to restrict \nwhat can be carried on inner wing pylons during Operational Test and \nEvaluation because of the excessive loads on them. These restrictions \nwould prohibit the Super Hornet from carrying 2,000-pound bombs on \nthese pylons, which reduces the payload capacity for the interdiction \nmission. GAO also reports that the pylon load problems could negatively \naffect bringback.\n  What all this technical talk is about, simply stated, is that the \npillars supporting the Super Hornet program are crumbling. But don't \ntake my word for it. Just look at the troubling evidence amassed by the \nGAO which makes the best case yet against the Super Hornet program.\n  According to GAO, the aircraft's performance is less than stellar. In \nfact, GAO reports that the aircraft offers only marginal improvements \nover the Hornet, the same finding it made in 1996. Over the last 3 \nyears, GAO has offered evidence of shortcomings in each and every area \nthe Navy declared as justifications for the Super Hornet. In addition, \nthe Super Hornet is actually worse than the Hornet in turning, \naccelerating, and climbing--actually worse than the plane we are using \nnow that is less expensive.\n  GAO testified recently before Congress that the Super Hornet is not \nmeeting all of its performance requirements. It is behind schedule, and \nit is above cost, regardless of Navy boasts to the contrary. The Navy's \nstatements on performance actually reflect the single-seat E model of \nthe aircraft, and it does not factor in the performance of the less \ncapable two-seat F model. This is troubling because the F model \nactually comprises 56 percent of the Pentagon's purchasing plan for the \noverall Super Hornet program. Not only that, the Navy's assertions \nabout performance are based on projections, not on actual performance.\n  GAO's work has made crystal clear the setbacks the Super Hornet has \nalready faced and the serious problems that lie ahead. There is really \na mountain of evidence against the Super Hornet. The Navy's response to \nthat mountain of evidence has been simply to tell you: It's a molehill; \ndon't worry about it.\n  To close the cost gap between the Super Hornet and Hornet aircraft, \nBoeing is shutting down production lines for the Hornet. Those lines \nmay be prohibitively expensive to reopen if we ever face the facts and \ndecide that the Super Hornet is not worth the cost and risk.\n  The Navy's response to the Super Hornet's troubles has been to play \ngames, to divert attention from the plane's failings, to keep the Navy \nfrom relying on the more reliable Hornet, and, most of all, they are \nplaying games with Federal tax dollars. These games have to stop.\n\n  For the sake of our pilots and American taxpayers, the Navy must be \nforthright with us. By any reasonable assessment, the Super Hornet \nprogram has problems that have to be corrected before we commit our \npilots and our taxpayers to a long-term obligation.\n  But that is what is so disturbing here, Mr. President. At the very \nmoment we should be pausing to reassess this program, in our oversight \nrole, the Navy and the Pentagon are pushing for a multiyear procurement \ncontract.\n  This is despite the fact that the Navy has identified 29 major \nunresolved deficiencies in the aircraft. The Program Risk Advisory \nBoard, which is made up of Navy and contractor personnel, states that \nthere is a medium risk--a medium risk--that the operational test and \nevaluation might find the Super Hornet is not operationally effective \nand/or suitable, even if all performance requirements are met. In other \nwords, even if they fix all the problems plaguing the plane, the Super \nHornet still might not cut the mustard. How can we sign off on a 5-year \n$9 billion contract before an aircraft is certified operationally \neffective?\n  I am very puzzled by that. Instead of signing off on this leap of \nfaith, I suggest the Navy complete OPEVAL and then reassess the \nprudence of a multiyear procurement contract. The Super Hornet's OPEVAL \nwill allow the Navy and its contractor to stress the aircraft as it \nwould be stressed in the fleet. A multiyear procurement decision prior \nto OPEVAL defeats the purpose of the test.\n  It is not unreasonable to ask that all deficiency corrections be \nincorporated into the aircraft design and successfully tested prior to \na 5-year, $9 billion procurement commitment. Not only is it not \nunreasonable, it is consistent with existing Navy criteria.\n  What concerns me most here is the conduct of the Navy and the \nPentagon as they have tried to ensure that the Super Hornet has a place \nin its aviation program. At every turn, they have pushed this plane, \ndespite all logic to the contrary. They have even resisted answering \nsimple, straightforward questions about the plane's performance.\n  My own experiences trying to extract information from the Pentagon \nabout the Super Hornet's performance have been fraught with \ndifficulties. Last November, I sent a straightforward letter to the \nSecretary of Defense that asked some simple questions about the status \nof the E/F. At the time, Congress had just appropriated more than $2 \nbillion for the third lot of production. After that letter, I wrote \nfour additional times urging DOD to answer very specific, clear \nquestions regarding the performance of the aircraft in its latest \nflight test.\n  Three months later, I received a memorandum stating that it \n``addresses some'' of my ``concerns.'' This was unfortunate because I \nwas assured by Pentagon officials familiar with the report that my \nquestions could be easily answered in full. I can assure everyone who \nis listening that I will not stop asking until I get answers.\n  I would like to conclude my initial remarks by telling my favorite \nstory about this profoundly flawed program.\n  This past January, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, \nDevelopment, and Acquisition commissioned an independent study to \naddress my questions. I had been asking for a study for some time, so I \nwas heartened and relieved and looking forward to the results.\n  Unfortunately, the person chosen to lead the inquiry is a well known \nWashington defense lobbyist who had a longstanding business \nrelationship with Boeing, the Super Hornet's primary contractor. During \nthe meeting with my staff, the lobbyist did not disclose his firm's \nassociation with Boeing. Later my staff telephoned him, and he \ndescribed his firm's association with Boeing in response to direct \nquestions from my staff. Then he went on to say that he had terminated \nhis relationship with Boeing ``a few days'' after Mr. Buchanan asked \nhim to perform the independent review--``a few days.''\n  No one will be shocked to hear that the report was very favorable to \nthe Super Hornet.\n  This latest episode with the Super Hornet highlights a pervasive \nPentagon mindset that sometimes sacrifices the interests of our men and \nwomen in uniform to the assumption that bigger and more expensive \nprograms are always better. It puts in stark relief the power of the \ndefense industry which gave more than $10 million in PAC money and soft \nmoney to\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\nparties and candidates in the last election cycle.\n  In the last 10 years, the defense industry gave almost $40 million to \nthe two national political parties. You know, for that much money, they \ncould buy their own Hornet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 of his 20 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the last 10 years, the defense \nindustry gave almost $40 million to the two national political parties. \nFor that kind of money, these interests could have gotten their own \nHornet. Unfortunately, they would have needed another $36 million to \nget themselves a Super Hornet.\n  Boeing, the Super Hornet's primary contractor, gave more than $3 \nmillion in PAC money and more than $1.5 million in soft money during \nthat same period. There were no PACs in Eisenhower's day, but this is \nwhat he warned us about, only with higher stakes than he may have \nimagined.\n  I have stood on the floor of the Senate for 3 years now discussing \nthe inadequacy of the Super Hornet program. And for 3 years, Congress \nhas turned a deaf ear to the facts. I harbor no illusions that the \nSuper Hornet will be terminated. I do hold out hope that this body will \nuse some common sense in procuring the aircraft.\n  My amendment does nothing more than set a cost cap using the exact \ndollar amount put forward by the Navy--nothing more, nothing less.\n  We owe it to our naval aviators to give them a product worthy of \ntheir courage and dedication. And we owe it to the American taxpayers \nto ensure that we are using their money to modernize our Armed Forces \nwisely.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays and reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the manager of \nthis bill for giving me the opportunity to rise in strongest opposition \nto the amendment offered by my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  This is becoming an annual ritual where the Senator from Wisconsin \nseeks to undermine the Navy's No. 1 procurement priority against the \nwill of the administration, the Department of Defense, and at the \nexpense of our Navy warfighters.\n  There are quite a few problems with this amendment and the one that \nhe will offer to follow it. But on this first one, it is absolutely not \nnecessary. A fixed-price contract is already in place. So submitting an \namendment that purports to do what is already being done is redundant.\n  Cost caps are normally reserved for problem programs to control cost \noverruns in the development phase. The F-18 E/F program of today is a \nmodel program which has consistently come in under budget. It is a well \ncontrolled program with cost incentives in place.\n  The attacks on this program can best be summed up by the words: Don't \nconfuse me with the facts, I have my prejudices, and I have my \nviewpoints that I am going to argue, regardless of what the facts are. \nBecause the facts are that the F-18 E/F procurement program is under \nbudget and it is ahead of schedule.\n  It absolutely amazes me that the Senator from Wisconsin would seek \none more time to hamper the program by adding further administrative \ncost controls for a program that has already been reviewed by the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, \nand the Senate Appropriations Committee. All three of these bodies \nreviewed the F-18 program and found no need to add further \nadministrative constraints to this successful program.\n  There is a report out, that was put out a year ago by Rear Admiral \nNathman, the ``N88 Position on OT-IIB.'' This report answers all of the \ncontentions raised by the Senator from Wisconsin. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this summary be printed in the Record.\n  We will have it available for anybody who wants to read it, the \nspecific responses to all the points raised. They have been available \nto the Senator from Wisconsin, and all of us, for over a year.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         N88 Position on OT-IIB\n\n       The OT-IIB Report has done an excellent job of further \n     quantifying and qualifying known issues with the F/A-18E/F. \n     The Navy Developmental and Operational Test process is \n     structured to identify issues prior to production to avoid \n     costly production modifications.\n       The OT-IIB Report has revalidated that process, confirming \n     that no such issues exist. The F/A-18E/F Hornet Program \n     remains a model program, on cost, on schedule, under budget \n     and meeting or exceeding all performance parameters.--RADM \n     Nathman.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Admiral Nathman says:\n\n       The OT-IIB Report has done an excellent job of further \n     quantifying and qualifying known issues with the F/A-18E/F. \n     The Navy Developmental and Operational Test process is \n     structured to identify issues prior to production to avoid \n     costly production modifications.\n       The OT-IIB Report has revalidated that process, confirming \n     that no such issues exist. The F/A-18E/F Hornet Program \n     remains a model program, on cost, on schedule, under budget \n     and meeting or exceeding all performance parameters.\n\n  I think we can take the word of the person who has the responsibility \nfor operational program review. We have people who do this for a living \nand who look at these programs full-time. This is what they are saying \nabout the program.\n  The F/A-18 multiyear contract will be a fixed price incentive \ncontract. It is a capped program in application. But the agency retains \ncontract administration flexibility, and the contractor maintains \ninherent cost control incentives. The statutory cap being proposed \nwould undoubtedly increase contract administration costs.\n  In an era where we are experiencing vexing retention problems, I see \nno need to add additional burdens to a major acquisition program \nintended to give our warfighters the best equipment available.\n  The viability of the Navy's tactical aviation program is directly \ntied to the success of this program, and any effort to tie up this \nprogram with needless administrative controls is counterproductive. The \namendment also contains no cost exemptions that would exclude costs \nbeyond the control of the contractor, such as allowance for new \ntechnology built into later models or changes in aircraft quantity.\n  To date, the F-18E/F has flown 4,665 hours during more than 3,100 \nflights with no mishaps. The aircraft just finished the Engineering, \nManufacturing, and Development phase and is scheduled to enter the \nOperational Test and Evaluation Phase, or OPEVAL, this week. It is \nanticipated that OPEVAL will be complete, looking to have a decision on \nfull rate production by March 2000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask if I might be accorded 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for a moment, \nwe are very anxious to start votes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator 2 of my 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think this would be an appropriate time for the \nmanagers to address the Senate as to the schedule of voting.\n  We are now hoping to start the first vote at about 11:50. That vote \nwould be in the normal sequencing of time, and we hope thereafter to \nhave the two following votes at 10 minutes each. I will not propound \nthat at this moment. I wish to alert the Senate and those debating so \nwhen I object to any extension of time for this debate to accommodate a \nnumber of Senators on the vote schedule, they will understand. I do not \npropose a UC at this time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 2 \nminutes from the time of the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BOND. Surely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So we can sequence Senator Lautenberg's 5 minutes for an \nearlier amendment in this process, after the Senator from Missouri is \nfinished his time and the Senator from\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nPennsylvania is recognized, the Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. You have a few Missouris mixed up. On the No. 1 \namendment, you are going to deal with that; is that correct?\n  Mr. BOND. I will make brief comments about the second amendment, and \nthen I will conclude.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could you advise the managers at what juncture we could \ncomplete Senator Lautenberg's 5 minutes on the Kennedy amendment? What \nwould be convenient?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I only need about 2 minutes to finish up all \nof my efforts on both of these, if I could finish.\n  Mr. WARNER. So in between the two amendments we could get 5 minutes?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, that would be fine with me. The two \nSenators from Missouri, myself, and then I would be happy to----\n  Mr. WARNER. Why don't you finish up the first amendment, inform the \nChair, and then we will have Senator Lautenberg complete the Kennedy \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri is recognized for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Let me reiterate that the F/A-18 program is under budget \nand ahead of schedule. Why don't we just ask the men and women who have \nflown them? Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, came before us. \nHe represents, and is responsible for, the men and women who fly these \naircraft. He has flown one, and has given overwhelming, enthusiastic, \nand unqualified support for the Super Hornet.\n  Now, we have hearings in this body for a reason; that is, to listen \nto the people who have the expertise and the experience. These people \nhave told us that the E/F is the best thing we have for the Navy, and \nthey want them. They know it is ahead of schedule, and under budget, \nwith improved performance. Why do we even bother with hearings if we do \nnot pay attention?\n  I say, with respect to the second amendment, this is an attempt to \nset up the GAO as a decision making authority in the Defense \nDepartment. Constitutionally they are not authorized to do so. We have \na director of OPEVAL, who is appointed by the President with advice and \nconsent of the Senate, to make these decisions. I believe in \nlegislative oversight. I believe in the GAO having a responsibility to \nraise questions. The people who have the responsibility in the \nexecutive branch have answered these questions.\n  I think it is time to quit hampering the program, trying to kill or \ncripple a program that is providing us the best tactical aircraft for \nthe Navy's carriers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in what I trust will be a tabling motion \nto table both of the amendments or to vote against them if they are not \ntabled.\n  I thank the Chair and the chairman of the subcommittee for giving me \nthis opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in response to the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri has stated eloquently the need to \nrespond to the military demands of America in ways that the military \nbelieves are effective. We have in the E/F a program that is under \nbudget, under cost. It is on schedule. It is certified ready for \noperational test and evaluation.\n  Those who have had the ability and opportunity to fly it have \ncertified to its character and its characteristics as those that are \nneeded. Every aircraft that we have in our arsenal has some \ncharacteristics which preclude others. There are tradeoffs. So there \nwill be those who attack this aircraft and say it doesn't do this as \nwell as something else does, or it doesn't do that as well as another \nplane does. The fact of the matter is, a plane must do what it is \ndesigned to do. When it does what it is designed to do, it meets the \nneeds of the defense of this United States of America.\n  Aircraft fighters and attack aircraft are designed to do specific \nthings. There is a need--and we have seen it; we are seeing it plainly \nin the arena of conflict today in the Balkans--for additional mission \nradius. There is a need for the ability to fly further. There is a need \nfor increasing the payload. If you look at the strike-sortie to just \ngeneral sortie ratio in the war in the Balkans, it is far different \nthan it was in the war in Desert Storm. That is because we are basing \nour planes in a different place.\n  This particular aircraft has a 37-percent increase in mission radius. \nThat is important. It is a design feature. It is needed. It is \nsomething the Defense Department and those who fly these airplanes \nunderstand we have to have in order to defend our interests and to \nprotect the most important resource we have in our defense operations, \nand that is the human resource of our pilots.\n  There is a 60-percent increase in recovery payload. Depending on the \nmission, the E/F has two to five times the strike capability of the \nearlier model, two to five times the strike capability, being able to \nput destruction on a target. That is an important thing to understand.\n  There is a 25-percent increase in frame size to accommodate 20 years \nof upgrades in cooling, power, and other internal systems. That is \nimportant.\n  It may be said this aircraft is only marginally better. Well, the \nmargin is what wins races. The winner in the 100 yard dash does it in \n10.4 seconds. The loser does it in 10.5 seconds. It is only marginally \nbetter, but marginal superiority is what wins conflicts. It is what \nsaves lives. It is what makes a difference.\n  In testimony before the Armed Services Committee, Phil Coyle, \nDirector, Operational Test and Evaluation, Department of Defense, said \nit this way:\n\n       The Department of Defense embarked upon the F/A-18E/F \n     program primarily to increase the Navy's capability to attack \n     ground targets at longer ranges.\n\n  Does that sound familiar? That is where we are right now in the \nBalkans. We are having to fly lots of sorties, because we have to have \nlots of refueling and other things, because the current things that we \nhave do not have the ability to attack and increase our ability to \nattack ground targets at longer ranges.\n\n  In order to obtain this objective, the principal improved \ncharacteristics were increased range and payload; increased capability \nto bring back unused weapons to a carrier; improved survivability; and \ngrowth capacity to incorporate future advanced subsystems . . . .\n  Three to five times the strike capability. We need to be able to add \nimproved technology. It is my understanding the Senator from Wisconsin \nwants to flatten the plane out, simply to say it can be this plane and \nno further. If there is a generation of technology available to upgrade \nthis, we need to be able to add the upgrades.\n  I think we need to be in a position where we can do for those who \nfight for America and freedom that which will serve their best \ninterests. The idea, somehow, that the GAO should make a determination \nabout whether an airplane is ready--I served as an auditor. For 2 years \nI was the auditor for the State of Missouri. It is a great job. It is a \nwonderful responsibility. But those flying green eyeshades and walnut \ndesks in Washington should not be compared to those who fly fighters to \ndefend freedom. We shouldn't have the green eyeshade accountant flying \na desk in Washington telling us whether or not the fighter is fit to \nfight. We need to rely on the responsible testimony and information \nprovided to us by those whose job it is to defend America and whose \nlives depend on the fighter being fit to fight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. What was the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas 3 minutes, the Senator from Wisconsin has 3 minutes, and then the \nSenator from New Jersey will be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think the fine representatives from \nthe State of Missouri, Senators Bond and Ashcroft, addressed the issue \nof the F/A-18E/F adequately on the merits. Frankly, I will not address \nthat because that is not what this amendment does.\n  This amendment has nothing to do with the merits of the F/A-18E/F. \nThis\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\nhas to do with a cost cap on a fixed price contract. Frankly, I was \nwilling to accept this amendment because a fixed price contract is a \nfixed price contract. Putting a cost cap on the fixed price times the \nnumber doesn't really have any impact.\n  What we are going to pay for this is already in law. What his \namendment did, which I objected to, was that it did not allow any \nincrease in money for what is called technology insertion. What does \nthat mean? Well, if we come up with a better radar system in the next \nfew years while we are procuring these F/A-18E/Fs, and if we want to \nput a new radar system in, which would cost more money, under the \nFeingold amendment we can't do that.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin talked about how we have an obligation to \nour naval aviators, to make sure they have the most competent equipment \nto be out there flying. I agree. That is why I can't support this \namendment. If we put this in, we would be denying those very aviators a \ntechnology insertion that would be important in improving the \nsurvivability of the aircraft, or their ability to locate targets, or \nwhatever the case may be.\n  This is a dangerous amendment. It threatens our naval aviators who \nare going to be flying these aircraft because we are not going to allow \nthe insertion of technology for an additional cost that may increase \nthe efficacy of that aircraft.\n  One other comment. This was in response to the comment of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin that we should not be approving this multiyear contract, \nwhich we do under this bill, without having the operational evaluation \nof testing go on, which could fail.\n  I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, if it fails, under our bill, \nthere is no multiyear contract. We spell out specifically in this \nlegislation that it has to pass OPEVAL. If it doesn't, there is no \nmultiyear.\n  We have taken care of the Senator from Wisconsin in that if there are \nproblems--and the Senator lists a variety that he believes exist--and \nif that is what is determined by the Department of Defense and the \nBureau of Testing, we will not have a multiyear contract. So the \nSenator will get his wish.\n  So I think, in the end, the Senator's amendment is superfluous at \nbest--if he would agree to the amendment I suggested--but it is \ndangerous now because it doesn't allow for technology insertion. So I \nwill move, at the appropriate time, to table the Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is pretty obvious at this point that \nany effort to question any weapons system is considered an effort to \nsomehow undercut the military strength of our country. The fact is that \nwe have a responsibility to do some oversight on our own. We should not \njust take the word of Government bureaucrats, whether they are in one \nDepartment or the other--the Defense Department or Department of \nAgriculture. We should not just take their word for it. We have some \nresponsibility to look at the questions that have been raised by \nindependent bodies such as the General Accounting Office that say there \nare real problems.\n  There has been a great effort here to distort my amendment. It takes \nthe Navy's figure of $8.8 billion and uses that for the cost cap. That \nis what it does. We have done this before on this particular airplane. \nMy amendment to do this in another phase of the program a couple of \nyears ago was accepted, and it worked just fine.\n  On the engineering and manufacturing development portion of it, it \nwas not a radical attack. This simply takes the Navy's own numbers and \nholds them to it. We all know what happens with the incredible cost \nincreases that occur with these planes.\n  Where is the role of oversight of the Senate? There is a attitude of \n``don't confuse me with the facts'' when it comes to such a \ncomplicated, expensive program. It is a $45 billion program, and we are \nwhitewashing the whole thing, even though the General Accounting \nOffice--not me, but the GAO--has identified problems on each of the \nfive pillars of the program. There was essentially no substantive \nresponse to any of the points the GAO made that I laid out. They just \nrepeated the facts of the original claims without saying one thing \nabout what has been determined about problems with survivability, and \nwith the additional space. It simply is not as good as originally \nclaimed.\n  So what we are left with is a blank check. This is the only challenge \nto any weapons system on the floor of the Senate on this entire bill. \nWhere have we come to, that we scrutinize and cut so many other areas \nof Government? I have worked hard on that and have a good record on it. \nBut why doesn't the Defense Department, and why don't these weapons \nsystems have to share in the scrutiny of everything else?\n  There are problems with this plane. My amendment doesn't terminate \nthe plane; it says we ought to hold them to a dollar amount that the \nNavy itself has identified.\n  Regarding the Senator's point, that technology improvement language \nhe thinks would help is a giant loophole that will allow anything to \nget through to add to the cost. In fact, you could fly a Super Hornet \nthrough that loophole.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to table the Feingold amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 442\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it was on December 21, 1988, over 10 \nyears ago, that Pan Am flight 103 was blown out of the sky over \nLockerbie, Scotland killing 270 people, including 189 American \ncitizens. Two Libyan intelligence agents have been indicted for \nplanting the bomb in this deliberate terrorist attack.\n  Over the past decade, I have watched with respect and admiration as \nthe victims' families have courageously pieced together their shattered \nlives. While these families have tried to move on, the agony of losing \ntheir loved ones will never disappear. Neither they nor we as a nation \nwill find closure until those responsible for the bombing are \nprosecuted and Libya rejects terrorism in word and in deed.\n  I therefore rise today to join with my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts in offering an amendment expressing the sense of Congress \nthat sanctions against Libya should not be lifted.\n  Last month, Senator Kennedy and other colleagues joined me in writing \nto Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to support her decision to \nkeep U.S. sanctions in place at the U.N. until Libya demonstrates it \nhas rejected terrorism.\n  We also called for the United States to pursue an investigation to \nidentify all those responsible for the Pan Am 103 bombing, including \nthose who ordered, organized, and financed this terrible crime. Libya \nand other terrorist nations must know that the U.S. will not allow \ncriminal acts against its citizens to go unpunished. We will use all \navailable means to ensure justice prevails.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the letter \nthat we sent to the Secretary of State printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Madeleine K. Albright,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Albright: We commend you and Ambassador \n     Burleigh for the diplomacy which has brought Abd al-Baset Ali \n     al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah to the Netherlands to \n     stand trial before a Scottish court for the bombing of Pan Am \n     flight 103.\n       The families of the victims of this heinous terrorist act \n     have waited too long--more than a decade--for the first \n     suspects to be\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\n     brought to justice. We must ensure that they are prosecuted \n     effectively. We hope the families and their representatives \n     will also have access to the trial, if possible through a \n     video link to the United States.\n       United Nations sanctions on Libya have already been \n     suspended. The United States should not consent to \n     permanently lifting the sanctions before the trial is \n     concluded to ensure continued Libyan cooperation. We agree \n     with your decision to keep U.S. sanctions in place until it \n     can be demonstrated that Libya has renounced terrorism in \n     word and in deed.\n       Our shared commitment to justice for the victims' families \n     cannot end with this trial. We would appreciate your \n     assurances that no line of inquiry has been excluded. The \n     United States must pursue the investigation to identify all \n     those responsible for ordering, financing, and organizing as \n     well as carrying out this terrible crime, wherever they may \n     be. Our national interest demands that we demonstrate that \n     terrorists who attack our citizens will be tracked down and \n     will find no quarter.\n       We stand ready to support your efforts to punish terrorists \n     as well as those who support and encourage such unlawful and \n     uncivilized conduct.\n           Sincerely,\n         Edward M. Kennedy; Barbara A. Mikulski; Daniel Patrick \n           Moynihan; Robert G. Torricelli; Charles Schumer; Dianne \n           Feinstein; Frank R. Lautenberg; Gordon Smith; Arlen \n           Specter; Sam Brownback; Paul D. Wellstone; Paul S. \n           Sarbanes.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Kennedy and I \noffer sends a message to Tripoli that the United States will do \neverything in its power to ensure continuing sanctions against Libya \nuntil it complies with international demands and renounces terrorism as \nstate policy.\n  Since the 1988 bombing, three United Nations Security Council \nresolutions--Numbers 731, 748 and 883--have demanded that Libya cease \nall support for terrorism, turn over the bombing suspects, cooperate \nwith the investigation and trial, and address the issue of appropriate \ncompensation.\n  To date, Tripoli has only fulfilled one of the four conditions--\nturning the two bombing suspects over to Scottish authorities to stand \ntrial at a specially-constituted court in the Netherlands. We have seen \nno indication that the Libyans intend to fulfill the other \nrequirements.\n  In early July, the U.N. Secretary General will report to the Security \nCouncil on Libya's compliance with the conditions set by the \ninternational community. Once he submits that report, members of the \nSecurity Council may well introduce a resolution to lift sanctions \nagainst Libya, which until now have only been suspended.\n  Mr. President, Libya must not be allowed to gain relief from \nsanctions through half-measures. This Amendment therefore calls on \nPresident Clinton to use all diplomatic means necessary, including the \nuse of the U.S. veto, to prevent sanctions from being lifted until \nTripoli fulfills all the conditions set out in the resolutions.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join us in support of this amendment, \nto speak with one voice to say that sanctions against Libya should not \nbe lifted until and unless Libya forever renounces terrorism and \nfulfills the other conditions set out in U.N. resolutions.\n  As Americans, we must take action to ensure such horrors never happen \nagain. We must punish the guilty and continue to exert pressure until \nLibya resolves to become an accepted member of the world community. \nThis amendment is one step in the right direction to make sure that \nhappens.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 3 minutes on the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Kansas has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, 189 Americans were killed in the bombing of Pan Am \n103. Their families have known no peace for more than a decade. While \nit is true that Libya has labored under mild United Nations sanctions \nfor much of that time, it is also true that the perpetrators of this \nhideous act of terrorism have lived a life of freedom with their \nfamilies.\n  For reasons best known to himself, Colonel Qadhafi has decided to \nturn over the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 bombing to a Scottish \ncourt constituted in The Hague. In return, the U.N. sanctions against \nLibya have been suspended.\n  This measure, a sense of the Congress, highlights some of the \ninadequacies of the current arrangement. For example, Libya has only \nfulfilled one of four requirements set forth in the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions. Qadhafi has yet to reassure us he will fully \ncooperate with the investigation and trial; he has yet to renounce his \nsupport for international terrorism; and he has failed to pay \ncompensation to the victims' families.\n  I have little confidence that no matter what the outcome of this \ntrial, Qadhafi will not change his stripes. He is a dictator and a \ncriminal. Indeed, the London Sunday Times of May 23, 1999, reported \nthat British intelligence has information clearly linking Qadhafi \nhimself to the bombing.\n  This amendment states the sense of Congress that the President should \nuse all means, including our veto in the Security Council, to preclude \nthe lifting of sanctions on Libya until all conditions are fulfilled. I \nwould go further. Until we know just who ordered this bombing, and \nuntil that person is duly punished, Libya must remain a pariah state, \nisolated not only by the United States but by all the decent nations of \nthe world.\n  I urge colleagues to support this amendment, and commend Senator \nKennedy for his many efforts of the Pan Am 103 victims and families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 444\n\n (Purpose: To ensure compliance with contract specifications prior to \nmulti-year contracting and entry into full-rate production under the F/\n                       A-18E/F aircraft program)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 444.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, strike lines 20 through 25, and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Limitation.--The Secretary may not exercise the \n     authority under subsection (a) to enter into a multiyear \n     contract for the procurement of F/A-18E/F aircraft or \n     authorize entry of the F/A-18E/F aircraft program into full-\n     rate production until--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Committees on \n     Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives \n     that the F/A-18E/F aircraft has successfully completed \n     initial operational test and evaluation;\n       (2) the Secretary of the Navy--\n       (A) determines that the results of operational test and \n     evaluation demonstrate that the version of the aircraft to be \n     procured under the multiyear contract in the higher quantity \n     than the other version satisfies all key performance \n     parameters in the operational requirements document for the \n     F/A-18E/F program, as submitted on April 1, 1997; and\n       (B) certifies those results of operational test and \n     evaluation; and\n       (3) the Comptroller General reviews those results of \n     operational test and evaluation and transmits to the \n     Secretary of the Navy the Comptroller General's concurrence \n     with the Secretary's certification.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have now reached concurrence among \nleadership and the managers that the three votes that were to begin at \n1:30 today will begin 20 minutes thereafter, at 1:50 a.m. in sequence \nback to back. At the conclusion of the first vote, it is the intention \nof the managers to seek a 10-minute limitation on the remaining two.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Navy would like to rely on flight \ntest data from the single seat E version of the Super Hornet to claim \nthat the aircraft procured under the Navy's F/A-18E/F program will \nperform up to specifications. Here is the problem. Fifty-six percent of \nthe planes the Navy intends to buy will be the lower performing two-\nseat F models. My amendment to address this sleight of hand is simple \nand sensible. It would require that the majority of aircraft ordered \nunder the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program meet the key \nperformance parameters in the Operational Requirements Document before \ngoing into full-rate production and before the Navy\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\nenters into a multi-year procurement contract.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues are well aware of my concerns about the \nNavy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft program. Over the past three \nyears, I've delved into the program's flaws in agonizing detail. \nEarlier, I was on the floor to offer an amendment that institutes a \ncost cap on the E/F program. At the time, I took this body through a \nwide-ranging review of facts and figures from the Pentagon's Director \nof Operational Test and Evaluation and the General Accounting Office, \non the Super Hornet's shortcomings. So I won't subject my colleagues to \nmore of the same facts showing how the Super Hornet program fails to \nimprove on the existing Hornet program more than marginally, or in a \ncost-effective manner.\n  Mr. President, I'm sure many of my colleagues wonder why I continue \non this lonesome crusade. I continue this effort pilots' lives will be \nplaced at risk in the F/A-18E/F for the next 25 to 30 years. On top of \nthat, taxpayers are being asked to pay more than $45 billion for this \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I offer simply requires the Super Hornet \nto meet existing performance specifications before going into full-rate \nproduction. It is simply a common sense measure.\n  To briefly summarize the contracting process, in 1992, the Secretary \nof the Navy and the aircraft's primary contractor, Boeing, entered into \na contract for the development, testing, and production of the Super \nHornet. Within a follow-up Operational Requirements Document, or ORD, \nwhich was signed off by the Navy in April, 1997, are a number of key \nperformance parameters. Essentially, Mr. President, the contract states \nexplicitly what the Navy wants the plane to be able to do.\n  Mr. President, the Navy wanted, and I assume still wants, a plane \nwith increased range, increased payload, greater bringback capability, \nimproved survivability, and increased growth space over the existing F/\nA-18C Hornet aircraft. The Navy calls these improvements the pillars of \nthe Super Hornet program.\n  As I stated earlier, premier among the Navy's justifications for the \npurchase of the Super Hornet is that it fly significantly farther than \nthe Hornet. As recently as this past January, the Navy claimed the E/F \nwould be able to fly up to 50 percent farther than the Hornet.\n  Mr. President, again, these improvements have yet to be proven in \nreality. And in the realm of reality, initial Super Hornet range \npredictions have declined as actual flight data has been gathered and \nincorporated into further prediction models. If the anticipated, but \nyet to be demonstrated range improvements are not included in the \nestimates, the Super Hornet range in the interdiction role amounts to a \nmere 8 percent improvement over the Hornet. According to GAO, this is \nnot a significant improvement.\n  Mr. President, not only does the Super Hornet fall short in its \nrange, but also in its payload capacity, and growth space improvements. \nOn top of that, the Super Hornet is worse than the Hornet is turning, \nacceleration, and ability to climb. Again, this plane will cost far \nmore, perhaps twice as much as the current model.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the General Accounting Office testified \nrecently before Congress that the Super Hornet is not meeting all of \nits performance requirements, is behind schedule, and above cost, \nregardless of Navy boasts to the contrary. The agency offered evidence \nof shortcomings in each and every area of the Navy declared as \njustifications for the aircraft. GAO also states that some of the \nNavy's assumed improvements to the aircraft have yet to be \ndemonstrated.\n  Mr. President, the Navy's statements on performance reflect the \nsingle-seat E model of the aircraft, not the less-capable two-seat F \nmodel. This is troubling because the model of the aircraft, not the \nless-capable two seat F model. This is troubling because the F model \ncomprises 56 percent of the Pentagon's purchasing plan for the Super \nHornet. Again, Mr. President, the Navy's statements on performing are \nbased on projections, not actual performance.\n  According to GAO, which has been reviewing the program for more than \nthree years, the aircraft continues to offer only marginal improvements \nover the Hornet, the same finding GAO made in 1996. After three years \nof development and testing, Mr. President, we still stand to gain only \nmarginal improvements that don't outweight the cost.\n  Again, Mr. President, I have stood on the floor of the United States \nfor three years now discussing the inadequacies of the Super Hornet \nprogram. And for three years, a majority of my colleagues have turned a \ndeaf ear to the facts. I hold out hope that this body will use some \nmeasure of common sense in procuring this aircraft.\n  Mr. President, this amendment merely enforces what should be \nblatantly obvious. Before moving to full-rate production, or entering \ninto a multi-year procurement contract, of the Super Hornet, the \ncontract between the Navy and its contractor should be enforced. The \nNavy signed a contract to receive a plane that can do certain things. I \nagree with the Navy.\n  The plane ought to do certain things. We shouldn't go forward until \nwe know that it really does those things.\n  This amendment simply requires that the Navy receive the plane it \nexpects.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays, I reserve the remainder \nof my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say this with great amusement. When I \npropounded the unanimous consent request for an 11:50 vote, it was \ninterpreted as a little too folksy for the Parliamentarian, so I now in \na very stern voice ask unanimous consent that the votes begin at 11:50.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask for a point of clarification. Does that include \nthe following two votes would be 10-minute votes?\n  Mr. WARNER. I intend to ask they be 10 minutes, but traditionally we \ndon't do it until we determine the whereabouts of all Members.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. In that event, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does this include any time between the votes? Could there \nbe 2 minutes between the votes on the first and second and second and \nthird amendments--2 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. WARNER. Is it desired?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is desired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  In response to the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin, it is an \nadditional hurdle to begin production of the E and F. This says that we \ncannot move forward with production, full-scale production, of this \naircraft without a successful operational test and evaluation. That \nwill be done by operational test pilots, maintenance people, experts in \nevaluating aircraft. They do the testing. They will do the report. The \ncommander of operational test forces will issue the report, determine \nwhether there was a successful test, and then that report will be given \nto the director of operational test and evaluation, who, under normal \ncircumstances, will then make the decision that a successful test has \nbeen conducted.\n  So all of that will have to be done. After that, again, according to \nnormal procurement, he would send that recommendation on to the Defense \nAcquisition Board, which would review all of the tests to determine \nwhether it was successful and make the decision to go ahead and procure \nthe aircraft.\n  Under our bill, we put in an additional step. We say that after the \ndirector of operational test and evaluation reviews the report, they \nhave to then get a certification from the Secretary of Defense that \nthis program has successfully completed operational test and \nevaluation. We have put an additional step in that is outside the \ncourse of the normal procurement area before the decision for \nacquisition is made. So we have already put in one additional step.\n  What the Senator from Wisconsin wants to do is put an additional step \nin. This is somewhat dangerous in this\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\nrespect: He includes no time limit. GAO can take 2 years if they want \nto. They can take whatever amount of time they want, hold up a $2.8 \nbillion contract, hold up what is a needed requirement for the Navy to \ndetermine when a bunch of people with ``green eye shades,'' as the \nSenator from Missouri said--to make the determination as to whether \nauditors believe that the test pilots and the maintenance people and \nthe Secretary of Defense and the director of operational test and \nevaluation, the defense acquisition board, they were all wrong--all the \nexperts were wrong, and congressional auditors are really the best \ndeterminant as to whether this aircraft meets its requirements, is \nneeded, and should be procured.\n  I don't think we want to do that. I think that sets a very dangerous \nprecedent. Frankly, it raises some constitutional questions as to \nwhether the Congress can, in fact, do that.\n  I can say to the Senator from Wisconsin, the junior Senator from \nMissouri had me out to St. Louis. I went through and reviewed \nextensively, spending the better part of a day at the facility in St. \nLouis. This is a program of which I think everyone will be proud. They \nare using state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques. They are, as the \nSenators have said, ahead of schedule, meeting every single benchmark. \nThey have 4,000 hours of flight time, more than any other aircraft that \nhas been tested in history.\n  I think this is an additional hurdle that is unnecessary and \npotentially dangerous. That is why I will at the appropriate time move \nto table the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin controls 9 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself the time required at this point.\n  Let me say exactly what this amendment does rather than rely on the \ncharacterization that was given. This appears to be something of a \nsleight-of-hand with regard to proving that this plane actually meets \nthe performance parameters it is supposed to meet.\n  There are two versions of the Super Hornet aircraft, a one-seat E \nmodel and another that has been proven to be less capable, a two-seat F \nmodel. The Navy now states that 56 percent of the Super Hornet will be \nF models, but they are trying to rely on the performance of the E model \nto determine compliance with performance parameters.\n  The amendment simply requires that the version of the Super Hornet \naircraft that represents the majority--the majority--of the Navy's \npurchasing plan has to satisfy all the key performance parameters in \nthe program Operational Requirements Documents. That is what this \namendment does.\n  For this to be characterized as an additional hurdle, as has been \ndone by the Senator from Pennsylvania, is simply not accurate. It \nsimply says that the flight test data used by the Navy, represent the \nversion of the plane they intend to purchase. All we are trying to do \nis to be sure that the information we are getting and that the \nassumptions are based on the planes that are actually being purchased \nand that they actually do what they said they would do.\n  That is not an additional step. That is just somebody buying \nsomething, making sure they are actually getting what they contracted \nfor. Shouldn't we, as the guardians of the taxpayers' dollars, be sure \nwe are getting what we contracted for? How can that be an additional \nhurdle, unless we want to allow the contractor to give us something we \ndidn't want and, in fact, paid a fortune for?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania reasonably asked whether or not there \nis a problem with the GAO having a limited time to make their \ncertification. I am happy to enter into an agreement for a time limit \nfor the GAO, with the Senator's indication that he would regard that as \na reasonable change. That is not a problem that was intended, and we \ncan solve that quite simply.\n  This is an incredibly expensive program. Hopefully, this plane, if it \ngoes through, will work as well as has been advertised. Hopefully, it \nwill not cause problems for our pilots, although there are those who \nare concerned about that.\n  All this amendment does is say that when we make the decision to move \nto the next phase, it is actually based on the plane we are buying. Any \nhousehold in America would use that much caution when buying something. \nWe talked a lot as we brought down the deficit, on a bipartisan basis, \nabout doing things like American families have to do. Don't we have a \nresponsibility to make sure we are getting the plane we are paying for? \nWe are not paying for it, the taxpayers are paying for it, and they \nwill pay $45 billion for it. It ought to be the plane that we are \nsupposed to get.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask that they yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote against both of these \namendments, although they are well intended.\n  The first amendment has the problem that it would not accommodate \nchanges in specifications in order to allow new technologies to be \ninserted which cost more than the specified technology in the cost cap.\n  That may be a lot of verbiage, but it is important. I have been very \nactive in cost caps. I proposed a cost cap, for instance, for the new \nCVN-77. I supported the cost cap that we previously wrote in to the F-\n22, and supported it very strongly. But, in both of those instances, \nthe cost caps allowed for the new technology possibility. If new \ntechnologies come along which are not in the specifications, we should \nwant them to be considered. We should not make it difficult or \nimpossible for new technologies to be considered. We should want them, \nif that would make the plane more effective, providing the Secretary \ncertifies to us--or notifies us, more accurately--that there is a \nchange. That is not a loophole. That is something which is desirable, \nit seems to me. I emphasize the cost cap--for instance in the CVN-77, \nwhich I wrote--contained the exception that if there is a new \ntechnology which the Secretary of the Navy certifies to us is \ndesirable, that then would be an exception to the cost cap.\n  On the current amendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield 1 more minute?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield an additional minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the pending amendment, again I think this is a well-\nintended amendment. I think up until the last paragraph it is on \ntarget. We do want the Secretary of the Navy to determine the results \nof operational test and evaluation and to certify that the version of \nthe aircraft to be procured under the multiyear satisfies all key \nperformance parameters. I think that is very good.\n  The problem is it then gives to the Comptroller General, who is in \nthe legislative branch, the veto power because the Comptroller General \nmust concur with the Secretary's----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's minute has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield an additional 30 seconds?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Comptroller General must concur with the Secretary's \ncertification. I believe that is a clear violation of the separation of \npowers. In Bowsher v. Synar, the Supreme Court ruled:\n\n       To permit the execution of the laws to be vested in an \n     officer answerable only to Congress would, in practical \n     terms, reserve in Congress control over the execution of the \n     laws.\n\n  So, except for that part requiring a legislative concurrence or \nlegislative officer's concurrence with the Secretary's certification, I \nthink that amendment would have been acceptable. With that additional \nprovision, I think it is unacceptable as it violates separation of \npowers and the Supreme Court ruling in the Bowsher case.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields time to the \nSenator from Missouri?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator from Missouri 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the F-18 is underbudget and early. The \nDepartment of Defense is making very, very careful evaluations, and \nwill continue to do so. This contracting will not go forward without \ntheir professional critical evaluation that the plane succeeded.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin says these two different planes in the F-\n18 package, the single-seater and the two-seater, must meet the same \nflight characteristics. That does not make sense. When you put an extra \nseat in an airplane it changes the characteristics, but it also changes \nthe fighting capacity of the airplane. You can do with two pilots--or \none plus a person operating radar or other things in a hostile \nenvironment in terms of locating targets--what you can't do with one \nperson both flying the airplane and doing that.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin asks about oversight. Frankly, we have had \nsubstantial oversight here. We have had oversight in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, oversight in the House Armed Services Committee, \noversight in the Senate Appropriations Committee. There will be, again, \nevaluation in the House Appropriations Committee.\n  This is a circumstance where, obviously, there has been substantial \noversight. The members of the committee and committee chairman are \nsaying we should approve this. I believe we should. For us to say the \nDepartment of Defense, the fighter-fliers, those whose lives depend on \nthis airplane performing, are to have their judgment about the airplane \nset aside or deferred or delayed until accountants or auditors from the \nGeneral Accounting Office make a decision on this plane is unwise. It \nis not only unwise, it has been clearly demonstrated, I think, in the \narguments that it is unconstitutional as well.\n  The F-18 is an outstanding aircraft with characteristics that will \nserve well--extended range, extended load-carrying capacity, and \nability in the two-seat configuration to do things not available in the \none-seat configuration. It is a well-made airplane that will serve our \ninterests well by serving well those who fly them. It will serve us \nwell by allowing those conflicts to be survivable. The margin of \nimprovement provides the margin of difference that means we win instead \nof lose.\n  It is time for us to move forward with this program; stop unnecessary \nattacks on it. This is an airplane that will serve us well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes and 23 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first with regard to the second \namendment, the one before us now having to do with the question of \nperformance parameters, there have been some concerns raised by the \nSenators from Virginia and Michigan about reference to the role of the \nGAO in this amendment.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that portion of the amendment be \ndeleted to address their concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have to determine from other Senators----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am sorry, I can't hear the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am simply trying to protect other Senators. At the \nmoment, there is an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will provide the Senate with a copy of \nthe amendment as I would modify it and simply delete the section \nrelating to the Comptroller General.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand the objection, it is perhaps a temporary \none. Is that the understanding of the Senator from Wisconsin? My \nunderstanding of what the Senator from Virginia said is that in order \nto protect the rights of other Senators, he would object at this time. \nBut I suggest at least the possibility that the Senator renew his \nunanimous-consent request and perhaps there will be no objection, after \nthere has been an opportunity for people to read the modification.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Michigan advise me of the \nappropriate time to raise that unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. LEVIN. They are checking it out now.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I reserve a few \nmoments of my time because the response to this will affect my \nargument. The only real objection to this is primarily to the role of \nthe GAO in this process. The only other objection was raised by the \nSenator from Missouri who made much of the fact that of course there is \na difference between the E and F plane.\n  The problem is that originally the Navy and the contractor sold this \nplane on the assumption that only 18 percent of the planes would be the \n``F'' version. The reality now is that 56 percent of the planes are \ngoing to be the lower-performing ``F'' version. That is why it is \nessential that we have this certification, at least by the Navy, that \nin fact a majority of the planes will meet the performance parameters.\n  So I am very interested to see if the Senators here who have raised \nthis concern will allow me to meet their concerns so we can pass this \ncommonsense amendment which, as the Senator from Michigan indicated, \nwithout that flaw would be a worthwhile amendment.\n  With regard to the other amendment, the cost containment amendment, \nlet me just make a couple of points in response to the Senator from \nMichigan. I do want to say he has been a tremendous advocate for \nappropriate cost containment and careful evaluation of military \nprograms throughout his career.\n  First of all, regarding our cap that we propose, which of course is a \nfigure the Navy proposed in the first place, that $8.8 billion is only \nfor over a 4-year period. It is not a permanent cap. Second, if there \nis a need for new technologies, as has been posited by the Senator from \nMichigan, if something comes up that absolutely has to be done--we are \nhere. We are not going anywhere. If something dramatic happens that \nrequires additional technology, we are in a position to respond to \nthat. In fact, the amendment I have proposed allows a number of \nflexibilities. It is not an absolute $8.8 billion cap.\n  It allows cost increases and decreases for inflation. It allows \nchanges for compliance in Federal, State, and local law, and it also \ncontemplates the possibility of quantity changes in the number of \nplanes within the scope of the multiyear contract, which we all know \ncan dramatically affect the cost of a plane.\n  There is substantial flexibility built into this amendment, and if \nthere is a need for the new technology, we are here and able to respond \nto that. Otherwise, all we are doing, as I indicated earlier, by \nincluding this language for new technology, we are essentially gutting \nour own amendment. We are removing the cost cap provision in our \namendment.\n  How many people would do that? If you are buying a car, if a car \nmanufacturer says: Well, we reserve the right, if we come up with a new \nthing to put on this car, to charge you a couple more thousand bucks \nafter we cut the contract, after we cut the deal. I do not think we \nshould be doing business that way. We have built flexibility into this \namendment.\n  Again, I indicate that all this is is the Navy's own figure of $8.8 \nbillion. We did a similar cost cap on the same plane previously.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Who yields time? The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am hopeful this matter can be resolved \nin a matter of minutes. In the interim, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Eden Murrie in \nSenator Lieberman's office and Dana Krupa in Senator Bingaman's office \nbe granted the privilege of the floor for the remainder of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to myself for a \nstatement unrelated to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time remaining is 25 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield to the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on the second Feingold amendment, we are \nattempting to work some accommodation so we can accept the amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays which were ordered on the \nsecond Feingold amendment be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I assume it is the \nintent of the Senator that if we do not work it out, there will be no \nproblem getting a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's give the number of that amendment so there is \nabsolute clarity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. 444 is the second Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are still on track to start our series \nof two votes now at approximately 11:50. To keep Senators advised, the \nranking member and I are rapidly clearing amendments. I know of only a \nfew remaining amendments that will require rollcall votes. I am anxious \nto complete the bill, as are all Senators. I see now that possibility \ntaking place perhaps early to mid-afternoon. We will be addressing the \nSenate on that after the two votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the two votes have \nbeen ordered at 11:50 with 2 minutes evenly divided before each vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we waived the 2 minutes before the first vote and \nwe will proceed to the vote.\n  Are the yeas and nays ordered on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nfirst vote as well as the second vote.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The 2-minute request was between the first and the second \nvote, not before the first vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is clear now.\n  We are proceeding to the vote for the full period of time.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next vote \nbe 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 443\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided on the Feingold amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is a straightforward, \ncommonsense measure that establishes accountability in the Super Hornet \nprogram. It holds the Navy to the $8.8 billion over the next 5 years to \nprocure the Super Hornet. My amendment simply sets a cost cap at that \nlevel and holds them to that amount.\n  Again, this amendment holds the Navy to the $8.8 billion, its own \nfigure. It doesn't terminate the funding, it doesn't hold the money up, \nit doesn't even restrict the use of the money, it just holds them to \nthe amount they say they need. I hope the body will use common sense in \nprocuring this aircraft.\n  The amendment does nothing more than set a cost cap using the exact \ndollar amount put forward by the Navy; nothing more, nothing less. We \nowe it to our naval aviators and to the taxpayers to make sure we \nprovide a modernized plane that does what it is supposed to do within \nthe parameters the Navy has set forth itself.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the F/A-18E/F is a fixed-price contract. \nIt is a fixed-price contract for the extent of the contract. What the \nSenator from Wisconsin does is put a price cap on a fixed-price \ncontract. Fine. I am willing to accept that. But what he did not \ninclude in his amendment was a provision for technology insertion. In \nother words, if we come up with a new radar system that can improve the \nquality of the aircraft, under his amendment we could not buy that \nimprovement and put it on the aircraft. I was willing to accept his \namendment, if he would allow for that technical improvement insertion \nprovision. But he refused to do so.\n\n  So, unfortunately, while I think the amendment is somewhat \nmeaningless because it is a fixed price contract, I have to oppose the \namendment, and would ask, for the sake of our naval aviators to make \nsure they have the best equipment to fly, that my colleagues join in \nsupporting the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 443. On this question the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSpecter) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 87, nays 11, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 153 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--87\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\n\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--11\n\n     Boxer\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Moynihan\n     Reid\n     Schumer\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Lautenberg\n     Specter\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, with respect to amendment No. 394, I ask a \nmodification to the amendment be accepted. I send the modification to \nthe desk.\n  (The text of the amendment (No. 394), as modified, is printed in \ntoday's Record under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Section 1061(a) of the amendment would require the \nPresident to promptly notify Congress whenever an ``investigation'' is \nundertaken. The term ``investigation'' is not defined in the amendment.\n  I am concerned that some could interpret this to require the \nPresident to report to Congress every time the executive branch \nreceives an allegation, even before the Justice Department or others \nhave an opportunity to determine whether the allegations are based in \nfact. Such an interpretation could lead to the disclosure of a flood of \nunsubstantiated allegations to Congress, with a resulting injustice to \ninnocent individuals who may be the subject of such allegations.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his comments and I appreciate his \nconcerns. I am pleased to agree to work closely with the Senator from \nMichigan during the conference on this bill, and to solicit the views \nof the administration, on how this provision will be implemented and in \nan effort to address his concerns.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 394), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on that amendment I ask Senator Baucus be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with regard to the remaining business, I \nam hopeful the leadership clears a unanimous consent request, agreed \nupon between Mr. Levin and myself. It is in the process now. It will \ngive clarity to the balance of the day.\n  At the moment, there are two Senators who have been waiting for 3 \ndays. I want to accommodate them. The Senator from Mississippi, Mr. \nCochran, would like to lay down an amendment and speak to it for 10 \nminutes. The amendment is not cleared, so I reserve 10 minutes for the \nopposition to that amendment prior to any vote that is required.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 444\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending amendment. The Chair tells \nthe distinguished Senator the pending amendment at the desk is No. 444 \nby the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My understanding is the various Senators have \nnegotiated agreement on this, and it is acceptable on both sides. As \nmodified, the Senate is prepared to accept it.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 444, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send the modification to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The amendment (No. 444), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, strike lines 20 through 25, and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Limitation.--The Secretary may not exercise the \n     authority under subsection (a) to enter into a multiyear \n     contract for the procurement of F/A-18E/F aircraft or \n     authorize entry of the F/A-18E/F aircraft program into full-\n     rate production until--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Committees on \n     Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives the \n     results of operational test and evaluation of the F/A-18E/F \n     aircraft.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense--\n       (A) determines that the results of operational test and \n     evaluation demonstrate that the version of the aircraft to be \n     procured under the multiyear contract in the higher quantity \n     than the other version satisfies all key performance \n     parameters appropriate to that versIon of aircraft in the \n     operational requirements document for the F/A-18E/F program, \n     as submitted on April 1, 1997, except that with respect to \n     the range performance parameter a deviation of 1 percent \n     shall be permitted.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified \nand agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 444), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, it is the request of the manager that Mr. Cochran be \nrecognized for not to exceed 10 minutes to lay down an amendment. If \nthat amendment cannot be agreed upon by a voice vote, we would just lay \nit aside with the understanding there is 10 minutes for opposition at \nsome point in the afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Florida has waited very patiently for \nabout 2 or 3 days. He has an amendment which is to be laid down \nfollowing the Cochran amendment. I ask there be a period of 30 minutes, \n15 minutes under the control of the Senator from Florida, 15 minutes \nunder the joint control of Senators Shelby and Robert Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. I guess that is the end of the ability to move things. We \njust have to put that request in abeyance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TRANSFER OF NAVAL VESSEL TO FOREIGN COUNTRY.\n\n       (a) Thailand.--The Secretary of the Navy is authorized to \n     transfer to the Government of Thailand the CYCLONE class \n     coastal patrol craft CYCLONE (PC1) or a craft with a similar \n     hull. The transfer shall be made on a grant basis under \n     section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2321j).\n       (b) Costs.--Any expense incurred by the United States in \n     connection with the transfer authorized under subsection (a) \n     shall be charged to the Government of Thailand.\n       (c) Repair and Refurbishment in United States Shipyards.--\n     To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary of the Navy \n     shall require, as a condition of the transfer of the vessel \n     to the Government of Thailand under this section, that the \n     Government of Thailand have such repair or refurbishment of \n     the vessel as is needed, before the vessel\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\n     joins the naval forces of that country, performed at a United \n     States Naval shipyard or other shipyard located in the United \n     States.\n       (d) Expiration of Authority.--The authority to transfer a \n     vessel under subsection (a) shall expire at the end of the \n     two-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, this \namendment would authorize the transfer of a naval vessel to Thailand \nand would authorize the Secretary of the Navy to receive in exchange a \nship that is now in the fleet of Thailand. The purpose of the amendment \nis to provide authority to the Secretary of the Navy to give a retiring \nU.S. Navy Cyclone class ship to the Government of Thailand in exchange \nfor a former U.S. Navy ship which served in World War II in the \nPacific. That ship is the LCS 102, LCS stands for landing craft \nsupport. It is presently in the service of the Royal Navy of Thailand.\n  For some history on this subject, 3 years ago in Public Law 104-201, \nthe Congress went on record in favor of trying to bring back to the \nUnited States the LCS 102. It is the last surviving ship of its class. \nThis ship saw heavy combat action in the western Pacific during World \nWar II. It was transferred after the war to Japan and then later was \ntransferred to Thailand where she has been in service for 30 years. \nThis ship is of great historical significance. It is the last one of \nits kind in existence in the world. Just a few years ago, it was \nentered on the Register of the World Ship Trust.\n  Many sailors from World War II might not recognize this class of \nship, because it was one of many different types of amphibious ships \nused in the Pacific during World War II. But it was highly appreciated \nby the Navy admirals and the Marines because it was a heavily armed \ngunboat which gave close-in fire support to the Marines in amphibious \nlandings. In fact, the LCS ships had more firepower per ton than an \nIowa class battleship.\n  These ships were in the thick of it in Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the \nPhilippines, and New Guinea. They also served in an anti-aircraft role \nagainst kamikaze aircraft at Okinawa and Iwo Jima, because of their \ntremendous firepower.\n  Mr. President, 26 of the 130 LCSs that were built were sunk, or badly \ndamaged in the first 6 months of their duty in the Pacific. Historians \nhave begun to write about these ships and the role they played in the \nsuccessful war in the Pacific. There is one illustrative title, \n``Mighty Midgets At War: The Saga of the LCS(L) Ships from Iwo Jima to \nVietnam,'' by Robert L. Reilly.\n  Our distinguished former colleague, who was chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, John Tower of Texas, served aboard the LCS 112. He \nwas chief bosun's mate during World War II on that ship. Also, former \nSecretary of the Navy William Middendorf served as an officer abroad \nLCS 53 and former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman's father served as \ncommanding officer of LCS 18 in the Pacific. He received the Bronze \nStar for bravery during his service at Okinawa.\n  In addition, the commanding officer of LCS 122, then lieutenant, \nRichard M. McCool, who now resides in Bainbridge Island in the State of \nWashington, received the Congressional Medal of Honor from President \nTruman for his service during a kamikaze attack at Okinawa.\n  There are several former LCS sailors from my State who have written \nme in support of this transfer: Robert Wells of Ocean Springs, MS, \nrecently wrote me a letter saying he was the only medical officer \nabroad LCS 31. Here is what else he said in his letter:\n\n       . . . The LCS-31, along with approximately 20 other LCSs, \n     invaded Iwo Jima in February, 1945, assisting the Marines in \n     landing.\n\n       From there, the LCS 31 went to Okinawa and fought suicide \n     planes on radar picket duty where the #31 shot down 6 suicide \n     planes and was hit by 3, killing 9 sailors and wounding 15. \n     The 31 received the Presidential Unit Citation for their \n     efforts. Please help in returning the LCS 102 to the United \n     States and receiving the recognition that the LCSs deserve.\n\n  Mr. President, these ships were a part of the U.S. Navy that fought \nand won the war in the Pacific. The LCS 102 is the last remaining ship \nof its class, and I believe it would be appropriate for it to come home \nand serve as a floating museum and a monument to the brave service of \ntens of thousands of sailors who served on these ships with the \nnickname ``Mighty Midgets.''\n  Since the Congress adopted an amendment 3 years ago urging the \nSecretary of Defense to bring home the LCS 102, the Navy has determined \nthat the Thai Navy will give up the LCS from its fleet for a return to \nthe United States, but they need a replacement ship to fulfill the \nshallow water mission now accomplished by the LCS 102.\n  This year, the Navy is retiring a small, fast gunboat from our fleet \nthat would meet the Thai Navy's requirement. The ship is a Cyclone \nclass ship. It could be made available to the Thai Navy in exchange for \nthe LCS 102. This amendment authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to \noffer a Cyclone class ship to the Thai Navy. It does not mandate that \nthe trade be consummated; it simply authorizes the trade if it can be \nnegotiated and legal hurdles and other details can be worked out.\n  There is an urgency to this issue because World War II veterans are \naging. Most of them are now in their seventies and eighties. If we are \ngoing to help the LCS association realize its dream and ambition of \nbringing home the last ship of its class, then we need to do it now. \nThere are LCS sailors living today all over the country in almost all \n50 States, and they would appreciate a vote in support of this \namendment.\n  Funds will be raised from the private sector to put this ship in \ncondition to serve as a museum, and there are still many details to be \nworked out before the LCS can be brought home. But by approving this \namendment, which is necessary as a first step, the Senate will go on \nrecord in support, as we did 3 years ago when we suggested this should \nbe done by the Navy.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment and join the Chief of \nNaval Operations, Jay Johnson, who has written me a letter in support \nof this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Chief of Naval Operations,\n\n                                                     May 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: I wanted to offer my thanks and \n     support for your proposed amendment to help return the last \n     ex-LCS 102 from Thailand to the United States. This ship \n     would make an excellent public memorial in honor of those who \n     served in ships like her during WWII. Further, it would \n     provide an additional monument for generations to come of the \n     sacrifices of this special generation.\n       My staff stands ready to brief yours on the details \n     involved in making the transfer of a retiring Cyclone-class \n     Patrol Craft (PC) come about. Thank you again for your \n     support. If I may be of further assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jay L. Johnson,\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, I want \nto read just one sentence from this letter:\n\n       This ship would make an excellent public memorial in honor \n     of those who served in ships like her during World War II.\n                                                 Adm. Jay Johnson,\n                                        Chief of Naval Operations.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield if I have any time.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has made very clear this is not a mandate; is \nthat right?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is right. It is authorizing legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Also, on page 2 of the Senator's amendment, it says ``on a \ngrant basis.'' Is it clear that it could also be done on a sale basis, \nlease basis or a lease with an option to buy basis?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We want to swap it. We want to swap the Cyclone for the \nLCS 102. It authorizes the trade.\n  Mr. REID. It says, ``the transfer shall be made on a grant basis.''\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is a legal word of art. I have explained the \nmeaning of it. If we had been able to get the committee to adopt the \namendment as we had hoped they would, there would be report language in \nthe committee report. I will be happy to give the Senator a copy of \nthat which further explains. If he will let me, I will read it:\n\n       The committee recommends that the Secretary of the Navy be \n     authorized to transfer to the Government of Thailand one \n     Cyclone class patrol vessel for the purpose of supporting \n     Thailand's counterdrug and\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\n     counterpiracy operations. The committee intends this transfer \n     to replace the former LCS 102 currently in service with the \n     Royal Thai Navy, should the discussions urged in section 1025 \n     of PL 104-201 result in the Government of Thailand's decision \n     to return LCS 102 to the Government of the United States. The \n     committee understands that the Secretary of the Navy supports \n     the return of LCS 102 to the United States for public display \n     as a naval museum.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. This is just to give the Secretary more options--sale, \nlease, lease option. It will give more discretion to the Secretary \nrather than saying the transfer shall be made by grant. There are other \nways it can be done. I think it would be in the best interest of all \nconcerned if these other options are available. I repeat: sale, lease, \nlease with an option to buy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be happy to consider that, and I appreciate the \nSenator raising it as an alternative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me clarify, Mr. President, there still remains some \ntime in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi; am \nI correct in that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes that Senators said there \nwould be 10 minutes allotted to the opposition of the Senator's \namendment. It was not stated in the form of a request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think some time should be reserved. I \nindicate for the Record, I support the Senator from Mississippi, but I \nam sure time should be reserved on this side, 10 minutes, and then we \nwill determine whether or not a recorded vote is necessary in this \nmatter, or it may be voice voted. I put that in the form of a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to support the \namendment of the Senator from Mississippi. This amendment deserves the \nsupport of every Senator because it is the right thing to do.\n  During World War II more than 10,000 Americans served their country \non LCS ships, and these ships were heavily involved in combat in the \nPacific. There is only one LCS left in the world, and a group of World \nWar II sailors wants to bring that ship back to the United States and \nmake it a floating museum.\n  Three years ago, I sponsored an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill urging the Secretary of Defense to seek the \nexpeditious return of the LCS 102 from Thailand. That amendment passed \nthe Congress and became part of Public Law 104-201.\n  For three years not much has happened because the Thai Navy still \nneeded the LCS 102, even though it is now more than 55 years old. Thai \nofficials have indicated that they would be prepared to return the LCS \n102 to the United States if we could provide a suitable ship to take \nits place. The U.S. Navy is planning to retire just such a ship this \nyear, and that is what this amendment is about.\n  The ranks of those World War II sailors is thinning each year, and \nthere is a need to move expeditiously. We need to bring this historic \nship home before all of our World War II veterans are gone.\n  Let me list briefly some facts about LCS ships and their service to \nour country.\n  These ships were born out of desperate need. In the early years of \nWorld War II, our Navy and Marine Corps discovered that they needed \nmore close-in gunfire support to protect our troops as they went ashore \nin amphibious landings. With typical American ingenuity, a new small \ngunboat was designed and quickly moved into production. The result was \nthe LCS(L) which stood for Landing Craft Support Ship (Large).\n  This newly designed ship had more firepower per ton than a \nbattleship, and it was capable of going all the way in to the beach and \nproviding close-in fire support for our troops going ashore.\n  One hundred and thirty of these ships were built and rushed into \nservice in 1944 and 1945. These ships and their brave crews helped save \nthe lives of countless soldiers and Marines by providing heavy close-in \nfirepower to support amphibious landings at Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and many \nother Pacific Islands. Twenty-six of these ships were sunk or badly \ndamaged in the Pacific campaign.\n  These ships were nicknamed the ``Mighty Midgets'' because of their \nfirepower and their service in World War II. These ships, like so many \nothers, received little notice when the history books were written \nbecause Carriers, Battleships, and Cruisers took most of the glory. \nHowever, the sailors aboard LCSs served bravely and well, and their \npart of World War II needs to be preserved as a part of our Navy's \nhistory.\n  LCS sailors received many decorations for their service during World \nWar II. A young Lieutenant by the name of Richard McCool from \nWashington State received the Congressional Medal of Honor from \nPresident Truman for his service at Okinawa. A young Lieutenant by the \nname of John F. Lehman received a bronze star for his service at \nOkinawa, as well. His son, John, Jr. served as a naval officer many \nyears later and became Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan.\n  Since the mid-1990s, several books have been published covering the \nhistory of the LCS ships. Former Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, \nJr. wrote the foreword to one of those books. This foreword provides \neloquent summary of the service to our Nation provided by LCSs and \ntheir brave sailors.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a distinguished former Senator who served as \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee in this body served ably as a \nBoatswain's Mate on an LCS during World War II. John Tower served his \nnation in World War II on an LCS.\n  This body needs to honor his service and that of all the LCS sailors \nby helping to save the LCS 102--the only one left in the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to do what they \ncan to help in the task of bringing this ship home to the United States \nto serve as a museum and a memorial to the valiant service of thousands \nof LCS sailors.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest, which is agreed upon on the other side, with regard to a \nprocedural matter. As soon as that is concluded, then I want to state a \nUC request on behalf of my two colleagues, Mr. Domenici and Mr. Kyl, on \nthis side. I think we can work it out.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I also am a sponsor of this legislation \nand would like to be recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, with regard to the balance of the afternoon: I ask \nunanimous consent that all remaining first-degree amendments be offered \nby 2:30 p.m. today, and at 2:10 p.m., Senator Levin be recognized to \noffer and lay aside amendments for Members on his side of the aisle, \nand at 2:20 p.m., the chairman of the committee be recognized to offer \nand lay aside amendments for Members on his side of the aisle, and that \nthose amendments be subject to relevant second-degree amendments. I \nfurther ask that all first-degree amendments must be relevant to the \ntext of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, all first-\ndegree amendments must be relevant and offered by 2:30 p.m. today. It \nis the intention of the managers and leaders to complete action on this \nbill, hopefully, no later than 5 o'clock today.\n  We have had a number of Senators patiently waiting. The Senator from \nFlorida is willing to accommodate the chairman in his request that a \nperiod of 30 minutes, under the control of the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from New Mexico, be allocated for an amendment which they \nwill lay down within that period of time, and at the conclusion of the \n30-minute period, that amendment will be laid aside for the purpose of \nan amendment to be laid down by the Senator from Florida, which \namendment will require 30 minutes of debate, 15 minutes under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Florida, 15 minutes under the control of \nthe Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, and that 15 minutes will be \nshared between\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\nMr. Shelby and Mr. Kerrey, the ranking member of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I propose that to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. That being in order, we will now proceed with the 30 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The distinguished Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Under the agreement just announced by Senator Warner, it would be the \nintention of Senator Domenici and Senator Murkowski and myself to \ndivide the next half-hour into roughly 10 minute segments. I would \nappreciate an indication from the Chair when we have achieved those \nthree milestones, if the Chair would, please.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 446\n\n  Mr. KYL. At this time I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, Senator Shelby, Senator \nHutchinson, and Senator Helms.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the manager of the bill, the chairman of the \ncommittee, there has been no unanimous consent agreement regarding the \nDomenici amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is that the Senator from Virginia \npropounded a UC to give the three Senators Senator Kyl just designated \n30 minutes in which to lay down an amendment, and at the end of the 30 \nminutes the amendment be laid aside. There is no restriction whatsoever \non the remainder of the time with respect to further consideration of \nthe amendment, I say to my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. \n     Helms, proposes an amendment numbered 446.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike Section 3158 and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 3158(A).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly describe the purpose of this amendment. \nI will acknowledge right up front that Senator Domenici, from New \nMexico, has been a primary motivating factor in addressing this \nsubject, based upon his expertise with our National Laboratories and \nhis concerns about national security. A lot of folks sat down to try to \ndetermine what the best course of action would be for us to begin to \ntake steps to ensure the security of our National Laboratories. \nCertainly, Senator Domenici is the person one would first turn to for \nthat kind of consideration.\n  Next, Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the Energy Committee, is \nsomeone who has jurisdiction and who has held hearings and who has a \ngreat deal to offer with respect to the organization of the Department \nof Energy, in particular the weapons programs, so we can ensure that we \nhave security over those programs.\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\n  Naturally, Senator Shelby, the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, has also had his input into this amendment, as have others.\n  It will be important that each of these key chairmen has an \nopportunity to discuss this bill. But I especially thank Senator \nDomenici for his efforts in doing literally hundreds of hours of \nresearch on the best possible approach to secure our National \nLaboratories.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. This amendment is, \nactually, the second step we will have taken in this defense \nauthorization bill to begin to rebuild the security of our National \nLaboratories.\n\n  In the Armed Services Committee, a provision that deals with this \nsubject was included in the bill. We have incorporated that part of \ntheir bill into this amendment. In addition to that, the Secretary of \nEnergy, Secretary Richardson, has some ideas about his organization. \nThe centerpiece of his ideas we have also incorporated into this \namendment.\n  What we are trying to do here is to get the best ideas that everybody \nhas to offer, and thereby ensure that when we finally finish this \nlegislative session, and finish discussing this with the \nadministration, we will have the best possible approach to security at \nour National Laboratories.\n  The essence of this amendment is to establish, in the Department of \nEnergy, a new Office of Counterintelligence which would be headed by a \nsenior executive from the FBI. I will come back to that. But that \noffice has been identified in the defense authorization bill. We simply \nflush out the provisions of that office in that bill and ensure that \nthat officer will have total authority here to deal with issues of \ncounterintelligence at our National Laboratories.\n  Then the second part of this amendment is to address the longstanding \nmanagement problems of the Department of Energy, especially relating to \nthe nuclear weapons complex and reorganizing the Department of Energy \nin such a way that there is a very clear line of authority over the \nnuclear weapons programs, with a person at the top of that, an \nadministrator, who has the responsibility over all of these nuclear \nprograms, and nothing else, within the Department. And, by the same \ntoken, nobody else in the Department, except those who are senior to \nhim, including the Secretary of the Department of Energy, would have \nany authority over his programs.\n  In effect, what we are replacing in the Department of Energy is a \nsituation in which all of the rules and regulations and management \npolicies, and everything else that applies to everybody within the \nDepartment--including the weapons complex--have created a situation in \nwhich, literally, they have not been able to focus on the management of \nthe nuclear weapons complexes, especially with regard to security.\n  So what this amendment does--in the intelligence community \nterminology--is to create a ``stovepipe'' within the Department of \nEnergy. At the top, of course, is the Secretary of Energy. Below him is \na person with the rank of Assistant Secretary, called the \n``administrator,'' who would, within that stovepipe, have the total \nauthority to operate the Department of Energy weapons programs, \nincluding the security functions of those programs.\n  He would be doing this, of course, in coordination with the office \nthat would be created by the language put in the bill by the Armed \nServices Committee relating to counterintelligence, with the FBI \npresence here, and the two of them would coordinate the national \nsecurity portions of this program.\n  In this way, you do not have people within the Department of Energy \nresponsible for all kinds of other things. Somebody talked about \nrefrigerator standards and powerplant issues and all of the rest of it. \nThose people would not have anything to do with this. This group would \nnot have anything to do with them. This would be a discrete function \nwithin the Department that would have nothing to do except manage our \nnuclear weapons programs, including, first and foremost, the security \nof those programs.\n  We will have much more to say about the details of this after a bit. \nCertainly Senator Domenici can go into many of the reasons he has \nhelped to craft this in the way that organizationally it will work.\n  Let me just make two concluding points.\n  First of all, I do not think we can emphasize enough the need to do \nsomething about security at the Laboratories now. One of the concerns \nthat has been raised about the amendment we have offered here is that \nit is premature, that we should hold hearings, and we should take a \nlong time so we can ``do this right.''\n  We have since 1995. And this administration has not done it right. It \nis time for the Senate to get involved in this issue and begin the \ndebate by putting this amendment out there. We will have plenty of time \nto deal with this before this bill ever goes to the President of the \nUnited States.\n  This is our approach to the best management for this weapons program. \nWe believe that to delay anymore is to engage in the same obfuscation \nand delay and, frankly, dereliction of duty that has characterized this \nadministration's approach to national security at our Nation's \nLaboratories, our nuclear weapons programs. We can't delay any longer.\n  If I were to go home over this Memorial Day recess, the first thing \nmy constituents would talk to me about is, what about this Chinese \nespionage? What about security at the Laboratories? If I say to them, \nwell, we were in such a hurry to get this Department of Defense \nauthorization bill done that we didn't really do anything about \nsecurity at our Nation's Laboratories, we are going to take our time \nand do that later, I think I would be pilloried, and so would all the \nrest of my colleagues. Our constituents expect us to act with alacrity. \nI don't see how we can complain about the Department of Energy and \nabout the administration taking their sweet time to deal with this \nproblem if we don't address it up front and right now.\n  The second point I make in closing is, with regard to a previous \ndraft of this legislation, the Secretary of Energy is indicating that \nhe doesn't approve of everything in here and might even recommend a \nveto of the legislation. I am sure by the time he is done hearing the \ndebate and conferring with us and reading the actual language of the \namendment, he will be willing to cooperate with us rather than threaten \nvetoes. We need to work together on this.\n  I commend Secretary Richardson because from the time he has come in, \nhe has tried to do the job of making reforms at the Department of \nEnergy. But it will not do to say that he is the only one who has any \nideas that could work here and for the Congress to but out, thank you.\n  The Congress has held numerous hearings, both in the House and the \nSenate. We have a lot of good ideas. Frankly, this management proposal, \nwhich has gone through a great deal of thought process about how to \nprovide security at our National Laboratories, is going to be part of \nthat reorganization. I know my colleagues and I look forward to working \nwith the Secretary of Energy to make this work.\n  As I conclude, might I ask how much time we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Within 1 minute, I will close. I will come back with more \ndiscussion of the rationale for the specific changes we have made in \nhere.\n  I close by saying this: The only way we are going to be able to \nguarantee security for the nuclear programs at our National \nLaboratories in the future is to have somebody with laser-like focus, \nfull responsibility over those programs in the Department of Energy, \nresponsible for nothing else, and nobody else in the Department \nresponsible for these programs. This person should be able to report \ndirectly to the Secretary of Energy and to the President of the United \nStates, which is what our amendment calls for. Finally, he should be \nable to work very closely with the Office of Counterintelligence \nestablished in the other part of this bill.\n  That is the essence of what this does. It detracts nothing from what \nSecretary Richardson is trying to do. As a matter of fact, it fits very \nnicely with what the Secretary is trying to do. I believe that, working \ntogether, we can provide security at our Nation's Laboratories and, \ntherefore, security for the people of the United States.\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield to Senator Domenici from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Chair will advise me when I have used \n10 minutes so there will be 10 minutes remaining for Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will be more than happy to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of my \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. He can rest \nassured that we intend to answer any questions he might have, debate \nany amendments he might have, and do this in a way that all of us can \nfeel is right.\n  Nobody was more saddened than this Senator when the Cox report was \nissued and when many of the facts broke in the New York Times and other \nnewspapers about a Chinese espionage effort.\n  I have been working with these Labs for a long time. I believe we are \nvery fortunate as a people to have these National Laboratories in our \nmidst. Looking at the science they practice, the technology they \ndevelop, and the way they have protected and preserved our nuclear \noptions during a long cold war, with a formidable opponent who chose \nanother route in terms of making nuclear weapons but is nonetheless \nformidable both in capacity and number, we are very fortunate that up \nuntil this time in history, with a few times when it wasn't true, \nalmost without limit the very best scientists in America cherished \nworking at one of these three great Labs and at the defense portion of \nthe Lab in Tennessee at Oak Ridge. Great scientists, great Nobel \nlaureates serving America well.\n  The problem now is, it has become obvious that for a long time, with \nthe biggest emphasis here in the last 3 or 4 years, the Chinese, the \nPeople's Republic of China, and their spies and cohorts have engaged in \na solid effort on many fronts to extract as many secrets as they could \nfrom these Laboratories. We now know there is a high probability that \nthey have succeeded and that our children in the future will have a \nmuch more formidable Communist Chinese leadership confronting the world \nwith a much more formidable set of rockets, delivery systems, and \nnuclear weapons.\n  All of their sabotage did not occur, all of their efforts to spy did \nnot occur, at just the Laboratories. They have had a concerted effort \nacross our land. But there is an adage that says, if it ain't broke, \ndon't fix it. The counter one to that is, if it is broke, fix it. \nFrankly, before the day is out, as I attempt to answer questions about \nthis approach, I will read to the Senate reams of reports, many of \nwhich have occurred in the last 4 or 5 years, telling us that we must \nchange the way we manage the nuclear defense part of the Department of \nEnergy. Now we have a reason to do it and a reason to get on with that \nbusiness.\n  Frankly, I have struggled mightily to try to figure out what is the \nbest approach under these circumstances. I am firmly convinced that \nwith the assault on the Laboratories and our scientists that is coming \nfrom the Congress and coming from across this land, we had better take \na giant step right now to move in the right direction and to assure \npeople and assure the Laboratories that we are not going to do anything \nto hurt their science base and their professionalism and their capacity \nto stay on the cutting edge for us and our children and our future.\n  The Laboratories, under this proposal, will retain their multiple-use \napproach. They can do work beyond and outside of what they do for the \nnuclear deterrent part of this bill.\n  I am very disturbed when I hear that the President of the United \nStates is against this, that he may have even made a few phone calls. I \nfigured those are coming because his trusted friend, the Secretary, who \nis also my friend, Bill Richardson, wants to make all of the changes in \nthe Department part of an administrative change.\n  Let me say loud and clear, as good as he is, as hard as he is trying, \nas much autonomy as the President gives him, the Secretary of Energy \ncannot fix this problem without congressional help. That is what we are \ntrying to do here today. We are trying to fix something so our nuclear \ndeterrent will have a better chance of remaining the best in the world \nand as free as humanly possible from espionage and spying.\n  Frankly, before the afternoon is finished, I will read excerpts from \nthree reports in the past 5 years just crying out to fix it.\n  We piled together various functions and put them in the Energy \nDepartment. We created a bunch of rules within the Department that do \nnot distinguish between the management of nuclear deterrent affairs and \nthe management of such things as refrigerator efficiency research. They \nare all in the same boat, all subject to the same management team, \nhundreds of functions that have nothing to do with nuclear deterrence. \nYet security was left in a position where the right hand didn't know \nwhat the left hand was doing.\n  And if you look at how it is structured, you can probably figure out \nthat there is some justification for it being in such a state of chaos. \nThere is not enough focus on the seriousness of the issue. Even when \nsigns and signals came forth, there have been people within the \nDepartment of Energy who didn't do their job right. There have been \npeople at the Laboratories who didn't do it right. There have been \npeople at the FBI who clearly messed up, and there have been people in \nthe White House who surely didn't rise up strongly enough and say \nsomething must be done now.\n  Essentially, what we are doing in this bill is to carve out within \nthe Department of Energy--carve out kind of an agency, for lack of a \nbetter word. It is going to be called the Security Administration, or \nSecurity Administrator, and an Assistant Secretary will run it and be \nresponsible to the Secretary and in total charge. That one individual \nwill be in total charge of the nuclear deterrent effort, as defined in \nthis bill.\n  There will be an extra reporting system that Senator Murkowski asked \nus to put in with reference to security breaches being transmitted to \nthe President of the United States and to the Congress, as soon as they \nare known, by this Assistant Secretary who is totally in charge of this \nnew administration within the Department of Energy. They will have \ntheir rules and regulations, and they will conduct the affairs \nsingularly and purposefully to make sure our nuclear deterrent is \nhandled correctly and that the security apparatus is done efficiently \nand appropriately.\n  Once again, I say to the Senators on the other side of the aisle, \nincluding my friend Senator Bingaman, and the Secretary of Energy, who, \nobviously, is working hard to defeat this amendment, we ought not to \ndefeat this amendment. If you have some constructive changes, let's get \nthem before us. We ought to send to that conference at least something \nthat is much more formidable and apt to do the job than we have done in \nthis bill, because we are apt to find some very serious suggestions \ncoming from the House.\n  If this bill goes there with no serious changes in the Department of \nEnergy, they are apt to be changed by the House. We ought to have our \ninput, and I am very proud that every chairman of every committee on \nour side of the aisle who will have anything to do with this in the \nfuture has signed onto this amendment--the Intelligence Committee \nchairman, the Energy and Natural Resources chairman, Government \nOperations, and I am the Senator who appropriates the money. We are all \non board asking that we take this step in the direction of real reform \nand that we can go home saying this defense bill, when it finally comes \nout, may indeed start us down a path that not only the Chinese, but \nnobody will be able to breach the security the way they have in the \npast.\n  Now, from my standpoint, there is not going to be a perfect structure \never designed for the nuclear deterrent work, nuclear weapons work, of \nthe Department of Energy. It is complicated, it is complex. That \nDepartment is complicated and complex, but there is nothing within that \nDepartment more important than this. I have been listening, as people \nhave ideas about what ought to happen, and I am worried about some of \nthose ideas. I am not worried about this idea.\n  I am not worried about this idea; this idea will work. What I am \nworried about are ideas that are talking about putting these \nLaboratories in the Department of Defense, which started\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\nfrom Harry Truman on down that it was something we thought we should \nnot do as a Nation. I am worried when this bill goes to conference and, \nin the heat of all this, we will do something we should not do. If they \nadopted this amendment, I would feel very comfortable, as a Senator, \nwith these Laboratories. I have probably worked longer and harder on \nthese issues than any Senator around, and I would be comfortable that \nwe are starting down a path to make it work and yet keep alive that \nenormous prestige and scientific prowess that has served us so well.\n  Before the afternoon is finished, we will have more remarks. I yield \nthe remainder of my time to the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and thank him for his efforts in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from New \nMexico. I rise to join with Senators Kyl, Domenici, and Shelby to offer \nan amendment which I feel confident creates accountability in the \nDepartment of Energy for protecting our country's national security \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the Cox committee report and the \nSenate's investigation of Chinese espionage at the Labs highlighted, in \na sense, a dysfunctional Department of Energy. Even though the \nDepartment of Energy's chief of intelligence, Notra Trulock, was \nringing alarm bells starting back in 1995, it simply seems that nobody \nwas listening. Today, we find that nobody is accountable.\n  We recognize the structure of the system simply didn't work. For Mr. \nTrulock to get approval to brief senior officials, he had to go through \nmore junior officials. He could not brief the Congress without \napproval. He didn't have access to the executive branch. What the \namendment that is pending creates is real accountability--\naccountability at DOE, accountability for the President, and \naccountability for the Congress. It puts into law an Office of \nCounterintelligence and mandates that the director report to the \nSecretary, the President, and the Congress, any actual or potential \nthreat to or loss of national security information.\n  We have seen a situation where the individual responsible simply \ndidn't have the capability to get the message through the process--to \nany of the four Secretaries of Energy whom we could identify for the \nrecord.\n  Further, this would require a report once a year to the Congress \nregarding the adequacy of the Department of Energy's procedures and \npolicies for protecting national security information, and whether each \nDepartment of Energy Lab is in full compliance with all Department of \nEnergy security requirements. The National Labs clearly had different \nsecurity arrangements previously.\n  The amendment also would prohibit any officer or employee of the \nDepartment of Energy or any other Federal agency from interfering with \nthe director's reporting. No interference, Mr. President.\n  Secretary Richardson has introduced several initiatives aimed at \ncorrecting the security problems at the Labs. I commend him for his \nefforts. I welcome the Secretary's initiative, energy, and enthusiasm, \nbut without a legislative overhaul, I doubt his ability to change the \nmindset at the Department of Energy which has plagued every other \nreform initiative.\n  It is kind of interesting to go back and look at the attempted \nreforms. Victor Rezendes, a director of the GAO, who has closely \nfollowed security initiatives at the Labs, made the following \nobservation:\n\n       DOE has often agreed to take corrective action, but the \n     implementation has not been successful.\n\n  A former head of security at Rocky Flats weapons plant, David \nRidenour, was more blunt. He was quoted in USA Today on May 19:\n\n       It's all the same people and I think they'll continue to \n     fall back into old ways. If there's a problem, classify it, \n     hide it and get rid of the people who brought it up.\n\n  Recall the so-called Curtis plan, which was put forth by Deputy \nSecretary Curtis. A good plan, but after Mr. Curtis left the \nDepartment, it was either disregarded or forgotten. It was so quickly \nforgotten, as a matter of fact, that Mr. Curtis' successor as Deputy \nSecretary wasn't even informed of its existence. There is no excuse for \nthat.\n  The New York Times reported that a November 1998 counterintelligence \nreport contained some shocking warnings, including that foreign spies \n``rightly view the Department of Energy as an inviting, diverse and \nsoft target that is easy to access and that employees are willing to \nshare information.''\n  So change is necessary. I think creating this new line of \nresponsibility will help change the mindset at the Department of \nEnergy. The amendment puts the DOE on the road to accountability by \ncreating under the law an Office of Counterintelligence, an Office of \nIntelligence, and a Nuclear Security Administration.\n  More legislation, obviously, is going to be needed. We simply don't \nhave all of the answers now. But the Cox report fills in some of the \nshocking details. After months of investigation, they have revealed \nfrightening information about the true ineptness of the espionage \ninvestigation.\n  I understand that the Secretary of Energy opposes this amendment. I \nam sorry to hear that. I gather he sent a letter up here indicating \nthat he will recommend that the President veto the bill because \nCongress is taking action to fix the problem. But what does he want \nCongress to do? Wait to take action until U.S.-designed nuclear weapon \nwarheads are launched at U.S. cities?\n  The problem is precisely that serious. After what we have learned \nabout security failures at the Department of Energy, I dare--I dare--\nthe President to veto this legislation.\n  It is time for action, and that is what we are talking about with \nthis amendment.\n  If one looks at where we are today, I am struck by three revelations.\n  First, we have in the Cox report stunning information about a \ncompromise of our national security that was self-inflicted. We can \nblame the Chinese for spying. But this happened as a consequence of our \nown failure to maintain adequate security in the Laboratories. Security \nof our most important Laboratories has been marginal at best.\n  We find that U.S. companies--Loral and Hughes--allowed their \ncommercial interests to override our national security interests. We \ngave the Chinese a roadmap on how to shoot their missiles straight and \nhow to arm those missiles with nuclear weapons. Aimed at whom? Well, \nthat is another concern.\n  Second, how much of this happened on President Clinton's watch?\n  Third, the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region could be \naffected by the information they have obtained.\n  Based on these finding, I believe now is the time for Congress to \ndemand accountability from those who allowed this to happen. We should \nnot allow the administration to simply promise change with reforms that \nin previous efforts have been tried but have failed.\n  One would not respond to, say, a burglary by saying that the robber \nis irrelevant. Our Nation has been robbed. Years of research and \nhundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars are lost to the Chinese. Who \nis responsible?\n  What should be done is that the Attorney General should testify in \npublic and tell the American people why the Department of Justice \ndenied requests for access to computer and wiretaps.\n  FBI Director Freeh should testify in public as to why the FISA \nwarrant was inadequate. Director Freeh should also explain the so-\ncalled ``misinformation'' on Wen Ho Lee's signed waiver of consent to \naccess his computer.\n  Sandy Berger should testify. He might require a subpoena. So be it. \nThe public is entitled to his testimony. Mr. Berger was briefed in \nApril of 1996 and July of 1997. Berger should be forced to testify as \nto what precisely he told the President and when.\n  Congress should also subpoena the written summary of the Cox report \nto President Clinton, which the President received in January of 1999.\n  Let us judge whether the President was being forthcoming in his March \n1999 statement when he said:\n\n       To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me \n     about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the \n     laboratories during my presidency.\n\n  What did the Vice President know? When did he know it?\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\n  The Vice President told the American people on March 10:\n\n       Please keep in mind that the [alleged espionage] happened \n     during the previous administration.\n\n  Now the Vice President is rather silent. What was he told by his \nNational Security Adviser, Leon Fuerth, who was briefed in 1995 and \n1996?\n  I have held six Energy Committee hearings. At another time I want to \ndetail what I have learned from those hearings. But let me summarize \nvery briefly.\n  Our Laboratories have not and still are not totally prepared to \nprotect our Nation's nuclear secrets.\n  The DOE put our national security at risk by not searching Wen Ho \nLee's computer in 1996 in spite of information about Chinese targeting \nof lab computers.\n  The FBI investigation was bureaucratic bungling. The right hand never \nknew what the left hand was doing.\n  Regarding the waiver, we have learned that on March 22, 1995, the Los \nAlamos Lab issued a policy to all employees, including Wen Ho Lee, \nstating that ``the laboratory or Federal Government may without notice \naudit or access any user's computer.''\n  On April 19, 1995, Wen Ho Lee signed a waiver at the DOE Lab to allow \nhis computer to be accessed. This is the actual copy of the waiver that \nWen Ho Lee signed on April 19, 1995. My committee heard testimony from \nthe Los Alamos Lab director, the DOE attorney, the DOE director of \ncounterintelligence. All agreed that Lee's computer could be searched \nbecause of these waivers.\n  Why wasn't his computer searched and the loss of our nuclear secrets \nprevented? Because the FBI claimed that the DOE told them there was no \nwaiver. The FBI then assumed that they needed a warrant to search.\n  Here is how the Los Alamos Lab director summed it up.\n\n       The FBI and the Department of Justice decided they should \n     seek court approval before accessing the subject's (Lee's) \n     computer. The Labortary's policy seems clear to be sufficient \n     for FBI access, but the legal framework affecting the FBI's \n     actions, as viewed by them, apparently prevented this.\n\n  What is the result? Lee's computer could have been searched but \ninstead was not searched for 3 long years. Yet there was a waiver. This \nwaiver was there the entire time, and the FBI didn't know it.\n  And then there was DOJ's role: DOJ thwarted investigation by refusing \nto approve FISA warrants--not once, not twice, but three times! Still \nhave not heard a reasonable explanation.\n  What's frightening, as well as frustrating, is that no one put our \nnational security as a priority. FBI and DOJ more concerned about \njumping through unnecessary legal hoops than about preventing one of \nthe most catastrophic losses in history.\n  The events involved throughout the Lee case are not only \nirresponsible--they're unconscionable.\n  That is why we must have this security change. This is why this \namendment must prevail.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ``Rules of Use'' \nwhich Wen Ho Lee signed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Rules of Use\n\n\n                   x-division open local area network\n\n       WARNING: To protect the LAN systems from unauthorized use \n     and to ensure that the systems are functioning properly, \n     activities on these systems are monitored and recorded and \n     subject to audit.

I thank my friend, the floor manager, for the time.\n  I wish the President a good day.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have negotiated the amendment of the \nSenator from Florida. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes on \nthis amendment prior to going to the amendment of the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. I view \nit as an augmentation of what we have in the defense bill. I understand \nmy colleague from New Mexico addressed the defense bill. I ask the \nquestion of my colleague from Alaska. The provision in the defense bill \nis a direct product of the working group assembled by the majority \nleader, Senator Lott. I am not entirely sure what Senator Domenici said \nabout the provisions of the defense bill. But the Senator from Alaska \nincorporated a portion of that in his bill. So there is some \nredundancy. But I look upon the two as joining forces and, indeed, \nputting forth what is essential at this point in time.\n  Does the Senator share that view?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I share that view with the senior Senator from \nVirginia. It is my understanding that the leader is still prepared to \ngo ahead with his amendment known as the Lott amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to advise my colleague that the \namendment has been agreed to and is in the bill now.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Good.\n  Mr. WARNER. There are really three components: One, the Armed \nServices' position; Leader Lott's position; and the position recited by \nthe three Senators who are sponsors of this amendment. But it all comes \ntogether as a very strong package. I hope it will be accepted on the \nother side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I hope that Senators Shelby and Robert Kerrey are \naware that this amendment is now up, and they have 15 minutes under \ntheir joint control reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 447\n\n    (Purpose: To establish a commission on the counterintelligence \n                   capabilities of the United States)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n[[Page S6199]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 447.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Sandi \nDittig of our staff be allowed on the floor for the duration of the \ndebate on the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I have presented the Senate with an amendment to the \nDefense Department authorization bill. The amendment would establish a \nnational commission to conduct an in-depth assessment of our \nGovernment's counterintelligence programs.\n  The discussion we just had for the past 30 minutes I think \nunderscores the necessity of the amendment I am offering. I am afraid \nwe are about to be put into a position in which there is a rush to \naction. It is almost analogous to the metaphor of firing before you \naim.\n  We have in the defense bill, as an example, a very comprehensive \ncommission on safeguarding security and counterintelligence at the \nDepartment of Energy facilities. That begins on page 540 of the \ncommittee bill. Among other things, it states that the commission will \ndetermine the adequacy of those activities to ensure the security of \nsensitive information, processes, and activities under the jurisdiction \nof the Department against threats of the disclosure of such \ninformation, processes, and activities.\n  In the same bill where we are establishing a commission to review \nthose issues of process, we are now about to adopt an amendment which \ncountermands this commission by making a decision based on 30 minutes \nof floor debate for answers to provide greater security at the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  I suggest these proposals have not received the thought and \nconsideration which their importance to the Nation deserves. I also am \nconcerned that there is a highly partisan atmosphere being developed.\n  In today's Roll Call magazine there is an article which quotes one \ncongressional staffer as saying,\n\n       We're going to milk this [the Chinese espionage issue] for \n     all it's worth.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nimmediately after my remarks a copy of that article.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as members of the Congress, we need to \naccept our responsibility and accept the importance of \ncounterintelligence to our national security. The country cannot afford \na partisan debate. We cannot afford a piecemeal solution to what is a \ncomplex set of issues. Yet with the amendments that are being offered \nin both Houses, that is exactly what we are getting.\n  My amendment represents an attempt to transform a potentially \ndestructive partisan debate into a nonpartisan, objective, \ndispassionate, and comprehensive review of current counterintelligence \npolicies--not just at the Department of Energy, but across the \ngovernment--a review that is long overdue.\n  Such a review would address a number of issues: What is the nature of \nthe counterintelligence threat? The nature of the threat goes far \nbeyond China and it goes far beyond our Department of Energy National \nLaboratories. For example, there are 24 countries on the Department of \nEnergy's sensitive country list. Those countries include those that we \nwould expect to be on such a list--China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq--but the \nlist also includes India, Israel, and Taiwan--countries, I suspect, \nmany Americans would be surprised to find on that list.\n  Another example of the threat relates to the missile programs in \nIndia, Pakistan, and North Korea. To what extent have their programs \nbenefited from American technology and know-how gleaned from our Labs \nor other high-tech institutions? What leads us to believe that our only \nvulnerability is from China?\n  The threat goes beyond the traditional security parameters of guns, \ngates, and guards at the Department of Energy. We must include an \nindepth look across the government and at the new areas of security \nvulnerability.\n  I have a report from the General Accounting Office issued to the \nCongress on May 20, 1999. This was an analysis of the vulnerability of \nthe NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, about the \nvulnerability of its system to security penetration. I will read a \nparagraph titled ``Results in Brief.''\n\n       We successfully penetrated several mission-critical \n     systems, including one responsible for calculating detailed \n     positioning data for Earth orbiting spacecraft and another \n     that processes and distributes the scientific data received \n     from these spacecraft. Having obtained access to these \n     systems, we could have disrupted NASA's ongoing command and \n     control operations and stolen, modified, or destroyed systems \n     software and data.\n\n  That is just another example of our national vulnerability.\n  Who should assess this threat? I believe that the commission that \nshould be established by this amendment would appropriately represent \nthe interests of the American people through the administration and the \nlegislative branches and would necessarily include persons with \nstrategic vision and specific counterintelligence experience. I have \nused as the model for the establishment of this commission, a \ncommission which was established by the Congress in 1994 under the \nleadership of Senator Warner, a commission which became known as the \nAspin-Brown Commission, to look at our intelligence community.\n\n  Like that commission, this would have 17 members. The President would \nappoint 9, the leadership of the Senate and the House--majority and \nminority--would appoint a total of 8 commissioners.\n  The commission would be charged with assessing the current \ncounterintelligence threat and the adequacy of resources being applied \nto that threat. Commissioners would also examine current personnel \nlevels and training oversight--both executive and legislative--\ncoordination among government agencies, the laws now on the books and \ntheir adequacy, the adequacy of current investigative techniques and, \nlast but not least, attempt to determine whether vigorous \ncounterintelligence capability can coexist with important work carried \nout by our National Laboratories and other important technological \ninstitutions.\n  It is important that we keep counterintelligence problems and \npossible solutions in some perspective. There is no doubt that \ncounterintelligence deficiencies of the Department of Energy are \nlongstanding. They have been excruciatingly well documented over a long \nperiod of time. We should have addressed these issues years ago. But as \nserious as our counterintelligence weaknesses are at the Department of \nEnergy and at our National Laboratories, effective focus on \ncounterintelligence issues must take into account many other agencies \nof the government. It must do this if we are to construct a \ncomprehensive and effective counterintelligence response.\n  Those agencies, of course, include those belonging to the \nintelligence community, but also must include agencies such as NASA, \nwhose vulnerability I have just outlined, and the Department of \nCommerce, which has had the responsibility for reviewing highly \ntechnical decisions on whether it is appropriate to license for export \nparticular dual-use machinery that might serve a military purpose.\n  These reviews of agencies like NASA and the Department of Commerce \nhave not been viewed in the past as warranting the degree of \ncounterintelligence focus which I believe they deserve. For those who \nargue that we can't wait for the commission, that we must act today, I \npoint out that the immediate counterintelligence issues facing our \nDepartment of Energy National Labs are being addressed.\n  According to Ed Curran, a highly respected 37-year FBI veteran who \nnow heads the Department of Energy's Counterintelligence Office, 75 to \n80 percent of the Tier One recommendations\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\nresulting from a 1998 FBI evaluation of Lab counterintelligence are now \nin place. The remainder will be in place within 7 months. These are \nimportant steps that will go a long way in the short term to protect \nthe work going on at the Labs.\n  In the heat of the moment, numerous recommendations are being put \nforward to improve counterintelligence at the Department of Energy. \nSome of them may be useful. Others, such as placing counterintelligence \nat the Labs under the FBI's control, may not be. All recommendations \ndeserve careful, objective, and dispassionate attention. I believe a \ncommission of the type that this amendment would establish would be the \nappropriate place to begin such a comprehensive reexamination.\n  I suggest that we draw a collective breath, that we step back, that \nwe take a serious indepth look at this very complicated issue, and that \nwe reach a consensus as Americans on the best way to proceed. I am \nconvinced if we force solutions and force them beyond our current \nanalysis and rush our deliberations, that we are likely to end up \nasking the wrong questions and coming up with the wrong answer. America \nwill be disserved by this pattern of action and the Congress will be \nthe culprit.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From Roll Call, May 27, 1999]\n\n               Cox Report Sparks Wave of GOP Initiatives\n\n                          (By John Bresnahan)\n\n       This week's release of the report on Chinese espionage by \n     the select House committee chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox \n     (R-Calif.) has triggered a wave of legislative initiatives.\n       Senate Republicans are pounding on senior administration \n     officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno, for their \n     perceived failure to address some of the most serious \n     allegations dealing with the scandal, including the Justice \n     Department's refusal to go along with an FBI wiretap of a \n     scientist suspected of transferring sensitive nuclear data to \n     the Chinese government.\n       Reno is scheduled to appear today before the senate \n     Judiciary Committee in closed session to talk about her role \n     in the denial of the wiretap request.\n       Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwanese-born scientist, was fired recently \n     from his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New \n     Mexico due to his alleged involvement with Chinese \n     intelligence officials.\n       Lee first came under scrutiny in 1996 after U.S. \n     intelligence officials learned the Chinese government may \n     have acquired data on an advanced U.S. nuclear weapons \n     systems. The following year, the Justice Department declined \n     to seek a warrant to conduct electronic surveillance on him, \n     with officials arguing that they did not have sufficient \n     evidence to approve such a step.\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) now believes \n     Reno personally denied the FBI request for electronic \n     surveillance on Lee, a reversal of his earlier position that \n     he did not think she was directly involved in the \n     controversy.\n       ``It looks to me like the line goes directly to her,'' said \n     Lott. ``Clearly, it's indefensible in my mind these two \n     [search] requests were turned down.''\n       Lott, though, backed away from any suggestion that Reno \n     should step down from her post.\n       ``I have not called for [her] resignation,'' noted the \n     Majority Leader.\n       Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the chairman of the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence, has already called on Reno to \n     resign.\n       Reno could also face tough questioning from Sen. Robert \n     Torricelli (D-N.J.), who has been highly critical of Reno's \n     behavior, during her Thursday appearance.\n       ``I believe President Clinton needs to make an assessment \n     whether Janet Reno is properly administering the department \n     and whether she has any culpability for this failure to find \n     probable cause to issue this warrant,'' Torricelli said this \n     week.\n       National Security Adviser Sandy Berger has also come under \n     fire from GOP Congressional leaders for his role in the \n     scandal.\n       Senate Republicans plan a broad legislative offensive on \n     China, possibly including new restrictions on the ability of \n     the Chinese officials to travel within the United States \n     during visits here, although they are promising to move \n     slowly on the issue. Republicans are using the \n     recommendations included in an earlier Intelligence Committee \n     report, as well as the Cox report, as the basis for the \n     legislation, said GOP staffers.\n       But Lott is still hedging on whether to set up a special \n     Senate investigative committee to look into Chinese \n     espionage, despite calls from some Senate Republicans to do \n     just that.\n       Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.) introduced a bill this week calling \n     for a special committee, while Sens. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.) \n     and Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) support the idea, according to GOP \n     sources.\n       The GOP staffers say senior Republicans, including several \n     committee chairmen, are opposed to the idea, believing that \n     Clinton and the Democrats may use the panel as an opportunity \n     to attack Republicans for conducting a witch hunt for Chinese \n     spies.\n       ``This idea is not dead,'' said a senior Senate GOP \n     staffer. ``It's going back and forth. It's still \n     percolating.''\n       Lott has inaugurated weekly meetings of his China task \n     force, which includes Shelby, Armed Services Chairman John \n     Warner (R-Va.), Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms (R-\n     N.C.), Governmental Affairs Chairman Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), \n     Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Frank Murkowski (R-\n     Alaska), as well as GOP Sens. Specter, Thad Cochran (Miss.), \n     Pete Domenici (N.M.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), Tim Hutchinson (Ark.) \n     and Craig Thomas (Wyo.).\n       That group is giving Lott weekly updates on China, although \n     the Mississippi Republican also wants to get the most \n     political mileage he can out of the Cox report.\n       ``We're going to milk this for all its worth,'' said one \n     Senate GOP staffer. ``What we do next is still being \n     considered.''\n       Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has been \n     echoing the White House line that past administrations, \n     including those of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George \n     Bush, were guilty of lax oversight of Chinese intelligence \n     activities within the United States.\n       Daschle cited an 1988 internal Energy Department study that \n     found ``a significant amount of important technology may have \n     been lost to potential adversaries through visits'' that took \n     place in the early 1980s.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask that amendments sent prior to the \npassage of the bill--that the chairman and ranking minority member be \nrecognized to offer a managers' package of amendments, notwithstanding \nthe previous consent agreement with respect to the 2:30 p.m. deadline \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise unfortunately to speak in \nopposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida, \nSenator Graham. Let me say, first of all, I think the intent of this \nbipartisan commission is right on target; that is, that we take care \nnot to rush to judgment, and in our rush to judgment----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator to yield for one \nadministrative announcement? I ask all Senators and their staff to pay \nattention to a hotline call, which will come very shortly, to clarify \nthe earlier unanimous consent agreement regarding filing of first-\ndegree amendments. That includes the need for the offices to resubmit \ncertain amendments that may have otherwise been informally sent over to \nthe floor staff. So a complete submission is necessary as indicated on \nthe hotline. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida has identified a \nvery serious potential problem, which is that we have now, in the \naftermath of the report that was produced and made public by \nCongressman Cox and Congressman Dicks, a great deal of interest in \ndoing something, to take some action to look like we are solving the \nproblem.\n  What I understand the Senator from Florida to be saying is we should \ntake a collective deep breath, and I quite agree with him. Because I \nthink not only is it possible, it is likely, if we are not careful, we \nwill, in our actions, do things that will make the country less safe, \nnot more safe and secure.\n  Perhaps the most important thing to be saying about the Cox and the \nDicks report is that there is a lot less there than meets the eye. By \nthat, I don't mean to say I am critical of the report, although there \nare three or four conclusions they reach with which I do not agree, \nthat I do not think are supported by the classified report they have \nfiled. I see in the Cox-Dicks report--and in fact in their own \nevaluation they say: This was not a comprehensive study; there were a \nlot of things we were not able to check out.\n  I believe that is essentially what the Senator from Florida is \nsaying. There is still a lot that neither the Cox-Dicks committee, the \nTemporary Special Committee, nor the House and the Senate Select \nCommittees on Intelligence, have examined. Indeed, one of the people we \nasked to do an evaluation of the damage, Admiral Jeremiah, has said in \nthe report he gave to us it is terribly important that we do a net \nassessment; we try to establish what the gains were, what the losses \nwere, before we move on.\n  I am just not persuaded, I say to my friend from Florida, that this \ncommission he is proposing--that would be essentially similar to the \nBrown-Aspin Commission; I think it is modeled after that commission--is \nthe right way to do it.\n\n[[Page S6201]]\n\n  I propose as an alternative, No. 1, the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence try to come up with a scope of study similar to the \nJeremiah study, try to put it in the intelligence authorization bill, \nbut, in other words, challenge our committee to do something similar to \nwhat we did with Admiral Jeremiah. He started to do a damage assessment \nfor us.\n  I think much more needs to be done before the Congress knows for \ncertain, A, what the damage was and, B, for certain what exactly it is \nwe ought to do.\n  I know the majority leader has, and I am cosponsoring with him, some \nchanges he is recommending that we will be recommending to be made. But \nthese are pretty limited. Many of these things can be done \nadministratively. They really are just based upon what we know right \nnow. So, while I find myself unpersuaded by this amendment--although \nmaybe with a little bit more time I could have been persuaded--I am not \npersuaded we need a commission of this kind. I am persuaded we do need \nfurther examination, in fact a more thorough examination, than done to \ndate.\n  The damage has been done. So we make certain in our response to this \nstory of espionage and story of lax security, not just at the Labs but \nin monitoring and watching the satellites that were being launched in \nthe Chinese Long March program, and the whole export regime we have \nestablished to make certain we do not export things that are then used \nagainst us in some fashion, that we do not presume, in short, that we \nknow everything that happened and we do not take action that could make \nthe problem worse.\n\n  I believe what the Senator from Florida is suggesting to us is right \non target. We have to be very careful that we do not rush to judgment \nand do things that will make things worse. So I recommend an \nalternative that I think will enable us to accomplish the same \nobjective.\n  Again, I have great respect for the Senator from Florida and what he \nis trying to do. I think I vote with him 9 out of 10 times and do not \nlike to be in a position where I am opposing his amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERREY. It depends on the question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. One of the principal purposes of this commission starts \nwith a recognition that our counterintelligence problems, or \nvulnerabilities, are not limited to Chinese penetration and are not \nlimited to Department of Energy Laboratories. In fact, I have quoted \nfrom a study by the General Accounting Office that is less than 10 days \nold about a major potential penetration in NASA of its computer \nsystems.\n  The question: ``Would the Senator agree that whatever form Congress \ntook to look at this issue, in addition to being rational, prudent, \nthoughtful, that it should also be comprehensive, in terms of the \nagencies of the Federal Government and the potential sources of efforts \nto penetrate those agencies?''\n  Mr. KERREY. I answer emphatically yes. It needs to be Governmentwide. \nIndeed, I would say to the Senator, as he no doubt knows, there is also \nvulnerability with contractors, current and former employees. There is \na significant amount of vulnerability.\n  Let me point out in the case of the transfer of these designs that \nhave been reported to the public, we are not 100 percent certain that \nthey were transferred out of Los Alamos. That is the problem. This \ndesign was held by many other people other than Los Alamos. So that is \none of the problems here. When you take this particular situation, if \nyou are 100 percent certain it is Los Alamos, tighten up security at \nthe Lab. If you are not 100 percent certain and we tighten up security \nin the Lab, we may be tightening up security in a place that is not the \nproblem.\n  So I think there is reason to believe the changes that have been \nsuggested thus far will not damage us. But I think what the Senator is \nsaying is exactly right. It needs to be Governmentwide. It needs to \nlook at the contractors.\n  Another thing I think needs to be considered, there was an op-ed \npiece written by Edward Teller, published in the New York Times. Mr. \nTeller can best be described as somebody whose lifetime has been \ndevoted to the task of making certain the United States of America has \na robust nuclear deterrent and that nuclear deterrent was adequate to \nprotect the people of the United States of America and our interests.\n  Mr. Teller says, and I agree with him, by the way, by the time you \nput all other security measures in place, the most important deterrent \nagainst losing our technological superiority is not defensive measures \nbut making certain we allocate enough for research and development and \nwe keep the pointy edge of our technological spear sharp. So long as we \ncontinue in research and development, not just in design but \nconstruction and deployment, Mr. Teller is saying you decrease the \npossibility that espionage or some other transfers--in some cases \ntransfers you do not even think about--will do damage to the security \nof the United States of America.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nebraska yield for \nanother question?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator's last point about trade-offs highlights the \nfact that we risk making our nation less secure if we are not careful \nwith our solutions. We could potentially be lured into doing what \nHitler did in the 1930s and 1940s; that is, prevent intelligent and \ncapable people from participating in our nation's government and \nsociety on the basis of their ethnicity. So we do not want, as some \nhave suggested, ethnic standards determining who will have an \nopportunity to access our laboratories. In my judgement, security \nshould be based on the individual who is involved, not on that \nindividual's membership in a larger ethnic group. The danger of denying \nour nation a pool of talent due to ethnic stereotyping illustrates the \ncomplexity of this issue.\n  Would the Senator agree also that in order to sort through all of \nthose complexities----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 7\\1/2\\ minutes of the Senator is up.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Since I don't think Senator Shelby has arrived----\n  Mr. KERREY. He is here.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to complete my question and give \nSenator Kerrey 2 minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree that in order to sort through \nthose complexities, we would need a group of Americans who can look at \nthis both from a strategic perspective as well as from the technical \ncompetencies of what is required to do appropriate counterintelligence \nprotective processes and methods?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes, I do. I have to answer the first part of the \nSenator's question no. I do not think we are in any danger of following \nAdolf Hitler's example, but I do think we need to be careful that in an \neffort to restrict who gets to know things we do not create an \nadditional security problem.\n  We have had many examples, as we try to figure out what goes wrong \nwith a national security decision, especially intelligence, where we \ndiscover that the problem was Jim knew it; Mary didn't know it. Neither \none of them had a right or need to know what each other was doing. As a \nconsequence of them simply walking from one cubicle to the other \ntalking, a mistake is made.\n  We have to be very careful in exercising our judgment in what ought \nto be done in tightening things that we do not actually create \nadditional security problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I oppose the Graham amendment as the \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We should, as an \ninstitution, oppose all efforts to devolve the authority and the \nresponsibility of any congressional committee to an outside group, such \nas this commission, when there is no compelling reason to do so, and \nthere is certainly no compelling reason to do so in this instance at \nthis time.\n  As my colleagues probably know, the Intelligence Committee is already\n\n[[Page S6202]]\n\naware of the state of our counterintelligence capabilities. I have \nworked with the vice chairman, Senator Kerrey, and other Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, in dealing with our counterintelligence \ncapabilities because we are engaged in the committee now in an ongoing \nlegislative oversight of the intelligence community's approach to \ncounterintelligence activities and espionage investigations. That is an \nongoing, very much alive investigation.\n  We have a tremendous staff, I believe--and I believe the Senator from \nNebraska, the vice chairman, joins me in saying this --a very able \nstaff on the Senate Intelligence Committee that is deeply involved in a \nbipartisan way in this investigation.\n  The committee has recommended, and will continue to recommend as our \ninvestigation unfolds, substantive changes in this area. We are working \nwith the majority leader, with the minority leader, and their staffs in \nthis regard.\n  I believe the Intelligence Committee is completely capable--and I \nbelieve the vice chairman has already indicated this--of addressing \nthis relatively small but very, very critical area within the National \nForeign Intelligence Program.\n  Most important, though, this legislation presumes the failure of \ncongressional oversight, and that did not happen. It did not happen in \nthis instance, and the Senator from Nebraska, who has just come back on \nthe floor, was very involved as the vice chairman of this committee in \npushing for more money for counterintelligence. That goes without \nsaying.\n\n  The failure of congressional oversight, as far as the Intel Committee \nis concerned, did not happen. For nearly 10 years, the Intelligence \nCommittee has repeatedly directed the intelligence community to improve \nits counterintelligence capabilities communitywide and specifically at \nthe Department of Energy where our most precious Labs, our most \nimportant Labs are located.\n  I believe this is really a case of the executive branch failing to \nheed congressional warnings, and I think we will see more and more of \nthis as the investigation unfolds.\n  Finally, counterintelligence has been a specific priority of the \nIntelligence Committee in the Senate and will continue to be a high \npriority, as it should, as long as I am chairman and as long as I am \ninvolved.\n  This amendment ignores the past and ongoing work of the Intelligence \nCommittee in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is under the control of the Senator from \nAlabama and the Senator from Florida. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are trying to work this out right now.\n  The Senator from Florida has authorized the managers to make a \nrequest on his behalf that this amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see the distinguished minority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a question--more of a statement--for \nthe purpose of understanding the schedule for the rest of the day. I \nsay at this time, so there are no surprises later on, as you know, \nthere has been an amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from New Mexico which is pending. I want the body to know that \nthis amendment is not satisfactory with the minority and with the \nadministration.\n  The debate on this amendment is going to take a very, very long time. \nI want everyone to understand that. I have several hours of information \nthat I need to explain to the body. Senator Bingaman and others wish to \nspeak at length in this regard.\n  It is getting late in the day, and I did not want at 3 or 4 o'clock \nfor people to ask: Why didn't you tell us earlier? I have suggested to \nboth managers of the bill that this amendment causes some problem over \nhere, in addition to the fact the President said he will veto it. In \nshort, I will not belabor the point other than to say I hope we can \nfinish this bill, but this amendment is going to prevent us from doing \nso in an expeditious fashion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have not taken much time to debate. I admire the \nleadership of the Senators from Virginia and Michigan. But I have to \nconcur with what the Senator from Nevada said. If we are going into \nthis new debate topic about security at the Laboratories, we are going \nto have to give it an adequate amount of time, and that will be \nsubstantial. I hope the Senator understands and will advise his side of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I hear very clearly what our two \ncolleagues have said. I believe that information was imparted to the \nthree sponsors of the amendment earlier today. We will just have to \nawait their response. At the moment, the Kyl-Domenici amendment is laid \ndown. It is the pending business; am I not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been laid aside but it is still \npending.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see other Senators anxious to speak to the Senate. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized to offer amendments from the other side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Michigan yield for a \nquestion by the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Texas \nbe recognized, and then we return to the previous order. But before \noffering that suggestion, I ask the Senator what her amendment is.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This is the amendment to ask for the report from the \nPresident on the foreign deployments with a report on where these \ndeployments could be categorized as low priority and where there can be \nconsolidation for reductions in troop commitments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator--I am \nprivileged to be a cosponsor of this important amendment. However, in \nthe course of the last hour we have had a chance to make a suggestion \nto the Senator from Texas. Has she incorporated that suggestion?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No. I say to the distinguished cosponsor of my \namendment, I discussed that particular issue and was told that it would \nbe put in an addendum that would be classified if there were any such \nmissions that needed to be disclosed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding now from my staff--staffs have been working on this and \nare still working on it. I ask that the Senator withhold that until we \ncan see whether or not that can be worked out, because my staff \nindicates that they were actually in the process of discussion, and we \nare not sure what version it is that the Senator is offering.\n  So I would not be able to agree to a change in our order unless we \ntake a few minutes here to see if we can first work it out. Then I \nwould assure the Senator that if it is not worked out--I know our good \nfriend from Virginia would assure you as well--there would be an \nopportunity to offer the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would want to be assured from both the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member that if we go past the 2:30 \nunanimous consent deadline I would be allowed to offer my amendment if \nthere is not an agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I assure my colleague that her amendment \nwill be included in the 2:30 unanimous consent agreement. But I thought \nperhaps the Senator from Texas could address the general content of the \namendment for a few minutes, and perhaps within that period we can work \nout a resolution.\n  I note the Senator from Alabama was anxious to speak to the Senate. I \ndo not see him at the moment. He has an amendment which I think is \ngoing to be accepted. He wants to speak to it.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am in no need of speaking to my amendment until I \nam able to offer it.\n\n[[Page S6203]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. We ask that she withhold it, but will consider it to be \nwithin the deadline.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. As long as I am assured I will be able to offer it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe the managers are prepared to \nsubmit to the Chair a package of amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 376, 386, 387, 398, 399, and 403\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

(a): Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the National Security Strategy of the United \n     States to ``deter and defeat large-scale, cross-border \n     aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time \n     frames;''\n       (2) The deterrence of Iraq and Iran in Southwest Asia and \n     the deterrence of North Korea in Northeast Asia represent two \n     such potential large-scale, cross-border theater \n     requirements;\n       (3) The United States has 120,000 troops permanently \n     assigned to those theaters;\n       (4) The United States has an additional 70,000 forces \n     assigned to non-NATO/non-Pacific threat foreign countries;\n       (5) The United States has more than 6,000 troops in Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina on indefinite assignment;\n       (6) The United States has diverted permanent assigned \n     resources from other theaters to support operations in the \n     Balkans;\n       (7) The United States provides military forces to seven \n     active United Nations peacekeeping operations, including some \n     missions that have continued for decades;\n       (8) Between 1986 and 1998, the number of American military \n     deployments per year has nearly tripled at the same time the \n     Department of Defense budget has been reduced in real terms \n     by 38 percent;\n       (9) The Army has 10 active-duty divisions today, down from \n     18 in 1991, while on an average day in FY98, 28,000 U.S. Army \n     soldiers were deployed to more than 70 countries for over 300 \n     separate missions;\n       (10) Active Air Force fighter wings have gone from 22 to 13 \n     since 1991, while 70 percent of air sorties in Operation \n     Allied Force over the Balkans are U.S.-flown and the Air \n     Force continues to enforce northern and southern no-fly zones \n     in Iraq. In response, the Air Force has initiated a ``stop \n     loss'' program to block normal retirements and separations.\n       (11) The United States Navy has been reduced in size to 339 \n     ships, its lowest level since 1938, necessitating the \n     redeployment of the only overseas homeported aircraft carrier \n     from the Western Pacific to the Mediterranean to support \n     Operation Allied Force;\n       (12) In 1998 just 10 percent of eligible carrier naval \n     aviators--27 out of 261--accepted continuation bonuses and \n     remained in service;\n       (13) In 1998 48 percent of Air Force pilots eligible for \n     continuation opted to leave the service.\n       (14) The Army could fall 6,000 below Congressionally \n     authorized troop strength by the end of 1999.\n       (b) Sense of Congress:\n       (1) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) The readiness of U.S. military forces to execute the \n     National Security Strategy of the United States is being \n     eroded from a combination of declining defense budgets and \n     expanded missions;\n       (B) There may be missions to which the United States is \n     contributing Armed Forces from which the United States can \n     begin disengaging.\n       (c) Report Requirement.\n       (1) Not later than March 1, 2000, the President shall \n     submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and \n     the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives, and to the Committees on Appropriations in \n     both Houses, a report prioritizing the ongoing global \n     missions to which the United States is contributing troops. \n     The President shall include in the report a feasibility \n     analysis of how the United States can:\n       (1) shift resources from low priority missions in support \n     of higher priority missions;\n       (2) consolidate or reduce U.S. troop commitments worldwide;\n       (3) end low priority missions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Domenici amendment will be set aside.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe we have all the amendments in \nunder the prescribed time agreement.\n\n[[Page S6211]]\n\nTwo colleagues have been waiting patiently to speak, and there is a \nthird. We will allocate the time that each Senator desires. Could the \nSenators from Texas and Alabama indicate who will go first and how much \ntime each will take?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be happy with 5 minutes, and I would be happy \nfor the Senator from Alabama to go first.\n  Mr. WARNER. How much time for the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Five.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand 20 minutes is needed by our colleague from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what are we dividing time up on?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are sequencing speeches.\n  Mr. REID. I am not going to agree to anything. I have been waiting to \nspeak on the Kyl-Domenici amendment, and I was here early this morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will withdraw the request. I was asked to enter that. \nCould my two colleagues complete their remarks and then we will go to \nthe distinguished minority whip?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 465\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today the valiant men and women of our \nArmed Forces are in their third month of deployment for Operation \nAllied Force in Yugoslavia and Kosovo. However, in these final months \nof this Century, when you say Armed Forces, you are not referring \nmerely to our Active Duty forces. In nearly every situation concerning \nour Nation's defense forces, when you speak of Armed Forces you also \nmust include the Reserve Components. As Secretary Cohen and General \nShelton have asserted, the Armed Forces cannot undertake any \nsignificant deployment without the citizen-soldiers of the Reserves and \nthe National Guard, together we call them the Reserve Components. For \nexample, 2,937 reservists are currently deployed world-wide on \noperational deployments; 1,000 reservists have supported Operation \nUphold Democracy in Haiti; 12,000 reservists have deployed to Bosnia; \nannually 20,000 reservists deploy to world-wide training sites. When we \nlook at these figures in light of the major missions the reserves have \nbeen involved in since Desert Storm to Operation Southern Watch , for \ninstance, reserve participation has gone up for some elements from a \nDesert Storm high of 33% to a high of 51% of the overall force deployed \nin later operations. To bring this point even closer to home, the \nPresident just called up two weeks ago 33,100 reservists for duties in \nsupport of the air operations over Kosovo and Serbia.\n  So, for those of us who find it imperative to provide our Armed \nForces with the resources that they need to carry out our Nation's \nincreasingly diverse military responsibilities, this means providing \nall of our components, Active, Reserve, and National Guard with the \nleadership structure that they need.\n  Mr. President, it would be my wish to tell you today that we could \ncount on the leadership of the Department of Defense to provide all of \nthe components of our Armed Forces with the resources they need, be it \nequipment, personnel, or training. Unfortunately, while the leadership \nmeans well, and I am sure is trying to do the right thing for each \ncomponent, in a number of areas at the end of the day the Active \nComponents are doing far better from a resourcing standpoint than are \nthe Reserve Components. This is because when the services sit down at \nthe table to allocate resources the cards are stacked, I am afraid, \nheavily in favor the active component missions and requirements.\n  How this happens can be attributed to the inequity of the rank those \nofficers who make the resource decisions at the senior levels. It is at \nthese levels that the Active Duty forces have an overwhelming advantage \nrank and in the power of the advocates who design the missions, provide \nand train the manpower, and who get establish the requirements for \nequipment and resources, as well as installations from which they \nproject combat power.\n  In the Armed Forces there is a very simple way to measure power, you \ncan count the senior officers--specifically the generals and admirals \nwho make the decisions for their components. In the Army there are a \ntotal of 307 general officers. In the Air Force the number is 282. When \ncompared to the 118 United States Army Reserve General Officers and the \n75 United States Air Force Reserve General Officers or the 195 Army \nNational Guard General Officers of whom only 92 have Federal \nRecognition there appears to be an inequity when it comes to the \nReserve Components. In the case of the Army, Air Force, Marine and Navy \nReserves, there are no four or three star positions. In the case of the \nNational Guard, the answer is one three star--- the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau who represents both the Army and the Air National \nGuard. This means that in the case of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarine Corps Reserves and the Army and Air Force National Guard, each \ncomponent's home team advocate is merely a two-star.\n\n  I do not choose the phase ``merely a two-star'' by accident. \n``Merely'' is an apt word when you are talking about the fight for \nresources in the Pentagon. When programming and budgeting decisions are \nmade within the services, the existing rank structure excludes the \nReserve chiefs from what I consider to be full participation in \ndeliberations, which are the realm of three-star participants. The \nReserve chiefs are relegated to the periphery and must rely on a \nhigher-ranking participant at the table to champion their cause. They \ncannot speak for themselves or their components unless asked. Now, this \nis wrong in my opinion and a classic example of how the Reserve chiefs \nare restricted from actively participating in the decision making \nprocess.\n  Furthermore, the two-star Reserve Component commanders exercise their \npreeminent authority over other senior commanders of their components \nwho also wear two stars. While the Reserve and Guard chiefs, by \nnecessity, have made this situation work, this arrangement is \nconsidered exceptional everywhere but in the Reserve Components.\n  Let me give you a compelling example of the inequity I am speaking of \nby looking closely at but one of our Reserve Components, the Army \nReserve: The Chief, Army Reserve, or the CAR as he is commonly known, \nis responsible for more than 20 percent of the Army's personnel. The \nsame applies for the Chief of the Navy Reserve. The CAR commands a \ntotal Army Reserve force of over a million soldiers. Of those soldiers \nover 415,000 are in the Ready Reserve and of those billets, nearly \n205,000 are in the ever more frequently deployed Selected Reserve. \nDon't let anybody use the outdated pejorative ``weekend warrior'' for \nthese citizen soldiers. Granted, when not deployed, they are not 24-\nhour-a-day troops. Nevertheless, the CAR also commands nearly 19,000 \nfull-time support personnel plus nearly 4,400 Department of the Army \nCivilians, or DA civilians. In contrast an Active Component four-star, \nyes, a four-star general in the field commands an average of 48,400 \ntroops plus DA civilians. An active component three-star general in the \nfield commands lesser number of troops, plus civilians, but only 3 \npercent of that commanded by the Chief, Army Reserve.\n  The Chief, Army Reserve, in the exercise of his preeminent authority \nover the other senior commanders of his component is also responsible \nfor evaluating 57 brigadier generals and 42 major generals. In contrast \nan active component four-star, yes, four-star general in the field is \nresponsible for evaluating an average of 31 brigadier generals and 10 \nmajor generals. An active component three-star general or admiral in \nthe field is responsible for evaluating an average of only 7 brigadier \ngenerals and only 2 major generals.\n\n  The Chief, Army Reserve has full responsibility for $3.5 billion of \nfiscal year 1999 appropriations--nearly triple that ($1.2 billion) of a \nthree-star general in the field and over 62% of that ($5.6 billion) of \na four-star general in the field.\n  Currently the Army National Guard provides 54 percent of the Army's \ncombat forces, 46 percent of the Combat Support capability, and about \none third of the Combat Service Support forces. Likewise, the Air \nNational Guard is a fully integrated partner in the Air Force providing \n49 percent of\n\n[[Page S6212]]\n\nthe theater airlift capability, 45 percent of the aerial tanker forces, \n34 percent of the fighters and 36 percent of the Air Rescue resources.\n  The Air Force Reserve, 74,000 strong, notably has been the second \nlargest major command in the USAF since it was elevated to that status \nin 1997. Only the Air Combat Command, with its 90,000 personnel is \nlarger, and, of the other eight major Air Force commands, seven are \ncommanded by 4-star generals. Only the smallest, the Special Operations \nCommand with fewer than 10,000 personnel, is commanded by a major \ngeneral. Prior to Desert Storm the Air Force Reserve had been involved \nin 10 contingencies. However, since the Gulf War, it has been involved \nin over 30 contingency, nation-building and peacekeeping operations. \nThe Air Force Reserve provides the Air Force 20 percent of its \ncapability. Air Force Reserve Command aircrews serve over 125 days a \nyear on average; support personnel serve over 60.\n  The Commander Naval Reserve serves in a billet that, in the past, \nactually was filled by a vice admiral and reports directly to the Chief \nof Naval Operations, which is not even typical for a Navy three-star \nadmiral. He is responsible for software development and acquisition for \nthe Navy's Manpower and Personnel information systems. The Naval \nReserve is responsible for: five percent of the Navy's total complement \nof ships and aircraft, 100 percent of intra-theater air logistics, 100 \npercent of the Navy's harbor surface and subsurface surveillance \nforces, 90 percent of the Navy's Expeditionary Logistics Support Force, \n47 percent of the Navy's combat search and rescue capability, and 35 \npercent of the Navy's total airborne ocean surveillance capability.\n  The Commander, Marine Force Reserve commands over 40,000 personnel \nand provides 20 percent of all U.S. ground divisions and 13 percent of \nall U.S. tactical air. The Marine Corps Reserve provides the Marine \nCorps the following: 100 percent of the adversary aircraft, 100 percent \nof the civil affairs groups, 50 percent of the theater missile defense, \n50 percent of the tanks, 40 percent of the force reconnaissance, 40 \npercent of the air refueling, and 30 percent of the artillery. We find \nsimilar core competencies in the Army Reserve where the USAR provides \n97% of Civil Affairs units, 81% of all psychological units, 100% of \nChemical Brigades, 75% of Chemical battalions; and 85% of all medical \nbrigades or roughly 47% of all Army Combat Service Support.\n  What are the implications for the Reserve Components?\n  Well, when reserve commanders, by virtue of their ranks, are \noutgunned so to speak by active counterparts, it means that the men and \nwomen in the Reserve Components, which are deploying with ever-\nincreasing frequency, might be deploying with less than the best \nresources because of the type of unit, where it fits in the equipping \nmatrix or the deployment matrix. I am gravely concerned that ALL TROOPS \nregardless of component receive the training they need before they \ndeploy. I am concerned you see because I was an Army reservist for 13 \nyears and understand what it means to be on the short end of things \nthey need like professional development training or speciality \ntraining.\n  Admittedly, in some cases there are valid reasons for these \ndisparities. In other cases there are not. What is clearly needed is a \nlevel playing field to ensure that the limited defense resources, \nwhether equipment, personnel, or training slots, are fairly \ndistributed.\n  Because the nation has come to depend to such a great extent on the \nreadiness of the Reserves and the National Guard, decisions taken \nwithin the Pentagon must be discussed, made and agreed to among \nindividuals more nearly alike in authority. To expect a two-star major \ngeneral to compete equally with three- and four-star generals is \nunrealistic. To not compete for funds on an equal basis is to guarantee \nthe component is under-capitalized for the mission it is asked to \nperform.\n  The need for three star ranks for the Reserve and Guard chiefs has \nbeen understood for years. In 1989, a study by General William \nRichardson recommended elevation of the Chief, Army Reserve to (four-\nstar) general. In 1992 the Hay Group, which reviewed all Reserve \nComponent general and flag officer billets, specifically recommended \nelevation of the Chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force Reserves and \nthe Directors of the Army and Air Force National Guard to three-star \nrank. In 1992, an independent commission chaired by General John Foss, \nUSA (Ret) recommended elevation of the CAR to lieutenant general. The \n1997 Defense Authorization Act directed the Secretary of Defense report \nto Congress not later than six months after enactment the recommended \ngrades for the Reserve and Guard chiefs. It is now May 1999 and we have \nyet to see the report called for in the 1997 statute. So, you can see \nmy point. We have waited patiently for DoD to send us a report \nupon which to make a full evaluation on general officer positions and \nit hasn't arrived. More deliberation and delay is sought. I say NO. It \nis time to take action--NOW.\n\n  This is why I am offering this command equity amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  My amendment will make the positions of the Chiefs of the Army, Navy, \nAir Force, and Marine Corps Reserve and the Directors of the Army and \nAir National Guard carry the three-star ranks. Each of them absolutely \nmust have it to ensure success and proper resources given the realities \nof today. Incumbents will be promoted and their successors will be \npromoted to three-star ranks upon confirmation by this body.\n  A valid argument can be made that the Army and Air Force already have \nall the three-star generals (45 and 37 respectively) that they need and \nwhile the active army, for instance, has reduced its overall general \nofficers from a 407 in 1991 to 307 in 1999 to correspond with changes \nin force structure and missions, the reserves conversely need these \ngrade increases to correspond with increases in assigned world-wide \nmissions, contingency deployments and need for greater share of \nresources.\n  Accordingly, my command equity amendment, while creating a few more \nthree star positions, does not exacerbate that situation by increasing \nthe overall numbers of senior officers in the Army or Air Force. This \nover abundance of high grade officers is not the case for the Navy and \nthe Marines, who are not now flush with senior grade billets; \ntherefore, my amendment does provide new billets that the Navy and \nMarines really would need.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased today that Chairman Warner, Senator \nLevin, and others who have been working on this bill have seen it \nfitting to agree and to accept as an amendment that there will be a \nseries of three-star ranks given to the Reserve Forces of the United \nStates. That is a critically important matter.\n  For a few minutes, I would like to explain why it is equitable and \nfair and why this will be an important step forward for the Reserves. I \nserved for 13 years in the Army Reserve. In the unit I served there was \na chief of staff. I remember getting out after 13 years and he remained \nin and was activated for 6 months for Desert Storm. Reservists all over \nAmerica, like those in the 11-84 transportational unit, are being \ndeployed; 33,000 have now been called up for the Kosovo activities.\n  In Desert Storm, in Kuwait, the Iraq war, 33 percent of the forces \ncommitted to that war were Reserves or National Guard. I am including \nNational Guard when I talk about the Reserve components. They play a \ncritical role. Yet, in our allocation of rank, they have not been \ntreated, in my opinion, fairly. It impacts on them when they seek to \nmake sure that the interests of the National Guard and Reserves are \nproperly taken care of. When the brass sits around the table and \ndecides how we are going to deal with the limited amount of resources \navailable, the Army Reserve, the Naval Reserve, the Air Force Reserve \nand the Marine Reserve--their officers sit there with just two stars. \nThey do not have the same level of clout that they would otherwise \nhave.\n  I would like to share a few things with you. I have some charts that \ndeal primarily with the United States Army Reserve, but the numbers are \nsimilar regarding the Navy, Air Force, and the National Guard units. \nThe Chief of the Army Reserve is now a two-star general. In the course \nof his duties, he is required to evaluate 57 brigadier generals. That \nis one star, and there are 42 major generals with two stars just like \nhimself. That is a responsibility he has,\n\n[[Page S6213]]\n\nwhereas in the Active Army a four-star general is only required to \nevaluate 31 brigadier generals, one star, and ten major generals, two \nstars.\n\n  This shows you what a four-star has responsibility for and what the \nChief of Army Reserve has. In the Active Army, a three-star general is \nresponsible for evaluating an average of just seven brigadier generals \nand two major generals, but he has a higher rank than the Chief of the \nArmy Reserve who has to rate 57 brigadiers and 42 major generals.\n  It strikes me that we have gone a little bit too far in containing \nthe rank available for the important position of Chief of Army Reserve.\n  The Chief of the Army Reserve also, for example, has full \nresponsibility for $3.372 billion in the fiscal year 1999 \nappropriations. That is nearly triple that of a field three-star \ngeneral, and over 62 percent, almost as much, as a four-star field \nactive-duty general. An active three-star general's prorated share of \nthe Active Army 1999 appropriations is a mere $1 million.\n  Let me show you this chart. I think it again adds some impact to what \nI am saying.\n  The General Chief of the Army Reserve commands over 1 million total \nArmy reserves. Those include those who are in retired status, subject \nto being recalled; the active reservists, which has 200,000; the ready \nreserves, which are subject to a more immediate callup; plus 18,000 FTS \npersonnel and nearly 4,300 civilian personnel; whereas a field Active \nArmy four-star commands an average of only 48,000 troops plus \ncivilians.\n  So you can begin to see the situation we are facing. I do not believe \nit reflects a proper balance.\n  Two years ago, the Appropriations Committee asked the Department of \nDefense to submit an analysis of this situation for improvement. That \nreport has not been received as requested.\n  It seems to me plainly obvious that we need at least three-star \ngenerals in charge of the Army Reserve and the Naval Reserve--a three-\nstar general for Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, and Air Force Reserve, \nMarine Reserve. There is one three-star general in the National Guard. \nBecause of their large size--they are bigger than any one of the other \ncomponents--we believe they need two three-star generals. With that, I \nbelieve we will have a more appropriate balance in the leadership and \nrank in our Defense Department.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to speak in support \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our colleague. He is a very \nvaluable member of the committee.\n  I was privileged to be in the Pentagon when Secretary Melvin Laird \ndevised the total force concept, which means the United States of \nAmerica looks to its national security in terms of not only the Active \nForces but the Reserve and the Guard. That was the turning point, a \nrecognition for those men and women who so proudly and in a great deal \nof sacrifice in terms of their private lives--because they have to \nbalance a full-time job in most instances together with Reserve and \nGuard commitments requiring them very often to forgo their vacations--\ncontribute that time to their desired slots in the Reserve and the \nGuard.\n  Therefore, I strongly support this amendment.\n  I want to clarify one thing. This does not add any more numbers of \ngeneral or flag officers to the total number now in the Pentagon. The \nnumbers that will be used for these promotions are to be drawn from a \nnumber within the ranks of each of the departments of the military.\n  Am I not correct on that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. In fact, there are 45, now, three-star \ngenerals in the Army. This would only involve two of those.\n  Mr. WARNER. Just by way of quick anecdote, when I was Secretary of \nNavy, I felt so strongly about the Naval Reserve that I promoted the \nthen two-star admiral to the grade of three, and he served in that \ngrade throughout my tenure. The day after I left the Department, the \nthird star disappeared, and it never reappeared again until this moment \nwhen we agree to this amendment. I hope it will become law.\n  I commend the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 477\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I call up amendment No. 477.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This amendment requires that the President and the Department of \nDefense come forward and report on the missions we have throughout the \nworld.\n  One thing that has become very clear to me as I have visited with our \ntroops--whether it is in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, whether it is in \nBosnia or in Albania just 2 weeks ago--is that our troops are \noverdeployed.\n  Secretary Bill Cohen said in testimony just last week to the Defense \nAppropriations Committee that we have either too few people or too many \nmissions. The fact is that this is beginning to show the wear and tear \non our military. Between 1986 and 1998, the number of American military \ndeployments per year nearly tripled at the same time that the \nDepartment of Defense budget was reduced by 38 percent. There is no \nquestion that our military is stretched. No one disagrees with that.\n  The Department of Defense is asking for help. Congress realizes that \nthis is a problem and has continually tried to increase the military \nspending, including pay raises for our military to give them more \nchances to live a quality of life. But the fact is that we have to do \nsomething about either overdeployment or too few numbers. In fact, our \npresent military strategy is to deter and defeat large-scale cross-\nborder aggression in two distant theaters in an overlapping timeframe.\n  We have the deterrence of Iraq and Iran in southwest Asia and the \ndeterrence of North Korea in northeast Asia. That represents two such \npotentially large-scale cross-border theater requirements. In addition \nto that, we have 120,000 troops permanently assigned to those theaters \nand 70,000 in addition to that assigned to non-NATO, nonspecific-threat \nforeign countries. The United States has more than 6,000 in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina and many others around the world. What we need to do is to \nstart to prioritize where our missions are and where American troops \nshould be deployed.\n  On May 27 of this year, the Secretary of the Air Force announced a \nstop-loss program that places a temporary hold on transfers, \nseparation, and retirement from the Air Force. This is a decision that \nis normally reserved for wartime or severe conflicts. And, yet, we now \nhave in place that no one can separate from the Air Force.\n  My amendment says it is the sense of Congress that the readiness of \nour U.S. military forces to execute the national security strategy is \nbeing eroded from a combination of declining defense budgets and \nexpanded mission. It says to the President that we must have a report \nthat prioritizes ongoing global missions, that the President shall \ninclude a report on the feasibility and analysis of how the United \nStates can shift resources from low-priority missions in support of \nhigh-priority missions, and consolidate the use of U.S. troop \ncommitments worldwide, and end low-priority missions. This is a report \nthat the President would make through the Department of Defense to \nprioritize these missions.\n  I believe the Department of Defense has been looking for this type of \nopportunity to prioritize and to say we are going to look at the wear \nand tear on our military and we are going to have to make some final \ndecisions.\n  I think when we get this report we will be able to see if, in fact, \nwe need more military and we need to ``ramp up'' the military force \nstrength in our country or whether we can prioritize the overseas \nmissions and stop the overdeployment and the mission fatigue that so \nmany of our military people have.\n  I am very pleased to offer this amendment. I think it is a step in \nthe right direction. It is a positive step toward relieving our very \nstretched military. Certainly, as we are watching events unfold in \nKosovo and we are seeing more and more of our military being called up, \nI think it is time for\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\nMembers to assess everywhere we are in the world and ask the President \nto prioritize those. Then Congress can work with the President to \ndetermine if we need to ramp up our military force structure or ramp \ndown the number of deployments that we have around the world.\n  I ask that the amendment be agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend the Senator from Texas. This is a very \nimportant amendment. I am a cosponsor. I believe it is acceptable on \nthis side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment is acceptable here. It \nperforms a useful purpose. The Defense Department has in the past given \nthe Senate these lists, but this updates it and gives us a little more \ndetail. I think it is very important we know all of our missions and \nhow many people are involved around the world.\n  We have no objection to it at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The question is on agreeing \nto the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 477) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that we return to the amendment \nnumbered 446. I also ask unanimous consent that the two-speech rule not \napply to the remarks about which I am about to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 446\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the country established the independence of \nthe weapons laboratory directors for a reason. We are lucky to have had \nthe weapons laboratories that have been such an important, integral \npart of this country. They are one of the main reasons the cold war \nended. They have been established independently so that the President \nand the Congress could expect independent and objective reporting of \nthe directors' honest judgment regarding assessment of the safety and \nreliability of nuclear weapon stockpile. We are talking about thousands \nof nuclear warheads.\n  The problem in the world today is the fact that we have too many \nnuclear warheads, but those that we have must be maintained to be safe \nand reliable. It is a responsibility of our weapon laboratories to make \nsure that, in fact, is the case.\n  This amendment, No. 446, strips our laboratory directors of this \nindependent objective status. The amendment makes the laboratory \ndirectors directly subject to the supervision and direction of the \nadministration.\n  What this means, in very direct language, is that we will get the \nopinion of the administration regarding stockpile safety and \nreliability--not the lab director's expertise and, therefore, their \nopinion. They will say what the President tells them to say, what the \nadministration tells them to say--not what their scientists and \nengineers tell them is appropriate with these weapons of mass \ndestruction. There will no longer be any reason to believe that \nstockpile assessments are founded on scientific and technical fact.\n  If this amendment comes to be we should just declare the stockpile \nadequate and simply not bother evaluating it for safety and \nreliability. This would be a tragedy not only for this country but the \nworld.\n  That is the reason that the Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, \nwrote a letter yesterday to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Virginia. He said, among other \nthings in this letter, ``The proposal would effectively cancel my 6-\nmonth effort to strengthen security at the Department in the wake of \nthe Chinese espionage issue,'' and he goes on to say if this proposal \nis adopted by the Congress, ``I will recommend to the President he veto \nthe defense authorization bill.''\n  This has gone a step further, separate and apart from the letter--the \nPresident will veto this bill if this language is in the bill.\n  This proposal would reverse reforms in the Department of Energy. \nAccording to the Secretary of Energy, still referring to this letter to \nChairman Warner:\n\n       This proposal would reverse reforms in the Department of \n     Energy going back to the Bush Administration by placing \n     oversight responsibilities within defense programs. A program \n     would be in charge of its own security oversight, its own \n     health oversight and its own safety oversight.\n\n  He says the fox will, in fact, be guarding the chicken coop.\n  Secretary Richardson says in the final paragraph of this letter:\n\n       In short, the security mission cuts across the entire \n     Department, not just defense programs facilities. We need a \n     structure that gives this important function proper \n     visibility and focus and provides the means to hold the \n     appropriate line manager responsible.\n  The Secretary of Energy is a person who served in the Congress of the \nUnited States for about 16 years, who served as the Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations, who has been involved in some of the most responsible \nand sensitive negotiations in the last 10 years that have taken place \nin this country, traveling all over the world, working to free \nhostages, and doing other things upon the recommendation and under the \nauspices of the President.\n  We are told that this bill, in effect, is going nowhere if this \namendment is in there.\n  Why? This isn't the way to legislate. The legislative process is an \norderly process, or should be an orderly process. If there is a bill \nthat is to be heard, there should be hearings held on that bill, \nespecially one as sensitive as this that deals with the nuclear \nstockpile of the United States. We have had no hearings. There are \nmultiple committees that have jurisdiction. We know that the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee has jurisdiction. We know the Armed \nServices Committee has jurisdiction.\n  The Cox-Dicks report--which was a bipartisan report and we should \ntreat it as such--said the problems with the laboratories as far as the \nespionage problems go back at least three administrations. Secretary \nRichardson has reported this past week that 85 percent of the report's \nrecommendations are already adopted or in the process of being adopted \nand, in fact, the report was one that most everyone agrees did a good \njob. Congressman Cox and Congressman Dicks did a good job.\n  I don't think it is appropriate that we go charging forth for \npolitical reasons to attempt to embarrass the administration or to \nembarrass Secretary Richardson. This deals with the most sensitive \nmilitary resources we have--management of nuclear weapons. To change \nhow that takes place, while keeping them safe and reliable, in an \namendment being discussed in the few hours prior to a congressional \nrecess, is not the way to go, especially when there have been no \ncongressional hearings. This committee deserves to take a look at \ncalling witnesses.\n  In short, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. As I have \nsaid earlier today, this amendment is not going to go away. This deals \nwith the security of this Nation. When I finish speaking, there are \nother Senators wishing to speak. I see the junior Senator from New \nMexico who is going to speak, the senior Senator from Illinois said he \nwill speak, we will have Senator Boxer from California speak. It will \ntake a considerable period of time before enough is said about this \namendment.\n  If adopted, this amendment would make the most sweeping changes in \nthe Department structure and management since the Department's creation \nin 1977. This amendment fundamentally overturns the most basic \norganizational decisions made about the Department when it was created. \nIt does it without any congressional hearings, without any oversight \nhearings, without any investigations having taken place. These changes \nwill result in long-term damage to the Department of Energy. The \ndefense National Laboratories will be tremendously compromised as \nscientific institutions.\n  The weapons laboratories have always been held out as being \nscientific institutions, not political institutions. Those who deal \nwith these laboratories--and I had the good fortune the last 3 years to \nbe the ranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee that \nappropriates money for these laboratories--I have found the people that \nwork in these laboratories to be some of the most nonpolitical people I \nhave ever dealt with in my entire political\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\ncareer. They are not involved in politics. They are involved in \nscience. We shouldn't change that.\n  Today, their work--that is, the work of the National Laboratories on \nnational security--is underpinned by scientific excellence, in a wide \nrange of civilian programs that sustained needed core competency at the \nlaboratories.\n\n  This amendment, No. 446, will result in the Department of Energy's \ndefense-related laboratories losing their multipurpose character to the \ndetriment of the laboratories themselves as scientific institutions and \nto the detriment of their ability to respond to defense needs.\n  This change reverses management improvements made at DOE by a series \nof Secretaries of Energy under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. These improvements were made after careful \nconsideration and review by these Secretaries. They looked at the \nmanagement deficiencies they encountered during their tenures. There \nwere hearings held in the Congress before the rightful committees, and \ndecisions were made as to what changes the Secretaries recommended \nshould be made in permanent law. That is how we should do things. That \nis not how we are doing things with this bill.\n  These improvements made part of the law have been made by careful \nreview by the Secretaries of the management deficiencies they \nencountered during their tenures. This amendment re-creates \ndysfunctional management relationships at the Department of Energy that \nhave proven in the past not to work. I repeat, these sweeping changes \nare being proposed on the floor of the Senate without any input from \nthe committees of jurisdiction over general department management--that \nis, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, or the committee \nwith specific jurisdiction over atomic energy defense activities--this \ncommittee, the Committee on Armed Services.\n  The two managers of this bill have worked very, very hard. As I said \nthe other day, on Monday evening, I do not know of two more competent \nmanagers we could have for a piece of legislation. They have dedicated \ntheir lives to Government. They have dedicated much of their adult \nlives to making sure the United States is safe and secure. They have \nworked very hard to have a bill that should be completed today, a very \nimportant bill dealing with the armed services of the United States. We \nshould not let this stand in its way. We should not have a bill that \ncomes out of here that is vetoed. We do not need this information in \nthe bill.\n  To this point, this bill has been proceeding forward on a bipartisan \nbasis. This is the way legislation should move forward. We have been \nworking on this bill for a few short days. In the past, it has taken as \nmany as 14 days of floor activity to complete this legislation. These \ntwo very competent managers are completing this bill, if we get rid of \nthis, completing this bill in 4 days. We should go forward.\n  There are so many important things in this bill that need to be \ncompleted that we should do that. If my friends on the other side--my \nfriends, the Senator from Arizona and the senior Senator from New \nMexico--if they really think there are problems in this regard I will \nwork with them. I will work from my position as the ranking member of \nthe Energy and Water Subcommittee. I will do whatever I can to make \nsure, if they believe a bill needs to come forward on the floor dealing \nwith these things, we would not object to a motion to proceed, that \nthey could bring this bill forward on the floor. We do not want to hold \nup this bill. But the bill is being held up, not because of anything we \nare doing on this side but because of this mischievous legislation.\n  I say to my two friends, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico--who are not on the floor; they are two Senators for \nwhom I have the greatest respect--this is not the way to proceed on \nthis. No matter how strongly they feel about what went on with the \nChinese espionage, whatever the reasons might be, let's work together \nand see if, in fact, after we go through the normal legislative \nprocess, with hearings, with committees of jurisdiction, that their \nmethod is the way to proceed. Certainly, we are not going to proceed on \nan afternoon with a bill of this importance, without, I repeat, \ncommittee hearings and the other things that go into good legislation.\n\n  These sweeping changes are being proposed with no supporting \nanalysis, no public record. Indeed, the changes to be made fly in the \nface of past recommendations made by distinguished experts and past \nreports of congressional hearings on the subject--DOE Organization, \nReorganization and Management.\n  These changes are firmly opposed, and that is an understatement, by \nthe administration, and I think we should pull this amendment so we can \ngo forward with this bill. The absurdity of this amendment is even more \nstriking when you see who the senior management officials in the \nDepartment of Energy are at this time. Think of this. The current Under \nSecretary of Energy is Dr. Ernest Moniz, who, if not the top nuclear \nphysicist in the country is one of the top nuclear physicists in the \nwhole country. This man is the former chairman of the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology's physics department--the most prestigious, \nfamous institution of science in this country, especially their physics \ndepartment.\n  Under this amendment, Secretary Moniz would be forbidden by law from \nhelping Secretary Richardson, whose office is 40 feet away, manage and \ndirect this program. He could not exercise any role in the management \nof the Department's nuclear weapons research and development. Is this a \ncrazy result? The answer is, obviously, yes, it is a crazy result.\n  The safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile is absolutely \ncritical to our national security and to the U.S. policy and strategy \nfor international peace and nonproliferation. My friend from New \nMexico, the junior Senator from New Mexico, is going to talk about why \nthis amendment substantively is so bad. I want to talk more about \nprocedurally why it is so bad. I have tried to lay that out. It is \nprocedurally bad because we should not be here today talking about this \nas we are now. There should be a bill introduced, referral to committee \nor committees and a committee hearing or hearings with people coming \nforward to talk about this issue.\n  This is not whether we are going to change the way boxing matches are \nheld in this country or how much money we are going to give to highways \nin this country. This deals with approximately 6,000 nuclear warheads, \nany one of which, as a weapon of mass destruction, would cause untold \ndamage to both people and property. So this is not how we should \nproceed on this legislation. We should proceed on this legislation in \nan orderly fashion.\n  I say to my friends, the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from \nArizona, if they are right--which I certainly do not think they are--\nbut if they are right, then let's have this legislation in the openness \nof a legislative hearing, the openness of the legislative process.\n  This amendment No. 446 causes us to be in the midst of protracted \ndebate when we should be trying to complete this most important \nlegislation.\n  We are in the midst of a major change in the way we ensure this \ncritical stockpile safety and reliability because we can no longer \ndemonstrate weapons performance with nuclear tests.\n  We have had approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons tests in the State of \nNevada--approximately 1,000. Some of these tests were set off in the \natmosphere. We did not know, at the time, the devastation these nuclear \ndevices would cause, not to the area where the devices were detonated, \nbut what happened with the winds blowing radioactive fallout into \nsouthern Utah, creating the highest rates of cancer anyplace in the \nUnited States as a result.\n  I would awaken in the mornings as a little boy and watch the tests, \nwatch the detonation, and see that orange flash in the sky. It was a \nlong way from where I was, but not so far that you could not see this \norange ball, over 100 miles away or more, that would light up the \nmorning sky. It was not far enough away that you could not hear the \nnoise. Still, we were very fortunate in that the wind did not blow \ntoward Searchlight, my hometown; it blew the other way.\n  We have set off over 1,000 of these nuclear weapons in the air, \nunderground, in tunnels, shafts. We cannot do that anymore. We cannot \ndo it because there has been an agreement made saying we are no longer \ngoing to test in\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\nthat manner. We have to manage our nuclear stockpile using science and \ncomputer simulation instead of nuclear testing. This is a terribly, \nterribly complex job. The greatest minds in the world are trying to \nfigure out how they can understand these weapons of mass destruction to \nmake sure they are safe and reliable.\n  It needs all of our attention and energy because we must demonstrate \nwith high confidence that this job can be done without returning to \nnuclear testing. We have not proven that the stockpile can be \nmaintained without nuclear testing, but we are doing everything we can \nto succeed.\n  We have developed a program called subcritical testing. What does \nthat mean? It means that components of a nuclear device are tested in a \nhigh explosive detonation. The fact is, the components cannot develop \ninto a critical mass, necessary for a nuclear detonation. It is \nsubcritical. As a result of computerization, they are able to determine \nwhat would have happened had the tests become critical. We are working \non that. We think it works, but there is a lot more we need to do. We \nneed, for example, to develop computers that are 100 times faster than \nthe ones now in existence. Some say, we need computers 1,000 times \nfaster than the ones now in existence to ensure these nuclear weapons, \nnuclear devices, are safe and reliable.\n  This tremendously demanding job is made even more difficult by all \nthe other problems with managing the nuclear stockpile. For example, we \nhave to clean up the legacy of the cold war at our production \nfacilities. We are spending billions of dollars every year doing that. \nWe need to develop the facilities and skills for stockpile stewardship. \nWe need to maintain an enduring, skilled workforce.\n  The people who worked in this nuclear testing for so long are an \naging population. We have to make sure we have people who have the \nexpertise and the ability to continue ensuring that these weapons are \nsafe and reliable. We need to provide the special nuclear materials for \nthe stockpile, because the material that makes up a nuclear weapon does \nnot last forever. Tritium, for example, has a life expectancy in a \nweapon of maybe 12 years. Weapons have to be continually monitored to \ndetermine if they are safe and reliable.\n  All these things are complicated by the discovery that some of our \nmost closely guarded nuclear secrets about our stockpile have been \ncompromised over the past 20 years. That makes it even more difficult \nand makes it even more important that we proceed to ensure that in the \nfuture our nuclear stockpile is safe, that it is not seen by eyes that \nshould not see the secrets that go into our nuclear stockpile. We \nshould not be determining the afternoon before the Memorial Day recess \nhow we are going to do that.\n\n  Secretary Richardson is one of the most open, available Secretaries \nwith whom I have dealt in my 17 years. He is open to the majority; he \nis open to the minority. We should not do this to him. He is a \ndedicated public servant. We need to concentrate on the most important \nthings right now, not later.\n  I do not think an ill-conceived administrative change--and that is \nwhat it is; we are legislating administrative changes in the way that \nthis most important, difficult job is being managed --is the most \nimportant thing we can do right now. Clearly, it is not. We have far \nmore pressing matters to attend to in the nuclear stockpile.\n  We talk about the stockpile, but it is a nuclear stockpile. It is \nsomething we have to maintain closely, carefully, to make sure it is \nsafe and reliable. We need to improve our computational capability; I \nsaid by 100, others say by 1,000 or more, beyond the advances we have \nalready made. That is where we need to direct our attention. We need to \ndevelop new simulation computer programs that will make effective use \nof these higher performance machines.\n  I have been in the tunnels where these subcritical tests are \nconducted. I have been in the tunnels where the critical tests were \nconducted. We need to continue, I repeat, making sure these weapons of \nmass destruction are safe and reliable.\n  We need to design, as I say, advanced experimental facilities to \nprovide the data for this advanced simulation capability.\n  We need to hire and train the next generation of weapons physicists \nand technicians before our experienced workforce really withers away.\n  We have to continue the training of these individuals, not only \ncontinue the training but have work for them to do, which we will \nsurely do.\n  We need to establish better and more effective controls in how we do \nthese jobs to ensure no further environmental contamination at our \nworking sites. Hanford, that is an environmental disaster; Savannah \nRiver, environmental disaster. We cannot let that take place anymore.\n  We should be directing our attention to those efforts, not \nlegislating on a bill that we should have completed by now. We could \nhave completed this bill, and I think we will if we can figure out some \nway to get rid of this amendment.\n  We need to establish better and more effective controls in how we do \nthose jobs, making sure we do not have Savannah Rivers or Hanford, WA, \nsites where we are spending billions upon billions of dollars to make \nthose places environmentally sensitive and clean.\n  Just as important--maybe more important--we need to implement \neffective security measures that will protect our secrets without \nunnecessary interference in this very important work. Whatever we do in \nthis terribly important job, we need to do it right.\n  There is neither the time nor the money to make mistakes. This \nproposed change in management of the nuclear weapons program is not the \nright thing to do right now. I feel fairly confident, having spent \nconsiderable time speaking to Secretary Richardson, that he is really \ndedicated to doing the right thing. He does not want to remedy the \nproblems in the weapons labs with our weapons systems in a Democratic \nfashion--I am talking in the form of a party--or a Republican fashion. \nHe wants to do it in a bipartisan fashion.\n  This amendment No. 446 would make the most sweeping changes in the \nDepartment of Energy structure and management since its creation in \n1977. These drastic changes would be made with no consideration or \nsuggestions, I repeat, by the committee of jurisdiction. They would be \nmade with no consideration or suggestions by the committee that has \ngeneral management jurisdiction; that is, the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources; or the committee that has jurisdiction over atomic \nenergy defense activities, the Armed Services Committee.\n  There have been no hearings and testimony by proponents and opponents \nof a change, and not just this proposed change, but other proposed \nchanges as well.\n  These jurisdictional considerations and testimony by credible \nwitnesses are mandatory for such a change, because what is being \nproposed is not obviously better than the present program management \nframework.\n  I want to take this opportunity to compliment the Secretary of \nEnergy--with whom I came to Congress in the same year--for his \nenergetic response to the problems that have come to light since he \nassumed his responsibilities. I think his public and private statements \nregarding the possible compromise by the Chinese or others have been \noutstanding. I think he has done extremely well. No Secretary in my \nmemory has taken such forthright and aggressive actions to remedy \nproblems in this most complex and, I repeat, important Department. He \nis searching out the Department's problems. He is doing everything he \ncan to correct these deficiencies.\n  Let's give him a chance to succeed. I am confident he will. I know \nthe Secretary has an outstanding relationship with one of the authors \nof this legislation, the senior Senator from New Mexico. Secretary \nRichardson is from New Mexico. He served in Congress for many years \nfrom New Mexico. He has a good working relation with the junior Senator \nfrom New Mexico and, frankly, with most everyone in this body. Let's \ngive him a chance to be successful.\n  This amendment has not been given, I believe, enough thought. There \nare obvious deficiencies in this proposal. Damage to our weapons \nlaboratories' capabilities would surely occur under the terms of this \namendment. The National Weapons Laboratories are truly multiprogram \nlaboratories, providing their skills and facilities, unmatched anywhere \nin the world.\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\n  We talk about how proud we are of our National Institutes of Health, \nand we should be, because it does the finest medical research that has \never been done in the history of the world. That is going on as we \nspeak. But likewise, the National Laboratories are truly unmatched \nanywhere in the world for the solution of critical defense and \nnondefense problems as well.\n  We think of the Laboratories as only working with nuclear weapons. \nBut the genome research was started in one of our National \nLaboratories. Many, many things that are now being developed and worked \non in the private sector were originally developed with our National \nLaboratories.\n  Enactment of this amendment would isolate these multiprogram national \nassets, making their contributions to other than defense work very \ndifficult, if not impossible. This isolation would reduce and erode the \ntechnical scope and skills within the weapons laboratories, and that \nmight result in missing an important national defense opportunity.\n\n  I am absolutely confident that the directors of the weapons labs will \ntestify to the enormous defense benefits that accompany the opportunity \nto attack important nondefense problems. I repeat that. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that the directors of the National Laboratories would \ntestify privately or publicly to the enormous defense benefits that \naccompany the opportunity they have had in the past and continue to \nhave to attack important nondefense problems. That opportunity exists \nbecause the weapons program is not isolated within the Department, as \nit would be in this amendment.\n  There is a critical need to rebuild our confidence that necessary \nwork can be done in a secure way and within a secure environment. I am \nvery uncomfortable with placing the management of security in a \nposition where it might compete with the management of the technical \nprogram. That critical function needs to exist independently of the \nprogram function so that these two equally important matters can be \nmanaged without conflict.\n  This amendment would require unnecessary duplication and redundancy \nof activities in the Department of Energy. Security of nuclear \nmaterials and information is necessary for activities that would not be \nincluded in the administration proposed by this amendment. This would \nrequire separate security organizations to undertake the same and other \nvery similar functions. There is not enough money to allow this kind of \ninefficiency to creep into the weapons program.\n  The Secretary of Energy and the President of the United States oppose \nthis amendment. The President promises to veto the defense \nauthorization bill if it is included in the bill. I personally oppose \nthis proposal for the reasons I have mentioned, and many other reasons \nthat at the right time I will be happy to discuss.\n  I have worked with the senior Senator from New Mexico now for 3 years \nas ranking member, and many other years as a member of his \nsubcommittee. I just think there is a better way to do this. I know of \nthe time and effort he has spent with the National Laboratories. I \nbelieve this amendment compromises the National Laboratories.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment or to vote for \nthe motion to table, which I am sure will precede an opportunity to \nvote on this ill-conceived and untimely measure.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks \nnot count against the two-speech rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first just say that I have had a \nchance now to read the amendment. We received it at about 1:15, about \n10 minutes into the description of the amendment by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  I have had that chance to read it. It is really three separate \nprovisions. I just want to briefly point out that two of them are \ntotally acceptable to this Senator, at least as I see it.\n  The first, of course, would put into statute the provision \nestablishing an Office of Counterintelligence in the Department of \nEnergy. This is something which was done as a result of Presidential \nDecision Directive 61 in February of 1998. It is something which the \nprevious Secretary of Energy has done administratively. This Secretary \nhas carried through on that. Clearly, this is a good thing to do, and \nputting it in statutory form is also helpful.\n  So I have no problem with that part of the amendment at all. I would \nsupport that. In fact, I point out that those provisions, with very few \nchanges, are in the underlying bill. But I can certainly agree to \nwhatever changes the authors of this amendment would like to see in \nthat section.\n  The second part of the three parts in this bill is establishing the \nOffice of Intelligence. Again, I believe this is totally appropriate. \nAgain, this is something that the administration has already done \nadministratively, but clearly there can be a good argument made that we \nshould put this in statute. I have no problem with that. Again, the \nunderlying bill which we are considering has in it the establishment of \nthe Office of Intelligence. So if this version of that legislative \nprovision has some improvements in it, that certainly is appropriate. I \ndo not oppose that.\n  The third part of the amendment is the part which I find very \nobjectionable. Let me use the rest of my time to just describe the \nnature of my concern about the rest of it.\n  The third part of the amendment is the part designated ``Nuclear \nSecurity Administration.'' This sets up a totally new organizational \nstructure within the Department of Energy which is, as my good friend \nand colleague from Nevada said, by far the most far-reaching \nreorganization of the Department of Energy since that Department was \ncreated 22 years ago in 1977.\n  The reasons I object to this provision, as it now stands, are \nseveral. Let me start by saying that I object to it because of the \nprocedure we followed in getting to where we are today. This is an \nimportant proposal. It has far-reaching ramifications. Much of what we \ndo here in the Senate is impacted by the law of unintended \nconsequences, and this is a prime example of something that is going to \nproduce substantial unintended consequences, in my opinion.\n\n  We have had many studies about the problems in the Department of \nEnergy. Some of those have been very useful. None of those studies have \nsuggested that we solve the problems with this solution.\n  The last time we had a hearing on the problems of organization in the \nDepartment of Energy was in September of 1996. That was nearly 3 years \nago. I sit on the committee, as does my colleague from New Mexico, as \ndo many of us involved in this discussion, I sit on the committee that \nhas jurisdiction over this Department, the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. In that committee, we have had a great many hearings on the \nChinese espionage problem. We have had six hearings in that committee \nalone. We have had one joint hearing with the Armed Services Committee, \nwhich I also sit on. That is seven hearings.\n  In none of those hearings have we considered any of this set of \nrecommendations. In none of those hearings have we asked the Secretary \nof Energy to come forward and explain what changes he thinks might be \nappropriate or whether or not these kinds of proposals might be \nappropriate as a way to fix the problem.\n  My friend, the Senator from Arizona, said it would be a derogation of \nour duty if we didn't go ahead and pass this this afternoon. I say it \nis almost a derogation of our duty if we do pass it this afternoon, \nbecause we will not have given the administration a chance to react. We \nwill not have given the administration a chance to explain why they \noppose this. I think that is the only reasonable course to follow.\n  Another suggestion was made by my colleague from Arizona that \nalthough Secretary Richardson had objected to an earlier draft, he was \nfairly confident that those problems had been resolved in the latest \nbill, which is the one we received at 1:15.\n  I have in my hand here--I will ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record--a letter from Secretary Richardson just received \na few minutes ago in which he says:\n\n       I have reviewed the latest version of the amendment being \n     offered by Senator Domenici to the Defense Authorization \n     bill. I am still deeply concerned that it moves the \n     Department of Energy and its effort to improve\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\n     security in the wrong direction. I remain firmly opposed to \n     the amendment, and I want to reiterate my intention to \n     recommend to the President that he veto the Defense \n     Authorization bill if this proposal is adopted by the \n     Congress.\n\n  He goes on to explain in more detail why that is his view.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I have reviewed the latest version \n     of the amendment being offered by Senator Domenici to the \n     defense authorization bill. I am still deeply concerned that \n     it moves the Department of Energy and its effort to improve \n     security in the wrong direction. I remain firmly opposed to \n     the amendment and want to reiterate my intention to recommend \n     to the President that he veto the defense authorization bill \n     if this proposal is adopted by the Congress.\n       As I stated in my letter of May 25, 1999, our security \n     program deserves a senior departmental advocate, with no \n     missions ``conflict of interest'' to focus full time on the \n     security mission. The requirements of the security program \n     should not compete with other programmatic priorities in \n     Defense Programs for the time and attention of the senior \n     management of that program, as well as for budgetary \n     resources. Resource competition has been a core problem of \n     Department of Energy security for decades, and we have seen \n     firsthand that inherent conflicts arise and security suffers \n     when the office that must devote resources to the security \n     mission has a competing primary mission, such as Stockpile \n     Stewardship. It is critical that we have a separate office \n     setting security policy and requirements in order to avoid \n     financial and other pressures from limiting security \n     requirements and operations.\n       Also, it is important to recognize that the Environmental \n     Management Program has significant security responsibilities \n     for securing large quantities of nuclear weapons materials at \n     its sites--Rocky Flats, Hanford, and Savannah River. Under \n     this proposal, if the security function were exclusively \n     located in Defense Programs, it would undermine my ability to \n     hold my top line manager for the clean-up sites accountable.\n       In short, the security mission cuts across the entire \n     department, not just Defense Programs facilities. We need a \n     structure that gives this important function proper \n     visibility and focus and provides the means to hold the \n     appropriate line managers responsible.\n       I appreciate your attention to this serious matter.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                  Bill Richardson.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So procedurally, we should not be here on a Thursday \nafternoon, where the very distinguished manager of the bill, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, has said we need to finish \nthis bill in the next hour and a half. We need to leave town. Everyone \nhas their plane reservations. We have to fly out. And by the way, \nbefore we leave, let's reorganize the Department of Energy.\n  This is not a responsible way for us to proceed. Accordingly, I do \nobject to the procedure.\n  Let me talk about the substance. My friend from Arizona, who is a \nprime sponsor on the bill, described the bill fairly accurately when he \nsaid, this bill, this provision, the third part of the amendment that I \nhave said is objectionable, the establishment of this Nuclear Security \nAdministration, says this bill creates a stovepipe. That is his exact \nquote. I agree that that is what happens.\n  Let me use this chart beside me here to describe very briefly how the \nDepartment of Energy functions now.\n  The Secretary of Energy is in charge of the Department of Energy. \nThere are, under the Secretary, various subdepartments. We have defense \nprograms. We have environmental management, energy efficiency, nuclear \nnonproliferation, fossil energy and science.\n  With regard to each of those, the Secretary has established--and much \nof this has been done by Secretary Richardson in the 6 months he has \nbeen there--some crosscutting responsibilities. Some people with \ncrosscutting responsibilities are directly answerable to the Secretary. \nOne is the director of counterintelligence. This was a major step \nforward, and I think everybody who sat through these hearings would \nacknowledge that this was a major step forward. This was one of the \nactions that was taken, really, by Secretary Richardson's predecessor, \nwhen Ed Curran, who is the gentleman who has been put in the Office of \nDirector of Counterintelligence, was hired. This was in April of 1998.\n  That individual, the director of counterintelligence, under the \nadministrative procedure now in place, and under the provisions of this \nbill, has crosscutting responsibility for counterintelligence in each \nof the parts of the Department of Energy; in fact, in each laboratory. \nMr. Curran has testified to various of the committees up here that he \nwill have a person who is responsible to him and who has authority by \nvirtue of his position to demand certain actions on the issue of \ncounterintelligence in each of our National Laboratories. That is as it \nshould be. That is putting accountability into the counterintelligence \nsystem. It is a good step forward. That is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  A second crosscutting responsibility is the security czar on security \npolicy. A third is this independent Safety and Security Oversight \nOffice that Secretary Richardson has established.\n  So at the present time there are those three entities that report \ndirectly to the Secretary of Energy on these issues related to \nsecurity.\n  These are the reforms that Secretary Richardson has been trying to \nput into place. These are the reforms that are called for under \nPresidential Decision Directive-61, and then additional administrative \nsteps that have been taken by this Secretary of Energy. I believe the \nsystem is structured in a way that makes some sense.\n  Let me now show the stovepipe organizational chart, because we have \none of those as well. This, as Senator Kyl indicated, is a major \nchange, this third part; the establishment of this Nuclear Security \nAdministration is a major change in the way the Department operates.\n  What essentially is done is you eliminate the defense programs \nportion of the Department of Energy and you rename that the ``Nuclear \nSecurity Administration.'' You put that in the so-called stovepipe. You \nsay there will be no independent counterintelligence authority over how \nthat agency functions. There will be no independent security oversight \nover how that agency, that independent agency or administration \nfunctions. There will be no environmental oversight, through the \nDepartment, on that. And there will be no oversight regarding health \nand safety factors relating to workers.\n  Under that we put all of the facilities that relate to nuclear \nweapons. One reason why I am particularly concerned, frankly, about \nthis, is that the two National Laboratories in my State would be in \nthis stovepipe. I do not know that that is good for them long term. I \nhave great doubts that that is good for them long term. I really do \nhave doubts as to whether that is a wise course for us to follow.\n  One problem--and I think the Senator from Nevada referred to this--is \nthat under this new arrangement, it makes it very clear with very \nspecific language here; it says the administrator of this new stovepipe \nagency, who shall report directly to and shall be accountable directly \nto the Secretary, ``the secretary may not delegate to any department \nofficial the duty to supervise the administrator.''\n  Presumably, what that means is that Secretary Richardson could not \nask his Under Secretary, in this case Dr. Moniz, to take on any of the \nresponsibility for supervising what is going on in this so-called \nstovepipe agency. Regardless of the experience or the qualifications of \nSecretary Moniz, or any other Under Secretary, Secretary Richardson \nwould have to personally exercise that oversight, or it would not be \nexercised. That is clearly not a good management arrangement.\n\n  This stovepipe agency, as it is contemplated in this Nuclear Security \nAdministration, eliminates the ability of the Secretary of the Interior \nto integrate important work on nuclear weapons with other important \nscientific work going on in the Department of Energy.\n  I believe very strongly that our laboratories and our nuclear weapons \nprogram are strengthened by the interaction that scientists and \nengineers in that nuclear weapons program have with other scientists \nand other engineers working elsewhere in the Department of Energy. That \nwould be stopped. That would be much more difficult under this kind of \na stovepipe arrangement. There is no prohibition\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\nagainst it happening here, but it is very clear that the head of this \nNuclear Security Administration has all authority, and exclusive \nauthority, for what goes on in his department, and there is very little \nincentive for anyone else to try to put work in those laboratories or \ninteract necessarily with those laboratories on nonnuclear weapons \nactivity.\n  As a result of this, I fear very much--and I know my good friend and \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, who is a cosponsor of this \namendment, says he believes that something like this amendment should \nbe adopted by the Senate because it will keep the Congress, ultimately, \nafter we conference with the House, from going even further and taking \na step toward shifting some of this nuclear weapons responsibility to \nthe Department of Defense.\n  My fear is somewhat different. My fear is that this is a first and \nsort of a logical step toward going in that direction, and that if you \nare going to set up all of this nuclear weapons activity in a stovepipe \nand it is going to be cordoned off from the rest of the Department of \nEnergy, as is proposed in this bill, I think it is very easy to go from \nthat point to the point of saying let's just cut this loose entirely \nfrom the Secretary of Energy and make it responsible to the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  I think that would be a serious mistake. That is a mistake that our \npredecessors had the wisdom to avoid. President Truman had the wisdom \nto avoid that. Those who set up the nuclear weapons program in this \ncountry decided early on that it should be in a civilian agency, it \nshould not be in a Department of Defense agency; and, clearly, the \ncloser we move toward making this defense-specific, defense-only, I \nthink we would be making a mistake.\n  Creating the stovepipe, in my view, does threaten the long-term \nvitality of our laboratories. I believe it threatens the long-term \nability to attract people we need to these laboratories, to keep them \nworld-class, cutting-edge scientific institutions.\n  I may be overdramatizing, but my own view is that we have seen the \nstovepipe model in action. Two years ago, I went to the Soviet Union \nand visited Chelyabinsk-70, also referred to as Shnezinsk. Shnezinsk is \none of the nuclear cities, one of the secret cities. When you go there, \nyou see how stovepipe organizations function. There is nobody there \ndoing any research on solar energy. There is nobody there worrying \nabout environmental problems that might be a result of research or work \ngoing on at that facility. There is nobody there interacting with much \nof anyone.\n\n  That is one of the big problems. That is why we have the nuclear \ncities initiative in this bill that we are trying to get going, to help \nthese laboratories in Russia break out of the stovepipe and begin to \ninteract with other elements in the society, with other scientists, and \nbegin to apply their talents to other activities.\n  So I am sure this is well intentioned. I am sure this proposal is \nwell intentioned, and I would like very much to have some hearings and \nbring in some experts to tell us what they think of this and allow the \nadministration to give us their point of view. I think that is an \nappropriate course for us to follow. But my initial reaction, after \nreading it here for the last hour and a half, or 2 hours that I have \nhad this, is that it does not do what the sponsors intend. It does not \nsolve the problem of Chinese espionage. It does create or result in \nmany other unintended consequences that will be long-term adverse to \nour nuclear weapons program.\n  Mr. President, I have great problems about it. I have a series of \nquestions I was going to raise about it. I see my colleague from New \nMexico wishing to speak. Maybe he would like to speak and I could ask \nhim a few questions about this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time has been used on the other \nside of the aisle with reference to this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit on this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that, but did somebody keep time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will check the records.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no need to do that. Let me say to Senator \nBingaman, first of all, I believe that over the past 15 years--\ncertainly within the last 6 or 7--and I am not casting aspersions in \nany way on anybody else, but I believe I have had as much to do with \nkeeping the labs diversified as any single Member of Congress.\n  I believe we have done an exciting job in dealing with the cards that \nwere dealt to us when we decided not to do anymore underground testing. \nAnd I believe what Senator Reid spoke about, which has the very fancy \nwords surrounding it--``science-based stockpiled stewardship''--you \nhave no idea how long it was difficult for me to put all four of those \nwords together. I used to leave half of them off. But I think I have \ngot it now. It was a very complicated concept. It was imposed on a \nlaboratory system that, I regret to say to you and everybody, was \nbroken down.\n  In fact, I am going to quote from some reports--all current ones, \nbecause they go back years--saying the Department of Energy, in terms \nof doing its work right for the nuclear weapons part--I haven't seen an \nanalysis about solar, but that is a little program, whether they run it \nor fund it. I have not seen a report in the last decade, and there are \ntwo within the last 6 years, that does not say the Department of \nEnergy's ability to handle nuclear weapons development is not broken to \nthe core. That is principally because it is stuck in a department with \nso many other things to do that are, with reference to urgency, much \ndifferent and much easier and not as important as nuclear weaponry and \nall that goes with it.\n  Yet, decisionmakers are making decisions on refrigerator efficiency, \nand then they move over and make a decision on nuclear weapons. I would \nalmost say with certainty--but I am not going to say I will predict--if \nthey don't adopt this amendment--and we are going to stay here for a \nwhile and see if we are going to adopt it. Maybe some of you want to \nfilibuster it. Some of you haven't filibustered yet, so it might be \nexciting. But I can tell you, either this model or a totally \nindependent department for nuclear weapons is going to be the aftermath \nof this espionage.\n  I am not worried that it is going to be the Department of Energy \nmanaging this because I think too many people have spoken out about \nthat. But when those looking at the management end up saying it cannot \nfit in a department of the type that is the Department of Energy and be \nrun in a regular, ordinary chain of command decisionmaking, which is \nwhat I call this proposal--you can allude to it as stovepipe. I choose \nthe Marine concept that is chain of command--I almost would predict \ntoday--but not quite--that it will be one of those, freestanding. When, \nfinally, it is determined what I have been frustrated with for years \nabout the ability to manage that Department, perhaps you can manage the \nother aspects that are not so critical, but you can't manage the \nnuclear part under the current environment. It needs dramatic change.\n\n  The reason we are on the floor and the reason we are going to finally \nget it done is because we are scared, because now it is not a question \nof efficiency and how long it takes to make decisions for nuclear \nweaponry. It is because we are frightened that we are getting kicked to \ndeath. So being frightened, we are going to fix something. This fix is \nnot going to be a little tiny fix as we have done in the past. If \nanybody chooses to say this is the most dramatic change in 22 years \nsince it was created from its former underpinnings called ERDA, which \nwas another department put together with bits and pieces from \neverywhere, they are right. It is the most significant proposal to \nstreamline nuclear weaponry that has ever been put forward.\n  But let me suggest that this administration has had two reports, or \nthree, suggesting that dramatic changes ought to be made, and nothing \nhas been done of any significance.\n  Secretary Richardson, in the aftermath of what some have called the \n``greatest espionage'' in our whole history, is busy and is to be \nadmired and respected for trying to reform. But if you try to reform \nit, and you are the Secretary of Energy, and you are as diligent as \nBill Richardson--and one who likes to run a lot of things, which\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\nI admire him for, and one who is a good politician, so he wants to do \nthings politically acceptable, especially for the White House and those \nhe works for--you will never come to the conclusion that this \nDepartment should be streamlined such that the Secretary has only one \nperson to be responsible for the nuclear weapons and they will run it \ninside out, because in a sense it diminishes the role of the Secretary.\n  I don't know whether Secretary Richardson does or not. But they are \nnot in office more than 6 months, and they run around calling these \ngreat laboratories, including those in my State, ``my laboratories.'' \nIt is just like: Isn't this great? The Secretary of Energy has this \nbig, $3 billion laboratory, and he calls it ``my laboratory.''\n  I did not say Secretary Richardson does that. I have not heard him. \nBut, if he did, he would be consistent with the other ones.\n  We have a suggestion here that is probably going to make it a little \nmore difficult for Secretaries of Energy to run around and call them \n``my laboratories,'' because they are going to be a laboratory system \nrun by an administrator within the Department, whether he ends up being \nan Under Secretary or an Assistant Secretary who is going to run the \nwhole show.\n  For those who do not think there are models such as this, there are. \nYou can take a look at DARPA. You can take a look within the Energy \nDepartment at the nuclear Navy. It is different than this, but if you \nwant to look at a model that is within a big department where you have \nsomething structured to handle a very important role and mission, there \nare such models. As a matter of fact, there are experts who say this is \na good model, if you want to keep it within the department.\n  I want to address two other things, and I want to read some notes.\n  First, if this Senator thought for 1 minute that the implementation \nof this approach would minimize the diversification and versatility of \nthese three major laboratories to do outside work for the government \nand others, I would pull it this afternoon. I don't believe that will \nhappen. I don't believe it is inherent in this amendment. I believe \nthat if there is concern it can be fixed with language, because the \nfact that it is so poorly managed under this structure that we have is \nnot what is contributing one way or another to its versatility. It is \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the scientists that are making \nthese laboratories multiuse, multipurpose, multifaceted and that do \nwork beyond nuclear work.\n  Since my colleague asked that his first speech not be counted as two \nspeeches, which I didn't object to, I gather that the other side \ndoesn't intend to let us vote on this. I don't know what we should do \nabout that. I will meet with our leadership. If it is just up to me, I \nwill debate it as long as we can tonight, and I will go home without \nthe bill completed and bring it up and take another week on it when we \ncome back.\n  The time is now to fix this tremendous deficiency in terms of how our \nnuclear weapons and everything attendant to it are managed.\n  Secretary Richardson is doing a mighty job, but he will never fix it \nwithout reorganization and streamlining and chain of command that is \nprovided in this amendment, which is not perfect and not the only one. \nBut this is what it is intended to do.\n  Let me just read a couple of things. This is Admiral Chiles' report, \nthe so-called Chiles report of March 1, 1999:\n\n       Establish clear lines of authority in DOE. The commission \n     believes that the disorderly organization within DOE has a \n     pervasive and negative impact on the working environment. \n     Therefore, on recruitment and retention, accordingly the \n     commission recommends that the Secretary of Energy organize \n     defense programs----\n\n  That is what we are talking about----\n\n     consistent with the recommendations of the 120-day study. We \n     recommend three structural changes.\n\n  They recommend three, for starters.\n  I use this because anybody, including my colleagues and Senator Reid, \nwho has today spoken about how well the laboratories have done, would \nalmost have to admit that they have done well in spite of the absolute \nchaotic condition with reference to sustained accountability within the \nlaboratories as a piece of DOE.\n  Frankly, I have appropriated for 5 years--this is my sixth--the \nCommittee on Energy and Water, which funds totally the laboratories, to \nsome extent, not totally, with reference to nuclear work and to some \nextent on nonnuclear.\n  There were Congressmen asking that we create some new regional \ncenters for headquarters, Albuquerque, for example, or a greater region \nsomewhere in Texas and the like. We asked, rather than do that, that \nthe appropriations fund a 120-day study. That was done. I am sure my \ncolleague has that. If he doesn't, his staff does.\n  I am going to quote from the executive summary of this, which is \ndated, incidentally, February 27, 1997. Still reports are saying ``fix \nit, fix it.''\n  At the bottom of page ES-1, ``These practices''--after describing \npractices within this Department of Energy as it pertains to nuclear \nweaponry--``are constipating the system.''\n  I am quoting.\n\n       They undermine accountability, making the entire system \n     less safe. Further, the process prevents timely decisions and \n     their implementation. Untold millions of dollars are wasted \n     on idle plants and equipment awaiting approvals of various \n     types, or on investments which age and become obsolete and \n     expensive to maintain without ever having been used for the \n     original productive purposes. Finally, the defense program \n     has a job to do--maintenance of a nuclear deterrent, which is \n     not well served by the ES review and approval process that \n     drags on forever.\n\n  That is the current system of environmental safety and health review \nin this Department.\n  People worry about what this amendment is going to do.\n  Let me tell you. This report says that we are not well served by that \nwhich exists in the Department now, and an approval process that drags \non forever helps no one.\n  There is much more to be read in the most current studies that kind \nof clamor for doing something dramatic and different.\n\n       The largest problem [says this same 120-day study on page \n     ES-1] uncovered is that the defense program practices for \n     managing safety, health and environmental concerns are based \n     on nonproductive, hybrid, or centralized and decentralized \n     management practices that have evolved over the past decade. \n     It goes on to say that because they have evolved doesn't mean \n     they are effective or operative.\n\n  I very much am pleased that Senator Bingaman yielded so I could have \na few words. Senator, I will be back shortly, but I am called to the \nmajority leader's office to discuss this issue. It will not take me \nover 15 minutes, and I will return.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I rise to speak on behalf of an amendment I sponsored that \nwas agreed to previously as part of the managers' package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kyl \namendment, which brings new security accountability and intelligent \nadministration to the Department of Energy's (DOE) nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  The Cox report has shown us that we have ceded design information on \nall of our most sensitive nuclear warheads and the neutron bomb to \nChina. These designs, our legacy codes, and our computer data have been \nlost because of lax security at our national labs (Los Alamos, Lawrence \nLivermore, Oak Ridge, and Sandia), incompetent administrations, and \npossibly, obstructions of investigations.\n  What have we lost because of this espionage? According to the Cox \nreport, ``Information on seven U.S. thermonuclear warheads, including \nevery currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in the U.S. ballistic \nmissile arsenal.'' These warheads are the W-88, W-87, W-78, W-76, W-70, \nW-62, and W-56. China has also obtained information on a number of \nassociated reentry vehicles. But it does not end there. China also has \nclassified design information for the neutron bomb, which no nation has \nyet deployed. Other classified information, not available to the pubic, \nhas also been stolen.\n  With this information, China has made a quantum leap in the \nmodernization of its nuclear arsenal. China will now be able to deploy \na mobile nuclear force, with its first deployment as soon as 2002.\n  The cost of these nuclear thefts is the security of the U.S. and the \nsecurity of our allies in the Asia-Pacific.\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\nThe ability to miniaturize and place multiple warheads on a single \nballistic missile will have serious destabilizing effects in the \nregion. India is watching China warily, as are Japan, South Korea, and \nTaiwan.\n  I hope that our troops in the Asia-Pacific will not have to suffer \nfor a domestic security failure. I hope that we will not have to pay \nfor these thefts in American lives.\n  But the costs will not be limited to the Asia-Pacific region. We can \nbet that this information will not stay in the hands of China. China \nhas supplied Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, and Libya with \nsensitive military technology in the past. We have no real guarantees \nthat China will not spread our lost secrets again.\n  This fiasco of security did not happen by accident. There was a \nconcerted effort on behalf of the Chinese government to obtain this \ninformation and a lack of effort on part of certain individuals to \nprotect those secrets. Janet Reno must be held accountable if she \ndenied her own FBI the authority to investigate suspected spies. \nLikewise, Sandy Berger must be held accountable if he delayed \nnotification of the President of the United States or if he delayed \naction on these security breaches.\n  Mr. President, for two decades we have left the door to our DOE \nfacilities open to thieves. We have exposed our most sensitive details \nto China. It is time to secure the door of security.\n  We cannot reverse what has taken place. We cannot take back the \ninformation that has been stolen. But we must prevent further theft of \nour secrets.\n  The Kyl amendment takes necessary steps in enhancing security at our \nDOE facilities. It establishes increased reporting requirements to \nCongress and the President, as well as layers of checks and balances to \nknock down the stone walls of silence. This amendment also gives the \nAssistant Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Weapons programs statutory \nauthority to competently administer our nuclear programs and enforce \nregulations.\n  But we must also recognize that this measure is not an iron sheath \nfor our weapons secrets. Beyond espionage at our national labs, there \nhave also been illegal transfers of sensitive missile design \ninformation by Loral and Hughes, two U.S. satellite manufacturers, to \nChina. With this information, China can improve its military command \nand control through communications satellites.\n  In its efforts to engage a ``strategic partner,'' the Clinton \nAdministration loosened export controls, allowing satellite and high \nperformance computer experts. Within two years of relaxing export \ncontrols, a steady stream of high performance computers flowed from the \nU.S. to China, giving China 600 supercomputers. Once again, China is \nusing these supercomputers to advance its military capabilities. These \nhigh performance computers are useful for enhancing almost every sector \nof the military, including the development of nuclear weapons.\n  We have not reached the bottom of this pit of security failures. The \ninvestigations will continue and Congress will hold the Administration \naccountable. In the meantime I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 418\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, last night the \nSenate did pass an amendment I drafted establishing a policy that would \nrequire the President to establish a multinational embargo against \nadversary nations once our Armed Forces have become engaged in \nhostilities. I thank the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Warner, and Senator Levin, as well as minority and \nmajority staffs of the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign \nRelations Committee for working with me on this initiative.\n  This amendment would impose a requirement on Presidents to seek \nmultilateral economic embargoes, as well as foreign asset seizures, \nagainst governments with which the United States engages in armed \nhostilities.\n  After 1 month of conflict in Kosovo, the Pentagon had announced that \nNATO had destroyed most of Yugoslavia's interior oil-refining capacity. \nAt approximately the same point in time, we had the Secretary of State \nacknowledging that the Serbians had continued to fortify with imported \noil their hidden armed forces in the province.\n  Just 3 weeks ago, the allies first agreed to an American proposal, \none which had been put forward by this administration, to intercept \npetroleum exports bound for Serbia but then declined to enforce the ban \nagainst their own ships.\n  On May 1, 5 weeks after the Kosovo operation had begun, the President \nfinally signed an Executive order imposing an American embargo against \nBelgrade on oil, software, and other sensitive products.\n  Yet, NATO and the United States have paid a steep price for failing \nto impose a comprehensive economic sanction on Serbia from the \nbeginning of the air campaign, which started in March.\n  As recently as May 13, a Government source told Reuters that the \nYugoslavian Army continued to smuggle significant amounts of oil over \nland and water.\n  At the end of April, General Clark gave the alliance a plan for the \ninterdiction of oil tankers coming into the Adriatic towards Serbian \nports. To justify this proposal, he cited the fact that through \napproximately 11 shipments, the Yugoslavians had imported 450,000 \nbarrels containing 19 million gallons of petroleum vital to their war \neffort. Let me repeat: 450,000 barrels, containing 19 million gallons \nof oil, that supported the war effort. Half of those 19 million gallons \nof oil would support them for 2 months; half of the 19 million gallons \nof oil supported the Serbian war effort for 2 months, yet we allowed 11 \nshipments to come through since the beginning of this air campaign.\n  Unfortunately, it has been economic business as usual for the \nSerbians as our missiles try to grind their will. The President \ndeclared on March 24 the beginning of the NATO campaign and set a goal \nof deterring a bloody offensive against the Moslem civilians. We know \nwhat happened.\n  I have a chart that illustrates a chronology of the situation when it \ncomes to economic business as usual. We started the air campaign March \n24. Then on April 13, while we were adding more aircraft to the \nengagement, Serbia had reached the midpoint of receiving 11 shipments \nof oil from abroad.\n  Of course, on April 27, General Clark announced:\n\n       We have destroyed his oil production capacity.\n\n  NATO estimates of displaced Kosovars rise to 820,000. Serbia receives \n165,000 barrels of imported fuel over a 24-hour period.\n\n  While we were adding more aircraft, it now had been a month later \nsince the campaign began, we find they are still bringing in more oil. \nA month after the start, they were at the midpoint of receiving 450,000 \nbarrels of oil.\n  By the close of April, General Clark confirmed the destruction of \nYugoslavia's oil production capacity. On the same day, however, the \nSerbs took in 165,000 barrels of imported oil. As I mentioned earlier \nin this chronology, while we are still bringing in the aircraft, they \nare still bringing in the oil.\n  Interestingly enough, just today, in the Financial Times of London, \nGeneral Wesley Clark was understood to have expressed concern about the \noil issue when he briefed NATO ambassadors yesterday on the progress of \nthe 9-week-old air campaign. He has expressed disappoint that U.S. \nproposals for using force to support the embargo, at least in the \nAdriatic, were rejected by other allies--notably France. NATO is still \nworking out how the details of a voluntary ``visit and search'' regime \nunder which the alliance warships would check on ships sailing up the \nAdriatic Sea. Let me repeat, they are still working out the details of \na voluntary visit and search regime.\n  Now we are in the ninth week of the campaign, well over 400 aircraft, \n23, 24 Apache helicopters, the President has called up 33,000 \nreservists, and they have yet to establish procedures for an oil \nembargo. They are still working out the details.\n  The article goes on to say the North Atlantic Council agreed this \nweek to introduce the regime but has to approve the rules of \nengagement.\n  It is clear that the air campaign is still being operated, and, \nobviously, the oil embargo, according to committee.\n  On May 1, when the President signed the Executive order barring oil \nand\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\nsoftware receipts, there were 11 foreign oil shipments of 450,000 \nbarrels. Milosevic has now received the last of the 11 April oil \nshipments, for a total of 450,000 barrels on the day when the President \nsigned the Executive order barring the oil and software imports.\n  As of 3 weeks ago, the number of displaced Kosovars had topped 1 \nmillion, and NATO acknowledges the continuation--as we have certainly \nlearned today in the most recent news updates--of energy imports by the \nenemy. These imported energy reserves play a significant role in \nsupporting Serbian ground operations.\n  The U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates that Yugoslavian forces \nconsume about 4,000 barrels of oil per day. This fact means that if \nSerbian armored units in Kosovo used only one half of the imported fuel \njust from the month of April alone, they could have operated for nearly \n2 months, just half the amount they imported in April, yet as we well \nknow, the air campaign began on March 24.\n  It took nearly 1 month after the start of the NATO campaign, however, \nfor Milosevic to uproot the vast majority of the ethnic Albanian \npopulation of the province. By the timeframe that NATO had claimed to \ndestroy Serbia's oil refining capacity, which was mid to late April, as \nwe have seen here when General Clark announced it on April 27, the \nYugoslavians still managed to perpetrate Europe's the worst \nhumanitarian crisis since World War II. We now face the strategic and \noperational challenge of uprooting dispersed tank, artillery and, \ninfantry units in Kosovo. This challenge confounds NATO because our \nmilitary campaign ignored the offshore economic base sustaining the \naggression that we had pledged to overcome.\n  This example teaches us that military victory involves more than the \ndecisive application of force. It also demands, as Operation Desert \nStorm so dramatically illustrated, a coordinated diplomatic and \neconomic enemy isolation effort among the United States and its allies.\n  Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 1, 1991. Five days later, on August 6, \nthe United Nations Security Council, with only Cuba and Yemen in \nopposition, passed a resolution directing ``all States'' to bar Iraqi \ncommodity and product imports. This action first helped to freeze \nSaddam in Kuwait before he could move into Saudi Arabia. The wartime \ncoalition subsequently faced the more manageable task of expelling this \ndictator from a small country rather than the entire Arabian peninsula.\n  The point is, during Operation Desert Storm the President of the \nUnited States had worked in concert with the allies to establish an \nembargo. That was effective. What is difficult to understand is why the \nPresident and the NATO alliance did not agree to this at the outset? \nWhy, at a time when we were conducting--initiating an air campaign, \nthis oil embargo was not in place? We must always try to damage or \ndestroy the offensive military apparatus of a hostile State, but as the \nPersian Gulf war taught us, it should also be starved of its resources.\n  No law can mandate an immediate multinational embargo. But this \namendment that will be included in this reauthorization will make it \nmore difficult for future Presidents to repeat President Clinton's \nmistake, the alliance's mistake of waiting a month--and actually it is \neven more than that, because we do not have it in full force. There is \nno immediate impact of a voluntary embargo currently, as we have \nobviously heard today with General Clark's concerns about this issue \nthat continues to fortify Milosevic's defenses. So we do not want \nfuture Presidents to repeat the mistake of waiting a month, waiting \nlonger to allow the enemy to conserve fuel, to get more fuel and to be \nable to become more entrenched on the ground as we have seen Milosevic \nhas done in Kosovo, and to cloud the prospects for victory.\n  The United States, as a matter of standing policy, should pursue an \ninternational embargo immediately. In fact, that should have been done \neven before the campaign had been initiated. That should have been part \nof the planning process. It should not have been an afterthought. It \nshould not have been ad hoc. It should not have been a few days later \nwe will get to it. In this case, obviously, it was more than a month \nand it is still running. It should be done immediately. If we are \nwilling to place our men and women and weaponry in harm's way in the \nmiddle of a conflict, in the midst of hostilities, then at the very \nleast the ability of any adversaries to reinforce their military \nmachine should cease. Dictators, tyrants, would further know in advance \nthat we would wage a parallel diplomatic and trade campaign next to the \nmilitary one to disable their war machinery.\n  This amendment is not micromanaging policy, but it provides increased \nassurances of victory and averts a delay in the interception of war \nmateriel. In the case of Kosovo, the administration and the alliance \nadmits this was helpful to the enemy. We keep seeing that time and time \nagain. We keep hearing it is helpful. That should have been done long \nago. It does beg the question why this was not considered as part of \nthe planning process before we initiated the air campaign. It seems to \nme it would be very logical.\n  This amendment will not constrain but strengthen future Presidents in \norganizing the international community against regional zealots like \nMilosevic. We must remember the European Union states declined to \nenforce the Adriatic Sea embargo, against the advice of the United \nStates. Obviously, that is what General Clark is stating, in terms of \nhis concerns. Obviously, the NATO alliance does not have the rules of \nengagement for even doing a voluntary search and seizure process.\n  So I think this amendment will be helpful to lend the force of law to \nfuture Presidents in order to strengthen their hand in implementing an \nembargo and to seek international agreement with those countries with \nwhom we are engaged in a military effort so we can force an aggressor \ninto military and economic bankruptcy.\n  As our Balkan campaign reveals, the foreign energy and assets at the \ndisposal of dictators can provide their forgotten tools of aggression. \nBut this amendment signals that the United States will not only \nremember these tools, but take decisive action to break them. It \nsignals we should not bomb only so the enemy can trade and hide and can \nconduct business as usual. It has been business as usual for Mr. \nMilosevic, regrettably.\n  So I hope this amendment will enforce greater clarity in our \nstrategies of isolating our adversaries of tomorrow.\n  I am pleased the Senate has given its unanimous support of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Object.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a quorum call in progress.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be put in \neffect after I finish this statement. It will take about 5 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. STEVENS pertaining to the introduction of S. 1159 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Reed be recognized to \ntalk about the bill for 10 minutes and that then the quorum call be \nreinstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as a preliminary matter, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Herb Cupo, a fellow in Senator Robb's office, and that \nSheila Jazayeri and Erin Barry of Senator Johnson's staff be granted \nfloor privileges during the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1059, the \nfiscal year 2000 defense authorization bill. As a new member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I would like to thank Chairman Warner \nand Ranking Member Levin for their leadership on this legislation and, \nalso, the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members who have been very \nhelpful. The staff of the committee has also given us able support and \nassistance throughout this process.\n  This bill represents a significant increase in funding for national \ndefense, $288.8 billion. This is an $8.3 billion increase over the \nrequest of the Administration. I must admit that although I recognize \nthe need for increasing defense spending, this is a substantial \nincrease that puts tremendous pressure on other priorities of the \nnation. Nevertheless, I think at this time in our history it is \nimportant to reinvest in our military forces to give them the support \nthey need to do the very critical job they perform every day to defend \nthe United States.\n  I am also pleased that, given this increase, the committee has very \nwisely allocated dollars to needs of the services that are paramount. \nWe have been able, for example, to increase research and development by \n$1.5 billion. In an increasingly technological world, we have to \ncontinue to invest in research and development if our military forces \nare going to have the technology, equipment and the sophisticated new \nweapons systems that they need to be effective forces in the world.\n  In addition, we have added about a billion dollars to the operation \nand maintenance accounts. These are critical accounts because equipment \nneeds to be maintained and our troops need to be trained. All of these \noperations are integral parts of an effective fighting force, and we \nhave made that commitment.\n  In addition, we have tried with those extra dollars to fund, as best \nwe can, the Service Chiefs' unfunded requirements. Those items they \nhave identified--the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Air Force, CNO of the \nNavy--are critical systems they think are vital to the performance of \ntheir service's mission.\n  In addition, we have also looked at and dealt with a very critical \nproblem, and that is recruitment and retention of the military forces. \nWe are finding ourselves each month, in many services, falling behind \nour goals for enrolling new enlistees to the military services and \nretaining the valuable members of the military services coming up for \nreenlistment.\n  This bill, which incorporates many provisions of S. 4, increases pay \nby 4.8 percent and significantly changes the retirement provisions that \nwere adopted in the 1980s to more favorably represent a retirement \nsystem for our military. It also will incorporate the provisions of \nSenator Cleland's bill with respect to Montgomery G.I. bill benefits, \nmaking them more flexible for military personnel so they can be used \nfor a spouse or child. This is a very important development, not only \nbecause of the substance, but also in the fact that it represents that \ntype of innovative thinking about dealing with the problem of \nrecruitment and retention, not simply by doing the obvious, but \nsomething that is innovative and, in the long term, helpful. I commend \nthe Senator from Georgia for his great leadership on this issue.\n  What we are also recognizing here is that among the quality of life \nissues that affect the military is the issue of health care. I am \npleased to note that we have attempted to deal with a nagging problem \nwith the military, and that is the difficulty of obtaining assistance \nregarding the TriCare system--that is the HMO, if you will, that \nmilitary families and personnel use. We have heard numerous complaints \nabout TriCare. Indeed, they are many of the same complaints we hear \nabout civilian HMOs from constituents back home.\n  It is interesting to note that this legislation incorporates an \nombudsman program for TriCare. There will be an 800 number where a \nmilitary person can call with a complaint, with a question, or with a \nconcern, and we will have an individual at that number who will help \nthe person negotiate and navigate through the intricate system of \nmanaged care. This is such an interesting program, and, indeed, we are \nworking on this in the context of civilian health care. Senator Wyden \nand I introduced legislation to create an ombudsman program for all \nmanaged care in the United States. Our program would authorize States \nto set up ombudsman programs to assist our constituents in dealing with \nproblems just as real and just as complicated as problems facing \nmilitary personnel in the TriCare system.\n\n  I hope that our unanimous support of this provision today in this \nlegislation will be a beacon of hope as we consider managed care reform \non this floor in the days ahead so that we can, in fact, adopt an \nombudsman provision for our civilian programs as well as our military \nTriCare program.\n  I am also pleased to note that we have actively supported the \nnonproliferation provisions in this legislation.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction program is absolutely essential to \nour national security. We authorize $475 million, an increase of $35 \nmillion.\n  The crucial area of concern obviously is the stockpile of nuclear \nweapons in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. We \nwant to make sure that they safeguard that system. We want to also make \nsure that we can work with them to dismantle those systems which will \nlead both to their security and our security and the security of the \nworld.\n  I am somewhat regretful, however, that the Senate chose to table \nSenator Kerrey's amendment which would strike the requirement that the \nUnited States maintain strategic force levels consistent with START I \nuntil START II provisions come into effect. We all agree that the \nUnited States needs to maintain a robust deterrent force, although I \nargue that this can be best accomplished at the START II level. \nMandating that the United States maintain a START I level is another \nexample of how we sometimes over-manage and hobble the Department of \nDefense. I think we can, and should have, adopted the amendment of the \nSenator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey. It would have been a valuable \ncontribution to this overall legislation.\n  We also are fortunate that we have in fact pushed ahead on another \nprovision which touches on our nuclear security and a strategic \nposture, and that is the approval of the decision of the Department of \nDefense to reduce our Trident submarine force from 18 ships to 14 \nships. That is a step in the right direction towards the START II \nlevel.\n  I am also pleased that this bill will authorize funding to begin \ndesign activity regarding the conversion of those four Trident \nballistic nuclear submarines to conventional submarines which are more \nin line with the current situation in the world. In fact, when I have \ntalked to commander in chiefs throughout the world, they say they are \ncontinually asked to use those submarines for conventional missions. \nThis will give us four more very high quality platforms to use in \nconventional situations. I think that is an improvement, both in our \nstrategic posture in terms of nuclear forces and also in terms of our \nconventional posture.\n  I am, however, also disappointed with respect to another issue. And \nthat is the failure to adopt a base closing amendment as proposed by \nSenator McCain and Senator Levin. We are maintaining a cold war \ninfrastructure in the post-cold-war world. We reduced our forces but we \ncan't reduce our real estate. It is not effective.\n  Until we give our Secretary of Defense and our military chiefs the \nflexibility in the base closing process to identify and to close excess \nmilitary installations, we will be spending money that we don't have. \nAnd we will be taking that money from readiness, from modernization, \nand from our forces in the field. They do not deserve that reduction in \nresources, but in fact deserve the shift of those resources from real \nestate that is excess to the\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\nreal needs of our fighting forces. The real needs are taking care of \ntheir families, being ready for the mission, and having equipment to do \nthe mission. And every dollar that we continue to invest in resources \nand installations that we don't need is one dollar less that we don't \nhave for the real needs of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines \nwho are out in harm's way standing up and protecting this great \ncountry.\n  I hope we can pass a base closing amendment. I am encouraged that we \nhave more support this year than last year. I hope that we can do so, \nbecause it is the one way we cannot only eliminate excess space but \nalso do it in a way that is not political. I know there have been many \ncharges on this floor about politicization. As I hear these charges and \nthese arguments against base closings, I fear that we are the ones that \nare the issue, that we are the ones that are letting politics get in \nthe way of national security policy. The longer we do that, the more \ndetrimental will be our impact upon the true interests of the country \nand the needs of our military forces.\n  Again, let me say in conclusion that this effort, led by Senator \nWarner and Senator Levin, by the ranking Members, and the Chairpersons \nof the subcommittees and assisting agencies, results, I think, in \nexcellent legislation. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that I \nwill propound at this time. I do think the issue which has been before \nthe Senate is a very important issue. I have shown my interest and my \nconcern regarding security and more reports with regard to China, \nsatellite technology, and security of our labs. We have added a \nsignificant amount of language into this bill. I also think an \nimportant part of making sure we have secure labs in the future and \nthat the administration is handled properly will involve reorganization \nat the Department of Energy. Obviously, what is now in place is not \nworking. But this is not about organization; this is about security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour for debate to be equally \ndivided on amendment No. 446, the amendment by Senators Kyl, Domenici, \nand others; following that time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the amendment, with no amendments in order prior to the \nvote.\n  I might add before the Chair rules, this agreement is the same type \nof agreement that we have been reaching for dozens of amendments \nthroughout the consideration of the DOD bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask consent that a vote occur on or in relation to this \namendment with the same parameters as outlined above, but the vote \noccur at a time to be determined by the majority leader after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I inquire of the assistant Democratic leader, is the \nSenator objecting because he does not want a direct vote on the \namendment No. 446, or is there some other problem with that request?\n  Mr. REID. I say with the deepest respect for the majority leader, I \nhave spent considerable time here this afternoon indicating why I think \nthis is the wrong time for this amendment. I have stated there are \nparts of the amendment that I think are acceptable and agreeable to the \nminority, but this is not the time for a full debate on reorganizing \nthe Department of Energy. This is on the eve of the recess for the \nMemorial Day weekend. We have had no congressional hearings; we have \nnot heard from the Secretary of Energy, except over the telephone. This \nis not the appropriate way to legislate.\n  For these and other reasons, I ask there be other arrangements made \nso that we can proceed to this most important bill, the defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of that objection, I ask consent \nthat when the Senate considers H.R. 1555--that is the intelligence \nauthorization bill--following the opening statement by the manager, \nSenator Kyl be recognized to offer an amendment relative to national \nsecurity at the Department of Energy; I further ask consent that if \nthis agreement is agreed to, amendment No. 446 be withdrawn, following \n60 minutes of debate to be equally divided between Senators Kyl and \nDomenici and Reid and Levin, or their designees.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, I do \nsay to the majority leader, I appreciate on behalf of the minority, \nvery much, this arrangement being made. This we acknowledge is \nimportant legislation. It is an important amendment, one that deserves \nthe consideration of this body, I think, at an appropriate time. As \nindicated, H.R. 1555 will be the time we can fully debate this issue.\n\n  So I say to the sponsors of the amendment, Senators Kyl, Domenici, \nMurkowski, we look forward to that debate and express our appreciation \nfor resolving this most important legislation today. There is no \nobjection from this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Leader, would you take the time you have allotted \nto the two of us, the Arizona Senator and myself, and add Senator \nMurkowski, equally divided?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will so amend my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, then we will \ncontinue. The managers have some work they need to do with regard to \nsome amendments that are still pending. During this 60 minutes of \ndebate, I hope that can be resolved. We are expecting that final \npassage on the Department of Defense authorization bill would occur \nthis evening, hopefully before 8 o'clock. If we can make it any sooner \nthan that, certainly we will try to, but 8 o'clock is still our goal.\n  Just one final point. I must say, I do not like having to pull aside \nthis amendment. I thought we should have full debate, that it was a \nvery important amendment and we should have had a vote on it. But we \nwill have an opportunity. This is an issue that is important. It does \ngo to the fundamental question of security at our energy and nuclear \nlabs. But I think this Department of Defense authorization bill is the \nbest defense authorization bill we have had in several years. A lot of \ngood work has been done and I thought it would not have been wise to \nleave tonight without this Department of Defense authorization bill \nbeing completed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank both leaders for arranging for this bill to go \nforward now.\n  Senators will recall, pursuant to an earlier unanimous consent, we \nasked Senators to send to the desk such amendments and file them, as \nhave not been as yet cleared by the managers. We are continuing to work \non those amendments, but we cannot guarantee we will be able to include \nall of them into the package.\n  So once we finish this debate, it is the intention of the managers to \nmove to third reading unless Senators come down with regard to these \namendments that are pending at the desk.\n  I will be on the floor, as will Senator Levin, continuously to try to \nwork out as many as we possibly can. But it is essential, as the \nmajority leader said, we try to vote this bill at 8 o'clock right now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I concur with his suggestion \nthat those who have amendments that have not been cleared come over. We \ndo not want to raise false hopes that we will be able to clear many \nmore of them because we have cleared, I believe, a goodly number.\n  Mr. WARNER. There were about 40.\n\n[[Page S6225]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are doing the best we can, but it is going to get more \nand more difficult to clear additional amendments. We have, I believe, \ncleared about 25 of the 40, roughly, that were sent to the desk. We \njust may not be able to clear many more because of differences on both \nsides.\n  Mr. WARNER. But we both want to be eminently fair to our colleagues. \nThe bulk of the amendments remaining at the desk are ones that we, at \nthis time, either on Senator Levin's side or my side, find \nunacceptable.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. At this moment that is correct. We are going to do our \nbest to see if we cannot get a few more to be acceptable, but it is \ngetting difficult.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 446\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the pending Kyl amendment? \nThe Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would greatly appreciate it if you \nnotify me when I have used up 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I first want to say how sorry I am at \nthe treatment of this amendment, the first major, significant effort to \nput our nuclear weapons development house in order and stop the \nespionage we have been hearing about. The American people are now very \nfearful of the consequences of this situation. There can be all the \ntalk the other side wants that the Secretary of Energy is going to fix \nthis. The truth of the matter is, the Secretary of Energy is lobbying \nvery hard against this, even calling the President about it. I think it \nis because the Secretary wants to fix it himself.\n  As good a friend as I am of his, and as complimentary as I am about \nhis work, the truth of the matter is he cannot fix what is wrong with \nthe Department of Energy as it pertains to nuclear weapons development \nand maintenance.\n  Second, he cannot correct the lack of accountability among those \nvarious elements of the Department that are charged with security \ntransgression activities. It is impossible under the current structure \nof the Department.\n  Some have said this is being done too quickly with not enough notice. \nOne of my fellow Senators was saying the Chinese did not give us very \nmuch notice when they set about to steal our secrets. We already know \nthe right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. We already \nknow about that. It is not going to get better until we decide to \nchange things dramatically and raise, within the Department, the \nconcern about the tremendous value of nuclear secrets and nuclear \nweapons development information. It cannot any longer be dealt with in \nthe same way we deal with all the other things in the Department of \nEnergy. There are hundreds of energy issues in that Department that \ntake up the same time of the same people, the same regulators who are \nsupposed to be concerned about nuclear weapons. That must stop. Sooner \nor later something like we proposed here is going to take shape.\n  I hear some have said it is the status quo. It is the opposite of the \nstatus quo. I understand our Secretary has said it is the status quo. \nIt is the very opposite of it. I understand some have said it gives the \nnuclear part of this, the nuclear weapons people, total control where \nthey are not responsible to anyone. That is not true. The Secretary is \nstill in charge. The truth of the matter is, if we made them a little \nless responsible for all the goings on in this monster department, we \nwould all be better off. So in that regard, we will take some credit \nfor that.\n  There are others who suggest this has not previously been thought of \nin this way. I want to read from a 1990 report of the Defense Committee \nin the House.\n\n       We concur with the recommendation of the Clark task force \n     group to ``strengthen DOD's management attention to national \n     security responsibilities.'' These steps should include \n     raising the stature of nuclear weapons programs management \n     within DOE, for example by establishing a separate \n     organizational entity and administration with a clearly \n     enunciated budget, reporting directly to the Secretary.\n\n  That is precisely what we have done.\n  I want to close tonight by saying this issue will be revisited. We \ncan say to the Secretary and the Democratic whip, and those on that \nside who would not let us vote--who did not bother to try to amend \nthis, just decided they would threaten a filibuster and be prepared to \ndo it--that they have not seen the last day of this approach. Because \nit is imperative, if our country is going to do justice to the future \nand be fair with our children and their children, we cannot continue \ndown the path we have been on with reference to nuclear weapons and \nnuclear weapons design and development. We must do better.\n\n  If you were to design a system calculated to give the most important \nand most effective part of the Department the least attention, that is \nwhat you would do. You would do it like we are doing it.\n  Or if you were to decide that the most important function for our \nfuture should be treated along with other functions that are rather \nirrelevant to our future, you would design this Department and you \nwould be here fighting this amendment because you would have that \nsituation that I just described right on top of the most important \nfunction of the Department of Energy.\n  So, with a lot of care and attention, I worked on this. I will \ncontinue to work on it. I know a lot about it, but I do not assume that \nI know more than other people. We ought to all work on it. But I \nsuggest to the President and to Secretary Richardson, they better get \nwith suggesting to Congress some real ways that we can be involved in \nstopping what has been going on in the Department of Energy on both \nfronts, the sabotage and the stealing of secrets, which we will never \ncorrect unless we change the structure, making the nuclear weapons \nsystem the most important function of the Department of Energy, bar \nnone, second to none, at the highest elevation, not fettered or \nburdened by all these other functions of the Department.\n  If you can imagine that the bureaucracy within that Department \nworries about--I said a couple times on the floor--refrigerators and \ntheir ability to be more energy efficient, and those who worry about \nthat are the same group of people who worry about the same kind of \nthings as pertains to nuclear energy. They do not belong in the same \nleague. They should be separated.\n  Our suggestion, for accountability and more direct reporting, more \nopportunity for committees in Congress and the President himself to \nknow when security violations are occurring and are serious, must at \nsome point be adopted.\n  Frankly, none of this is said with any idea that my good colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, is anything but totally concerned about this issue. \nHe has different views than I tonight, but clearly I do not in any way \nclaim that he has anything but the highest motives in his lack of \nsupport for the amendment on which I have worked.\n  Neither do I think the distinguished minority whip in his remarks \nshould have said about this amendment that it will put the national \nsecurity at risk and that it will put our nuclear weapons and \ndevelopment of them at risk. He should retract that statement and take \nit out of there. If anything, any management team would say it would \nimprove the situation.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not know if the other proponents of \nthe amendment want to speak at this time. I gather they do not since \nthey are not on the floor, so I will take a very few minutes of our \ntime and make a few moments.\n  First of all, I think this is a good result we have come up with that \nallows for a reasoned and deliberate consideration of this proposal. I \ncertainly repeat what I said earlier today, which is, I question \nnobody's motives. I am sure everyone's motives are the same as mine, \nand that is, how do we improve the security of our nuclear weapons \nprogram and, at the same time, maintain the good things about our \nnuclear weapons program in our National Laboratories in our Department \nof Energy.\n  I, for one, started this from the proposition that the Stockpile \nStewardship Program, which is the program that is essentially \nresponsible for maintaining\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\nour nuclear deterrent, has been a success. That is my strong \nimpression, and the suggestion that it has been fettered and burdened--\nI believe that is the language that was used--by other activities in \nthe Department, I do not believe is true.\n  My strong impression is that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is \nalive and well, that our nuclear deterrent is secure and reliable, and \nthat in fact there is a lot we can point to with pride in that regard. \nClearly, there have been security lapses. Clearly, classified \ninformation has been stolen, and we need to put in place safeguards \nagainst that ever recurring. I favor that, and I believe we have some \nstrong provisions in this underlying bill which will accomplish that \nand will move us in the direction of accomplishing that.\n  Maybe there should be more. I am not totally averse to considering \nreorganization in parts of the Department of Energy. That may be a very \nconstructive suggestion for us to look into. But I do believe that the \nway to do it is through hearings.\n  Hopefully, we can have hearings in the Armed Services Committee. This \nis the appropriate committee, I believe. I serve on that committee. \nPerhaps Senator Warner can schedule some hearings as early as the week \nafter next when we return, if there is a sense of urgency, and I share \na sense of urgency about doing all that is constructive to do.\n  I am not in any way arguing that we should not look into this issue. \nI believe if we have hearings, we should give the Secretary of Energy \nthe chance to testify. I do believe that if we are going to embark upon \na major reorganization of the Department of Energy, the logical thing \nto do is to ask the Secretary of Energy his reaction to our proposed \nreorganization. That is the kind of responsible, deliberate action that \nour constituents expect of us. That is what the Secretary of Energy has \na right to expect. That is what the President expects. I hope that is \nthe course we follow.\n  I will briefly respond to the point my colleague, Senator Domenici, \nmade about a 1990 report by the Clark task force. I am not personally \nfamiliar with that report, but I point out to my colleagues that in \n1990 the Secretary of Energy was Admiral Watkins. That was not a \nDemocratic administration; that was a Republican administration. \nAdmiral Watkins was a very, very qualified individual to be our \nSecretary of Energy. His credentials for line management and command \nand control and maintaining military security cannot be questioned.\n  Admiral Watkins, of course, evidently did not think the \nrecommendations from that Clark task force alluded to should be \nfollowed up and implemented, and did not do that. There have been a lot \nof capable people in the Department of Energy, some in the position of \nSecretary, who have spent substantial time looking at this problem. \nThey have made some improvements. Perhaps more are needed, and I \ncertainly will embrace additional improvements if that is the case.\n  I do, once again, make the point I made earlier today, and that is \nthat we do not want to do something that has not been thoroughly \ndiscussed, has not been thoroughly analyzed, and which can have very, \nvery adverse consequences, unintended adverse consequences, on the \nstrength of our National Laboratories, on our ability to retain, to \nmaintain, and to recruit the top scientists and engineers in this \ncountry to work on these programs and to work in these laboratories.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time \nto see if other of my colleagues wish to speak on this issue as well.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am really appalled at the state of \naffairs on the floor. Earlier today, I asked that an order for a quorum \ncall be rescinded in order to discuss further the Kyl amendment which \nSenator Domenici, Senator Kyl, and I have participated in developing. I \nwas really disappointed we were denied that opportunity. I am pleased \nwe have this limited time available to us.\n  When we offered the amendment, we each had 10 minutes. That is not \nvery much time to explain it. I had hoped the minority would have \ngranted more time. I can only assume the minority is very much opposed \nto a full discussion of the circumstances surrounding the greatest \nbreach of our national security, as evidenced by the Cox report which \ncame down yesterday.\n  I am further shocked that the administration has succeeded in \ntemporarily derailing this amendment. And that is what they have done; \nthey have derailed the amendment. The administration seems to be more \nconcerned about how the bureaucracy within the Department of Energy is \norganized than whether the national security of the United States is \nprotected. We had an obligation prior to this recess to initiate a \ncorrective action within the Department of Energy. The minority has \nprecluded us from proceeding with that opportunity today.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have \nheld seven hearings. These hearings have revealed the shocking, dismal \nstate of security at our weapons labs. Those on the other side do not \nwant to repair it now; they want to study. How long have they studied \nit? It has gone through at least four Secretaries, that we know of. It \nhas gone back a decade. Why, for the life of me, do we delay now? I \ndon't know.\n\n  The pending Kyl amendment would have provided some assurances to the \nCongress and the American people that this will not happen again. This \namendment was about accountability--accountability by the Department of \nEnergy, accountability by the Department of Energy laboratories, \naccountability by the Secretary of Energy, accountability by the \nPresident--because it would provide, if you will, reporting not just to \nthe Secretary but to the Congress and to the President.\n  This would have provided accountability to the people of the United \nStates. They are entitled to it. But not now. The administration and \nthe minority have succeeded in derailing it.\n  The opponents of the amendment claim that it would make the DOE, the \nDepartment of Energy, bureaucracy unworkable. Well, I have news for \nyou. Unworkable? It is already unworkable. That bureaucracy is so \nunworkable, it has allowed all our secrets--all our secrets--that we \nhave spent billions of dollars on, to simply pass over to the Chinese, \nand perhaps other nations as well.\n  The Department of Energy's bureaucracy has proven time and time again \nthat no matter how diligent any individual Secretary of Energy is, the \nbureaucracy can outwait the Secretary, the bureaucracy can ignore the \nSecretary, the bureaucracy can do whatever it pleases without fear of \nany consequences.\n  Let me just give you one example.\n  In 1996, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, Charles Curtis, implemented \nthe so-called Curtis Plan. It was a security plan. It was a good plan. \nIt was a plan to enhance security at the DOE laboratories.\n  But in early 1997 he left the Department of Energy. And guess what. \nNot only did the Department of Energy bureaucracy ignore the Curtis \nPlan, the DOE bureaucracy did not even tell the new Secretary about the \nCurtis Plan.\n  I have had the opportunity in hearings to personally ask the new \nSecretary if he was familiar with the Curtis Plan. The specific \nresponse was: Well, it was never transmitted.\n  Why wasn't it transmitted?\n  Well, we don't know. We just have fingers pointing the fingers back \nand forth.\n  I certainly commend Secretary Richardson for his efforts to improve \nsecurity. He has improved security. But the plans, the traditional \nDepartment of Energy security plans, seem to have the life of a fruit \nfly.\n  The loss of our nuclear weapons secrets is just too important to \nignore or to trust to the bureaucracy of an agency that has time and \ntime again proven that it simply cannot be trusted, because the \nbureaucracy does not work, the checks and balances are not there.\n  So I am extremely disappointed that the Secretary has said in a \nletter he will demand that the President veto the bill because Congress \nis taking action--Congress is taking action--to fix the problem. Can \nyou imagine that? We are taking action to fix the problem, and they are \nsaying it is too hasty, we should not fix the problem.\n  This is just part of the problem. This amendment is just part of the \nanswer.\n\n[[Page S6227]]\n\n But at least we are trying to do something. The Democrats on the other \nside say: Oh, no, you're too early.\n  The pending amendment would have created accountability and \nresponsibility for protecting the national security at the Department \nof Energy; but not now, as a result of the administration's objections.\n  The pending amendment would have created three new organizations \nwithin the Department of Energy to protect our national secrets; but \nnot now, as a result objections from the minority and the \nadministration.\n  The pending amendment would require the Department of Energy to fully \ninform the President and the Congress about any threat to or loss of \nnational security information; but not now, as a result of the \nobjections of the minority and the administration.\n\n  President Clinton will rightfully be able to claim ignorance--claim \nignorance--again on what is going on, because he will be ignorant of \nwhat is going on.\n  The amendment would have prohibited anyone in the Department of \nEnergy or the administration from interfering with reporting to \nCongress about any threat to or loss of our Nation's national security \ninformation; but not now, as a result of the objections of the minority \nand the administration.\n  The amendment would have required the Department of Energy to report \nto Congress every year regarding the adequacy of the Department of \nEnergy's procedures and policies for protection of national security \ninformation and whether each DOE laboratory is in full compliance with \nall the DOE security requirements; but not now, as a result of the \nobjections of the minority and the administration.\n  The amendment would have required each Department of Energy \nlaboratory director to certify in writing whether that laboratory is in \nfull compliance with all departmental national security information \nprotection requirements; but not now, as a result of the objections of \nthe minority and the administration.\n  In short, this amendment would have gone far--not all the way--but it \nwould have gone far in preventing further loss of our nuclear weapons \nsecrets to China; but not now--well, it is evident--as a result of the \nobjections by the minority and by the administration.\n  I suggest that the administration has made a tragic mistake, that the \nminority has made a tragic mistake. The American people expect a \nresponse from the Congress, the Senate, now in this matter--not next \nweek or next month.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask what the time remaining is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Two minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I believe there are other Senators wishing to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire, was the time on the \nRepublican side equally divided, 10 minutes each, among Senators \nMurkowski, Domenici, and myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. In that event, I suggest that Senator Murkowski yield the \nremainder of his time to Senator Hutchinson--he has comments to make--\nunless Senator Murkowski has further comments.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will need another 30 seconds to a minute at the end. \nYou have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank Senator Kyl and Senator Murkowski for their \nefforts in this area.\n  I, along with every Member of this body, received the three volumes \nof the Cox report. I share the absolute shock at the indescribable \nbreach of our national security at our labs. I think it is inexcusable \nthat we would leave for the Memorial Day recess without taking even \nthis step.\n  Senator Kyl has presented to us--and I am glad to cosponsor the \namendment--an amendment that makes eminent good sense. It calls for the \nhead of DOE counterintelligence to report immediately to the President \nand the Congress on any actual or potential significant loss or \nthreatened loss of national security information. That is an \nindisputable need. It is clear in the Cox report that that was one area \nof failure.\n  For the Democrats, at a time when this Nation is at war, to threaten \nthat they are going to block, through filibuster, a national security \nreauthorization bill because they do not want us to debate an amendment \nto address this shocking failure of security, I think is inexplicable, \ndisappointing, and is going to be hard to explain to our constituents.\n  I wish we had debated the Kyl amendment, had enough time to spend on \nit, have a vote on it, and take the kind of step Senator Kyl has \nproposed in this amendment.\n  I leave with disappointment and dismay that such a filibuster would \nbe threatened on an amendment that is so important to the security of \nthe United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 9 minutes 30 \nseconds. The Senator from Michigan has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLevin's time be assigned to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to a few of the points \nthat have been made. Then I will yield, because I know the Senator from \nArizona, who is the prime sponsor on the amendment, is here and wishes \nto speak.\n  The suggestion that we are leaving without knowing anything about \nsecurity in our National Laboratories in the Department of Energy is \njust wrong.\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee. I participated in the drafting \nof the language that is included in this bill. We have 24 pages in the \ndefense authorization bill which is the best--the best--we could come \nup with in the Armed Services Committee to deal with this problem of \nsecurity and put in place more safeguards.\n  We start on page 540, establishing a Commission on Safeguards, \nSecurity, and Counterintelligence at Department of Energy \nFacilities. We go on; that commission is established. We move on to \nincrease the background investigations of certain personnel at the \nDepartment of Energy facilities. We move on to requiring a plan for \npolygraph examinations of certain personnel at the Department of Energy \nfacilities. We then go on to establish civil monetary penalties for \nviolations of the Department of Energy regulations related to \nsafeguarding and security of restricted data.\n\n  We have a moratorium on lab-to-lab and foreign visitors and \nassignment programs unless there is a certification made by the head of \nthe FBI, the head of the CIA, the Secretary of Energy himself as to the \nfact that safeguards are in place.\n  We increase penalties for misuse of restricted data. We establish the \nOffice of Counterintelligence in statute, which is essentially a third \nof the amendment that the Senator from Arizona is proposing. So two of \nthe three parts of the amendment the Senator from Arizona and my \ncolleague from New Mexico are proposing are included in this amendment.\n  It is just not accurate to say we are leaving here without having \ndone anything. We also provide for increased protection for whistle-\nblowers in the Department. We provide for investigation and remediation \nof alleged reprisals for disclosure of certain information to Congress. \nWe provide for notification to Congress of certain security and \ncounterintelligence failures at the Department of Energy facilities. \nAll of these provisions are in the bill the way it now reads.\n  I say again what I said before: Maybe there should be more. I hope \nvery much we will have some hearings in the Armed Services Committee, \nperhaps on the Energy Committee. I know my colleague from Alaska, the \nchairman of\n\n[[Page S6228]]\n\nthe Energy Committee, expressed his great concern that we are not \nmoving ahead this afternoon on this. Since we have already had seven \nhearings on this China espionage issue, we should go ahead and have an \neighth hearing, hopefully the week after next, and we should look at \nthis proposal or similar proposals to see what can be done.\n  One other minor item: There has been reference made to the failure to \nimplement the recommendations that Charles Curtis, our former Under \nSecretary, made with regard to security. I agree, this was a failing. \nThe information was not properly passed from one group of appointed \nofficials to the next group of appointed officials when they came into \noffice. That is a very unfortunate lapse. Under this amendment, \nSecretary Curtis would have been stripped of any authority over the \nnuclear weapons program. It would be prohibited for the Secretary of \nEnergy to allow the Under Secretary any authority over that program \nunder this proposal.\n  One of our outstanding Secretaries of Energy, since I have been \nserving in the Senate, has been Secretary Watkins. He is known for his \nattention to the detail of management and administration. During the \ntime he was Secretary of Energy, he issued a great many management \ndirectives or ``notices,'' as he called them. I have here a notebook \ncontaining 37 of these management directives that Secretary Watkins \nissued. They are all related to the organization and management of the \nDepartment of Energy. None of them contain the provisions or anything \nlike the provisions that are contained in here.\n  I hope when we have hearings in the Armed Services Committee, in the \nEnergy Committee, in whatever committee the majority would like to hold \nhearings, let's call Secretary Watkins, Admiral Watkins, to come and \nexplain to us his view of this proposal. Surely we cannot question his \ncommitment to dealing with safeguards and security and with the problem \nof Chinese espionage. If some of my colleagues want to imply that \nMembers on the Democratic side are less than concerned, let us call \nSecretary Watkins and see whether he is less than concerned about some \nof these issues.\n\n  I am persuaded that he is very concerned. I am persuaded that all of \nmy colleagues in the Senate, Democrat and Republican, are very \nconcerned. We need to do the right thing. We need to be sure that \nwhatever we legislate helps, rather than hinders, our ability to deal \nwith this problem.\n  I yield the floor at this point and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I just address the Senate to say \nthat Senator Levin and I are still working with regard to the managers' \npackage and reviewing such amendments at the desk when Senators come \nand discuss them. It is the intention of this Senator to move to third \nreading very shortly, just minutes following the debate on the current \namendment by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, is there anybody else on the Democratic side \nwho wishes to speak at this point?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the time now is being controlled by Senator \nBingaman. I ask him for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the Senator such time as he wants.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman has just put in the Record \nthe extensive actions that are taken in this bill in order to enhance \nsecurity at these labs, actions which were taken after some very \nthoughtful debate and discussion by the Armed Services Committee. \nSenator Bingaman has outlined those for the Record and for the Nation.\n  I want to put in the Record at this time the summary of the amendment \nthat we adopted here today. Senator Lott offered an amendment earlier \ntoday. It was modified somewhat. In essence, it does some of the \nfollowing things:\n  First, it requires the President to notify the Congress whenever an \ninvestigation is undertaken of an alleged violation of export control \nlaws. It would require the President to notify Congress whenever an \nexport license or waiver is granted on behalf of any person who is the \nsubject of a criminal investigation. It would require the Secretary of \nDefense to undertake certain actions that would enhance the performance \nand effectiveness of the Department of Defense program for monitoring \nso-called satellite launch campaigns. It would enhance the intelligence \ncommunity's role in the export license review process. It proposes a \nmechanism for determining the extent to which the classified nuclear \nweapons information has been released by the Department of Energy. It \nproposes putting the FBI in charge of conducting security background \ninvestigations of DOE laboratory employees.\n  These are a long list of actions which are now in this bill, that \nstarted off in this bill from the Armed Services Committee that had \nbeen improved on the floor today. To suggest that we are not doing \nanything relative to trying to clamp down on espionage activities which \nhave been going on for 20 years at these labs, it seems to me, is a \ntotal misstatement of what is in this bill that we will be voting on in \na few minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Lott amendment, again, \nslightly modified since this list has been prepared, but that a summary \nof the Lott amendment be printed in the Record at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object--I do not intend to--could \nyou describe who prepared the summary?\n  Mr. LEVIN. This was prepared by Senator Lott's staff. Again, there \nwere some slight modifications in this, which Senator Lott agreed to, \nwhich I proposed prior to the adoption of the amendment. This, in \nessence, is the summary of the Lott amendment. This, plus the numerous \nprovisions in the Senate bill that came out of the Armed Services \nCommittee, a commission on safeguarding security, counterintelligence \nat the facility, background check investigations now going on that had \nnot been taking place, polygraph examinations, monetary penalties to be \nadded to the criminal penalties, moratorium on laboratory-to-laboratory \nand foreign visitors in assignment programs, counterintelligence and \nintelligence program activities being organized, whistle-blower \nprotection, notification of Congress of certain security and \ncounterintelligence failures at these labs.\n\n  This is a significant effort on the part of the Armed Services \nCommittee. It was supplemented by the full Senate today. I don't think \nwe ought to denigrate this effort on the part of the Armed Services \nCommittee or of the Senate in adopting the amendment we adopted today \nby just suggesting we are not doing anything because in a few hours \nprior to a recess, without one hearing on the subject, we are not \nreorganizing the Department of Energy without even hearing from the \nSecretary of Energy. I think that suggestion is a denigration of what \nis in this bill, which was thoughtfully placed in this bill by the \nArmed Services Committee, and a denigration of the amendment of the \nmajority leader, which we adopted here this morning on this floor.\n  We should not characterize these kinds of efforts and diminish these \nkinds of efforts by sort of saying we are not doing anything before we \nare going home on recess. We are doing an awful lot, and there is more \nto be done. But we ought to do it in a way that will do credit to this \ninstitution, the Senate. We ought to do it promptly after the recess. \nWe ought to do it after a hearing, where the Secretary of Energy is \nheard. The head of the Department should at least be heard. We received \na letter from him today. Do we not want to hear from him prior to \nreorganizing the Department? That is not thoughtful.\n  That is not the way to proceed to close the hole. That is a way of \nprecipitously trying to do something and trying to get some advantage \nfrom the refusal of others to go along with that kind of precipitous \naction. But more important, I believe it would denigrate the \nsignificant steps that are in this bill, both as it came to the floor \nand as it was added by the majority leader\n\n[[Page S6229]]\n\nwith modifications, which I suggested, and that work is significant. It \nwill close, we hope, most of the holes that have been in these labs in \nterms of trying to protect against espionage for 20 years, where \nnothing was done until finally last year the President issued a \nPresidential directive that started the process of tightening up the \nsecurity at these laboratories.\n  We should be proud of these efforts. They were done thoughtfully in \ncommittee by the majority leader, by Senators on the floor. We should \nnot denigrate them and simply slough them off because there is not a \nprecipitous reorganization of the entire Department 2 hours before the \nrecess, without even having a hearing on the subject and hearing from \nthe Secretary of the Department.\n  That is more than 1 minute, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the summary of the Lott amendment be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Lott Amendment Summary\n\n       First, this amendment would require the President to notify \n     the Congress whenever an investigation is undertaken of an \n     alleged violation of U.S. export control laws in connection \n     with the export of a commercial satellite of U.S. origin. It \n     also would require the President to notify the Congress \n     whenever an export license or waiver is granted on behalf of \n     any U.S. person or firm that is the subject of a criminal \n     investigation.\n       Second, this amendment would require the Secretary of \n     Defense to undertake certain actions that would significantly \n     enhance the performance and effectiveness of the DOD program \n     for monitoring so-called ``satellite launch campaigns'' in \n     China and elsewhere.\n       Third, this amendment would enhance the Intelligence \n     Community's role in the export license review process, and \n     would require a report by the DCI on efforts of foreign \n     governments to acquire sensitive U.S. technology and \n     technical information.\n       Fourth, this amendment expresses the Sense of Congress that \n     the People's Republic of China should not be permitted to \n     join the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) as a member \n     until Beijing has demonstrated a sustained commitment to \n     missile nonproliferation and adopted an effective export \n     control system.\n       Fifth, the amendment expresses strong support for \n     stimulating the expansion of the commercial space launch \n     industry here in America. This amendment strongly encourages \n     efforts to promote the domestic commercial space launch \n     industry, including through the elimination of legal or \n     regulatory barriers to long-term competitiveness. The \n     amendment also urges a review of the current policy of \n     permitting the export of commercial satellites of U.S. origin \n     to the PRC for launch.\n       Sixth, this amendment requires the Secretary of State to \n     provide information to U.S. satellite manufacturers when a \n     license application is denied.\n       Seventh, this amendment also would require the Secretary of \n     Defense to submit an annual report on the military balance in \n     the Taiwan Straits, similar to the report delivered to the \n     Congress earlier this year.\n       Eighth, the amendment proposes a mechanism for determining \n     the extent to which classified nuclear weapons information \n     has been released by the Department of Energy.\n       Ninth, the amendment proposes putting the FBI in charge of \n     conducting security background investigations of DOE \n     laboratory employees, versus the OPM.\n       Tenth, the amendment proposes increased counter-\n     intelligence training and other measures to ensure classified \n     information is protected during DOE laboratory-to-laboratory \n     exchanges.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 458, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send a modification of amendment No. 458 \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 458), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In title X, at the end of subtitle D, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1061. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDICTED \n                   WAR CRIMINALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States as a member of NATO, should not negotiate with \n     Slobodan Milosevic, an indicted war criminal, or any other \n     indicted war criminal with respect to reaching an end to the \n     conflict in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n       (b) Yugoslavia Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'' means the Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will you advise us as to the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico has 11 \nminutes; the senior Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes; the Senator \nfrom Alaska has 2 minutes 13 seconds; and the Senator from Arizona has \n8 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have had a lot of conversation here \non the floor as we have looked at the examples of finger-pointing. It \nis apparent also that we have had bungling at the very highest level.\n  I'd like to share a couple of examples with my colleagues. Why wasn't \nWen Ho Lee's computer searched to prevent the loss of our secrets? \nBecause the FBI claims that the DOE told the FBI that there was no \nwaiver. The FBI then assumed they needed a warrant to search.\n  Well, Wen Ho Lee did sign a computer access waiver. This is the \nwaiver on this chart. I can't tell you how many days of communication \nit took to get this waiver, because the first explanation was that it \ndidn't exist. When the FBI asked the Department of Energy if there was \na waiver on Wen Ho Lee, the Department of Energy examined their records \nand they could not find a waiver. Here is a waiver signed by Wen Ho \nLee, April 19, 1995. It says:\n\n       These systems are monitored and recorded and subject to \n     audit. Any unauthorized access or use of this LAN is \n     prohibited and could be subject to criminal and civil \n     penalties. I understand and agree to follow these rules.\n\n  There it is. We found it. What is the result? Lee's computer could \nhave been searched, but instead was not searched for 3 long years. \nThere was a waiver the entire time. What is the excuse of the \nbureaucrats for that? They point to one another.\n  Then there is the role of the Justice Department. The Justice \nDepartment thwarted the investigation by refusing to approve a warrant, \nnot once, twice, but three times. We still have not heard a reasonable \nexplanation. The Attorney General owes to the American people and the \ntaxpayers an explanation as to why it was turned down.\n  What is frightening, as well as frustrating, is that nobody put our \nnational security as the priority. The FBI and the Department of \nJustice were more concerned about jumping through unnecessary legal \nhoops than about preventing one of the most catastrophic losses in \nhistory. The events involved throughout the Lee case are not only \nirresponsible, they are unconscionable.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I agree that there was substantial \nbungling by various officials and, clearly, that computer should have \nbeen investigated. Maybe we ought to have an amendment out here to \nreorganize the FBI. Maybe that is the solution to this problem, and we \ncan consider it tonight before we leave town. Clearly, there is no \ndisagreement between Democrats and Republicans about the fact that \nserious problems exist and they need correcting.\n  The question is, Should we do a major reorganization of the \nDepartment of Energy with no hearings, no opportunity for the Secretary \nof Energy to come forward, and do so here as everyone is trying to rush \nout to National Airport and fly home? In my view, that is clearly not \nthe responsible way to proceed. Accordingly, we did object to that \nportion of the amendment. I think that is the right thing to do. After \nhearings, after consideration and meaningful discussion with the \nDepartment and with other experts about how to proceed, we may well \nfind some ways to improve that Department through changes in its \norganization. If we do find those, I will certainly be the first to \nsupport such a proposal. But I do think it is appropriate for us, at \nthis stage, to stay with what we know will help and continue to look \nfor other ways to help in the weeks and days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest that the example of the FBI and the \nDepartment of Energy not knowing that this waiver existed that Senator\n\n[[Page S6230]]\n\nMurkowski spoke about is the perfect case of the right hand not knowing \nwhat the left hand was doing, and it is precisely what this amendment \nseeks to correct. There is an old debate technique called the ``red \nherring.''\n  If you can't meet the real argument of your opponent, throw something \nout there that you can defeat and pretend like that is the issue.\n  Members of the Democratic side have said, why, there are all kinds of \nsecurity provisions in this bill. How dare the Republicans suggest that \nwe haven't done anything about security in the bill.\n  The security provisions in the bill were put there by Republicans. We \nknow full well that we have security provisions in the bill. Virtually \nevery one of them were put there by Republicans. And I am informed that \nin the Armed Services Committee, Democrats fought many of them. Now \nthey come to the floor very proud of what is in the bill--not having \nsponsored them, having opposed some of them, but now contend that we \nhave solved the problems, because the Republicans on the Armed Services \nCommittee put some provisions in the bill, and because the Republican \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, brought a whole series of things to the \nfloor. Much of what was quoted by the Democrats came from the Lott \namendment. In fact, Senator Levin even put into the Record a summary of \nthe Lott amendment.\n  I am glad. These are all very good provisions. Republicans are \nserious about our national security.\n  But to suggest that what was done there is the end of it, now we can \ngo home, is to quit way before this problem has been solved.\n  The Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment is an amendment that seeks to \nget to the core of the problem. As Senator Bingaman said, two-thirds of \nthe Armed Services Committee amendments were incorporated into our \namendment. That is true. We did that for stylistic purposes.\n  What is the problem? It is the remaining one-third. They don't want \nto get to the core of the problem, which is the organization of the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Here is what it boils down to: Who do you trust? Do you trust the \nClinton administration with the national security of the United States \nsaying: Trust us; we will do the reorganization down here at the \nDepartment of Energy. We are going to get this figured out.\n  Is that who you trust?\n  I don't think the American people can afford to continue to put their \ntrust in an administration which has known about this problem since \n1995, and only in 1999 did it begin to do anything about it because of \npublic pressure. From the management review report of the Department of \nEnergy itself, as recently as last month, it recognized that, \n``significant problems exist in that the roles and responsibilities are \nunclear.''\n  That is precisely what we are trying to fix--to get these roles and \nresponsibilities straight.\n  Only a month before, a congressionally created administration said, \n``The Assistant Secretary of Defense programs should be given direct \nline management over all aspects of the nuclear weapons complex.'' That \nis our amendment.\n  The GAO report--a whole list of reports, all highly critical of the \nmanagement at the Department of Energy and the defense weapons complex.\n  I finally conclude with this point: The GAO testified that the \ncontinuing management problems at the Department ``were a key factor \ncontributing to security problems at the laboratories and a major \nreason why DOE has been unable to develop long-term solutions to the \nrecurring problems reported by advisory groups.''\n\n  Is that who you want to trust to clean this up and fix it up, and \nmake sure that we don't have any more problems? I think not. I think it \nis time for Congress to get involved.\n  What is so amazing to me tonight is that the Democrat minority would \nhold up the defense authorization bill at a time when we are at war in \nKosovo, because they don't even want to debate our amendment. They \ncalled a quorum call and wouldn't take it off so that Republican \nMembers couldn't even come to the floor. Senator Domenici asked to be \nallowed to speak on our amendment. He is a coauthor. The minority \nrefused him the opportunity even to speak.\n  So not only will they not allow us to vote on our amendment, but they \nwon't even allow it to be debated. Yet their ostensible reasoning for \nopposing it is not because they don't think it has some good ideas in \nit but because we have to have a lot more discussion and debate about \nthis; we haven't had hearings; we need to talk about this.\n  We have offered them the opportunity to talk about it, but they don't \nwant to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it because it gets \nright to the guts of the problem--the Department of Energy has to be \nreformed. This amendment does that.\n  The national security of the United States cannot be protected until \nwe do that. And the suggestion of the distinguished minority whip that \nnow is not the time, on the eve of the Memorial Day recess, is \nastounding. What is more important, that Members get to go home for the \nMemorial Day recess, or that we act with alacrity to fix the problems \nof national security at our laboratories?\n  I am astonished that the Democratic minority would take this kind of \ncavalier approach to the national security of the United States--we \nneed to talk about it more, but we are not going to let you talk about \nit. We need to get out of town for the recess. So withdraw your \namendment.\n  Only because the Department of Defense needs the authorization bill \nare the authors of this amendment willing to withdraw it at this time.\n  There is a war in Kosovo. It is irresponsible for the minority to \nthreaten to filibuster this bill until kingdom come while that war is \ngoing on, because they don't even want to talk about an amendment that \nwould guarantee the security at our National Laboratories.\n  This is a sad day for those who are opposing this amendment. It is a \nsad day when Members of this Senate won't let their colleagues talk \nabout this amendment, won't allow a vote on it, and can't wait to get \nout of town to brag about whatever it is that they have done, but \nwithout doing the unfinished business of protecting the security of our \nNational Laboratories.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent not to take from \nthe time of the debate and to continue to work on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Florida has \ndebated an amendment today. Senator Shelby and Senator Robert Kerrey \nreplied to that debate.\n  I am now informed that they will consider the amendment of the \nSenator from Florida at such time as the intelligence bill is brought \nup, and that basically meets the requirements of the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n             Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Amendment No. 447\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate considers H.R. 1555 I be recognized to offer an amendment \nrelative to counterintelligence, and I further ask consent that if this \nagreement is agreed to that amendment 447 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nand I will shortly send a managers' package to the desk. I don't know \nthat that package is ready at this moment. We hope very much to start \nthe final vote before 8 o'clock. There are a number of our colleagues \nwhose plans can be greatly enhanced if we can start this vote as \nquickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make some comments, and then I \nwill be prepared to yield the remainder of our time. Perhaps I will not \nbe able to with my colleague from Nevada here.\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\n  But let me just make a few comments at least, and then return the \nremainder of the time over to him for any comments he has.\n  I think that trying to characterize this problem which exists in our \nDepartment of Energy and in our National Laboratories as this \n``administration's problem'' rather than all of our problem is just a \nrewriting of history.\n  I have a list that, once I have completed my statement, I will offer \nor ask unanimous consent to add to the Record. It is called ``Security \nConcerns at America's Nuclear Facilities,'' excerpts from GAO Reports, \n1980 through 1993.\n  When you go through this and look at just the titles of these \nreports, you see that the problems we are debating--the problems of \nadequate safeguards for nuclear secrets, and for these facilities--have \nbeen with us a long time--long before I ever came to the Senate.\n  From a GAO report, March of 1980: Adequate safeguards to prevent the \ntheft or diversion of weapons usable material from commercial nuclear \nfuel reprocessing plants have not yet been deployed.\n  May, 1986: DOE has insufficient control over nuclear technology \nexports.\n  March of 1987: DOE reinvestigation of employees has not been timely.\n  August of 1987: Department of Energy needs tighter controls over \nreprocessing information.\n  December of 1987: DOE needs a more accurate and efficient security \nclearance program.\n  June of 1989: Better controls needed over weapons-related information \nand technology.\n  These are the titles of GAO reports. These are all GAO reports that \nwere issued in the 1980s before this administration ever came to town, \nbefore this administration was ever heard of.\n  To try to say this is a problem that this administration created and \nthat now, this afternoon, we have to get this problem solved because \notherwise we would be in derogation of our duty, I think is just \nclearly wrong.\n  There are significant improvements in security and safeguards of \nsecure information and classified information in this bill and there \nare additional safeguards put in place in the Lott amendment which we \nall agree to.\n  I was at the Armed Services Committee markup. I can say without \nqualification that the Democrats did not object to the provisions that \nwere offered and that are now included in this bill. I believe that we \nDemocrats--and I was one of them in that committee markup--\nsubstantially improved the provisions which wound up in the final bill. \nI think we worked with the majority, we tried very hard to be \nconstructive and to come up with proposals that were workable and that \nwere effective in improving security. I think we have done that.\n  I look forward to going through the very same process on this \nquestion of reorganization of the Department of Energy. We should \nconsider the provisions in this amendment which relate to \nreorganization of the Department of Energy and we should do so with \nhearings. We can have them as soon as the week after next. I am happy \nto stay next week and have them, if the Senator is suggesting we are \ntrying to leave town without doing our duty to the country. I am happy \nto have them next week in the committees I serve on. If the Energy \nCommittee and the Armed Services Committee schedule hearings next week, \nI will be there and I will do all I can to help make whatever \nlegislative provisions we propose out of those committees be \nconstructive and effective in improving the security of our National \nLaboratories and our Department of Energy, generally, and improving the \norganization of that Department.\n  It is highly improper, in my view, to try to legislate something here \nwithout allowing the Secretary of Energy to testify, without allowing \nhim to give his input into it, and without looking at how other \nSecretaries of Energy feel about some of these major, far-reaching \nchanges as well.\n  We should do this right. We should do it quickly. We should take \nwhatever action we determine makes sense for the country's good, and we \nshould not play politics with this issue. This is not a Democrat or \nRepublican issue. We are all very concerned about our national \nsecurity. We are all anxious to do the right thing--Secretary \nRichardson as much as anyone in this body, and we need to ask his \nadvice. We need to talk to all the experts we can find. I hope we can \ncome up with some good solutions here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. How much time remains on this \nunanimous-consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes, the \nSenator from Arizona 1 minute 42 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Arizona, in my \nabsence, talked about how I had improperly held up this bill. I \ncomplied with every Senate rule. The rules of the Senate have been in \neffect for a long time.\n  I think what we should understand is that it appears there was some \nkind of game playing here, that late in the day this amendment would be \noffered and because people wanted to go home --and I am not one of \nthose Senators who had some desire to rush out of here; I had no \nairplane today--there would be a capitulation to this amendment which \nwas filed late in the game. It was filed at a time when there were no \ncongressional hearings, there had been no time to review this \nresponsibly. The minority would not cave in to that.\n  We are not talking about Memorial Day recess. We are talking about \ngood legislation. This is not good legislation. We have acknowledged \nthat there are certain pieces of this amendment we are willing to \naccept, but the rest of it we are not. We are not going to be compelled \nto do so. We complied with the Senate rules, as we always try to do.\n  We shouldn't be dealing with this on a partisan basis. The Cox-Dicks \nreport dealing with the espionage at one of the National Laboratories \nwas done on a bipartisan basis. If we are going to do something to \nchange the way the Department of Energy is administered, it should be \ndone on a bipartisan basis.\n  There may be feelings hurt in this matter; certainly my feelings are \nnot hurt. I did what was appropriate to protect the prerogatives of a \nSenator and a minority. That is a reason the Senate has fared so well \nover the two centuries or more that it has been in existence--that the \nrights of the minority can be protected. This is the body to do it. We \ndid protect our rights.\n  I look forward to the day when we can debate this again. I think it \nwill be an interesting debate.\n  I have said this before: I commend and applaud the managers of this \nbill. They have done an outstanding job to get rid of this very, very \nimportant, big piece of legislation. They could not have done it with \nthis amendment pending.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the assistant Democratic leader. Senator Levin \nand I have been able to move this bill, but it is because of the \ncooperation we have had from the leadership and all Senators. This is \nmy 21st armed services authorization bill and Senator Levin's 21st. I \ndon't know of a smoother one. We have had few quorum calls and \nexcellent cooperation.\n  I wish to say to my distinguished friend and assistant Democratic \nleader, the timing of the bringing up of the Kyl-Domenici amendment I \nam largely responsible for. I worked with them and said I recognized \nthat this could begin to slow the bill down. It wasn't a last-minute \ntype of thing.\n  Mr. REID. I accept that explanation, but I think it underscores what \nI said about the capabilities of the two managers of this bill. Had \nthis come up earlier, this bill would not be completed now.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the leader, and I certainly want to pay my \nrespect to Senator Lott. He has worked on this issue knowing the \ninterest of all parties relating to this important amendment. He has \nworked with us for some several days on it.\n  Mr. President, we are ready to begin to wrap things up.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 482 Through 536, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. On behalf of myself and the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, I send 56 amendments to the desk. This package of \namendments is for Senators on both sides of the aisle and has been \ncleared by the minority.\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\n  I send the amendments to the desk at this time and I ask they be \nconsidered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments will be \nconsidered en bloc.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes amendments Nos. 482 through 536, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 482\n\n (Purpose: To add an exception to a requirement to reimburse a mentor \n                 firm under the Mentor-Protege Program)\n\n       On page 273, line 20, strike ``a period;'' and insert `` `, \n     except that this clause does not apply in a case in which the \n     Secretary of Defense determines in writing that unusual \n     circumstances justify reimbursement using a separate \n     contract.'; ''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment No. 483\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the consolidation of Air Force Research \n    Laboratory facilities at the Rome Research Site, Rome, New York)\n\n       On page 417, in the table preceding line 1, strike \n     ``$12,800,000'' in the amount column of the item relating to \n     Rome Laboratory, New York, and insert ``$25,800,000''.\n       On page 420, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2305.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has adopted \nmy amendment to S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2000, to authorize special compensation for severely \ndisabled military retirees who suffer under an existing law regarding \n``concurrent receipt.'' As many of my colleagues know, current law \nrequires military retirees who are rated as disabled to offset their \nmilitary retired pay by the amount they receive in veterans' disability \ncompensation. This requirement is discriminatory and wrong.\n  Today, America's disabled military retirees--those individuals who \ndedicated their careers to military service, and who suffered disabling \ninjuries in the course of that service--cannot receive concurrently \ntheir military retirement pay, which they have earned through at least \n20 years of service in the Armed Forces, and their veterans' disability \ncompensation, which they are owed due to pain and suffering incurred \nfrom military service. In other words, the law penalizes the very men \nand women who have sacrificed their physical or psychological well-\nbeing in uniformed service to their country.\n  My amendment does not provide for full payment to eligible veterans \nof both the disability compensation and the retired pay they have \nearned. I regret that such a proposal, which I support in principle, \nwould be far more expensive than many of my colleagues could accept. I \nlearned that lesson the hard way in the course of sponsoring more \nambitious concurrent receipt proposals in previous Congresses.\n  The amendment instead authorizes special compensation for the most \nseverely disabled retired veterans--those who have served for at least \n20 years, and who have disability ratings of between 70 and 100 \npercent. More specifically, it would authorize monthly payments of $300 \nfor totally disabled retired veterans; $200 for retirees rated as 90 \npercent disabled; and $100 for retirees with disability ratings of 70-\n80 percent.\n  These men and women suffer from disabilities that have kept them from \npursuing second careers. If we cannot muster the votes to provide them \nwith their disability pay and retired pay concurrently, the least we \ncan do is authorize a modest special compensation package to \ndemonstrate that we have not forgotten their sacrifices.\n  The Military Coalition, an organization of 30 prominent veterans' and \nretires' advocacy groups, supports this legislation, as do many other \nveterans' service organizations, including the American Legion and \nDisabled American Veterans. These highly respected organizations \nrecognize, as I do, that severely disabled military retirees deserve, \nat a minimum, special compensation for the honorable service they have \nrendered the United States.\n  The existing requirement that military retired pay be offset dollar-\nfor-dollar by veterans' disability compensation is inequitable. I \nfirmly believe that non-disability military retired pay is post-service \ncompensation for services rendered in the United States military. \nVeterans' disability pay, on the other hand, is compensation for a \nphysical or mental disability incurred from the performance of such \nservice. In my view, the two pays are for very different purposes: one \nfor service rendered and the other for physical or mental ``pain and \nsuffering.'' This is an important distinction evident to any military \nretiree currently forced to offset his retirement pay with disability \ncompensation.\n  Concurrent receipt is, at its core, a fairness issue, and present law \nsimply discriminates against career military people. Retired veterans \nare the only group of federal retirees who are required to waive their \nretirement pay in order to receive VA disability. This inequity needs \nto be corrected. The Senate has made important progress toward that end \nwith the adoption of this amendment.\n  I continue to hope that the Pentagon, once it finally understands our \nmessage that it cannot continue to unfairly penalize disabled military \nretirees, will provide Congress with a fair and equitable plan to \nproperly compensate retired service members with disabilities. It is \nhard to disagree with the simple logic that disabled veterans both need \nand deserve our full support after the untold sacrifices they made in \ndefense of this country.\n  I look forward to the day when our disabled retirees are no longer \nunduly penalized by existing limitations on concurrent receipt of the \nbenefits they deserve. And I thank Senators Warner and Levin, the \nmanagers of S. 1059, for accepting my amendment to provide special \ncompensation for severely disabled retired veterans, who deserve our \nongoing support and gratitude.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 489\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Defense to eliminate the backlog \n in satisfying requests of former members of the Armed Forces for the \n      issuance or replacement of military medals and decorations)\n\n       In title V, at the end of subtitle D, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 552.

Although \ncargo preference or preference waivers are not mentioned, this pilot \nprogram could potentially be used to permit waivers of cargo preference \nlaw found in 10 U.S.C. 2631. In the absence of cargo preferences, DOD \nwould have to acquire an immense organic fleet and use very scarce \nuniformed manpower at enormous cost of more than $800 million per year. \nThis would dwarf any acquisition reform savings. This amendment would \nensure the waivers of 10 U.S.C. 2631 for commercial service contracts \nare not authorized under this pilot program.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 491\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report on the use of the facilities and \n  electronic infrastructure of the National Guard for support of the \n                    provision of veterans services)\n\n       On page 357, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\n     SEC. 1032.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that \npromises to extend to the Nation's veterans an improved, more \naccessible way to submit and process claims for benefits and other \nservices. Recently, in my state of New Mexico, complaints about \nprocessing claims for veterans benefits reached high volume. Billboards \nappeared around the city of Albuquerque that the Albuquerque regional \noffice of the Veterans Administration was the ``worst VA office in the \ncountry.'' I was very concerned about those charges and looked into the \nsituation. Information provided by the Albuquerque office essentially \nconfirmed the accusations I read on the billboard. Statistics show that \nthe system is broken and needs fixing. Compensation for completed \nclaims in New Mexico takes 301.6 days on average; the nationwide \naverage is 192.9 days. Pension compensation claims average 149.9 days \nin Albuquerque versus 108.8 days nationwide. ``Cases Pending Over 180 \nDays'' in Albuquerque are about 31 percent of the total. Nationwide, \nonly about 22 percent fall into that category.\n  The system appears to be broken and the situation is ripe for \ncreative new ways to solve our beleaguered veterans' problems.\n  I recently received a briefing that I thought might go a long way to \nserving veterans' needs, particularly in rural States such as New \nMexico. The proposal suggested that veterans be permitted to use \nNational Guard armories and communications infrastructure to receive \ncounsel on a wide range of veterans problems and programs. As you are \naware, National Guard armories are typically used during weekends for \nexercises and training, but often are underutilized during the week. \nThe proposal suggested that the National Guard and the Veterans \nAdministration coordinate ideas and concerns into a program which could \ntake advantage of the considerable resources already in place at the \narmories. The wide dispersion or armories, particularly among rural \ncommunities, would provide a considerably more convenient venue for \nreceiving veterans services than the long commute to major metropolitan \nareas such as Albuquerque that is now required.\n  My amendment requires the National Guard in consultation with the \nVeterans Administration to examine this idea, and to report their \nfindings regarding costs and benefits to the Secretary of Defense, who, \nhaving reviewed the report, would submit it and any additional findings \nto the Congress. I am optimistic that the analysis will show that \ninvesting resources in this project would pay major dividends to the \nveterans community which is experiencing considerable difficulty in \nsettling benefit claims under the current process.\n  I am pleased to introduce this idea to my fellow Senators and \nappreciate its acceptance as an agreed amendment in this year's defense \nbill.\n       In title II, t the end of subtitle C, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 225. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BALLISTIC MISSILE \n                   DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY FUNDING.\n\n       It is the Sense of Congress that--\n       (1) because technology development provides the basis for \n     future weapon systems, it is important to maintain a healthy \n     funding balance between ballistic missile defense technology \n     development and ballistic missile defense acquisition \n     programs;\n       (2) funding planned within the future years defense program \n     of the Department of Defense should be sufficient to support \n     the development of technology for future and follow-on \n     ballistic missile defense systems while simultaneously \n     supporting ballistic missile defense acquisition programs;\n       (3) the Secretary of Defense should seek to ensure that \n     funding in the future years defense program is adequate for \n     both advanced ballistic missile defense technology \n     development and for existing ballistic missile defense major \n     defense acquisition programs; and\n       (4) the Secretary should submit a report to the \n     congressional defense committees by March 15, 2000, on the \n     Secretary's plan for dealing with the matters identified in \n     this section.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, funding for Ballistic Missile Defense \nTechnology has been in a steady decline since Fiscal Year 1992, with \nthe Army part of the budget down approximately 70% during this period. \nAll indications are that it appears technology funding is headed for \nfurther descent in the future.\n  The Ballistic Missile Defense Technology program is in the category \nof research and development, a category that bridges the gap between \nbasic research and full-scale weapon system development and it is \ncritical to preventing technical obsolescence and to meeting emerging \nthreats.\n  Historically, this applied research in the area of ballistic Missile \nDefense has been vital to the evolution of systems that are being \ndeveloped and deployed today to meet an ever-growing missile threat. It \nis the wellspring of new defense systems and the source of demonstrated \ntechnology that is needed to make upgrades to systems already in the \nfield.\n  The emphasis in the Ballistic Defense Technology program for the past \n7 to 8 years has been on acquisition, getting systems developed and \nfielded. Following Desert Storm in 1991, it was clear that ballistic \nmissiles were a real threat and that the problem of proliferation of \nthese missiles would be of grave concern for many years to come. There \nwere understandable calls to rapidly build defense systems to counter \nthis threat.\n  While this emphasis is on deployment certainly justified by the pace \nand scale of the threat, it has resulted in a serious reduction in the \nadvanced development budget. This means the missile defense systems \nentering the inventory today are the products of laboratories of the \nservices over a number of years, in some cases over a span of 20 or \nmore years.\n  If we are to remain the world's leader in missile systems, it is \nimperative that we do all we can to stop this dramatic erosion of \nBallistic Missile Defense Advanced Technology funding and strengthen \nthe chain of development upon which future defense capability depends. \nWe are indeed ``eating our seed corn'' when we pull from our research \nefforts to fund the deployment of systems or carry out other military \nmissions such as those found in the contingency operation arena such as \nBosnia or Kosovo.\n  This Sense of the Congress calls upon the Secretary of Defense to \ntake a hard look at the Future Years Defense Program to ensure that \nfunding in the future years defense program is adequate for both \nadvanced ballistic missile defense technology development and for \nexisting ballistic defense major defense acquisition and improvement \nprograms. To that end we look forward to the Secretary's report by \nMarch 15th, 2000 on his plan for dealing with the matters identified in \nthe amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 493\n\n   (Purpose: To require a report regarding National Missile Defense)\n\n       In title II, at the end of subtitle C, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 225.

Mr. President, this dynamic legislative year has seen \nsome monumental events. This body began the year by passing S. 4, the \nSoldiers, Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. \nWith an overwhelming vote of 91-8, the United States Senate did not \nhesitate to show this great Nation that we appreciate the sacrifices \nand contributions of our service men and women. We also sent a message \nto the senior leaders of our military services that their pleas for \nassistance in stemming the flow of highly qualified service members \nfrom the military would not go unanswered.\n  The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of \n1999 included a 4.8% pay raise, pay table reform, REDUX repeal, a \nthrift savings plan, and improvements to the current GI Bill. These GI \nBill improvements included an increase in GI Bill benefits from $528 to \n$600 per month, elimination of the now-required $1200 service member \ncontribution, permission to accelerate lump sum benefits and finally, \nauthority to transfer GI Bill benefits to immediate family members. \nWhile the bill we are considering today addresses pay and retirement \nsystem reforms, it does not address the GI Bill enhancements. You, my \ndistinguished colleagues, showed your support for these GI Bill \nenhancements earlier this year. I, and the members of our armed \nservices--and their families, asks for your support again.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, our military services have been \nreduced by one-third, yet worldwide commitments have increased \nfourfold. Our forces are poised in Asia, standing guard in the Sinai, \nproviding assistance in south America and Haiti, flying combat missions \nin Iraq, and engaged in war in Kosovo. They are providing invaluable \nhumanitarian assistance to those who have been devastated by a number \nof natural disasters around the world. And, members of our Guard and \nReserve components will be this country's sole providers of a \n``Homeland Defense'' against the challenge of weapons of mass \ndestruction presented by this uncertain world.\n  Sadly, these men and women who sacrifice so much for our country are \nbearing the brunt of these competing demands. By improving pay and \nbenefits, as well as providing for increases in equipment upgrades, \nweapons procurement and replenishment, and spare parts funding, we can \nshow America's brightest that we value their service and recognized \ntheir sacrifices.\n  In my opinion, improvements to the GI Bill may be the single most \nimportant step the Congress can take in assisting the recruiting and \nretaining of America's best. Data we are seeing indicate that education \nbenefits are an essential component in attracting young people to join \nthe armed services. As the costs of college tuition rise, we must \nremain in step by increasing in GI Bill benefits, or the benefits \nthemselves will become less effective over time. The transferability \noption, under which service members would be allowed to transfer their \nGI Bill benefits to their spouse or children, is an innovative, \npowerful tool that sends the right message to those young people we are \ntrying to attract into the military and those we are trying to retain.\n  This Nation changed dramatically, and for the better, under the \noriginal GI Bill. Now we have another chance to address future national \nneeds by creating the GI Bill of the 21st Century.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is the text of S. 763 as introduced on \nApril 12. It would increase the minimum Survivor Benefit Plan basic \nannuity for surviving spouses age 62 and older. I am pleased to have \njoin me as cosponsors of the amendment: Senators Lott, Burns, Cochran, \nCleland, Collins, Hutchinson of Arkansas, Mack, McCain and Snowe.\n  Mr. President, as our Armed Forces are engaged in operations over \nYugoslavia, it is appropriate for the Congress to correct a long-\nstanding economic injustice to the widows of our military retirees. My \namendment would immediately increase for survivors over the age 62 the \nminimum Survivor Benefit Plan annuity from 35 percent to 40 percent of \nthe Survivor Benefit Plan-covered retired pay. The amendment would \nprovide a further increase to 45 percent of covered retired pay as of \nOctober 1, 2004.\n  Mr. President, I expect every member of the Senate has received mail \nfrom military spouses expressing dismay\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\nthat they would not be receiving the 55 percent of their husband's \nretirement pay as advertised in the Survivor Benefit Plan literature \nprovided by the military. The reason that they do not receive the 55 \npercent of retired pay is that current law mandates that at age 62 this \namount be reduced either by the amount of the Survivors Social Security \nbenefit or to 35 percent of the SBP. This law is especially irksome to \nthose retirees who joined the plan when it was first offered in 1972. \nThese service members were never informed of the age-62 reduction until \nthey had made an irrevocable decision to participate. Many retirees and \ntheir spouses, as the constituent mail attests, believed their premium \npayments would guarantee 55 percent of retired pay for the life of the \nsurvivor. It is not hard to imagine the shock and financial \ndisadvantage these men and women who so loyally served the Nation in \ntroubled spots throughout the world undergo when they learn of the \nannuity reduction.\n  Mr. President, when the Survivor Benefit Plan was enacted in 1972, \nthe Congress intended that the government would pay 40 percent of the \ncost to parallel the government subsidy of the Federal civilian \nsurvivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the \ngovernment's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other \nwords, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-\nterm program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with \nthe federal civilian SBP, which has a 42 percent subsidy for those \npersonnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50 \npercent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. \nFurther, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay \nwith no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 \npercent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the \ndifference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that \nour service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil \nservant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the federal \ncivilian retiree.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago, with the significant support from the \nMembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was successful in \ngaining approval from the Congress in enacting the Survivor Benefit \nPlan benefits for the so-called Forgotten Widows. This is the second \nstep toward correcting the Survivors Benefit Plan and providing the \nsurviving spouses of our military personnel earned and paid for \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 497\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the award of the Navy Combat Action Ribbon based \nupon participation in ground or surface combat as a member of the Navy \n or Marine Corps during the period between December 7, 1941, and March \n                                1, 1961)\n\n       On page 134, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 552. RETROACTIVE AWARD OF NAVY COMBAT ACTION RIBBON.\n\n       The Secretary of the Navy may award the Navy Combat Action \n     Ribbon (established by Secretary of the Navy Notice 1650, \n     dated February 17, 1969) to a member of the Navy and Marine \n     Corps for participation in ground or surface combat during \n     any period after December 6, 1941, and before March 1, 1961 \n     (the date of the otherwise applicable limitation on \n     retroactivity for the award of such decoration), if the \n     Secretary determines that the member has not been previously \n     recognized in appropriate manner for such participation.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment for \nmyself and Senator Smith of New Hampshire, to ensure that Navy and \nMarine Corps Combat veterans get the recognition they deeply deserve.\n  The ongoing action in Kosovo reminds us of the dangers our men and \nwomen in uniform face when called upon during a time of conflict. In \nrecognition of their service, they are awarded campaign and combat \ndecorations to identify them as those who have faced this nation's \nfiercest challenge--enemy fire. America's combat veterans risk their \nlives to preserve our freedoms, and carry out the orders of the \nPresident in answering the challenges to our nation's security.\n  During World War II, the Army created the combat infantry badge to \nidentify those soldiers who had faced combat. The Navy had no similar \naward until the 1960's. Although the Navy awarded Combat Stars prior to \nthat point, the Combat Action Ribbon was created as a way to better \nrecognize those who had served in combat. Recently, legislation was \nintroduced in the House of Representatives to make Navy and Marine \ncombat veterans who served in combat for any period after July 4, 1943, \nand before March 1, 1961, eligible for the Navy Combat Action Ribbon. \nIn response to this legislation, a Pearl Harbor survivor from my state \nwrote to me and pointed out that the dates included in the legislation \nexclude many of the combat veterans who served in the war's fiercest \nnaval battles, Pearl Harbor and Midway among them.\n  In response to this oversight, our legislation will make eligible for \nthe Navy Combat Action Ribbon those Navy and Marine combat veterans who \nserved in combat for any period after December 6, 1941, and before \nMarch 1, 1961, The Secretary of the Navy will review those who apply \nfor these awards to ensure that those who have not yet been recognized \nare not forgotten. We believe it is only appropriate that we honor \nthose who were willing to sacrifice their lives for this country.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 498\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize Coast Guard participation in DOD education \n                   programs, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, just a little over a week ago, I had the \nprivilege of traveling with the Secretary of Defense down to my home \nstate. It was a terrific trip and I believe the Secretary was very \nimpressed with the work that we are doing in Louisiana at our military \ninstallations and with our defense industry. One of the real highlights \nof the trip was the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Naval Information \nTechnology Center in New Orleans. This facility, hosted by the \nUniversity of New Orleans, is home to the\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n\nDefense Integrated Military Human Resources System, as well as other \npersonnel software projects for the Navy.\n  The DIHMRS project is one of those rare proposals that instantly \ncaptures the support of those that understand it. The military services \nhave spent countless billions of dollars in developing and supporting \n``stove pipe'' personnel software systems, that were out-of-date before \nthey were complete, had no capacity for interconnectivity and did not \nprovide the breadth of personnel information to be of real utility to \nour military leadership.\n  DIHMRS seeks to change all of that. It will provide an integrated \nsystem of personnel information, that will ultimately tie all the \nservices all the personnel systems and records, and do so in a easily \naccessible fashion that will give commanders the information about \ntraining and experience that they need to make deployment decisions. \nThis project fits perfectly into our efforts to craft smaller, faster \nand more flexible force structures. One of the key ingredients to \ncreating smaller, more effective forces, is the ability to quickly \nidentify individuals with the experience and training that needed for \nparticular missions. This is daunting task for any service now, it \nbecomes more so if you are trying to put together an inter-service task \nforce. When fully operational DIHMRS will address this need.\n  These advantages do not even address the enormous savings that the \nDepartment of Defense will realize by terminating the innumerable \nindividual human resource computer systems that track only one kind of \ndata for one branch of the military. Thus, this project is a boon to \nboth readiness and economic efficiency.\n  For that reason, I have introduced an amendment which emphasizes the \nSenate Armed Service Committee's support for this effort. It is \nimportant to note that a project like DIHMRS requires innovation and \ndivision. Thus, the management structure for the program has also \nrequired a degree of innovation and flexibility. I believe that the \nunique structure adopted for the DIHMRS project is critical for its \nultimate success. For that reason, the amendment reemphasizes the \nsupport for the present management structure expressed in Section 8147 \nof Public Law 105-262. That appropriations law directed the Department \nto establish a Defense Reform Initiative enterprise program for \nmilitary manpower, personnel, training and compensation using a revised \nDIHMRS project as the baseline. Additionally, the amendment also \nexpresses the intention that the DoD maintain this enterprise project, \nand the management and executive responsibility be contained within the \nSystems Executive Office for Manpower and Personnel.\n  The President's budget request includes $65 million dollars for \nDIHMRS. I believe that these monies must be used according to the \ndirection given in last year's Defense Appropriation's conference \nreport to maintain the success of the program. Specifically, these \nfunds should be used to: (1) address modernization and migration \nsystems support for service information systems within the enterprise \nof manpower, personnel, training and compensation; (2) to continue \nsupport for infrastructure improvements at the Naval Information \nTechnology Center; and, (3) to continue Navy central design activity \nconsolidations and relocations already begun under the Systems \nExecutive Officer and the Naval Reserve Information Systems Office.\n  The consolidation of the personnel information reform efforts is \nnecessary for both budgetary concerns, and valuable as a tool for \nmanaging our soldiers, sailors and airmen better. I believe that DIHMRS \nwill make an invaluable contribution to that effort. I thank the \nmangers for accepting this amendment, and I look forward to working \nwith the Navy to make this project a real success.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 500\n\n (Purpose: To authorize a demonstration program on open enrollment in \n     managed care plans of the former uniformed services treatment \n                              facilities)\n\n       In title VII, at the end of subtitle A, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 705. OPEN ENROLLMENT DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 724 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104-201; 10 U.S.C. 1073 note) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) Open Enrollment Demonstration Program.--(1) The \n     Secretary of Defense shall conduct a demonstration program \n     under which covered beneficiaries shall be permitted to \n     enroll at any time in a managed care plan offered by a \n     designated provider consistent with the enrollment \n     requirements for the TRICARE Prime option under the TRICARE \n     program but without regard to the limitation in subsection \n     (b).

The \n     report shall include, at a minimum, an evaluation of the \n     benefits of the open enrollment opportunity to covered \n     beneficiaries and a recommendation concerning whether to \n     authorize open enrollments in the managed care plans of \n     designated providers permanently.''.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, access to quality health care concerns many \nof our military men and women, both active and retired. My amendment \nwould allow the Department of Defense to start a pilot project allowing \ncontinuous open enrollment in managed health care plans form military \nretirees at 2 sites selected by the Defense Department.\n  The term ``continuous enrollment'' means the opportunity for military \nbeneficiaries to join the Prime option in TRICARE at any time. \nCurrently, military retirees and their beneficiaries wishing to enroll \nin the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan (USFHP) may only do so \nduring an annual 30-day long, open session.\n  This arrangement inconsistent with the enrollment rules under TRICARE \nPrime option. These same beneficiaries can join TRICARE Prime on a \ncontinuous basis, but are restricted from joining the USFHP to joint \nonce a year for a 30-day period.\n  Coupled with the many changes in TriCare, including new enrollment \nfees and higher copayments, many military beneficiaries are confused \nand unsure if the HMO option in TriCare, either Prime through the \nmanaged care support contractor of the USFHP, is the right choice for \nthem and their families. Thus, as I have been informed by physicians \nfrom my own state, many beneficiaries and their families have decided \nnot to join either program.\n  What this restriction means in practical terms for retirees is that \nthey are not able to take advantage of health are providers that may \npractice in close proximity to their residences, but instead travel \nsignificant distances to a military treatment facility. In locations \nwhere there are no TriCare Prime network providers, the retirees are \naced with limited choices and higher costs.\n  The Department of Defense has indicate that this open enrollment \nwould be too costly; however, there is limited data to support their \ncontention that this provision will generate a significant influx of \nnew enrollees in the program. DOD's key concerns are based on two \nfactors; the possible increase in cost due to the number of enrollees, \nand the risk adjustment in the Medicare program scheduled to take \neffect January 1, 2000. However, based on a review of the actual \nenrollment data the number of people enrolled in the USFHP program has \nactually declined from 29,256 in October 1997 to 26,950 in March 1999.\n  This trend represents a decline of 7.6% over eighteen months and an \nannual rate of decline of 5.0%.\n  As of June 1, six of seven designated providers which operate the \nUSFHP will have completed ``open season'' enrollment. The preliminary \nresults show a net increase of 3,754 individuals enrolled in the USFHP. \nOf this number, approximately 18% or 676, were 65 and older. This is a \nmuch lower percentage--18% compared to 28%--than the 65 and older \nenrollees were as a percentage of enrollment before the current open \nseason started.\n  This amendment would authorize the Department of Defense to \ndemonstrate the continuous open enrollment program at a minimum of two \nsites for a two year period. During the second year of the \ndemonstration period, DOD would submit a report to Congress evaluation \nthe benefits of the program and a recommendation concerning\n\n[[Page S6238]]\n\nwhether the authorize open enrollments in the managed care plans on a \npermanent basis.\n  This proposal is supported by numerous organizations such as the \nNational Military Family Association and the National Military and \nVeterans Alliance. The national Military and Veterans Alliance includes \norganizations such as: The Retired Officers Association, Non-\nCommissioned Officers Association, Naval Reserve Association, National \nAssociation of Uniformed Services, the Reserve Enlisted Association and \nthe Korean War Veterans Association.\n  In testimony before the Personnel Subcommittee earlier this year, \nrepresentatives from many of these organizations have emphasized that \naccess to quality health care is one of their primary concerns.\n  Finally, I believe that this amendment is a measured step, but one \nthat leads us toward a fair and good faith effort to address the \ninconsistency in providing our retirees access to health care on an \nequal basis with TriCare Prime.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 501\n\n       (Purpose: To require a report on the D-5 missile program)\n\n       On page 28, below line 21, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 143.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf \nof myself and Senator Lautenberg. The purpose of this amendment is to \nencourage the Secretaries of each military department to give due \nconsideration to providing a higher priority to the officers from \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for attendance at our military \nschools and training programs. Our professional military schools and \ntraining programs including the service academies, the senior service \ncolleges and the command and general staff colleges provide an \noutstanding opportunity for these officers to become fully immersed in \nour military doctrine and develop a deeper understanding for the \nAmerican military culture. As new member nations of NATO, it is \nimportant that the officers of these countries become fully integrated \nas quickly as possible. The professional friendships and the mutual \nunderstanding which results from attendance at these courses is \ninvaluable for both American officers and for foreign military \nofficers.\n  I recently led a Congressional delegation to the Balkans. In Budapest \nwe met with Hungarian Chief of Defense Staff, General Ferenc Vegh, who \nwas proud to inform the delegation that he was a graduate of the United \nStates Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. As a direct result \nof the professional association gained as a student at the War College, \nGeneral Vegh has been key in directing Hungary's rapid integration into \nNATO. His story is simply one example among many of how the United \nStates and the NATO Alliance has reaped an enormous benefit by \nproviding the opportunity for foreign officer attendance at our \nmilitary schools.\n  Attendance at our service academies on a priority basis will also \nprovide an outstanding opportunity for future officers from our new \nNATO allies to foster long-term relationships with future U.S. military \nleaders. Historically, the relationships fostered through attendance at \nthe Military Academy, the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy among \nAmerican and foreign cadets over the four-year curriculum at the \nservice academies have formed the basis for closer long-term military-\nto-military relations. Numerous foreign cadets who have graduated from \nour service academies have gone on to serve at the very highest levels \nas military and civilian leaders, including many heads of state.\n  It is my expectation that this legislation will encourage the \nSecretaries of our military departments to give the officers and cadets \nfrom Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, our new NATO allies, a \npriority for attendance at our professional military schools and \nacademies.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 504\n\n(Purpose: To enhance the technology of health care quality surveillance \n                          and accountability)\n\n       In title VII, at the end of subtitle B, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 717.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization bill regarding Russian \nnonproliferation and U.S.-Russian cooperation on commercial space \nlaunch service.\n  This amendment is very simple: It states that a sustained Russian \ncommitment to cooperation with the United States in preventing the \nproliferation of ballistic missile technology to Iran can provide the \nbasis for an increase in the current quota limit on commercial space \nlaunches. Lifting the launch quota is an important incentive for Russia \nto cooperate with the U.S. on this issue.\n  This amendment also demands continued Russian cooperation on non-\nproliferation, and calls on the United\n\n[[Page S6240]]\n\nStates to take every appropriate measure to encourage the Russian \ngovernment to seek out and prevent the illegal transfer of fissile \nmaterial or missile equipment or any other technology necessary for the \nacquisition or development of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles.\n  I offer this amendment because I believe that there may be no greater \nlong term threat to peace and stability in the Middle East than an Iran \nactively seeking ballistic missile and nuclear weapons.\n  Preventing the transfer of illegal nuclear and missile technology \nfrom Russia to Iran must be at the top of the U.S. policy agenda.\n  There have been numerous reports over the past several years of \nRussian missile technology reaching Iran, sometimes with a semi-\nofficial wink from government authorities in Moscow, sometimes by rogue \noperators.\n  Either way, the Russian Government must put a stop to these \ntransfers.\n  As much as we want good relations with Russia, cooperation in this \narea is crucial. In some ways, I believe it is a litmus test of what \nsort of player Russia wants to be in the post-cold war international \nsystem.\n  There is ample reason for concern. According to a Congressional \nResearch Service report:\n  Despite pledges by Soviet leaders in 1990 and by various Russian \nleaders since then to ban missile exports, President Yeltsin's 1994 \nagreement to refrain from new arms sales to Iran, and Russia's entry \ninto the Missile Technology Control Regime in October 1995, there are \nrecurring reports that Russian companies are selling missile technology \nto Iran and other countries.\n  On February 6, 1997, Vice President Gore issued a diplomatic warning \nto then-Premier Chernomyrdin regarding Russian transfers to Iran of \nparts and technology associated with SS-4 medium-range ballistic \nmissiles. Over the next several months, press reports indicated that \nRussian enterprises provided Iran specialty steels and alloys, tungsten \ncoated graphite, wind tunnel facilities, gyroscopes and other guidance \ntechnology, rocket engine and fuel technology, laser equipment, machine \ntools, and maintenance manuals.\n  Russian assistance has apparently helped Iran overcome a number of \nobstacles and advance its missile development program faster than \nexpected. The Rumsfeld Commission said, ``The ballistic missile \ninfrastructure in Iran is now more sophisticated than that of North \nKorea and has benefitted from broad, essential assistance from Russia. \n* * *''\n  In February 1998, the Washington Times reported that Russia's Federal \nSecurity Service (FSB, a successor to the KGB) was still working with \nIran's intelligence service to pass technology through a joint research \ncenter, Persepolis, with facilities in St. Petersburg and Tehran.\n  In March 1998, the State Department listed (but did not make public) \n20 Russian entities suspected of transferring missile technology to \nIran.\n  Lastly, there are still unanswered questions about Russian-Iranian \nnuclear cooperation raised by the January, 1995 contract signed by the \nRussian nuclear agency MINATOM to finish one unit of the Bushehr \nnuclear power project. Although the Bushehr plant itself is not \nconsidered a source of weapons material, the project is viewed as a \nproliferation risk because it entails massive involvement of Iranian \npersonnel in nuclear technology, and extensive training and \ntechnological support from Russian nuclear experts.\n  Last year, the American Jewish Committee released a report, ``The \nRussian Connection: Russia, Iran, and the Proliferation of Weapons of \nMass Destruction'' which provides an excellent overview of Russia's \nrecord in this area, as well as U.S.-Russian cooperation.\n  In addition to the troubling questions raised by some of Russia's \npast actions, however, there are also indications that the Russian \ngovernment is making efforts to control the proliferation of missile \nand nuclear technology to Iran.\n  Although initially Moscow denied that its missiles or missile \ntechnology had been transferred to Iran, in September 1997, Russian \nofficials reportedly stated that such transfers were being made without \nthe consent of the government.\n  In January 1998, in response to concerns raised by numerous U.S. \nofficials, Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency, said of 13 \ncases raised by the U.S. Government, 11 had no connection to technology \ntransfers related to weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, \nor chemical) that were banned under a 1996 agreement.\n  On July 15, 1998, Russian authorities announced that nine Russian \nentities were being investigated for suspected violation of laws \ngoverning export of dual-use technologies. The nine include the Inor \nNPO, Polyus Research Institute, and Baltic State Technical University \ncited earlier, plus the Grafit Research Institute, Tikhomirov \nInstitute, the MOSO Company, the Komintern plant (Novosibirsk), \nEuropalace 2000, and Glavcosmos.\n  Also last year, Russia announced the cancellation of a 1997 contract \nbetween a Russian entity, NPO Trud, and Iran in which rocket engine \ncomponents were to have been shipped under the guise of gas pipeline \ncompressors.\n  According to an April 15 letter I received from the Vice President, \nwhich I would like to submit for the Record, U.S. Special Ambassador \nGallucci and Mr. Koptev have agreed to a work plan that addresses many \nof the concerns the U.S. has about missile proliferation, including the \nestablishment of internal compliance offices at several of the entities \nof concern.\n  U.S. experts have also developed a work plan with the Russian \nMinistry of Atomic Energy on measures to sever the links between \nNIKIET, a leading Russian nuclear institute, and Iran, according to the \nVice President.\n  I believe that we should try to build on Russia's record of \ncooperation, and that the best and most effective way to work with \nRussia on this issue is to offer them a carrot--lifting the launch \nquota--as an inducement to continued cooperation on this vital matter.\n  The current quota on commercial space launches is set at sixteen. \nPending Russian cooperation, I believe that this quota can be raised to \n20 and, if Russia continues to cooperate, incrementally raised again in \nthe coming years. Each launch provides Russia with approximately $100 \nmillion in hard currency--a good incentive to cooperate.\n  This amendment also states, however, that the United States must \ncontinue to demand full and complete cooperation from Russia on this \nissue, and that the United States should take every appropriate measure \nto assure that the government of Russia continues to cooperate on this \nissue.\n  Russia must understand that just as we are willing to offer \ninducements to cooperate, there will also be a price to be paid for \nnon-cooperation on this critical issue.\n  This amendment, I believe, is rather simple and straightforward in \nits make-up. But it is also essential and far reaching in its impact. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter I received dated April 15, 1999, \nfrom the Vice President be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The Vice President,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your recent letter \n     requesting that I raise the issue of non-proliferation with \n     Russian Prime Minister Primakov during his planned visit to \n     Washington. Cutting off the flow of missile and nuclear \n     technologies from Russian entities to Iran is one of the \n     Administration's most important national security objectives. \n     As you know, I have engaged my Russian counterparts on this \n     issue for the past several years, most recently in January \n     when I saw Prime Minister Primakov in Davos.\n       It was my intention to raise this issue again with the \n     Prime Minister last month, but our planned meeting was \n     postponed. I can report, however, that over the past several \n     weeks United States and Russian experts developed concrete \n     plans to curtail cooperation by Russian entities with Iran's \n     nuclear and missile programs. Because of intelligence and \n     security consideration, I will outline only the core elements \n     of the work plans in this letter. My staff can arrange a \n     classified briefing if that would be helpful.\n       U.S. Special Ambassador Gallucci and Yuri Koptev, head of \n     the Russian Space Agency, agreed to a work plan that \n     addresses some of our most pressing concerns about missile \n     proliferation. As a central element of this plan--and as a \n     direct result of my earlier intercession with Mr. Primakov--\n     Mr. Koptev\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\n     agreed to cancel a contract with Iran's missile program and \n     to establish on a priority basis internal compliance offices \n     at several entities of concern. These internal compliance \n     offices would be staffed by individuals specially trained in \n     export control procedures and techniques, and would have \n     access to the records they need to do their jobs. The United \n     States Government has offered technical assistance to help \n     these entities set up the necessary export control \n     procedures. The Russian government has committed to take \n     effective measures to prohibit Iranian missile specialists \n     from operating in Russia and to facilitate the early adoption \n     of the Russian export control law.\n       The missile work plan represents some forward movement and \n     in my judgment reflects Russia's intense desire to see the \n     launch quota increased and sanctions lifted. It is not, \n     however, a complete accounting for past problems. It may \n     create a credible foundation to inhibit future cooperation. I \n     have underscored that we will be watching Russian \n     implementation of the agreement closely. I have also made \n     clear that a solid track record is needed for us to consider \n     an increase in the launch quota.\n       United States experts have also developed a work plan with \n     the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy on measures to sever \n     the links between NIKIET, a leading Russian nuclear \n     institute, and Iran. Again, the key principle underlying this \n     work plan is performance, which we are in a position to judge \n     through our intelligence information. If we are satisfied \n     that Russia's commitments are being implemented, we can begin \n     to incrementally lift our sanctions against NIKIET, beginning \n     with the nuclear reactor safety projects that have been \n     suspended.\n       The work plans I have described could represent a path \n     forward if the Russian government acts effectively and \n     quickly. I am by no means ready to suggest that we have \n     resolved either the missile or the nuclear proliferation \n     problem. However, we now have a clear delineation of steps in \n     that direction which we are in a position to verify. \n     Positive, concrete actions by Russia will be the basis for \n     any decisions we take to increase commercial and other forms \n     of cooperation with Russian space and nuclear entities.\n       I will continue to raise this issue in discussions with my \n     Russian counterparts until I am satisfied that all our \n     concerns have been addressed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Al Gore.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 507\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Of the funds in section 301a(5), $23,000,000 shall be made \n     available to the American Red Cross to fund the Armed Forces \n     Emergency Services.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 508\n\n (Purpose: To require the Department of Defense and the Department of \n   Veterans Affairs to carry out joint telemedicine and telepharmacy \n                        demonstration projects)\n\n       On page 272, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 717.

Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to create a \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \ncollaborative demonstration research pilot for at least five sites \nnationwide. These funded projects would create and expand current \ntelemedicine and telepharmacy research efforts. In these times of \nconcern over health care resources, telemedicine and telepharmacy \nstudies are crucial to determining the best use of health care \nclinicians.\n  My amendment would authorize $5 million a year for three years for \nfive DoD/VA Telemedicine and Telepharmacy demonstration projects. Under \nmy proposal DoD/VA researchers and clinicians will develop rigorous, \noutcome-oriented telemedicine and telepharmacy research projects that \nwill benefit military and veteran study participants and potentially \nfuture servicemembers and veteran recipients of health care.\n  Telemedicine is technology's version of the ``doctor's housecall.'' \nMany recipients of care, such as the homebound, find making a visit to \nthe doctor a very difficult and often painful experience. Health care \noutreach is needed in the home, remote deployment sites, rural clinics \nand other underserved areas. I also propose a telepharmacy project, \nwhich will study more efficient ways to bring drug and pharmaceutical \nexpertise, as well as supplies, to the patient. For example, the Navy \nhas reported its Battlegroup Telemedicine Program as cost-saving and \ngroundbreaking in providing onboard ship medical treatment of military \npersonnel, thus preventing unnecessary transport.\n  Support of collaborative endeavors between DoD and VA to reduce \nescalating health care costs and for more accessible, quality care has \nalready been strongly advocated and discussed in the 1999 Report of the \nCongressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition \nassistance and endorsed by the Congress in the Cleland-Kempthorne Bill, \nS. 1334, which was made part of the Strom Thurmond National Defense \nAuthorization Act (P. L. 105-261).\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to further advance DoD/\nVA collaboration, to explore innovative ways of providing health care \nfor veterans and members of the Armed Services and possible cost-\nreduction strategies, and to help military and veterans' health care \nset an example of quality health care.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 509\n\n (Purpose: To permit certain members of the Armed Forces not currently \nparticipating in the Montgomery GI Bill educational assistance program \n                    to participate in that program)\n\n       On page 254, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 676.

Mr. President, this amendment is meant to assist the men \nand women serving in our armed forces in attaining an education. This \namendment is targeted at a group serving in our military that has been \nforgotten since the passage of the Montgomery GI Bill.\n  Before the GI Bill was enacted in 1985, new servicemen were invited \nto participate in a program called the Veterans' Educational Assistance \nProgram or VEAP. This program offered only a modest return on the \nservice member's investment and, as a consequence, provided little \nassistance to men and women in the armed services who wanted to pursue \nadditional education. It was and is inferior to the Montgomery GI Bill \nthat every new serviceman is offered today.\n  My amendment would allow active duty members of the armed services \nwho entered the service after December 31, 1976 and before July 1, 1985 \nand who are or were otherwise eligible for the Veterans' Educational \nAssistance Program to participate in the Montgomery GI bill. This group \nof military professionals largely consists of the mid-career and senior \nnoncommissioned officer ranks of our services--the exact group that new \nrecruits have as mentors and leaders.\n  If we really believe in the importance of providing our service men \nand women with the education opportunities afforded by the Montgomery \nGI bill, it is critical that we offer all service members the \nopportunity to participate if they choose.\n  It is important to remember that much of the impetus for the creation \nof the Montgomery GI Bill was that the Veterans' Educational Assistance \nProgram was not doing the job. It was not providing sufficient \nassistance for young men and women to go to college. It was expensive \nfor them to participate, and provided little incentive for young men \nand women to enter the military.\n  The Montgomery GI Bill offers those serving in the military a \nsignificant increase in benefits over its predecessor and has been one \nof the most important recruiting tools over the last decade. It is \nessential that active military still covered under VEAP but not by the \nMontgomery GI Bill be brought into the fold.\n  The injustice that my bill attempts to address is that new recruits \nare eligible for a better education program than the noncommissioned \nofficers responsible for their training and well-being. Expanding \nMontgomery Bill eligibility to those currently eligible for VEAP would, \nin many cases, help mid-career and senior noncommissioned officers, who \nare the backbone of our force and set the example for younger troops, \nbecome better educated. This legislation is modest in its scope and \napproach, but is enormously important for the individual attempting to \nbetter himself through education.\n  Moreover, this legislation sends a meaningful message to those \nserving to protect the American interest that Congress cares. S. 4, the \nSoldiers, Sailors, Airman, and Marines Bill of Rights Act which I was \nproud to cosponsor was an enormous step in this direction, and my \nlegislation complements that effort.\n  Some of the common sense provisions of this amendment are:\n  1. Regardless of previous enrollment or disenrollment in the VEAP, \nactive military personnel may choose to participate in the GI Bill.\n  2. Participation for VEAP-eligible members in the GI Bill is to be \nbased on the same ``buy in requirements'' as are currently applicable \nto any new GI Bill participant. For example, an active duty member is \nrequired to pay $100 a month for twelve months in order to be eligible \nfor the Montgomery GI Bill. The same would be required of someone \npreviously eligible for VEAP.\n  3. Any active duty member who has previously declined participation \nin the GI bill may also participate.\n  4. There will be a one year period of eligibility for enrollment.\n  I believe that if we are to maintain the best trained, and most \ncapable military force in the world, we must be committed to allowing \nthe people that comprise our armed forces to pursue further education \nopportunities. I believe that the modest amendment will have a positive \neffect on morale and give our noncommissioned officers additional \nopportunities for self-improvement and life-long learning. I ask for my \ncolleagues support in this effort. thank you Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\n                           amendment no. 510\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to continue \npayment of monthly educational assistance benefits to veterans enrolled \n    at educational institutions during periods between terms if the \n       interval between such periods does not exceed eight weeks)\n\n       On page 254, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 676.

Mr. President, this amendment, which I offer along with \nSenator Voinovich, would fix an unintended oversight in veterans' \neducational benefits. This amendment is similar to legislation I \nintroduced along with my distinguished Ohio colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Bob Ney, who is the leader of this effort.\n  Currently, the law allows qualified veterans to receive their monthly \neducational assistance benefits when they are enrolled at educational \ninstitutions during periods between terms, if the period does not \nexceed 4 weeks. This allowance was established to enable enrolled \nveterans to continue to receive their benefits during the December/\nJanuary holidays.\n  The problem with the current time period is that it only covers \nveterans enrolled at educational institutions that operate on the \nsemester system. Obviously, many educational institutions, including \nseveral in Ohio, work on the quarter system, which can have a vacation \nperiod of eight weeks between the first and second quarters during the \nwinter holiday season. As a result, many veterans unfairly lose their \nbenefits during this period because of the institution's course \nstructure.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that some educational \ninstitutions that have a sizable veteran enrollment frequently create a \none credit hour course on military history or a similar topic \nspecifically geared towards veterans in order for them to remain \nenrolled and eligible for their educational benefits. It is my \nunderstanding that, the cost of extending the current eligibility \nperiod to eight weeks would have a minimal, if not negligible, cost.\n  The Department of Veterans' Administration has recognized the need to \ncorrect this oversight and assisted in the drafting of this legislation \nand has given it their full support.\n  I have no doubt that this very simple fix will be well-received by \nour veterans and the educational institutions that operate under the \nquarter system. I already know that Wright State University, Bowling \nGreen State University, Ohio University and Methodist Theological \nSchool in Ohio have expressed their support for this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this common sense fix and allow all \nveterans to receive the uninterrupted educational assistance they \nearned.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 511\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the transfer of a naval vessel to Thailand)\n\n       In title X, at the end of subtitle B, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1013.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX TREATMENT OF \n                   MEMBERS RECEIVING SPECIAL PAY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that members of the Armed \n     Forces who receive special pay for duty subject to hostile \n     fire or imminent danger (37 U.S.C. 310) should receive the \n     same tax treatment as members serving in combat zones.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the Sense of the \nSenate that income received by a member of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States while receiving special pay should be tax exempt.\n  Currently, members of the U.S. Armed Forces who serve in a ``combat \nzone'' receive special tax exemptions. For example, they do not have to \npay excise taxes on phone calls that they make from the combat zone. \nNor do they have to pay income taxes on the money earned while in that \nzone.\n  My amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the tax \nexemptions should be triggered when the Secretary of Defense designates \nhis employees as eligible for ``special pay'' based on hostile \nconditions. Members of the Armed Forces receive special pay under Title \n37, United States Code, Section 310 when: (a) subject to hostile fire; \n(b) on duty in which he, or others with him, are in imminent danger of \nsuch fire; (c) were killed, injured or wounded by hostile fire or (d) \nwere on duty in a foreign area in which he was subject to the threat of \nphysical harm or imminent danger on the basis of civil insurrection, \ncivil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions.\n  The original tax exemption for combat pay was put in place during the \nKorean War. But given the current uses of our Armed Forces, it makes \nsense to update the provision for soldiers in hostile zones.\n  And I also believe that making this change in the Tax Code would \ncorrect an inequity. I think it is only right that soldiers in the \nKosovo engagement are receiving the tax exemptions. But during a recent \nvisit to Fort Bragg, many soldiers and their families commented that \nthe same benefits should have been extended to the soldiers who served \nin Haiti and in Somalia. I have to say that I agreed with them. Indeed, \nI will introduce legislation after Memorial Day to implement this Sense \nof the Senate.\n  This Sense of the Senate addresses the new realities of the post-cold \nwar world that repeatedly affects the members of our armed forces and \ntheir families. As the Senate knows all too well, the end of the cold \nwar brought with it a significant drawdown in the size of our armed \nforces and a withdrawal from an overseas based force to one based \nprimarily in the United States. Almost concurrently, our national \nsecurity strategy has lead us into an era of seemingly continuous \ndeployments. In the 40 years between 1950 and 1990, the U.S. Army was \ndeployed 10 times. In the less than 10 years since the fall of the \nBerlin Wall, the Army has been deployed 33 times. The Navy's responses \nhave doubled in the 90's. The Air Force has seen its deployed forces \nrise 400 percent while its active duty personnel dropped 33 percent. \nSome of these deployments are a few months in duration; some are part \nof a continuous presence--such as our forces in the Sinai. All work \nhardship on both the members deployed and their families, particularly \nwhen there are repeated or back-to-back deployments.\n  Again, as the Senate well knows these demands are contributing to \nboth recruitment and retention problems. In recognition of these \ndemands and of the likelihood that we will continue to see more of \nthese deployments, this Sense of the Senate recognizes that we need to \nbring our Tax Code up to date so that it too acknowledges these new \nrealities.\n  As we approach Memorial Day, I ask the Senate to approve this \namendment as a means of acknowledging the sacrifices demanded of our \nservice members and their families.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 515\n\n (Purpose: To increase the funding for the Formerly Used Defense Sites \n                                account)\n\n       (1) On page 56, line 16, add ``$40,000,000''.\n       (2) On page 55, line 15, reduce ``$40,000,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 516\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the portions of the military lands withdrawals \n                 relating to lands located in Arizona)\n\n       In section 2902, strike subsection (a).\n       In section 2902, redesignate subsections (b), (c), and (d) \n     as subsections (a), (b), and (c), respectively.\n       In section 2903(c), strike paragraphs (4) and (7).\n       In section 2903(c), redesignate paragraphs (5) and (6) as \n     paragraphs (4) and (5), respectively.\n       In section 2904(a)(1)(A), strike ``(except those lands \n     within a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System)''.\n       In section 2904(a)(1), strike subparagraph (B).\n       In section 2904, strike subsection (g).\n       Strike section 2905.\n       Strike section 2906.\n       Redesignate sections 2907 through 2914 as sections 2905 \n     through 2912, respectively.\n       In section 2907(h), as so redesignated, strike ``section \n     2902(c) or 2902(d)'' and insert ``section 2902(b) or \n     2902(c)''.\n       In section 2908(b), as so redesignated, strike ``section \n     2909(g)'' and insert ``section 2907(g)''.\n       In section 2910, as so redesignated, strike ``, except that \n     hunting,'' and all that follows and insert a period.\n       In section 2911(a)(1), as so redesignated, strike \n     ``subsections (b), (c), and (d)'' and insert ``subsections \n     (a), (b), and (c)''.\n       In section 2911(a)(2), as so redesignated, strike ``, \n     except that lands'' and all that follows and insert a period.\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2912. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING WITHDRAWALS OF CERTAIN \n                   LANDS IN ARIZONA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is vital to the national interest that the \n     withdrawal of the lands withdrawn by section 1(c) of the \n     Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-606), \n     relating to Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range and the Cabeza \n     Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which would otherwise expire \n     in 2001, be renewed in 1999;\n       (2) the renewed withdrawal of such lands is critical to \n     meet the military training requirements of the Armed Forces \n     and to provide the Armed Forces with experience necessary to \n     defend the national interests;\n       (3) the Armed Forces currently carry out environmental \n     stewardship of such lands in a comprehensive and focused \n     manner; and\n       (4) a continuation in high-quality management of United \n     States natural and cultural resources is required if the \n     United States is to preserve its national heritage.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nArizona for sponsoring his amendment relating to the withdrawal of \nlands from the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. I am happy to \ncosponsor it, and I look forward to working with him in the future on \nthis issue.\n  The amendment removes the provision in Title 29 relating to the \nGoldwater Range, and includes nothing more than a placeholder for \nsubsequent consideration of the withdrawals. It is no more than a means \nto ensure that the Administration expeditiously completes its review \nprocess regarding the withdrawals. It is not intended in any way to \nprejudice this process, or to shape the substance of the provisions \nultimately adopted by Congress.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Arizona and I have agreed to work \nopenly and collaboratively on this provision. As the National Wildlife \nRefuge System is within the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, I have a strong interest in the withdrawals of lands \nfrom the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, as well as the Desert \nNational Wildlife Refuge, which will be considered later.\n  Again, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona. I thank him for his willingness \nto address my concerns and to sponsor this amendment. It is always a \ngreat pleasure to work with him and his staff, and I am delighted to \nhave this opportunity to do so again.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would remove from Title 29 \nof the bill all references to renewing the withdrawal from public use \nof the Barry M. Goldwater Range in Arizona. In place of the stricken \nlanguage, I am proposing a ``sense of the Senate'' provision that \nexpresses the clear desire to complete the legislative process of \nrenewing the withdrawal of this land this\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\nyear, both because of its vital importance to military readiness and \nthe environmental and cultural resources that will be preserved and \nprotected by its continued withdrawn status.\n  I offer this amendment reluctantly, but in full recognition of the \nunintended controversy caused by its inclusion in the bill at this \ntime. My intention in including these provisions in the Defense \nAuthorization bill this year was to create a meaningful placeholder in \nthe bill to ensure that legislation withdrawing the Goldwater Range \ncould be enacted during this session of Congress. Based on repeated \nassurances and testimony before Congress, I believe the Administration \nshares that goal, and I intend to pursue inclusion of a final \nlegislative package, developed with input from all interested parties, \nin the conference agreement on this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, my attempt to craft language which remained neutral on \nthe few controversial aspects of the proposed withdrawal appears to \nhave been inadequate. In addition, concerns about the process by which \nthis legislation was developed have also been raised. Therefore, in \norder to ensure that all interested parties have a full opportunity to \nparticipate in the drafting of the final legislation withdrawing the \nGoldwater Range, I am proposing this amendment to replace the existing \nlanguage with a ``sense of the Senate'' provision expressing the desire \nto complete the withdrawal process this year.\n  As I have said, there has been some controversy about the language of \ntitle 29.\n  I appreciate the concerns raised by the leadership of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee concerning their jurisdiction, respectively, over public \nlands management and wildlife refuges. In no way was the inclusion of \nthis language in the bill intended to preclude the ability of those \nCommittees to conduct oversight hearings and provide input in the final \nlegislation to withdraw the Goldwater and other ranges covered in Title \n29. In full respect, however, of these Committees' interest in ensuring \nthis bill in no way prejudices the outcome of the legislative process, \nI agree that a placeholder which simply expresses the desire to the \nSenate to enact legislation this year is more appropriate at this time. \nI fully expect to work closely with all members of the Senate and \ninterested outside parties to reach a consensus on legislation that can \nbe re-inserted in this bill in conference.\n  I also sympathize with the concerns raised by several organizations \nregarding future environmental stewardship of the Goldwater Range, just \nas I fully appreciate and support the need to maintain the availability \nof the range for essential military training.\n  Let me reiterate what I said more fully in my additional views filed \nwith the bill. This language was intended simply to be a placeholder to \nensure that, if an Administration proposal is submitted to Congress \nthis year for the withdrawal of these lands, it can be appropriately \nconsidered in the normal legislative process. I have been and will \nremain committed to ensuring that all viewpoints are heard and \nrespected in crafting the final language of the withdrawal legislation, \nboth because of the importance of the Goldwater Range as a military \ntraining facility, and to preserve and protect the unique environmental \nand cultural resources in this 2.7 million acre area.\n  The placeholder language in Title 29 of the Committee-reported bill \nis generally based on Public Law 99-606, which is the law that \ncurrently governs the status of these lands and which expires in 2001. \nHowever, the language is intentionally silent on many of the difficult \nissues that must be resolved before this legislation can be enacted. \nFor example, the Committee-approved provision does not specify a length \nof time for the withdrawal of the Goldwater Range. The provision is \ndeliberately ambiguous, as is the language of Public Law 99-606 which \ncurrently governs these lands, about whether the Cabeza Prieta is \nwithdrawn or not, and it is silent on the issue of which federal agency \nmanages all or part of the land.\n  At the same time, through the Committee process, the language was \namended to include several additional provisions, not in the current \nlaw, to improve environmental protection and resource management of the \nlands. It mandates at least the same level of resource management and \npreservation be maintained at the range, and requires the Secretary of \nthe Interior to provide a report on any additional recommended \nmanagement measures. It precludes changes in the memorandum of \nunderstanding between the Department of Defense and Department of the \nInterior that governs the management of the Cabeza Prieta without \nnotifying Congress 90 days in advance. It also includes a provision \nrequiring a study and recommendation, to be submitted to Congress \nwithin two years, on the proposal to designate the Goldwater Range as \npart of a Sonoran Desert National Park.\n  The language would have been subject to further negotiation and \namendment, pending submission of the Administration's legislative \nproposal to Congress. However, respecting the concerns raised by others \nabout the content of the placeholder legislation, I am proposing that \nit be stricken.\n  Mr. President, it is vitally important that the Administration \ncomplete the process for renewing the withdrawal of these lands and \nprovide a final legislative proposal to Congress this year. Delaying \nthis issue unnecessarily puts at risk both the tremendous efforts to \nprotect the natural and cultural resources on these lands and the \ncritical need to conduct military training, both of which would end \nwith the expiration of the current law.\n  The Administration has stated their desire to complete the \nlegislative process for withdrawal of these lands during this session \nof the Congress--a goal which I and the Committee fully support--and \nhas now committed to send a final legislative proposal to Congress by \napproximately June 9, 1999. I urge the Administration to finalize and \nsubmit a legislative proposal as early as possible so that all \ninterested parties may review it carefully and efforts can be \nundertaken quickly to achieve a consensus on legislation that can be \nenacted this year in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment can be accepted. I believe I \nhave the support of the able Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner, to try to work out acceptable language on the Goldwater \nRange withdrawal, as well as the Chairmen of the Environment and Energy \nCommittees. I look forward to working with the relevant committees and \ninterested parties to reach a consensus on a final legislative package \nregarding the Goldwater Range that can be included in the conference \nagreement on this bill.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 517\n\n(Purpose: To increase by $2,000,000 the amount authorized for the Navy \n   for procurement of MJU-52/B air expendable countermeasures and to \n     offset the increase by a decrease by $2,000,000 of the amount \n       authorized for the Army for UH-1 helicopter modifications)\n\n       On page 16, line 17, strike ``$1,500,188,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,498,188,000''.\n       On page 17, line 18, strike ``$540,700,000'' and insert \n     ``$542,700,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 518\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize a one-year delay in the demolition of three \ncertain radio transmitting facility towers at Naval Station, Annapolis, \n             Maryland and to facilitate transfer of towers)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title XXVIII, add the \n     following: SEC: ONE-YEAR DELAY IN DEMOLITION OF RADIO \n     TRANSMITTING FACILITY TOWERS AT NAVAL STATION, ANNAPOLIS, \n     MARYLAND, TO FACILITATE TRANSFER OF TOWERS.\n       (a) One-Year Delay.--The Secretary of the Navy may not \n     obligate or expend any funds for the demolition of the naval \n     radio transmitting towers described in subsection (b) during \n     the one-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Covered Towers.--The naval radio transmitting towers \n     described in this subsection are the three southeastern most \n     naval radio transmitting towers located at Naval Station, \n     Annapolis, Maryland that are scheduled for demolition as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Transfer of Towers.--The Secretary may transfer to the \n     State of Maryland, or the County of Anne Arundel, Maryland, \n     all right, title, and interest (including maintenance \n     responsibility) of the United States in and to the towers \n     described in subsection (b) if the State of Maryland or the \n     County of Anne Arundel, Maryland, as the case may be, agrees \n     to accept such right, title, and interest (including accrued \n     maintenance responsibility) during the one-year period \n     referred to in subsection (a).\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                           amendment No. 519\n\n (Purpose: To impose certain requirements relating to the recovery and \n  identification of remains of World War II servicemen in the Pacific \n                         theater of operations)\n\n       In title X, at the end of subtitle D, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1061.

I \ncan't begin to tell you how moved I was to attend this funeral and \nlisten to the eulogy about this young pilot, who joined the Army the \nday after Pearl Harbor, went on to get his wings in the Army Air Corps, \nmarried his sweetheart, only to have to leave her two days later. He \nwas never to come home. He was lost over the jungles of New Guinea \nflying his P-47 Thunderbolt in 1943.\n  Fifty-three years later, in 1996, his remains inside his crashed \nplane were accidently located by a private American citizen, Mr. Fred \nHagen, who was searching for his great uncle's B-25 bomber.\n  Only then, did the emotional rollercoaster ride for the surviving \nelderly family members really begin because it took almost 3 additional \nyears, and my continuous intervention along the way, for the remains to \nbe formally recovered and identified by the Army. There was political \ninstability in New Guinea at one point, and that delayed things, and \nthere were also competing priorities that the Army was trying to \nbalance.\n  That case is now behind us, but I am aware that there are other World \nWar II crashsites in New Guinea where the remains of American \nservicemen are presently located, yet they have not been formally \nrecovered by the Army. Indeed, Mr. President, I would like to enclose \nfor the record a letter I received yesterday from one American who has \nlocated several crash sites in New Guinea.\n  All this amendment does, Mr. President, is ensure that the Army works \nhard at locating, excavating, and identifying remains from these crash \nsites. By passing this amendment, we increase the likelihood that some \nof these families of missing World War II aviators will finally have a \ngrave at which to lay flowers during a future Memorial Day. It's the \nleast we can do, Mr. President, to honor those who made the ultimate \nsacrifice, and their aging family members.\n  Accounting for missing servicemen from World War II is just as \nimportant as accounting for missing servicemen from the Vietnam or \nKorean Wars. Each of these brave men made the ultimate sacrifice for \ntheir country. This amendment makes sure every effort is made to \naccount for these missing servicemen.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Alfred (Fred) Hagen,\n\n                                                 Philadelphia, PA.\n     Senator Smith,\n     c/o Dino Carluccio.\n       Dear Sir: In September, 1998 Cil-Hi apparently flew over \n     the site of a B-25 that I found in November, 1997 and decided \n     that the site should not be recovered due to the danger of \n     landslides and the difficulty of working on the precipitous \n     slope. If Cil-Hi does not change their position on this \n     matter, I plan to organize a private team and recover the \n     site myself.\n       We were able to identify the plane as a B-25D-I, #41-30182, \n     38th Bomb Group, 71st Bomb Squadron. The B-25 had departed \n     Saidor on a shuttle flight to Nadzab on July 1, 1944@0907. \n     There were 9 persons aboard:\n       They were: Pilot, Richard Hurst, 1st Lt.; Co-Pilot, James \n     Henderson, 1st Lt.; Navigator, Aloysius Steele, 2nd Lt.; \n     Radio/Gunner, John Creighton, Pfc.; Gunner, Henry Miga, Sgt.; \n     Passenger, A. Milazzo, TEC 5; Passenger, B. Durham, Pfc.; \n     Passenger, S. Russell; Pfc.; Passenger, G. Norris, Cpl.\n       Their exact fate had been unknown until Friday, November \n     7th, 1997. I picked up the bones of what turned out to be \n     partial remains of three men and put them in my backpack. The \n     remains had already been moved by the natives and no site \n     integrity was lost by my action. I returned the remains to \n     the US Ambassador in Port Moresby.\n       After years of searching, I also located the wreckage of \n     the B-25 in which my late relative Major Bill Benn was killed \n     in 1957. The spot was located in very rugged terrain in 1957 \n     and was visited by an Australian who performed a cursory \n     ``look around'', salvaged a few bones and left. The site is \n     littered with remains. I returned a number of bones to Cil-Hi \n     after my June 1998 visit and requested that they do a formal \n     site investigation. The site has never been visited by a US \n     serviceman, in fact, there is little doubt in my mind that no \n     one had re-visited the site until my team located in it 1998. \n     The scarce remains of the crew were interred in a single box \n     in Zachary Taylor National Cemetery (chosen due to its \n     central location). I would like all the recoverable remains \n     to come home, the 1957 burial site exhumed and all the \n     remains to be segregated utilizing today's DNA technology. It \n     would be very meaningful to my family to be able to give Bill \n     Benn a proper burial in Arlington, minutes away from the \n     residence of his widow and daughter.\n       I don't think that is too much to ask for a man who \n     received the following commendation from General Kenney ``No \n     one in the theatre made a greater contribution to victory \n     than Bill Benn''. He has subsequently been forgotten by the \n     world but not by his family.\n       This may not be a high priority for Cil-Hi because the case \n     is supposedly already resolved. The bulk of remains appear to \n     still be in New Guinea, however, and the question is whether \n     it is good enough to appear to recover remains or whether the \n     US military is committed enough to recover all possible \n     remains. I cut a large heli-pad nearby and the site is \n     readily accessible. I am also willing to accompany the team \n     to guide them and render any assistance possible.\n       I appreciate your interest and assistance. I understand \n     that you are busy and probably not available on short notice \n     but I want to invite you to attend the burial of another P-47 \n     pilot that I discovered in New Guinea named George Gaffney. \n     He is being buried at Arlington on June 9th, 1999. After I \n     found Desilets, Gaffney's daughter contacted me and asked me \n     to look for her father. In what can only be described as a \n     ``miraculous'' turn of good fortune, I succeeded in finding \n     his remains.\n           Thank you so much.\n                                                       Fred Hagen.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 520\n\n         (Purpose: To make technical and clarifying amendments)\n\n       On page 33, beginning on line 3, strike ``that involve'' \n     and insert ``, as well as for use for''.\n       On page 278, line 4, strike ``1998'' and insert ``1999''.\n       On page 283, line 19, strike ``(A)'' and insert ``(1)''.\n       On page 283, line 23, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 284, line 3, strike ``(C)'' and insert ``(3)''.\n       On page 368, line 14, strike ``$40,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$85,000,000''.\n       On page 397, beginning on line 2, strike ``readily \n     accessible and adequately preserved artifacts and readily \n     accessible representations'' and insert ``adequately visited \n     and adequately preserved artifacts and representations''.\n       On page 411, in the table below line 12, strike the item \n     relating to ``Naval Air Station Atlanta, Georgia''.\n       On page 412, in the table above line 1, strike \n     ``$744,140,000'' in the amount column in the item relating to \n     the total and insert ``$738,710,000''.\n       On page 413, in the table following line 2, strike the \n     first item relating to Naval Base, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and \n     insert the following new item:\n\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        Naval Base, Pearl Harbor.  133 Units....................     $30,168,000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       On page 414, line 6, strike ``$2,078,015,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,072,585,000''.\n       On page 414, line 9, strike ``$673,960,000'' and insert \n     ``$668,530,000''.\n       On page 429, line 20, strike ``$179,271,000'' and insert \n     ``$189,639,000''.\n       On page 429, line 21, strike ``$115,185,000'' and insert \n     ``$104,817,000''.\n       On page 429, line 23, strike ``$23,045,000'' and insert \n     ``$28,475,000''.\n       On page 509, line 10, strike ``$892,629,000'' and insert \n     ``$880,629,000''.\n       On page 509, line 16, strike ``$88,290,000'' and insert \n     ``$100,290,000''.\n       On page 509, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Project 00-D-____, Transuranic waste treatment, Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee, $12,000,000.\n       Project 00-D-400, Site Operations Center, Idaho National \n     Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Idaho Falls, Idaho, \n     $1,306,000.\n       On page 541, line 22, strike ``The'' and insert ``After \n     five members of the Commission have been appointed under \n     paragraph (1), the''.\n       On page 542, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       (8) The Commission may commence its activities under this \n     section upon the designation of the chairman of the \n     Commission under paragraph (4).\n       On page 546, strike lines 20 through 23.\n       On page 547, line 1, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 577, line 16, strike ``PROJECT'' and insert \n     ``PLANT''.\n       On page 577, line 23, strike ``Project'' and insert \n     ``Plant''.\n       On page 578, line 3, strike ``Project'' and insert \n     ``Plant''.\n       On page 578, line 6, strike ``Project'' and insert \n     ``Plant''.\n       On page 578, line 14, strike ``Project'' and insert \n     ``Plant''.\n       On page 578, strike lines 17 through 21, and insert the \n     following:\n       (3) That, to the maximum extent practicable, shipments of \n     waste from the Rocky Flats Plant to the Waste Isolation Pilot \n     Plant will be carried out on an expedited schedule, but not \n     interfere with other shipments of waste to the Waste \n     Isolation Pilot Plant that are planned as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 521\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on military-to-military contacts between \n         the United States and the People's Republic of China)\n\n       On page 357, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1032.

Mr. President, last year the Congress provided an $800 \nmillion down payment to restore viability to our counter drug \neradication and interdiction strategy in the region. This funding was \nthe first installment of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, \nwhich was passed as part of last year's omnibus appropriations bill. \nOur goal is to reduce significantly the flow of cocaine and heroine \nflowing into the United States. This would be done by driving up drug \ntrafficking costs, reducing drug availability, and ultimately keeping \nthese horrendous drugs out of the reach of our children.\n  We made great progress last year to secure the funds for an enhanced \ncounter-drug strategy. Today, I am seeking additional resources for \nthis important national security interest.\n  Today, Senator Coverdell and I are offering an amendment that would \nauthorize more funds for Defense counter-drug programs. This amendment \nis taken from a provision contained in S. 5, the Drug Free Century Act, \nwhich I introduced with seven of my Senate colleagues.\n  Mr. President, since the late 1980's, the Department of Defense has \nbeen called upon to support counter narcotics activities in transit \nareas in the Caribbean, and these dedicated members of our armed \nservices have done an extraordinary job. Unfortunately, we in the \nCongress, and those all over the United States, are keenly aware that \nthe Armed Forces of the United States are being stretched too thin. \nWith the ongoing hostilities against Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and the \nenormous air campaign against Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo, material \nand manpower dedicated to the interdiction of drugs entering our \ncountry have been diverted to these ``higher priority'' duties, leaving \nthe drug transit areas vulnerable and unguarded.\n  In addition, this year we have seen the closure of Howard Air Force \nBase in Panama, which causes the United States to lose a premier \nairfield for conducting counter-drug aerial detection and monitoring \nmissions. Without this aerial surveillance of the coca fields and \nproduction sites in Colombia, and the major transit areas for bringing \ncocaine into the United States, timely and actionable intelligence \ncannot be relayed to the Colombian government forces in time for \nseizure and eradication actions.\n  Fortunately, the current bill already would authorize $42.8 million \nfor the creation of forward operating locations to replace the \ncapability lost with the closure of Howard Air Force Base. These sites \nwill be critical to the continuing ability of the U.S. Armed Forces and \nlaw enforcement agencies to effectively detect and interdict illegal \ndrug traffic. However, it will take time to get these sites identified \nand operational.\n  Mr. President, that is why this amendment is timely and important. \nOur amendment would shore up deficient funding in the critical areas of \nintelligence gathering, monitoring, and tracking of suspect drug \nactivity heading toward the United States.\n  This amendment would provide authorization for an additional $59.2 \nmillion in counter-drug intelligence gathering and interdiction \noperations.\n  We need to have a reliable and efficient means of monitoring, \nidentifying, and tracking suspect traffickers before assigning \ninterdiction aircraft or marine craft to intercept. The key to our \nsuccess is accurate intelligence. Without accurate intelligence, we are \nwasting time and valuable resources.\n  This amendment would enable such intelligence gathering technologies \nas a CONUS-based, over-the-horizon radar that could be used in \ndetecting and tracking both air and maritime targets in the eastern \nPacific and Mexico. This technology would greatly enhance the ability \nof law enforcement agencies of both the United States and Mexico to \ninterdict and disrupt shipments of narcotics destined for the United \nStates.\n  This amendment also would authorize funds for enhanced intelligence \ncapabilities such as signals intelligence, collections, and translation \nthat would significantly improve the overall effectiveness of the \ncounter drug effort.\n  Mr. President, it is time to renew drug interdiction efforts, provide \nthe necessary equipment to our drug-enforcement agencies, and make the \nissue a national priority once again. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment and help turn the tide of the drug crisis in our \ncountry.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 533\n\n (Purpose: Expressing the Sense of the Senate regarding settlement of \n claims with respect to the deaths of members of the United States Air \n  Force resulting from the accident off Namibia on September 13, 1997)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 482 through 538) were agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask all remaining amendments at the desk \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is the intention of the managers to move to third \nreading momentarily.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are ready.\n  Mr. WARNER. In the moment I have here, I just want to acknowledge, \nagain, the tremendous cooperation and the spirit with which my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan and I--we have worked together \nfor these many years--came together. We were supported by superb \nstaffs; our staff directors, I tell you, they are pretty tough.\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\n At this moment we will withhold that, but the balance of the staffs on \nboth sides have done magnificent work.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my dear friend, the chairman, in \nthat sentiment about our staffs and our colleagues. This is a very \ncomplex bill. I think we have done it in record time, but it has taken \nthe cooperation of all of our colleagues, the leadership on both sides, \nand of course our staff made it possible. We will have more to say \nabout that after final passage. I think we are now waiting for the \nfinal high-sign from our staff that everything has been cleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, of course we include Les Brownlee and \nDavid Lyles in those accolades.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 1 minute 42 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. The minority has yielded back its time?\n  Mr. REID. We have not yielded it back, but I don't think we will use \nit. We will wait and see what the Senator has to say.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent Senator Domenici's time be folded in \nwith my time and then I will close our side of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has 3 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me just clarify about three things that \nwere said by Members of the minority a moment ago.\n  Senator Bingaman said we should not be playing politics with national \nsecurity. We could not agree more with that. He, then, began discussing \nhow these problems have been around a long time, under Republican \nadministrations as well as Democrat administrations. That is true. It \nis not political; it is true. Of course, that is what the Cox \nCommission report said, but that has nothing to do with whether we \nshould begin to solve those problems now.\n  Once this administration became aware of the espionage in about 1995, \nit was important to begin the work of cleaning up the mess at the \nDepartment of Energy. What we are saying is if that is not going to be \ndone by the administration, we are prepared to help do that with the \namendment we have offered.\n  Second, Senator Bingaman indicated that Democrats did not object to \nthe Republican security amendments in the Armed Services Committee, \nwhich were then included in the bill and which Members of the \nDemocratic side have been talking about as a good thing in this bill.\n  I just asked staff to note a couple of the specifics to which there \nwas objection. The minority, for example, objected to the requirement \nthat DOE employees who have access to nuclear weapons data have a full \nbackground investigation. They watered it down by delaying \nimplementation and also requiring an analysis of costs. They weakened \nthe restrictions on the lab-to-lab program, section 3156 or 3158, I \nhave forgotten. There were more. Not to quibble, but the point is the \nsecurity provisions in this bill were put there by the Members of the \nRepublican side, by and large. The primary section that was discussed \nwas the section put in by Senator Lott, the majority leader.\n\n  But there is one more important piece of unfinished business and that \nis the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment, and that is what the Democrats \nwill not let each of us talk about let alone debate about, except for \nthe unanimous consent to close the debate here this evening.\n  Senator Reid concluded by saying he did not improperly hold up the \nbill. He, in fact, used the rules of the Senate to protect the \nprerogatives of one Senator and his side. That is certainly true. He \nknows the rules. He used the rules. He was able to use the rules to \nprevent us from speaking, from debating our amendment, and from voting \non it. The only way we could bring the defense authorization bill to a \nclose and conclude this very important piece of business for the \nAmerican people was for us to withdraw this important amendment.\n  I hope all of our colleagues and the American people understand what \nhappened here. Because we could not discuss or vote on the Kyl-\nDomenici-Murkowski amendment, and because it was important to conclude \nthe work on the defense authorization bill, we were required to \nwithdraw our amendment. That important piece of unfinished business to \nprotect the security of the National Laboratories, therefore, remains \nunfinished business and will have to be taken up in the future.\n  I do not know of a higher priority for the Senate at this time than \ntrying to ensure the security of our National Laboratories and our most \nsophisticated weapons. This amendment would go a long way toward doing \nthat. It is not the total answer. I am just hopeful in the days and \nweeks to come we will not hear the continuing wails that it is not \ntime, we do not have time to discuss this, we should have lots of \nhearings about it.\n  We are prepared to have all kinds of discussions. We need to have \nthose discussions. If we are not able to have those discussions in \nfuture times here, then the next time it will not be withdrawn and we \nwill have to deal with it one way or the other.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together, try to resolve these important \nsecurity issues for the safety and defense of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 399\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to briefly speak on an amendment I \noffered today that was accepted by unanimous consent in the Defense \nauthorization bill. My amendment will address an unfulfilled obligation \nto our nation's veterans. The problem is a substantial backlog of \nrequests by veterans for replacement and issuance of military medals. \nAt a time when our troops are engaged overseas, and with the Memorial \nDay weekend approaching, it is all the more important to ensure we are \nrecognizing the sacrifices of our veterans.\n  Believe it or not, it can take years for veterans to receive medals \nearned through their service to our nation. My state offices are \ninvolved in a number of current cases where veterans have been waiting \ntwo to three years for medals they earned, but were never awarded. \nWhile my staff and I pursue these cases aggressively, the reality is \nthat no amount of pressure and follow-through can overcome what is \nessentially a resource problem.\n  The medal issue revolves around a huge backlog of requests. The \npersonnel centers, which process applications for the separate services \nfor never-issued awards and replacement medals, have accumulated huge \nbacklogs of requests by veterans. In one personnel center alone, 98,000 \nrequests have been allowed to back up, resulting in years of waiting \ntime. These time delays have denied veterans across the nation the \nmedals and honors they have rightfully earned through heroic actions.\n  Let me briefly share the story of Mr. Dale Holmes, a Korean War \nveteran. I have shared this story on the floor before, but I think it \nbears repeating. Mr. Holmes fired a mortar on the front lines of the \nKorean War. Stacy Groff, the daughter of Mr. Holmes, tried \nunsuccessfully for three years on her own, through the normal \nDepartment of Defense channels, to get the medals her father earned and \ndeserved. Ms. Groff turned to me after her letter writing produced no \nresults. My office began an inquiry in January of 1997 and we were not \nable to resolve this issue favorably until September 1997.\n  Ms. Groff made a statement about the delays that sum up my sentiments \nperfectly: ``I don't think it's fair. My dad deserves, everybody \ndeserves, better treatment than that.'' Ms. Groff could not be more \ncorrect. Our veterans deserve better from the country they served so \ncourageously.\n  DOD claims that it does not have the people or resources to speed up \nthe process. But it would not take much to make a dent in the problem. \nFor example, the Navy Liaison Office was averaging a relatively quick \nturnaround time of only four to five months when it had five personnel \nworking cases. Now that it has only three people in the office, it is \nhaving a hard time keeping up with the crush of requests. DOD must make \nputting more resources towards this problem a priority. However, it \nseems like the same old story--our government forgets the\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\nsacrifices servicemen and women have made as soon as they leave \nmilitary duty. We can do better.\n  Last year, during the debate over the FY99 Defense Appropriations \nbill, the Senate passed my amendment urging the DOD to end the backlog \nof unfulfilled military medal requests. Unfortunately, the Pentagon has \nnot moved to fix the problem. In fact, according to my information, the \nproblem has worsened.\n  Therefore, here I am again. My amendment directs the Secretary of \nDefense to establish and carry out a plan to make available the funds \nand resources necessary to eliminate the backlog in decoration \nrequests.\n  Specifically, my amendment says the Secretary of Defense shall make \navailable to the Army Reserve Personnel Command, the Bureau of Naval \nPersonnel, the Air Force Personnel Center, the National Archives and \nRecords Administration, and any other relevant office or command, the \nresources necessary to solve the problem. These resources could be in \nthe form of increased personnel, equipment or whatever these offices \nneed for this problem.\n  My amendment also directs that funding and resources should not come \nat the expense of other personnel service and support activities within \nDOD. It is a commonsense approach which will allow DOD to structure a \nquick and direct solution to the problem.\n  Our veterans are not asking for much. Their brave actions in time of \nwar deserve our highest respect, recognition, and admiration. My \namendment will help expedite the recognition they so richly deserve. \nOur veterans deserve nothing less.\n  I thank the Veterans of Foreign Wars for strongly supporting this \namendment. Their support meant a great deal to my efforts.\n  I thank the managers of the Defense Authorization bill, Senator \nWarner and Senator Levin, for their cooperation and understanding in \nagreeing to accept this important amendment.\n  While this is only a small change to the Defense authorization bill, \nit will send a clear message to our Nation's veterans and active duty \npersonnel: we recognize and value the sacrifices you have made on our \nbehalf.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 394\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nmajority leader's amendment to the defense authorization bill. The \namendment takes important steps to improve the monitoring of the export \nof advanced U.S. satellite technology and to strengthen security and \ncounterintelligence measures at Department of Energy facilities.\n  As a Senator, I have been privy to a wide range of classified and \nunclassified information relating to efforts by the People's Republic \nof China to acquire our sensitive technology and influence our \npolitical process. As a United States citizen, I am gravely concerned.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I learned during \nthe campaign finance investigation ably lead by Chairman Thompson that \nChina developed and implemented a plan to influence U.S. politicians \nand elections. And from Charlie Trie and John Huang, both of whom have \nrecently plead to felony offenses and agreed to cooperate with the \nJustice Department, I suspect we could learn more. More recently, I \nreviewed the Cox report, and just yesterday, listened to testimony \nconcerning the report during a hearing of the Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services. The \nevidence is clear that China stole very sensitive military secrets \ninvolving virtually all of our nuclear weapons. What is more, I believe \nthat the lax security at our government labs is completely inexcusable \nas is the Clinton Administration's abject failure to take swift and \nstrong action when it became aware of evidence of serious breaches in \nour national security.\n  This administration is faced now with the opportunity to focus the \ncountry on constructive solutions to our problems concerning espionage \nand undue foreign influence. I fear, however, that we will be mired for \na long time to come in the details of what happened, because those who \nknow will not tell. Instead of a swift accounting of what went wrong, I \nam afraid we can expect the stonewalling and lack of cooperation we \nreceived during the campaign finance inquiry.\n  Yet there are things Congress can do now to improve security at our \nnational labs, and the majority leader's amendment is one of them. The \nAmendment increases the exchange of information between the \nAdministration and the Congress and requires changes at the Departments \nof State, Energy, Defense as well as other intelligence agencies. These \nchanges will help strengthen security checks, licensing procedures, and \naccess to classified information. I am hopeful that these provisions \nwill enhance the security and protection of our most vital \ntechnological secrets and ensure that if violations do occur, swift and \ndecisive action is taken to correct them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n\n\n                    bqm-74 target drone procurement\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Bingaman to engage the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Armed Services Committee in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chair. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan, Senator \nBingaman, and I have come to the Senate floor today to discuss with the \nArmed Services Committee's able leadership how the Congress might go \nabout ensuring funding for procurement in fiscal year 2000 of the BQM-\n74, a Navy target drone.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand that the Senator from New Mexico has some \nexpertise on this subject.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have been pleased to support the BQM-74. This target \ndrone plays an important role in Navy air-to-air and surface warfare \ntraining, representing enemy fighters, bombers, and cruise missiles \nduring live-fire training operations. The Chief of Naval Operations has \na requirement that at least 240 of these drones be kept in the active \ninventory. We have maintained this number in the past, and I hope that \nthe Navy will be able to continue to do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wonder if I could direct a question to my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, who also has some familiarity with this program. \nSenator Dorgan, am I correct to understand that a lack of BQM-74 \nprocurement in fiscal year 2000 could result in the Navy's inventory \nfalling below the CNO's requirement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. My colleague from North Dakota is entirely correct. I am \ninformed that no production in the coming fiscal year would likely \nresult in a dangerous reduction to the inventory, and could force Navy \ntraining operations to be curtailed as early as 2002. This would \nclearly not be in our nation's interest. I am additionally informed \nthat a gap in production next year could drive up unit cost sharply.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This is most distressing. I wonder, could the Senator \nfrom New Mexico provide some background on the BQM-74's current funding \nstatus?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As my colleagues may be aware, the Navy had allocated \n435 million for procurement of 135 BQM-74 drones in fiscal year 2000. \nThis funding was zeroed out by the Office of the Secretary of Defense \nprior to submission of the budget request to Congress.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Office of the Secretary of Defense clearly did not \nact prudently in this regard, and I am pleased to report that this week \nthe Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--on which I serve--added \n430 million for procurement of this target drone. This move followed an \nauthorization by the House Armed Services Committee of $27 million for \nBQM-74 procurement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In light of the unquestioned importance of the BQM-74 and \nthe action taken by the House authorizers and Senate appropriators, I \nwonder if the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee believes that this matter can be addressed in conference.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senators for their valuable input. The BQM-74 \nis one of several critical defense priorities that will be addressed in \nconference.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Levin, might I ask if you concur with the \nChairman?\n  Mr. LEVIN. the issue will certainly have to be addressed in \nconference. The BQM-74 target drone is important to\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\npeacetime training and readiness. I know that the House Armed Services \nCommittee authorized funding, and the Senate Appropriations Committee \nhas recommended funding. It is my intention to work with the Chairman \nand our House counterparts in the upcoming conference to try to provide \nauthorization funding for BQM-74 procurement in fiscal year 2000.\n  Mr. CONRAD. On behalf of myself, Senator Dorgan, and Senator \nBingaman, I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Members for \ntheir important assurances.\n\n\n                            wartime embargo\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this amendment imposes a straightforward \nbut neglected requirement on the administration to seek multilateral \neconomic embargoes as well as foreign asset seizures against \ngovernments with which the United States engages in armed hostilities.\n  After one month of conflict in Kosovo, the Pentagon had announced \nthat NATO had destroyed most of Yugoslavia's internal oil refining \ncapacity.\n  But the Secretary of State then acknowledged that the Serbians \ncontinued to fortify their hidden armored forces in the province with \nimported oil.\n  And just three weeks ago, the allies first agreed to an American \nproposal to intercept petroleum exports bound for Serbia on the high \nseas but then declined to enforce the ban against their own ships!\n  On May 1st, five weeks after the Kosovo operation had begun, the \nPresident finally signed an executive order imposing an American \nembargo against Belgrade on oil, software, and other sensitive \nproducts.\n  Yet NATO and the United States have paid a steep price for failing to \nimpose comprehensive economic sanctions on Serbia from the beginning of \nthe air campaign in late March. As recently as May 13th, an anonymous \nU.S. government source told Reuters that the Yugoslavian Army continued \nto smuggle significant amounts of oil over land and water.\n  At the end of April, General Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Commander, \ngave the alliance a plan for the interdiction of oil tankers streaming \nin the Adriatic towards Serbian ports. To justify this proposal, he \ncited the fact that through approximately 11 shipments, as this \nchronology shows, the Yugoslavians had imported 450,000 barrels \ncontaining 19 million gallons of petroleum vital to their war efforts. \nOne Russian vessel alone deposited more than four million gallons of \nthis amount.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, it has been economic business as usual \nfor the Serbians as our missiles try to grind their will. The President \ndeclared on March 24th the beginning of the NATO campaign and set a \ngoal of deterring a bloody offensive against Moslem civilians.\n  Less than four weeks later, with more than 400 planes flying over \n400,000 internally displaced Kosovars, Belgrade reached the mid-point \nof receiving 11 shipments of oil from abroad.\n  By the close of April, General Clark confirmed the destruction of \nYugoslavia's oil production capacity. On the same day, however, the \nSerbs took in 165,000 barrels of imported fuel.\n  And on May 1st, when the President signed the executive order banning \nU.S. trade with Yugoslavia, Milosevic had received the last of the 11 \nApril oil shipments for a total of 450,000 barrels.\n  As of three weeks ago, the number of displaced Kosovars had topped \none million and NATO acknowledged the continuation of energy imports by \nthe enemy.\n  These imported energy reserves play a significant role in supporting \nSerbian ground operations. The U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates \nthat Yugoslav forces consume about four thousand barrels of oil per \nday. This fact means that if Serbian armored units in Kosovo used only \none-half of the imported fuel just from April, they could have operated \nfor nearly two months.\n  It took barely one month after the start of the NATO campaign, \nhowever, for President Milosevic to uproot the vast majority of the \nethnic Albanian population of the province. So by the time frame that \nNATO had claimed to destroy Serbia's oil refining capacity, mid-to-late \nApril, the Yugoslavians still managed to perpetrate Europe's worst \nhumanitarian crisis since World War II.\n  We now face the strategic and operational challenge of uprooting \ndispersed tank, artillery, and infantry units in Kosovo. This challenge \nconfounds NATO because our military campaign ignored the offshore \neconomic base sustaining the aggression that we had pledged to \novercome.\n  This example, Mr. President, teaches us that military victory \ninvolves more than the decisive application of force. It also demands, \nas Operation Desert Storm so dramatically illustrated, a coordinated \ndiplomatic and economic enemy isolation effort among the United States \nand its allies.\n  Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 1, 1990. Five days later, on August \n6th, the United Nations Security Council, with only Cuba and Yemen in \nopposition, had passed a resolution directing ``all states'' to bar \nIraqi commodity and product imports. This action first helped to freeze \nSaddam in Kuwait before he could move into Saudi Arabia. The wartime \ncoalition subsequently faced the more manageable task of expelling this \ndictator from a small country rather than the entire Arabian Peninsula.\n  We must always try to damage or destroy the offensive military \napparatus of a hostile state. But as the Persian Gulf War taught us, it \nshould also be starved of resources.\n  Efforts to establish multilateral embargoes will always encounter \nresistance and lapses in enforcement. My amendment, however, puts the \ntyrants of the globe on notice that as a matter of policy, the United \nStates will take immediate steps to deprive them of the finances and \nthe imports to wage war should America and its international partners \nengage in hostilities against them.\n  The language of this provision instructs the President to ``seek the \nestablishment of a multinational economic embargo'' against an enemy \ngovernment upon the engagement of our Armed Forces in hostilities. If \nthe conflict continues for more than 14 days, the President must also \nreport to Congress on the actions taken by the administration to \nimplement the embargo and to publish any foreign sources of trade and \nrevenue that sustain an adversary's war-making capabilities.\n  This amendment will not constrain, but strengthen, future Presidents \nin organizing the international community against regional zealots like \nMilosevic. We must remember that the European Union states declined to \nenforce the Adriatic Sea embargo against the advice of the United \nStates. But if we lend the force of law to administration's embargo \nefforts from the outset of a war, we could gain more allied partners to \nforce an aggressor into military bankruptcy.\n  As our Balkan campaign reveals, the foreign energy and assets at the \ndisposal of dictators can provide their forgotten tools of aggression. \nBut this seamless embargo amendment signals that the United States will \nnot only remember these tools, but take decisive action to break them. \nIt signals that we should not bomb only so the enemy can trade and \nhide.\n  To enforce greater clarity in our strategies of isolating the \nnation's armed adversaries of tomorrow, Mr. President, I urge the \nSenate's unanimous support for this amendment.\n\n\n                             nato's mission\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss three \ninterrelated aspects of our country's security at the brink of the new \nmillenium. There has already been discussion of NATO in this new world. \nWe have also intermittently discussed the war in the region of Kosovo.\n  It is important to reflect on NATO's mission under changed \ncircumstances. It is critical to address the U.S. role as part of NATO. \nAt the same time, we must evaluate threats globally, and we must be \nvigilant in safeguarding our security and defense capabilities.\n  In April, we celebrated NATO's 50th Anniversary. Despite the \ncircumstances, we had good reason to celebrate. After the horrors of \nWorld War I and II, U.S. decisionmakers sought to construct European \nstructures for integration, peace, and security. U.S. policy focused on \ntwo tracks: the Marshall Plan for economic reconstruction and NATO for \ntransatlantic security cooperation.\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\n  The creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949 \nacknowledged what we failed to admit after World War I. Europe was and \nis a precarious continent. Twice in the first 50 years of this century, \nAmerica fought against tyrannical and malevolent forces in Europe.\n  It is important to remember that NATO did not begin as a response to \nthe Warsaw Pact. This primary objective evolved as a de facto result of \nStalinist expansion into Central Europe.\n  Fifty years later NATO remains the strategic link between the Old \nWorld and the New. NATO achieved its Cold War mission and even now, in \na changed era and very different world, NATO is a vital element of \ntransatlantic cooperation and security.\n  We must, however, be conscious and careful in applying the lessons of \nthe past to current circumstances. None of what I have just talked \nabout should be interpreted as an argument for current NATO action in \nthe region of Yugoslavia, Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro.\n  The administration repeatedly suggests that violence in the Balkans \nignited the First World War. This is true. A member of the Black Hand, \na Serbian nationalist group, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand. \nSerbia, at that time, was a small nation fighting for independence \nwithin a crumbling Austian-Hungarian Empire.\n  Due to Russia's alliance with Serbia and Germany's open-ended \nmilitary pact with Austria, both Germany and Russia mobilized \nimmediately. Other than a few neutral countries--Norway, Sweden, Italy, \nSwitzerland, and Spain--the rest were locked in polarized blocs that \nset the Triple Alliance against the Triple Entente.\n  Such polarized blocs do not exist today. Serbai's aggression against \nKosovar Albanians can and has created regional instabilities. But this \nwould not lead to World War Three.\n  This is not 1914. Only one alliance dominates Europe--NATO. NATO can \nbe used as a force for peace. Acting without regard to security \nperceptions outside of NATO, however, can lead us down a very different \nand dangerous path.\n  Our current actions disregarded the views others of their own \nsecurity. Our actions in Kosovo may yet unravel any gains achieved in \nnuclear arms reductions and cooperative security alliances since the \nSoviet Union collapsed.\n  Furthermore, NATO's response in Kosovo has accelerated and \nexacerbated regional instability. We have managed to create a \nhumanitarian crisis, while not achieving any of our military \nobjectives. Of course, any rational person could see that an air \ncampaign from 20,000 feet would not prevent executions, rapes, and \npurges on the ground. This is especially true given the 5 months of \ntime we gave President Milosevic to plan, prepare, and position his \nforces.\n  One relevant aspect of today's world that the administration failed \nto mention in their arguments for involvement in this campaign is the \nimpact this would have on U.S.-Russian relations. We have a tendency to \nbelieve that Russia is so weak and needs our money so bad that we can \ndisregard their views or interests.\n  I ask you to consider two key facts:\n  as Russia's conventional military declines, reliance on their nuclear \narsenal increases;\n  global stability cannot be achieved without cooperation between the \nU.S. and Russia.\n  The reciprocal unilateral withdrawal of thousands of tactical nuclear \nwarheads between the U.S. and Russia may also be reversed. Russia has \nrecently announced its intent to redeploy components of its tactical \nnuclear arsenal. We were on a path through arms reduction and steps \ntoward increased transparency to addressing tactical weapons. These \ngains are steadily unraveling.\n  The administration never suggested that NATO strikes against Serbs \nmay lead to a worst-case scenario over the next few years in Russian \npolitics. Russia faces Parliamentary elections this year and a \nPresidential election next.\n  According to one of the most pro-American Duma members, the U.S. \nAdministration picked the best route to influence the upcoming \nelections in favor of Communist and ultra-nationalist parties. In \nRussia, 90 percent of the public support the Serbs and are against \nNATO.\n  This war will have profoundly negative impact on the relationship \nbetween Russia and the U.S. for a long time.\n  The U.S. was supposedly not fighting for either side. We were trying \nto be the honest broker, at least in the beginning. Our actions have \ncreated enemies. These enemies have historical ties to Russia. Russia's \neconomy is in tatters, but Russia still controls the only means to \nobliterate the United States.\n  We feel we are in the right, because we are fighting a tyrant, one \ncapable of great evil. I don't disagree with the objectives sought, but \nI do believe that the Administration should have taken into account the \npossible political consequences of our actions on Russia's political \nfuture, as well as our future relationship with Russia.\n  There are those who suggest that NATO must be victorious in the \nKosovo conflict. Victory in Kosovo is short-term if we do not sort out \nthe broader consequences of a victory dictated on NATO's terms.\n  Russia is edging closer to China, and India. Our blatant disregard of \nthe security needs of others and perceptions may culminate in a \nEurasian bloc allied against us--against NATO. And election campaigns \nin Russia will begin very soon.\n  As European leaders converged to celebrate NATO's 50th birthday, they \nspent much time debating and deliberating on NATO's future. NATO's \npresent reflects poor policy decisions and an ineffective military \napproach.\n  I also take this opportunity to discuss the grievous situation of our \nmilitary today. Recent actions in Kosovo underscore the self-inflicted \ndamage we have done to our national security in the years since the \nCold War.\n  I was one of many Senators during the 1980's who supported seeing our \nNation's defenses bolstered in order to bring the Soviet Union to its \nknees. We defeated them--not through hot war--but by demonstrating the \nunparalleled power of American democracy and free market dominance over \na command economy.\n  The collapse of the Soviet state was inevitable, but it would have \ntaken a lot longer without the catalyst of our rapid defense buildup. \nThis charge greatly accelerated the breakdown in the Soviet Union's \neconomy. Their political and economic institutions unraveled in light \nof America's clear superiority.\n  In 1991, after years of focus on a strong defense, when the Iraqis \noccupied Kuwait, U.S. forces were able to demonstrate their dominance. \nThe U.S. military liberated Kuwait in a short, decisive campaign. The \nGulf war was a ground and air war. It was a full blown offensive.\n  And at no time during the Gulf war did anyone even so much as hint \nthat U.S. forces were spread too thin. There were no reports of not \nbeing able to thwart an attack from North Korea due to our commitment \nin the Gulf. Never did we hear of depleted munitions stores, shortages \nin spare parts for our equipment, or waning missile supplies.\n  Eight years later, the cracks in our defense capabilities emerged \nafter less than 60 days of an air campaign in the Kosovo region. In \nless than forty days of what have been limited air strikes, respected \nofficials reported that U.S. defenses are spread too thin. If North \nKorea or Saddam wanted to capitalize on our distraction in the Balkans, \nwe currently would not have the means to defend our interests.\n  We have been forced to divert resources from other regions in the \nworld to meet NATO's needs in the Balkans. Our transport capabilities \nare insufficient. We evidently have too few carriers. Our munitions \nreserves are depleted. And, as ludicrous as it may sound, for years our \nmilitary personnel have had to scramble to find spare parts.\n  In the early nineties, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the \nU.S. was viewed as the only remaining ``superpower.'' Our global \neconomic and military dominance was unquestioned. That time was, in the \nwords of respected scholars and strategists, the Unipolar Moment. There \nwas no doubt that the U.S. could defend its interests in any \nsituation--whether military action or political persuasion were \nnecessary.\n  We have squandered that moment and missed many opportunities to \ncapitalize on our success. In fact, out of\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\ncomplacency and misplaced perceptions of the post-Cold War world, our \ndefense capacity today is insufficient to match the threats to our \nnational interests.\n  Many years of self-indulgence and inattention to our nation's defense \ncannot be corrected with a one-time boost. This is a complex and long-\nterm problem. But I'm committed to ensuring that our nation's defenses \nare not further eroded. I'm fed up with the complacency that has \ncreated our current situation.\n  We must have a strong defense. We must ensure that the men and women \nin uniform have the right equipment, the best training, and are \nafforded a quality of life sufficient to keep them in the military. \nThis cannot be done by sitting on our hands and hoping that the world \nremains calm.\n  Additions to readiness accounts, ammunition, and missile stocks in \nthe emergency supplemental for Kosovo will help ensure that our \nfighting forces are not in worse shape than before this engagement. It \nprovides a small, but significant, step forward.\n  The Defense authorization bill before us takes additional steps in \nthe right direction. I commend Senator Warner and his diligent staff on \nthe hard work they have done to balance priorities and provide for our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  Let me briefly outline some major provisions of this bill that I \nconsider important and appropriate to address some of our military's \nmost pressing needs.\n  As an additional boost to problems in readiness, this bill authorizes \nan additional $1.2 billion in operations and maintenance funding.\n  The bill also includes over $740 million for DoD and Department of \nEnergy programs that provide assistance to Russia and other states of \nthe former Soviet Union. These programs address the most prevalent \nproliferation threat in our world today.\n  The $3.4 billion increase in military construction and family housing \nis an essential element of providing our armed forces with the quality \nof life they deserve. In addition, pay raises and improved retirement \nplans demonstrate our commitment to the people who serve in our \nmilitary.\n  I do not believe that increased pay and better retirement address the \nfull spectrum of issues that feed into retention problems. The \npreliminary findings of a GAO study requested by myself and Senator \nStevens indicate that the main problem is not pay, but rather working \nconditions. Lack of spare parts and deficient manning were the most \nfrequent reasons offered for dissatisfaction with their current \nsituation.\n  These are important findings, because it is something we can address. \nAs more conclusions come to light, we can do a better job in fixing the \nproblems that currently contribute to recruitment and retention. We \nmust pay close attention to these issues. The men and women serving in \nour military are the sole assurance of a strong, capable U.S. defense \ncapability.\n  A strong defense must be coupled with a consistent set of foreign \npolicy objectives that strive to reduce or contain security threats. At \npresent, we have neither.\n  Mr. President, it seems we must focus on shifting the balance back in \nour favor. This cannot be done ad hoc. Securing U.S. interests requires \nsustained commitment and well-planned execution. First, we must provide \nthe domestic means for a strong, capable armed forces. Second, we must \nbe calculated and careful in the application of force as a fix to \nfailed diplomacy.\n\n\n                     the nuclear cities initiative\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a provision, \nsection 3136(b), of the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal \nYear 2000, concerning the Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI). The Nuclear \nCities Initiative is a Department of Energy cooperative effort with \nRussia to assist Russia in downsizing its nuclear weapons complex. The \nreport accompanying the Defense Bill, Senate Report 106-50, states that \nRussia has not agreed to close or dismantle weapons-related facilities \nat the nuclear complexes receiving U.S. technical and financial \nassistance. As a result, Section 3136 of the Defense Authorization bill \ncontains a provision the would prohibit the obligation or expenditure \nof funding until the Secretary of Energy certifies to the Congress that \nRussia has agreed to close some of its facilities engaged in work on \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Because of several past interpretations by the Department of Defense \nof the wording similar to that in section 3136(b), I believe that the \nwording of this provision would effectively prevent the implementation \nof the Nuclear Cities Initiative.\n  While I share the goal of Senator Roberts, to ensure that the Russian \nweapons complex is downsized, I am concerned that the specific \ncertification is unachievable. Russia has publicly committed to shut \ndown or downsize some of its nuclear weapons complexes or related \nfacilities. Even if the certification is achievable, the logistics of \nthe required certification process could delay the program for a very \nlong time.\n  The Nuclear Cities program is just getting started, but has already \nmade some real progress. To stop the funding in fiscal year 2000, \nparticularly since Russian officials have already announced their \nintent to close some facilities seems to me to be counterproductive. If \nfunding were suspended, program activities would be halted and the \ncooperative program itself placed in jeopardy. Given the shared \nconcerns that Senator Roberts and I have with respect to prevention of \nthe spread of nuclear weapons technology and information, I would like \nto ask my esteemed colleague whether that is the intent behind this \nprovision in the bill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator. The NCI was intended to be a joint \nprogram with the Russian government. At one point the Russians said \nthat they would provide $30 million to the NCI. Due to the current \neconomic crisis in Russia, any Russian assistance to the NCI program \nwill be in the form of in-kind contributions, such as labor and \nbuildings. The NCI has the potential to provide the Russian government \nwith significant economic benefit. According to the Department of \nEnergy, the benefit to the United States is to have the Russian \ngovernment close or dismantle the nuclear weapons complexes in those \nten cities. However, the Russian government has not agreed to close or \ndismantle weapons-related facilities in these cities in exchange for \nUnited States' assistance. In the absence of such a Russian agreement, \nthis initiative could result in great financial benefit for the \nRussians without any reduction in Russian weapons capability. The \nprovision in question requires that, as a prerequisite for U.S. funding \nfor the Nuclear Cities Initiative, the Russian government agree to \nclose facilities engaged in work on weapons of mass destruction.\n  I assure the Senator from New Mexico that it is not the intention \nbehind this provision to result in the termination of this program. \nRather, it is to secure a commitment from the Russian government to do \nmore to support the nonproliferation goals of the NCI effort. It is \nimportant to ensure that the Russians participate in the implementation \nof this program in an equitable way. I believe that the requirement for \nan agreement will ensure that the Russians participate equitably \nthrough in-kind contributions and through the closure of weapons of \nmass destruction facilities. I believe the provision contained in this \nbill will afford benefits to the U.S. national security and will assure \nthat the program is on firm footing in the foreseeable future. I look \nforward to working with Senator Bingaman in overseeing the \nimplementation of the Nuclear Cities Initiative.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Kansas for that assurance, and \npromise to work closely with you and the Department of Energy to see \nthat the Nuclear Cities Initiative continues to move forward.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I too wish to thank the Senator from Kansas \nfor clarifying his intentions with regard to the language in this bill \nas it relates to funding for the Department of Energy's Nuclear Cities \nInitiative.\n  There is no more important national security issue facing America \ntoday than preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nThrough the Nuclear Cities Initiative, the United States and Russia are \nworking together to downsize Russia's nuclear weapons complex and \nprevent the dispersal of the scientific and technical legacy that \nremains in Russia today. In the short term, this will require the \ncreation of alternate industries and\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\nnew employment for as many as 50,000 scientists and technicians who are \nunder tremendous financial burdens and might be tempted to offer their \nnuclear expertise to rogue governments and others who are all too \nwilling to pay top dollar for that information. Over the long run, it \nwill require sustainable economic development to allow Russia's \nscientific and technological assets to be put to peaceful, prosperous \nuse. Mr. President, the Nuclear Cities Initiative is an integral part \nof our ongoing counterproliferation efforts. I join my colleague from \nNew Mexico in pledging to continue to work with the Senator from Kansas \nand the Department of Energy in support of this program. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                Health Care Choice for Military Retirees\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman, Mr. Warner, for \nincluding an amendment that directs a demonstration project for TRICARE \nDesignated Providers to enroll new military beneficiaries on a 12-month \ncontinuous basis.\n  This is a compromise amendment sponsored by Senator Snowe, which I \nhave agreed to cosponsor. I personally would have preferred a straight-\nforward amendment that would have permitted beneficiaries the same \nopportunities to enroll in the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan \nprovided by Designated Providers as is currently available for TRICARE \nPrime. For the sake of providing fairness to the beneficiaries and \naffording more health care choices, beneficiaries should be able to \nenroll at a Designated Provider at anytime during the year. I note that \neleven groups representing military retirees recently wrote the \nChairman in support of this proposal for open continuous enrollment for \nthe Designated Providers.\n  My preferred amendment, however, was not acceptable to the Committee. \nHowever, I am pleased that a compromise advanced by my colleague from \nMaine was agreeable, which directs a two-year demonstration of \ncontinuous open enrollment for the Designated Providers. I urge the \nDepartment of Defense to faithfully carry out this demonstration by \nincluding as many of the TRICARE Designated Providers in the \ndemonstration as possible. The agreed-to amendment does not restrict \nthe size of the demonstration. Since the seven Designated Providers run \nthe same Uniformed Services Family Health Program, I believe it makes \nsense to include all of them in the demonstration.\n  At a minimum, I urge the Department to include the PacMed Clinics in \nmy state in this demonstration. The PacMed Clinics pioneered managed \nhealth care for military beneficiaries and have provided quality care \nto military families for a generation. Beneficiaries should have the \nopportunity to enroll at PacMed during any time of the year, just like \nTRICARE Prime. Accordingly, the demonstration mandated by this \namendment should include the PacMed clinics and as many of the other \nDesignated Provider as possible.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nstrong support for S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Bill for \nFiscal Year 2000. As Chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, I want to \nbriefly summarize the Strategic Subcommittee portion of the Armed \nServices Committee markup and the philosophy that it is based on. As in \nthe past, the Strategic Subcommittee has reviewed the adequacy of \nprograms and policies in five key areas: (1) ballistic and cruise \nmissile defense; (2) national security space programs; (3) strategic \nnuclear delivery systems; (4) military intelligence; and (5) Department \nof Energy activities regarding the nuclear weapons stockpile, nuclear \nwaste cleanup, and other defense activities.\n  This year, the subcommittee's review included two field hearings--one \nat the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on DOE weapons programs, \nand one at U.S. Space Command in Colorado Springs on U.S. national \nsecurity space programs. In addition, the subcommittee visited the U.S. \nArmy Space and Missile Defense Command in Huntsville Alabama, Barksdale \nAir Force Base in Louisiana, the Capistrano High Energy Laser Test \nfacility in California, Beale Air Force Base in California, and a \nvariety of military facilities in the Denver and Colorado Springs area. \nThese visits greatly enhanced my understanding of the issues under the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction and significantly influenced the bill \nbefore us today.\n  The Strategic Subcommittee recommended funding increases for critical \nprograms under the subcommittee's jurisdiction by approximately $850 \nmillion, including an increase of $500 million for Ballistic Missile \nDefense programs, $220 million for national security space programs, \n$110 million for strategic forces, and $50 million for military \nintelligence.\n  The Strategic Subcommittee also supported the full amount requested \nby the Department of Energy with the exception of the Formerly Utilized \nSites Remedial Action Program. Let me highlight the key funding and \nlegislative issues.\n  In the area of missile defense the Strategic Subcommittee included \nthe following funding: An increase of $120 million to accelerate the \nNavy Upper Tier program and provide for continued development of \nadvanced radar concepts. An increase of $212 million to fix the Patriot \nPAC-3 funding shortfall so the program can begin production during \nfiscal year 2000. An increase of $60 million to begin production of the \nPatriot Anti-Cruise missile program, which will provide an upgraded \nseeker for older Patriot missiles.\n  In the area of space programs and technologies, the Strategic \nSubcommittee included the following funding: An increase of $92 \nmillion, which the Administration requested, to fully fund the revised \nSpace Based Infrared System (High) program. An increase of $111 million \nfor advanced space technology development, including funds for space \ncontrol technology, micro-satellite technology, and space maneuver \nvehicle development.\n  In the area of strategic nuclear delivery systems, the Strategic \nSubcommittee included the following funding: An increase of $40 million \nfor the Minuteman III Guidance Replacement Program to put the program \non a more efficient production schedule. An increase of $52.4 million \nfor bomber upgrades based on the Air Force's unfunded priorities list, \nincluding funding for the B-2 Link-16 program and B-52 radar upgrades.\n  In the area of military intelligence programs the Strategic \nSubcommittee included a number of funding increases, including an \nincrease of $25 million for U-2 cockpit and defensive system upgrades. \nI would note that the Strategic Subcommittee toured the U-2 base at \nBeale Air Force base and witnessed first hand the serious deficiencies \nassociated with the U-2.\n  In the area of DOD legislative provisions, the Strategic Subcommittee \nincluded the following: A provision addressing DOD's proposed TMD Upper \nTier strategy, which reverses DOD's decision to compete Navy Upper Tier \nand THAAD. A provision establishing a commission to assess U.S. \nnational security space organization and management, which is modeled \nafter the Rumsfeld Commission. A provision limiting the Retirement of \nstrategic nuclear delivery systems, which extends last year's law on \nthis matter, but also allows the Navy to retire 4 older Trident \nsubmarines while modernizing the remaining fleet to carry the D-5 \nmissile. A provision regarding the Airborne Laser program, which \nrequires a number of tests, certifications, and acquisition strategy \nmodifications before the program can move into successive phases of its \ndevelopment. A provision regarding the Space Based Laser program, which \nrequires near-term focus on an Integrated Flight Experiment.\n\n  In the Department of Energy section of the markup, the Strategic \nSubcommittee provided the full amount of the Administration's request \nwith the exception of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action \nProgram. I took great pains to examine the budget request and eliminate \nthose funding items that do not support organizational mission \nrequirements. In the weapons program, my goal was to ensure DOE has a \nwell planned and funded stockpile life extension program that is \ncapable to remanufacturing and certifying every warhead in the enduring \nU.S. nuclear stockpile. My goal in the cleanup program was to maintain \nthe pace of clean-up at DOE facilities and continue to press for \nearlier deployment of innovative technologies to lower out-year costs.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n  The Strategic Subcommittee included the following recommendations \nregarding DOE funding: An increase of $55 million for the four \ntraditional weapons production plants. An increase of $15 million for \nthe tritium production program. A reduction of $30.0 million to the \nAdvanced Strategic Computing Initiative. An increase of $35 million to \nsupport security and counter-intelligence activities. An increase of \n$17 million to increase security investigations in support of security \nclearances at DOE.\n  In the area of DOE legislative provisions, the Strategic Subcommittee \nincluded the following: A substantial package of legislation dealing \nwith security and counter-intelligence at DOE. A provision regarding \ntritium production, which would require DOE to implement the \nSecretary's tritium production decision.\n  Mr. President, in closing let me reiterate my strong support for S. \n1059. This is a good bill that deserves strong bipartisan support.\n\n\n property conveyance at nike batter base 80 in east hanover, new jersey\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to call up my amendment regarding \nproperty conveyance at Nike Battery Base 80 Family Housing Site in East \nHanover Township, New Jersey. This provision would convey roughly 14 \nacres to the Township of East Hanover for the development of low and \nmoderate income housing, senior housing, and parkland. Using this land \nfor these purposes is consistent with the 1994 Base Closure and \nCommunity Redevelopment Homeless Assistance Act. The Township needs \nthis land to fulfill its obligation to provide such housing under New \nJersey state law. I understand a similar provision exists in the bill \nreported from the House Armed Service Committee. In the interest of \nexpediting the Senate's consideration of this bill, I am willing to \nwithdraw my amendment contingent upon a commitment from the managers of \nthe bill that they will give the House position full consideration in \nconference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the senior Senator from New Jersey for his \nwillingness to expedite our consideration of this bill. We understand \nthe House has a similar provision. During conference, we will give full \nconsideration to the project as the Senator from New Jersey has \nrecommended.\n  Mr. WARNER. I concur with my distinguished colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss several provisions \nwithin the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act. These provisions can be \nfound in Title II, Subtitle D, Sections 231-239 within the FY2000 \nDefense Authorization Act. The provisions are intended to stimulate \nintense technical innovation within our military research and \ndevelopment (R) enterprise and hence lay the foundation for \nrevolutionary changes in future warfare concepts. Before giving an \nextended introduction to these defense innovation provisions, I would \nlike to thank Senator Roberts and Senator Bingaman and the staff who \nhave worked on this subtitle--particularly Pamela Farrell, Peter \nLevine, John Jennings, Frederick Downey, Merrilea Mayo, and William \nBonvillian--for their hard and thoughtful work on this legislation. The \ntechnical superiority of our military is something we have come to take \nfor granted, yet it is founded in an R system that has seen little \nchange since the cold war era. These defense innovation provisions \nattempt to reposition our R system so that it can keep up with the \npace of technological change in the very different world we are in \ntoday.\n  It is my belief that the explosive advances in technology may provide \nthe basis for not just a ``revolution in military affairs,'' but a \ncomplete paradigm shift. With advanced communication and information \nsystems, it may become possible to fight a war without concentrating \nforces, making force organizations impossible to kill. With advances in \nrobotics and miniaturization, it may become possible to fight a ground \nwar with far fewer people. With advances in nuclear power, hydrolysis, \nand hydrogen storage, it may be possible to create virtually unlimited \nsources of on-site power. These opportunities are complemented by \nnumerous challenges, also brought forth by technology: urban warfare, \nspace warfare, electronic/information warfare, chemical, nuclear, and \nbiological warfare, and warfare relying on underground storage centers \nand facilities. As the variety of opportunities and threats continues \nto climb, and as increasing numbers of nations emerge into the high \ntech arena, I believe the military arms race of the past will be \nreplaced by a military technology race. Instead of simply accumulating \never greater numbers of conventional armaments against a well-\nestablished foe, as we did in the Cold War era, we will have to \nconcentrate on producing fewer, but ever more rapidly evolving, and \never more specialized weapons systems to counter specific asymmetric \nthreats.\n  To meet these new challenges, we need to transform our R enterprise \nfrom its antiquated Cold War structure to a fast-moving, well-\nintegrated R machine that can seize the leading edge of techno-\nwarfare. For this reason Senator Roberts, Senator Bingaman and I have \ninserted provisions within Title II, Subtitle D of the FY2000 Defense \nAuthorization Act whose purpose is to stimulate a much greater and \nfaster degree of technical innovation within the military.\n  The defense innovation provisions address three goals--establishing a \nnew vision for military R, changing the structure of the military R \nenterprise, and correcting the driving forces for R in our current \nsystem. For the first task, establishing a new vision, Section 231 of \nthe FY2000 Defense Authorization Act requires DoD to determine the most \ndangerous adversarial threats we will likely face two to three decades \nfrom now, and what technologies will be needed on our part to prevail \nagainst those threats. Given that it takes 20-30 years to translate \nbasic science to fielded application, our R vision needs to be \nfounded on a set of required operational capabilities that is equally \ndistant in time, and far beyond the 5 year vision of our current \nProgram Objective Memorandums (POM's). We need not strive for perfect \nclairvoyance in this exercise; however, we should be able to create an \nopen conceptual architecture which successfully frames the many \npotential future opportunities and threats. Once the far future threats \nand hence far future operational capabilities are outlined, Section 231 \nasks DOD to give Congress a roadmap of future systems hardware and \ntechnologies our services will have to deploy within two to three \ndecades to assure US military dominance in that time frame. From the \nfirst roadmap, we are requesting DOD derive a second roadmap--the R \npath that DOD, in cooperation with the private sector, will have to \nfollow to obtain these new defense technologies and systems. To add \ndepth and perspective to the results, I encourage the Secretary of \nDefense to utilize an independent review panel of outside experts in \nthese exercises, to complement the work done by in-house personnel. The \nbroader our vision, the more likely it is to be inclusive of whatever \nsurprises the actual future may bring.\n  A second goal of the defense innovation provisions, Subtitle D, is to \nlay the groundwork for a new organizational structure for R Unless \nwe fix the innovation structure, we will be unable to deliver to DOD \nthe rapid technological advances it will need to secure and maintain \nworld dominance. To meet the challenges of the upcoming decades, the \nDefense Science Board has recommended that at least one third of the \ntechnologies pursued by DoD be ones that offer 5 to 10 fold \nimprovements in military capabilities. However, the current structure, \nwhich was founded on Cold War realities, will require large \norganizational change to enable it to pursue revolutionary, rather than \nevolutionary, technology goals. The segregated and insulated components \nof the military R system will need to be seamlessly interwoven, and \nthe system as a whole will need to be much more flexible in its \ninteractions with the outside world. We can learn from the success of \nthe commercial sector, which takes advantage of temporary alliances \nbetween competitors and peers to develop technologies at a breathtaking \npace.\n  The defense innovation provisions ask DoD to formulate a modern \nblueprint for the structure, of not only its laboratories, but of the \nextended set of policies, institutions, and organizations which \ntogether make up its entire innovation system. As noted earlier, the \nDefense Science Board has\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\ncalled for the military R system to increase its focus on \nrevolutionary new technologies. The overarching goal of the new \nstructural plan requested by Section 233 is to deliver the conceptual \narchitecture for an innovation system that is capable of routinely \nproviding such revolutionary advances. Section 239 requests an analysis \nby the Defense Science Board of overlaps and gaps within the current \nsystem. Section 233 asks the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition \nto develop the plan for the future innovation system, one which ensures \nthat joint technologies, technologies developed in other government \nlaboratories, and technologies developed in the private sector can \nreadily flow into and across the military R labs and the broader \ninnovation structure as a whole. Section 233 emphasizes the need to \ndevelop better processes for identifying private sector technologies of \nmilitary value, and military technologies of commercial value. Once \nidentified, there also need to be efficient processes in place for \ntransfer of those technologies, so that the military may reap the \nrespective military and economic gains. Also in Section 233, the Under \nSecretary is requested to deliver a solution to the major structural \ngap which currently exists between the R pipeline and the acquisition \npipeline. Development of the best technologies in the world will not \nhelp our future military posture if those technologies are never \nadopted, or even seen, by the acquisition arms of our services. \nFinally, to better merge the strategic and technological threads within \nthe military's decision making process, Section 233 in the FY2000 \nDefense Authorization Act requests a DoD plan for modifying the ongoing \neducation of its future military leadership (i.e., its uniformed \nofficers) so they may better understand the technological opportunities \nand threats they face.\n\n  The laboratories themselves could and should play a crucial role in \nour future military. Ideally, the military laboratories are the place \nwhere the minds of the brightest scientists meet the demands of the \nmost experienced warfighters. Out of this intense dialogue would then \ncome a clearer understanding of future warfare possibilities, as well \nas the technological breakthroughs critical to changing the face of \nwarfare as we know it. For various reasons, however, that vision is in \ndanger of becoming lost. One specific problem is DoD's rigid personnel \nsystem and the corresponding lack of performance-based compensation, \nwhich is causing the labs to rapidly hemorrhage talent to the more \ncompetitive and less bureaucratic private sector. To address these \nissues, a defense innovation provision within the FY2000 Defense \nAuthorization Act--specifically, Section 237--repeals several of the \nlabs' restrictive personnel regulations. The intent of this Section is \nto drastically reduce hiring times and eliminate artificial salary \nconstraints to the point where defense laboratories can hire new talent \nin a time frame and at a salary level that is similar to that offered \nby the private and university sectors. Currently, the two processes are \nnot even close to competitive: the military R labs take several \nmonths to over a year to extend an offer, with the result that the \nlaboratories, over and over again, lose the hiring race to private \nsector interests which can hire top-notch talent in one or two weeks. \nAs noted by the Defense Science Board report, the salaries which can be \noffered by the laboratories are also about 50 percent lower (for higher \ngrade new hires), compared to the salaries those same new hires could \nobtain in the private sector. It is significant that the hiring time \nproblem, as well as the high grade caps problem, were universally cited \nby laboratory managers as the key obstacles in upgrading their \nlaboratory talent.\n  In addition to improving the quality of the laboratories' effort by \nattracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, the defense \ninnovation provisions ask the Secretary of Defense to improve the \nquality of work itself by developing a system of modern business \nperformance metrics which can be implemented within and across all \nmilitary laboratories (Section 239(b)). Such metrics can help ensure \nthat the best work and the best talent are identified, so that they may \nbe rewarded, nurtured and used accordingly. As a word of caution, the \nultimate impact of science and technology innovation is very hard to \nmeasure, especially in the early stages. Overly mechanical assessments \ninevitably do much more harm than good. Nevertheless, advanced \ntechnology companies have been making great strides in better assessing \n(and assisting) their innovation efforts, and DOD is encouraged to work \nwith industry R leaders in implementing this section. Examples of \nmetrics which may be useful for DOD labs include measurement of lab \nquality through formal annual peer reviews of its divisions, \nmeasurement of technical relevance through required customer approval/\nevaluation of R projects both before and after they are undertaken, \nand measurement of organizational relevance through annual board \nmeetings of senior military with the heads of the R laboratories. The \nfirst of these metrics can help capture and bring attention to \npromising work in its earliest stages, while the last two can help \nbridge the gap between later stage innovation and new products.\n  The need for structural reform within the laboratories is a pressing \none. The above-mentioned reforms are intended to be jump started with a \npilot program, found in Section 236 of the Defense Authorization \nProvisions. This pilot program may address any of the issues mentioned \nabove but is particularly focused on the problem of attracting and \nretaining the best possible talent for the laboratories. To be more \ncompetitive with working conditions in the commercial sector, this \npilot program may include such innovations as pay for performance, \nstarting bonuses (e.g., in the form of equipment start-up funds) for \nattracting key scientists, ability to alter reduction in force (RIF) \nretention rules to favor high performers, broadbanding of pay grades, \nsimplified employee classification, educational programs which allow \nemployees to receive advanced degrees while still employed, \nmodification of priority placement procedures, and creation of employee \nparticipation and reward programs.\n  To attract the best possible outside talent for collaborations with \nthe laboratories, Section 236 also encourages expansion of exchange \nprograms at both the personal and institutional level. Programs for \nexchanges within DoD, with the private sector, and with academic \ninstitutions are all encouraged. Examples of such programs include the \nsponsorship of talented students through college or graduate school in \nexchange for later work commitments to the laboratories, expansion of \nthe federated laboratory concept, increased exchanges between the \ndefense laboratories and the war colleges, training programs, and \nextension of IPA authority to hire commercial sector employees. The \nDefense Science Board has strongly recommended that the laboratories \nemulate DARPA in its mix of temporary and permanent workers in order to \nbe able to quickly bring in relevant talent when needs shift. Section \n236(a)(2) creates this option and can be used in conjunction with other \nprovisions in Subtitle D.\n  A new structure and a new vision are all well and good, but if there \nis no motivation for the new structure to proceed towards the new \nvision, nothing is gained. Consequently, the third goal of the defense \ninnovation provisions is to correct current forces which tend to drive \nDoD away from technical innovation. Three of these driving forces are \ndescribed below.\n  The first ``counter-innovation'' driving force is the lack of a well-\ndefined customer within the military for far future military \ntechnologies. Ideally, this customer would be at the Joint Chiefs \nlevel, so that broadly sweeping strategies which capitalize on novel \ntechnologies can be rapidly incorporated into our existing military \nstructure, doctrine, and systems. Unfortunately, there is little \nconnection at present between that level and the service laboratories. \nSection 239(b) should be used to improve this situation. Furthermore, \nas part of the legislation's mandated study on improving the structure \nof our R system (Section 233), we also request the Under Secretary of \nDefense to address the issue of a suitable internal customer for truly \nlong range R For maximum impact and credibility, this customer--\nwhether it be a person, position, or organization--should be a bona\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nfide paying customer who has responsibility not just for the long range \ntechnology itself, but for the unconventional military options such \ntechnology provides.\n  The lack of an internal customer for long range R is one driving \nforce pulling the military away from technical innovation. The second \nis the vacuum-like force created by the absence of an intimate \nconnection between the R customers and producers within the later \nstages of R Specifically, there is an insufficient connection \nbetween the program managers who sponsor product development and the \nR workforce performing later stage R In contrast, the industrial \nexperience has shown that if the customer, researchers, and designers \nshare in all product development decisions from the very initial stages \nof concept design, the degree of innovation is much higher, the product \nacceptance rate is much higher, and, ultimately, the pace of \ntechnological change is dramatically accelerated. Section 233(b)(5) \ndirects the Under Secretary of Defense to identify how new technologies \ncan be rapidly transi-\ntioned from late stage R to product development and prepare an \nappropriate plan for doing so. One sub-issue within this larger problem \nis this need to create a DoD customer--DoD researcher--DoD designer \ninteraction that is early enough and robust enough to ensure that \nmaturing innovations can be drawn into product lines on a time scale \nsimilar to that experienced in the commercial sector. This sub-issue \nshould be addressed in the Under Secretary's plan under Section \n233(b)(5).\n  The third force which drives the military away from technological \ninnovation is the lack of a customer outside the military for \ninnovative military technologies. Were such a customer present, it \nmight partially make up for the lack of the other two drivers in terms \nof motivating innovation. Currently, the most important external \ncustomer for military R is the industrial half of the military-\nindustrial complex. However, the structure of our procurement \nregulations give virtually identical profit margins to these companies \nno matter how difficult the technical path or how many risks are \nundertaken in the process of producing a military system. Therefore, \nthe continued production of legacy systems is guaranteed to be \nprofitable, while gambling with innovative new systems is not. \nEssentially, our procurement regulations are a direct disincentive to \ninnovation, giving the defense industry a strong vested interest in \nadhering to incremental change. The resulting lobbying by industry, \naimed squarely at preserving the ``state-of-yesterday's-art,'' then \nsignificantly slows the rate at which the military can innovate. \nAccordingly, one of the defense innovation provisions, specifically \nSection 234, Subtitle D, Title II of the FY 2000 Defense Authorization \nAct, calls for DoD to change its profit margins for acquisitions in \norder to alter the innovation incentives for industry. Given \nsubstantially higher profit levels for the development of innovative \nsystems, than for the continued production of legacy systems, industry \ncould become much more receptive to the idea of cultivating innovation \nin fielded hardware. Substantive, consistent economic rewards are \ncritical to incentivizing companies to take the necessary and serious \ntechnological risks required to produce the innovations DOD must have.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues Senators Roberts and Bingaman for \njoining me in develoing a set of stimulating and thought-provoking \ndefense innovation provisions within Subtitle D, Title II of the FY2000 \nDefense Authorization bill. These provisions should launch us towards a \nnew vision, a new structure, and a new set of driving forces for \nmilitary R In the past 48 years, DoD has funded the pre-award \nresearch of 58 percent of this country's Nobel laureates in Chemistry, \nand 43 percent of this country's Nobel laureates in Physics. This is a \nphenomenal base on which to build. However, the Cold War structure and \nrationale for our R enterprise needs to be shed so that leading edge \ntechno-warfare can emerge. The time to do this is now, because, in many \nsenses, the future is already here. The military systems of 2020 and \n2030 will be founded on the science of the year 2000.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to draw the \nSenate's attention to the CBO cost estimate on the Defense \nAuthorization bill. In the Budget Resolution Congress agreed that the \nnational defense account would have $288 billion in Budget authority \nand $276 in outlays for fiscal year 2000.\n  The CBO estimates that the Defense Authorization bill as it currently \nstands in the Senate, would exceed the outlay level by almost $7 \nbillion. The Budget Committees of the House and Senate have told CBO to \nreduce their score of the outlays by $10 billion in order that the bill \nfit under the caps. While this changes the scoring number, it does not \nchange the fact that the bill still authorizes the Department of \nDefense to spend $284 billion next year, $7 billion over the caps.\n  Whether someone agrees with the Budget Resolution or not, these sorts \nof end runs are destructive to the process by undermining popular \nconfidence in the institution.\n  If there is not enough money for Defense in the Budget Resolution, \nthen members should not have supported it back in March. If there was \nenough in March, nothing has changed, and it should be enough now. The \nCongress recently passed a Supplemental Appropriations bill that \ninclude $11 billion for funding for the Kosovo operation, almost $5 \nbillion over the President's request, so there should be plenty of \nmoney for our operation in Europe. Now, if members grudgingly supported \nthe Resolution because of the assurances of the Budget Committee \nChairman that he would ``fix the outlay problem'' I ask them to show me \nthe fix. It looks as thought the Budget Committee did nothing but allow \nDefense spending to exceed the budget caps without letting any other \nprogram do the same.\n  Congress should own up to the fact that the Budget caps are being \nexceeded. They are being quietly raised by hiding the increase in a \nscoring gimmick. Members should take notice that the way to get more \nmoney for your appropriations priorities is to petition the Budget \nCommittee for an ``outlay fix''.\n  There is going to be a train wreck at the end of this year, and we \nall know it. There is going to be a train wreck, and it will happen \nbecause no one is driving the train, we are all just nervously looking \nout the window admiring the scenery and trying not to think of our \nimpending doom.\n  I have faith that the American people will eventually figure out how \nmuch we are going to spend next year. The increases in Defense spending \nwill no doubt be joined by a tremendous amount of last minute spending \nat the end of the year. The American people will look at what Congress \ntold them we would spend at the beginning of the year, and what we will \neventually agree to at the close of the year and they will be very \nsurprised at the difference. I hope they hold us accountable.\n  It is worth noting that we do not have to be in this situation. \nCongress could take action to cut unnecessary spending in the defense \naccount. This would reduce the pressure on the discretionary budget, \nand free up resources for other needs around the country.\n  Another two rounds of base closures for example, while increasing \noutlays in the short run, would yield savings of $4 billion over ten \nyears according to the Congressional Budget Office. I co-sponsored \nSenator McCain's legislation on this matter, and I co-sponsored the \nMcCain-Levin amendment, which would only authorize one additional \nround. I was disappointed the Senate refused to support this worthy \nalternative. The military has come to the Senate time and again \npleading with us to give them the authority to close bases through the \nCommission process in a manner isolated from political pressures. Had \nwe supported base closure rounds when they were initially requested we \nmight not now be pushing so tightly against the budget caps, while \nstraining under draconian cuts in the non-defense accounts.\n  Senator Kerrey has also offered an amendment that could help reduce \nthe need to rely on budget gimmickry without reducing our capacity \noverseas. He would simply allow the Department of Defense to reduce our \nnuclear forces below the START I levels\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\nof 6,500 warheads. According to CBO, if we reduce our warheads to the \nSTART II level of 3,500 the Department of Defense could save $12.7 \nbillion by 2009. All that savings would come without reducing our \nconventional capability one iota. While nuclear deterrence is still \nimportant, it can be accomplished with many fewer missiles, and at less \ncost.\n  My point, Mr. President, is defense spending does not have to be this \nhigh. It is only this high because Congress and the Department of \nDefense are unwilling to make the tough choices to bring the cost of \ndefending our nation and international interests down to a sustainable \nlevel. When our troops are deployed overseas, and in harms way, it is \nhard to critically look at the defense budget for unnecessary or unwise \nspending. Our instinct is to give our brave men and women whatever they \nneed and then some to get the job done. I would argue, however, that it \nis even more important now than ever to closely examine our spending \npriorities. We need to stretch every defense dollar as far as it can \ngo, and to do that we need to look for efficiencies and cut wasteful \nprojects and items that contribute little to our defense.\n  Careful spending is the way to reduce outlays, not budget gimmicks. \nCongress needs to be more critical, not more clever.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few moments \nabout the F-15 Eagle, the finest fighter plane in the world. The F-15 \narguably has been the most successful fighter in the history of U.S. \naviation warfare. Unfortunately, the United States is in danger of \nlosing this aircraft. The Administration is well aware of the \nperformance record of the F-15, but in not taking the steps necessary \nto save the line.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and I had a debate this \nmorning on congressional oversight of the Department of Defense. I \nagreed with the Senator from Wisconsin that Congress has oversight \nresponsibilities for the Pentagon, but disagreed with abdicating that \nresponsibility to GAO.\n  In the case of the F/A-18E/F, Congress has exercised its oversight \nresponsibilities. Three of the four oversight committees already have \napproved the multiyear contract for the E/F, and the House \nappropriators are expected to next month.\n  But Congress does have a responsibility to address deficiencies in \njudgment within the Defense Department when it sees them. The loss of \nthe F-15 is just such a case. General Richard Hawley, Commander of the \nAir Force's Combat Command, stated just this month that ``. . . the F-\n15 is the most stressed fighter in Air Combat Command's inventory right \nnow in terms of its use in engagements and the operational tempo of the \naircrews.''\n  Given the nature of the threats we face today, which require the \nstrike, range, and versatility of the F-15, it is easy to see why this \nfighter is the most tasked plane in the Air Force. The loss of the F-15 \nwill harm national security and harm my home state of Missouri. Seven \nthousand highly skilled aerospace workers will lose their jobs if the \nF-15 line closes. Those workers and their knowledge is a national \nsecurity asset that must not be lost.\n  On almost every front, the arguments are compelling for maintaining \nthis national security asset. There is plenty of work for the F-15 to \ndo. Purchasing more planes provides a critical fighter to the Air \nForce. Purchasing more planes would preserve the production capability \nof this critical national security asset. Finally, Congress wants to \nencourage budgetary discipline in other tactical fighter programs. \nPurchasing more F-15s would encourage budgetary discipline in the F-22 \nprogram.\n  I and many of the members from the Missouri and Illinois delegations \nhave written to the President requesting a meeting regarding the F-15. \nWe have not received a reply. We have asked the President that he take \nthe steps necessary to keep the F-15 line open. Unfortunately, the \nClinton administration has blocked efforts to do so.\n  The F-15 program was initiated with a Request for Proposal in \nDecember 1968. The first model, the F-15A, entered operational service \nin 1976. The F-15A was a single mission, air superiority fighter with a \nmaximum gross weight of 56,000 pounds.\n  The F-15 entered the world stage as the dominant air superiority \nfighter in 1976, and the evolution of the program demonstrates just how \nmuch this great fighter improved over the years. After twelve years and \nsubsequent models of the F-15 were developed, the latest model, the F-\n15E, was delivered to the Air Force in 1988.\n  The F-15E's gross weight was 45 percent greater than the A model. \nEngineers increased fuel capacity over 50 percent to 34,000 pounds, \ngiving the aircraft record range. Payload was enhanced and the dominant \nair-to-air platform was given critical air-to-ground capabilities. \nAvionics, engine, and weapons technology were also upgraded.\n  The F-15 is arguably the most versatile and effective fighter in the \nhistory of the U.S. Air Force. The F-15 has never lost in air-to-air \ncombat. It has the best air-to-air kill ratio of any fighter in the \nhistory of U.S. aviation warfare: 96.5 to 0. That was certainly the \ncase in Desert Storm, where F-15s destroyed 33 of the 35 fixed-wing \naircraft Iraq lost in air combat. The F-15E maintained a 95.5 percent \naverage mission capable rate, the highest of any fighter in the war. \nThe F-15's stellar performance also has been on display in Kosovo. \nGeneral Johnny Jumper, Commander of U.S. Air Forces Europe, has lauded \nthe performance of the F-15 as the workhorse of the operation.\n  In addition, the F-15 has the best safety record of any Air Force \nfighter: 2.42 losses per 100,000 flying hours. With a record like \nthat--the best safety record, the most successful air-to-air combat \nrecord, the most versatile aircraft in the Air Force inventory--it is \nnot difficult to see why the plane is in such demand.\n  One of the major concerns about the F-15 is the cost of the airplane. \nWhen you compare a $50 million F-15 to an F-22 that costs over $100 \nmillion, the F-15 doesn't look so bad. But even against the cheaper F-\n16, the cost differential is not as great as it appears.\n  The greater capabilities of the F-15 over the F-16 negate much of the \ncost differential. RAND completed a study for the Air Force entitled \n``Measuring Effects of Payload and Radius Differences of Fighter \nAircraft.'' Let me mention several of the major conclusions of the \nreport which were made in light of the nature of future conflicts.\n  First, increasing the use of inertially/GPS-aided weapons could \nexploit the inherent payload carriage advantage of the F-15E. Second, \nmost regional conflict scenarios involve long distances from bases to \ntargets, favoring aircraft having greater combat radius. Third, as the \nfighter force structure contracts, higher quality systems can help \nmaintain force capability.\n  Each of those conclusions point to the desirability of the F-15. A \nmajor conclusion of the report was that ``Over a wide spectrum of \ncases, our analysis suggests that an equal cost but smaller force of F-\n15s is a more cost effective carrier of weapons to the target area than \nan alternative larger force of F-15Cs. Looking to the future, the \nemployment characteristics of future precision weapons, the size of \nmany potential regional conflict theaters, and the reality of expected \nforce structure contractions seem consistent with the capabilities \noffered by large payload, long radius vehicles such as the F-15E.''\n  Another reason to maintain the production capability of the F-15 is \nuncertainty over the future of the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter. These \nfighter programs may have additional developmental difficulties. The F-\n22 is not expected to be in operational service until 2005. The Joint \nStrike Fighter will not be in service until 2010 or later. Remember, \nthese are the best case scenarios.\n  Since its inception, the F-22 program has been restructured three \ntimes, with a 50 percent reduction in the number of planes to be \nprocured. The F-22 is up against a budget cap and has run out of \npolitical capital in Congress. Additional, significant increases in \ncost could jeopardize the program, which still has five years to go to \nInitial Operational Capability.\n  Because the Air Force has had to reduce the number of F-22s it will \nbuy, it will need to rely more on the F-15. Colonel Frederick \nRichardson, chief of F-22 requirements at Air Combat Command, states \n``From a pure numbers standpoint, we're clearly not going to\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nbe able to replace the F-15 with F-22s on a one-to-one basis, which \nmeans we'll have to assume some more risks and probably keep the F-15 \naround for longer than 23 planned.'' But if the F-15 line is shut down, \nthere won't be the production capabilities to fill the gap.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, the F-15 is the best fighter in the \nworld. Its unique capabilities have made it the most heavily tasked \naircraft in the force today, according to General Hawley, Commander of \nthe Air Force's Combat Command.\n  The RAND study concludes that the F-15E is the kind of airplane we \nneed to meet the security threats of the future. The Air Force is not \ninfallible. The RAND study itself encourages the Air Force to pursue a \nbetter mix of fighter aircraft, stating that ``To maintain force \ncapability as its force structure contracts, the Air Force may need to \nstrive for a higher quality mix of forces. The Air Force should be \nalert to opportunities for maintaining and in some cases enhancing \noverall force effectiveness despite cuts in force structure'' (From the \nreport ``Measuring Effects of Payload and Radius Differences of Fighter \nAircraft).\n  By purchasing additional F-15Es, not only are we taking appropriate \nsteps to meet our current force needs, we are preserving a critical \nnational security asset for an uncertain future. I reiterate my call on \nthe President to take the necessary steps to keep the F-15 line open.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the FY 2000 \ndefense authorization bill. As the challenges facing us today \ndemonstrate, the effectiveness of our military, and its readiness to \nact immediately to protect our national interests, must always be a \npriority concern for Congress. The $288.8 billion proposed in this bill \nis a 2 percent real increase over last year's budget and is the first \nreal increase in topline defense funding since FY 1985, the middle of \nthe Reagan administration. After fourteen years of declining, or flat \ndefense spending, we increased authorization for readiness programs by \n$1.1 billion, we increased authorizations for procurement by $2.9 \nbillion, and we increased authorizations for reasearch and development \nby $1.5 billion. I firmly believe this bill makes an important \nstatement at a critical time, affirming our commitment to having the \nbest trained, best equipped, and most effective military in the world, \nboth today and tomorrow.\n  Under the excellent leadership of our colleagues, Senator John \nWarner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the \nranking Democrat, Senator Carl Levin, we stepped up to our \nresponsibility to provide what our soldiers, sailors, and airmen need \ntoday, and we took some very important steps to move toward the \nmilitary that will protect our nation in the next century.\n  The past 14 years of inadequate defense spending has taken a toll on \nthe readiness of our force today. We simply were not able to keep our \ntraining and maintenance at the levels that our role as a superpower \ndemands. The struggle to do so, and the increasing need to use our \nforces to meet the many challenges of the post cold war world has taken \nits toll not just on equipment, but on our people in uniform. Simply \nput, the morale of our forces is suffering. This past year, we not only \nsought out and listened to our nation's top military leaders as they \noutlined the problems facing our military, but in this bill we \naddressed the most critical of those problems, including falling \nrecruitment and retention in critical skill areas; aging equipment that \ncosts more to keep operating at acceptable levels of reliability; a \nneed for more support services for a force with a high percentage of \nmarried personnel.\n  So I am pleased and proud that we reversed the 14 years of declining \ndefense dollars and added the money to readiness and procurement to fix \nthe most urgent near-term readiness problems. But many of these \nproblems are not simple to address, and simply adding money to budget \nlines will not fix them any more than adding money to welfare programs \nfixed the underlying welfare problem in America. Adding money was \nnecessary, but it won't be enough. How we spend the money we spend is \nas important as how much money we spend. We will have to be sure that \nwe are alert to how well the provisions we have included here are \nworking to have a positive effect on those critical problems we must \nsolve.\n  This will be more difficult than it has been in the past. We are now \nin an era of fundamental change for our security and our military. The \ncollapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the unprecedented explosion in \ntechnology are now redefining what it is we are asking our military to \ndo, the threats that it must overcome to do what we ask of it, and the \ncapabilities that our military will bring to bear to successfully \naccomplish its mission. This body has been in the forefront of \ndemanding rigorous assessments about our needs and our potential. We \ndirected, in the Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996, the \nSecretary of Defense to complete a comprehensive assessment of the \ndefense strategy, force structure, force modernization plans, \ninfrastructure, and other elements of the defense policies and programs \nwith a view toward determining and expressing the defense strategy of \nthe United States and establishing a revised program. This assessment, \ncompleted by the Secretary of Defense in 1997, declared that our future \nforce will be different in character than our current force, and placed \ngreat emphasis on the need to prepare now for an uncertain future by \nexploiting the revolution in technology and transforming the force \ntoward that envisioned in Joint Vision 2010. The independent National \nDefense Panel report published in December 1997 concluded ``the \nDepartment of Defense should accord the highest priority to executing a \ntransformation strategy for the U.S. military, starting now.'' These \nassessments, and others that have come to our attention, have \nreinforced the wisdom of Congress in passing in 1986, over the \nPentagon's strenuous objections, the Goldwater-Nichols act and have \nprovided us here with a compelling argument that the future security \nenvironment will be different and that environment requires new \ncapabilities. In last year's defense authorization bill we sent a \nstrong signal to the Pentagon that we must begin to build the \nfundamentally different military by including a provision strongly \nsupporting Joint Experimentation to objectively examine our future \nneeds and how we can best fulfill them.\n  This year, once again, Congress is stepping up to the responsibility \nto ensure our future security. By establishing this year the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities Subcommittee, Senator Warner addressed the \ngrowing consensus that transformation of our military to deal with the \nuncertain future we face is one of our most important objectives and \nthat promoting innovation is among our greatest challenges. Under the \nleadership of the subcommittee chairman, Senator Roberts and the \nRanking Member, Senator Bingaman, we focused on the critical threats \nfacing our nation and the emerging capabilities to deal with these \nthreats. I would like to highlight what I think are important \nlegislative provisions that this new subcommittee placed in this bill \nthat further both transformation and innovation. An ongoing initiative \nof transformation supported by this bill is joint experimentation. The \ncommittee recognized the program's progress in developing joint service \nwarfighting requirements, doctrinal improvements, and in promoting the \nvalues and benefits of joint operations for future wars and contingency \noperations. We need to continue to identify and assess interdependent \nareas of joint warfare which will be key in transforming the conduct of \nfuture U.S. military operations, and expanding projected joint \nexperimentation activities this year will be a strong base for future \nefforts. To this end the committee approved provisions that built on \nits previous support for Joint Experimentation by adding $10 million to \naccelerate the establishment of the organization responsible for joint \nexperimentation, and to accelerate the conduct of the initial joint \nexperiments. The committee also modified the reporting requirements of \nthe commander responsible for joint experimentation to send a strong \nsignal that we expect him to make important and difficult \nrecommendations about future requirements for forces, organizations, \nand doctrine and that we expect the Secretary of Defense fully inform \nus about what action he takes as a result of these recommendations. The \nbill also includes very important provisions to stimulate a greater \ndegree of\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\ntechnical innovation faster within the military. It is my belief that \nthe explosive advances in technology provide the basis for not just a \n``revolution in military affairs,'' but ultimately a complete paradigm \nshift. The opportunities provided by technology give us the promise of \nachieving an order of magnitude increase in military capability over \nthat which we have today. The U.S. military of 2020 and 2030 will be \nbased on the science we begin to develop in the year 2000. But to take \nadvantage of this promise and defend ourselves against its use against \nus by future adversaries, we need to transform our R enterprise from \nits antiquated cold war structure to a fast-moving, better-integrated \nstructure and a process that can seize the leading edge of techno-\nwarfare. The Defense Innovation provisions in this bill establish a new \nvision for military R that is based more on how we want to fight in \nthe future, and begin to change the structure of the military R \nenterprise to achieve that objective through better integration and \nless inefficiency.\n\n  To help establish a new vision, the provisions require the Secretary \nof Defense to determine the most dangerous adversarial threats we will \nlikely face two to three decades from now and what technologies will be \nneeded on our part to prevail against those threats, and merge the \nstrategic and technological decision-making processes. To help lay the \ngroundwork for a new organizational structure for R, the Department \nof Defense is to develop a plan which ensures the crossflow of \ntechnologies into and across R labs, and close the gap between the \nR pipeline and the acquisition pipeline, to ensure the customer is \ninvolved in the entire R process. Our R structure needs to be \nrevamped now so that leading edge techno-warfare can emerge.\n  Along the same lines as innovation, this bill has provisions that \nensure we continue to step up to our responsibility to oversee the \ntransformation of our military to the future force that will protect \nour security in the 21st century. We need a permanent requirement that \nthe Secretary of Defense conduct a Quadrennial Defense Review at the \nbeginning of each new administration to determine and express the \ndefense strategy of our nation, and establish a revised defense plan \nfor the next 10 to 20 years. Complementing the QDR will be a National \nDefense Panel that would conduct an assessment of the defense strategy, \nforce structure, force modernization plans, infrastructure, budget \nplan, and other elements of the defense program and policies \nestablished under the previous quadrennial defense review. Based on our \nprevious experiences with the QDR and NDP, and the debate they raised, \nit is obvious that any one time assessment is not going to provide all \nthe answers we need. Periodic assessments as prescribed by this \nlegislation will continue to provide Congress with a compelling \nforecast of the future security environment and the military challenges \nwe will face.\n  The requirement for the provisions I have mentioned is paramount. The \nneed for renewed emphasis on innovation and transformation has never \nbeen more apparent to me than after my time this year as the Ranking \nMember on the AirLand Subcommittee. That committee, under the excellent \nleadership of Senator Rick Santorum, examined many modernization issues \naffecting the Army and the Air Force. Some of the findings were \ndisturbing, and reinforce the fact that despite the widespread and \ngrowing consensus that transformation is essential to our military, our \nbudgets continue to look much as they have for a decade, focused on \ntoday's force at the expense of tomorrow. I would like to discuss some \nof the disturbing findings, and some of the important provisions we \nincluded in the bill to begin to address these concerns.\n  We found that some responsible voices are concerned that the United \nStates Army is facing a condition of deteriorating strategic relevance. \nThe Army force structure is essentially still a cold war force \nstructure built around very heavy weapons systems. The Army \nmodernization program is based on incremental improvements to this \nforce and is largely unfunded due to hard choices made in the past. \nThis has resulted in inefficient programs and extended program \ntimelines. Consequently we have a force that looks essentially the same \ntoday as it did yesterday, and that doesn't have enough money to \nmaintain an increasingly expensive current force and invest in the Army \nAfter Next which is the future. Kosovo is an example of the future the \nArmy will surely face; operations that are increasingly urbanized, with \ngrowing deployment and access problems, and the need for lighter \nweight, self-deployable systems becomes compelling. We reviewed the \nArmy's modernization plan to understand the relationship between the \ncurrent service modernization program and projected land force \nchallenges. The Army's modernization plans do not appear adequately \naddress these issues. So we have required the Army to take a renewed \nlook at its modernization plans generally, and its armor and aviation \nmodernization programs specifically, to address these challenges and to \nprovide us with modernization plans that are complete and that will be \nfully funded in future budgets. We direct this analysis include the \noperational capabilities that are necessary for the Army to prevail \nagainst the future land force challenges, including asymetrical \nthreats, and the key capabilities and characteristics of of the future \nArmy systems needed to achieve these operational capabilities. We are \nespecially concerned about the ability of the Army to maintain the \ncurrent fleet of helicopters that is rapidly aging and we have included \na provision to require them to provide a complete and funded program \nthat would upgrade, modernize, or retire the entire range of aircraft \ncurrently in the fleet, or provide an alternative that is sufficient \nand affordable. Similarly, the Army's armor modernization plan seems to \nbe inadequate to modernize the current armor force while designing the \ntank of the future, and leads me to believe that the Army must reassess \narmor system plans and provide us with the most appropriate path to \naccelerate the development of the future combat vehicle.\n  The Air Force has fewer apparent modernization problems than the \nArmy, but I wonder if their modernization plan is on the right track. \nOur hearings strongly suggest that the Department of Defense needs to \nanswer several questions about our tactical air requirements, not the \nleast of which is the characteristics, mix, and numbers of aircraft \nbest suited for future conflicts. Kosovo is an example of how important \nthe right mix of platforms and weapons really is to success on the \nbattlefields of the future. We are embarked on three new TAC air \nprograms which may report increasing costs coming dangerously close to \nthe cost caps we have established, and in the case of the F-22 we must \nbe alert to the danger that we will delay critical testing in order to \nnot exceed the caps. And in the out years, the combined costs of these \nprograms will consume a very large share of the overall procurement \nbudget. We must make sure that we are not sacrificing other leading-\nedge capabilities, like unmanned aerial vehicles, information \ntechnology, or space technology. The specific aircraft programs will \nrequire close scrutiny as will the strategy for their use as we attempt \nto decide on the right course in future authorization bills.\n  We must overcome our cold war mentality and further examine and \ndirect our trek into the 21st century. The provisions in this bill \nconcerning innovation and transformation lay the foundation for the \nrequired changes in our defense mind set that will become mandatory as \nwe face far different conflicts in the future--and, as we see on CNN \neveryday, much of that future is already here.\n  In closing, I express my appreciation to the committee for agreeing \nto include in the bill a provision to extend and expand the highly \nsuccessful Troops to Teachers program, which I joined Senators McCain \nand Robb in sponsoring.\n  As my colleagues may know, this program was initially authorized by \nCongress several years ago to help transition retiring and downsized \nmilitary personnel into jobs where they could continue their commitment \nto public service and bring their valuable skills to bear for the \nbenefit of America's students.\n  To date Troops to Teachers has placed more than 3,000 retired or\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\ndownsized service members in public schools in 48 different states, \nproviding participants with assistance in obtaining the proper \ncertification or licensing and matching them up with prospective \nemployers. In return, these new teachers bring to the classroom what \neducators say our schools need most: mature and disciplined role \nmodels, most of them male and many of them minorities, well-trained in \nmath and science and high tech fields, highly motivated, and highly \ncapable of working in challenging environments.\n  The legislation we introduced earlier in the year, and which the \nPresident has endorsed, aims to build on this success by encouraging \nmore military retirees to move into teaching. It would do so by \noffering those departing troops new incentives to enter the teaching \nprofession, particularly for those who are willing to serve in areas \nwith large concentrations of at-risk children and severe shortages of \nqualified teaching candidates.\n  Even with the new incentives we are creating, which we hope will \nrecruit as many as 3,000 new teachers each year, we recognize that \nTroops to Teachers will still only make a modest dent in solving the \nnational teacher shortage. The Department of Education estimates that \nAmerica's public schools will need to hire more than two million new \nteachers over the next decade.\n  But we are confident that, with an extremely modest investment, we \nwill make a substantial contribution to our common goals of not just \nfilling classroom slots, but doing so in way that raises teaching \nstandards and helping our children realize their potential. I can't \nthink of a better source of teaching candidates than the pool of smart, \ndisciplined and dedicated men and women who retire from the military \nevery year.\n  What's more, with this bill, we may well galvanize support for a \nrecruitment method that, as Education Secretary Richard Riley has \nsuggested, could serve as a model for bringing many more bright, \ntalented people from different professions to serve in our public \nschools. This really is an ingenious idea, helping us to harness a \nunique national resource to meet a pressing national need, and I think \nwe would be well served as country to build on it.\n  In putting together this bill, once again hard choices had to be \nmade. We closely examined and analyzed the critical defense issues, and \nwe ended up with are effective and affordable defense authorization \nbill which meets the growing readiness and retention challenges facing \nour armed forces, and augments our investment in the research, \ndevelopment, and procurement of the weapon systems necessary to \nmaintain our military superiority well into the 21st Century. This bill \ncompensates our most valuable resource, our service men and women, plus \nlays the groundwork for a sensible and executable programs for our \nmilitary. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and \nsend an unequivocal message of support to our troops and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill before us.\n  In this bill the Armed Service Committee has done a good job of \nreconciling important yet competing needs for defense funding under \ndaunting fiscal constraints. This bill will be an important \ncontribution to our efforts to strengthen our already first-class \nmilitary, and enhance important benefits for American military \npersonnel, their dependents, retirees, and veterans.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation includes my amendments \nconcerning Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile, National Missile \nDefense, and Air Force cruise missiles. I would offer to the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Member my most sincere thanks for \nworking with me on these important amendments, as I would for the \nassurances they offered regarding the Navy's BQM-74 in a colloquy with \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Bingaman, and myself.\n  Before reviewing several of the bill's provisions, I would like to \nreflect for a moment on the context in which the Senate is considering \nthis year's defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I have had the honor and privilege of serving the \npeople of North Dakota and the nation in the United States Senate for \n13 years. However, this is the first time during my tenure that the \nSenate has taken up a defense authorization bill while our forces are \nengaged in hostilities. I know I am not alone in being especially \nmindful of the fact that the provisions we approve here today will have \na significant impact on our brave men and women in uniform as they do \ntheir jobs in Balkans and over Iraq. I am pleased that several sections \nof this bill address concerns and needs that have been identified \nduring Operation Desert Fox and the current air campaign against \nYugoslavia.\n  Now, Mr. President, allow me to highlight several particularly good \nprovisions of this bill, for which Chairman Warner and Senator Levin \nshould be congratulated.\n  First, this measure wisely provides full funding for vital missile \ndefense programs. National Missile Defense that is affordable, makes \nsense in the context of our arms control agreements, and utilizes \nproven technology has always had my support, and it is encouraging to \nsee that it has been fully funded for fiscal year 2000. After damaging \ncuts in recent years, the revolutionary Airborne Laser program has also \nbeen fully supported this year by the Committee.\n  Chairman Warner and Senator Levin must also be praised for including \nmany of the provisions passed earlier this year by the Senate as part \nof S. 4, the Soldier's Sailor's, Airmen's, and Marine's Bill of Rights. \nSeveral of the most beneficial include a base COLA of 4.8 percent for \nall personnel, coupled with reform of the pay tables. Servicemembers \nwill also now be able to participate in a Thrift Savings Plan.\n  Third, the bill recommends significant funding boosts for vital \nstrategic forces. The Minuteman III Guidance Replacement Program will \nbe kept on schedule with a $40 million hike, and $41.4 million has been \nwisely added for B-52 upgrades identified as top unfunded priorities by \nthe Air Force.\n  Additionally, the Committee has also supported important housing \nimprovement projects at Minot and Grand Forks Air Force Bases in North \nDakota, and acted to accelerate construction of a $9.5 million apron \nextension at Grand Forks.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the Strategic Forces Subcommittee has \nrecommended a reduction in the minimum START I Trident submarine force \nlevel that must be maintained until START II is ratified by the Russian \nDuma. The Commander in Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command has assured \nme that we can meet our deterrence needs with 14 Trident boats, and \nthat retirement of four submarines will not adversely affect our \nnation's security.\n  All of these provisions are steps in the right direction, but there \nare a number of matters in this bill of great concern.\n  First, the Committee yet again did not provide adequate funding for \nthe B-52H bomber force. Today, part of the fleet is deployed to keep an \neye on Saddam, and 15 B-52s are participating in Operation Allied \nForce. The B-52 is the backbone of the long range bomber force, and it \nis my hope that the Committee will review its decision not the fund the \nentire force during conference. As I have said many times before, no \nairborne platform can deliver a greater quantity or quality of nuclear \nand conventional munitions as far without refueling at as little cost \nto taxpayers than today's thoroughly modernized, battle-tested B-52. I \napplaud Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye--the distinguish leadership \nof the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--for acting to fund all 94 \nB-52s in the fiscal year 2000 defense appropriations bill.\n  Additionally, the bill unnecessarily increases spending on the Space \nBased Laser by $25 million. One day we will likely do the NMD mission \nfrom space. But that time is not now, when ground-based NMD will soon \nbe available. Today, the SBL is unaffordable, a clear violation of the \nABM Treaty, and simply not feasible. I hope the extra funding is \nreallocated in conference.\n  Despite these drawbacks, this is a good bill. But it is a better bill \nin light of the addition of the amendments I offered today. Briefly, I \nwould like to summarize each in turn.\n  First, the 1999 Conrad Russian tactical nuclear weapons amendment \nresponds to Russia's extremely disturbing announcement last month that \nit will not reduce its massive tactical\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\nnuclear stockpile, but rather will retain and redeploy many of these \nill-secured thermonuclear weapons.\n  My amendment includes a Sense of the Senate calling on the President \nto urge the Russians to match U.S. tactical nuclear cuts. Additionally, \nmy amendment requires regular reports on Russia's tactical arsenal, \nwhich could be larger than ours by a factor of eight to one, and is not \ncovered by any arms control treaty. My amendment builds on the \nbipartisan amendment I authored last year, and supports the related \nprovisions in the bill before us.\n  I thank the able leadership of the Armed Services Committee for \nsupporting this amendment, as I do for accepting my amendment \nconcerning NMD. As a result of this measure, the Secretary of Defense \nwill be required to study the advantages of a two-site NMD system, as \nopposed to a single site, as is now being considered by the \nAdministration.\n  Although we may be able to defend all 50 states from a single site, \nthere may be advantages from a two-site system related to defensive \ncoverage, system security, and economies of scale. My amendment will \nmake sure these are fully explored. Two sites are also not incompatible \nwith arms control. In fact, the ABM Treaty as originally drafted \nincluded two sites, and it may be appropriate to go back to such an \nidea.\n  The third amendment I offered here today responds to growing concern \non the part of our military commanders about the rapidly diminishing \nsupply of conventional air launched cruise missiles, or CALCMs.\n  Simply put, the CALCM has performed brilliantly in Operation Allied \nForce. Its range of more than 1,500 miles, ability to carry a 3,000 \npound warhead, and dead-on accuracy are unmatched by any other air-\ndelivered cruise missile in the world. It represents a capability we \nwill continue to need, long after the 60 or so left in the inventory, \nand the 320 now being converted from nuclear missions, have been \nexpended.\n  My amendment will require the Secretary of the AF to report to \nCongress on how the Air Force plans to meet the long-range, large \nwarhead, high accuracy cruise missile requirement once the CALCMs are \nexpended.\n  In particular, three options will be reviewed: restarting the CALCM \nline, developing and acquiring a new variety of cruise missile with the \nsame or better performance characteristics, and upgrading planned \nmunitions. The time to start planning on this matter is now, and again \nI thank Chairman Warner and Senator Levin for working with me on this \namendment.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would reiterate that the bill before us \nis a good one, and deserves the support of every Senator.\n  No bill is perfect in every respect, but I am confident that this \ndefense authorization bill will strengthen our armed forces and require \nstudies that will enhance our national security. At a time when we are \nat war in the Balkans, ready for another on the Korean Peninsula, and \ncontinue an open-ended air campaign against Iraq, we owe our brave men \nand women in uniform no less.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voice my strong opposition to the \nfiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Authorization Act.\n  It is with disgust and sorrow that we are forced to bear witness to a \ndefense bill that fails, once again, to understand the 21st century \nreality of national defense. So we set the foundation for our national \ndefense in the new millennium to serve the needs of the Cold War era.\n  Mr. President, this bill exemplifies the Pentagon's utter failure to \nadapt its priorities to the post-Cold War era. It promotes a pervasive \nPentagon mind set that sacrifices the interests of our men and women in \nuniform to the assumption that bigger and more expensive weapons \nsystems are always better. And even then, the prohibitive cost of the \nnew weapons systems necessary means that we can't replace, on a one-to-\none basis, old weapons for newer replacements. No matter how much money \nwe throw at this problem, we won't find a solution. Short of a true \nshift in the paradigm at the heart of our national defense strategy, \nthis problem will continue unabated.\n  Mr. President, I start with a perennial culprit of misguided defense \nstrategy; that is the continued spending of billions of dollars on \nwasteful and unnecessary programs. But this year, it's been taken a \nstep further.\n  For the past year, Mr. President, we've heard the call to address our \nmilitary's readiness crisis from virtually all quarters. We were told \nthat foremost among the readiness shortfalls were operations and \nmaintenance as well as pay and allowances accounts. This 288.8 billion \ndollar bill would have us increase O by all of $1.1 billion, with \n$1.8 billion for a pay raise and a retirement benefit change. That \nworks out to about 1 percent. I'm sure that our men and women in \nuniform are not impressed.\n  Mr. President, even the pay raise and retirement change is fraught \nwith uncertainty and was addressed in a less than proper manner. In \nFebruary, this body passed the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and \nMarines' Bill of Rights. We did so without benefit of hearings, prior \nto the budget resolution, and prior to the issuance of three reports on \nwhether such changes would improve recruitment and retention in our \narmed forces.\n  Then, this month, we paid for the entire $1.8 billion price tag for \nthe pay raise and benefit reform in the emergency supplemental bill. \nYet we still await reports from the General Accounting Office, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and the Department of Defense on the \nefficacy of that action. Earlier this year, GAO offered preliminary \ndata on a study showing that money has been overstated as a factor \naffecting decisions to stay in or leave the military.\n  Instead, GAO found that issues like a lack of spare parts; concerns \nwith the health care system; increased deployments; and dissatisfaction \nwith military leaders have at least as much effect on retention, if not \nmore, then pay issues. These are the same concerns that I have heard \nfrom the men and women out on the front lines.\n  Mr. President, there's no question that certain services have a \nrecruiting and retention problem. For a variety of reasons, officers \nand enlisted members are leaving the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and \nthese services are having problems bringing enough new people on board. \nSerious questions remain unresolved about the cause of this problem, or \nits best solution, yet we will authorize and appropriate the entire \n$1.8 billion in an extraordinary and inappropriate manner. This is a \nquick fix that fails to address the recruitment and retention problem \nin a comprehensive and thoughtful manner.\n  I agree that many service members need a raise. These men and women \nhave chosen to represent our country. They deserve to be paid \nadequately.\n  Meanwhile, in this bill, Mr. President, programs that didn't even \nwarrant DoD's request will receive $3.3 billion. Additionally, weapons \nprocurement is up $2.9 billion beyond DoD's request. Missile defense \nprograms, that paragon of efficiency and effectiveness, is up $509 \nmillion. These and other provisions raise the question, just how \nimportant does the Pentagon think our men and women in uniform are?\n  Mr. President, the bill authorizes 2.9 billion dollars for the Navy's \nF/A-18E/F Super Hornet program. It also authorizes the Navy to enter \ninto a five-year $9 billion multi-year procurement contract for the \nSuper Hornet. It's no secret that I have numerous concerns about the \nprogram, but I am also troubled by the manner in which the Pentagon and \nthe Navy have moved the Super Hornet forward. And my concerns are not \naddressed in the least by this bill. In fact, this bill makes them \nworse.\n  The Super Hornet program hasn't even begun its Operational Test and \nEvaluation, yet we're ready to authorize a five-year, $9 billion \nprocurement contract. The program has 29 unresolved, major \ndeficiencies, yet we're ready to authorize a five-year, $9 billion \nprocurement contract. The program still fails significantly to improve \non the existing F/A-18C aircraft, yet we're poised to blindly authorize \na five-year, $9 billion procurement contract. Mr. President, the logic \nis baffling.\n\n  The current Hornet program has been proven reliable and cost-\neffective. Why do we want to replace the Hornet with a bloated, cost-\nprohibitive aircraft that offers marginal benefits over a reliable \nfighter?\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill has some remarkable budgetary issues. \nEssentially, we can't pay for what this bill authorizes, and remain \nunder the budget caps. The bill meets the fiscal year 2000 Budget \nResolution target for budget authority, but current estimates state \nthat the bill exceeds the outlay target in the Budget Resolution by $2 \nto $3 billion. Even by Washington standards, that is real money.\n  Mr. President, one concern goes to the heart of the entire debate on \nour national defense. The underlying question is this: Why should the \nPentagon receive billions dollars more in funding when it has failed \nutterly to manage its budget?\n  In a 1998 audit of the Department of Defense, GAO, the official \nauditors for the U.S. Congress, could not match more than $22 billion \nin DoD expenditures with obligations; it could not find over $9 billion \nin inventory; and it documented millions in overpayments to contracts. \nGAO concluded that ``no major part of DoD has been able to pass the \ntest of an independent audit.'' Throwing good money after bad without \naccountability is not the answer.\n  Instead, Mr. President, we will sharply increase defense spending. \nThe fiscal year 1999 DoD authorization bill assumed a budget of $250.6 \nbillion. Since that time, the Congress has added $17 billion in \nemergency spending for defense. That spending boost is not offset and \ntakes money directly from the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  Mr. President, we have done a tremendous job of eliminating our \nbudget deficit. We're staring a huge budget surplus in the face, but we \ncan't seem to handle the temptation to spend it. To spend it before we \naddress Social Security and Medicare is irresponsible, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, a large part of that success has been due to the \nwillingness of both the Congress and the President to do more with \nless, to trim excessive spending wherever possible and maintain \nimportant services with fewer resources. We have begun to succeed in \nmany areas of government--education, health care, veterans' care, \nwelfare benefits, environmental programs--but not in defense spending, \nwhere we continue to build destroyers the Navy does not ask for and \ncontinue to build bombers the Air Force does not want. This bill \ncontinues this sad tradition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the National Defense \nAuthorization bill for fiscal year 2000. This past year has \ndemonstrated once again how important it is for the nation to maintain \na well-prepared military. There is no doubt that the Nation's armed \nforces are more active today than they were during cold war. Our \nservicemen and women are currently conducting combat operations in \nKosovo and Iraq. They are serving as peacekeepers in Bosnia, and as \nhumanitarian support personnel in Central America. All of this is \ntaking place in addition to the day-to-day routine operations and \nexercises in which the military participates throughout the year in \nthis country and in many other parts of the globe.\n  The Nation is also calling on its National Guard and Reserve units at \nan increased rate. This past year, Guard and Reserve units from \nMassachusetts were deployed in support of operation Northern Watch in \nIraq, Hurricane Mitch relief in Central America, and most recently \nOperation Allied Force in the Balkans. Our country is proud of their \nservice and grateful for the sacrifices that they, their families and \ntheir civilian employers are making for all of us.\n  Our armed forces continue to do all that is asked of them. This year, \nmany of us in Congress have been concerned about the effects that these \nincreased operations tempo are having on our service personnel and \nequipment. We have no doubt about the dedication and skills of our .14 \nmillion men and women in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps who \nmake our military the most capable fighting force in the world today. \nBut there are increasing questions about whether they are receiving the \nfull support they need to do their job well.\n  This bill addresses many of the current concerns about declining \nreadiness, insufficient equipment, and inadequate recruitment and \nretention. It provides greater support for our military forces, while \nmaintaining a realistic balance between readiness to take care of \nimmediate needs, and the investments needed to develop and procure the \nbest systems for the future.\n  The cornerstone of the Nation's military preeminence rests on many \nfactors, but the most critical is its people. Without men and women \nwilling to volunteer for military duty, the Nation would not be able to \nrespond to crises around the globe as it does today. We need to have \ncutting-edge weapon systems, but we also need dedicated service members \nto operate these systems. It is imperative for us to provide \neffectively for our troops and their families.\n  Today's force is truly an all volunteer force. Its ranks contain \nwell-educated professionals who have chosen to serve their country in \nthe armed forces. We must treat them as professionals or we will lose \nthem.\n  The bill provides a fully-funded and well-deserved 4.8% pay raise for \nmilitary personnel, as well as expanded authority to offer additional \npay and other incentives to critical military specialities. The bill \nalso improves retirements benefits for those who are serving by \naddressing concerns with the current system and allowing servicemen and \nwomen to participate in a Thrift Savings Plan.\n  The bill also enhances the very successful Troops-to-Teachers \nProgram. Troops-to-Teachers was established by Congress in 1993 and has \nenabled over 3,000 service men and women to go into the teaching \nprofession. These teachers have filled positions in high-need schools \nin 48 states. The bill shifts the responsibility for this program to \nthe Department of Education in order to see that it is coordinated as \neffectively as possible with our overall education reform initiatives.\n  Well over half of today's military is married. In many cases both \nparent are employed. The military also contains many single mothers and \nfathers. Each of these constituencies has unique characteristic and \nneed that must be recognized so that we can encourage continued service \nand careers in the Nation's armed forces.\n  The bill contains a provision which I strongly support to authorize \nthe Secretary of Defense to provide financial assistance for child care \nservices and youth programs for members of the armed services. These \nexpanded provisions will ensure that many more military families have \naccess to adequate child care and worthwhile activities for their \nchildren.\n  The Nation's service men and women operate in a demanding and \nstressful environment that is being exacerbated by the increased \noperations of the last decade. One unfortunate result has been an \nincrease in domestic violence involving military families. We have a \nresponsibility to these families to help them cope more effectively \nwith this problem. An important provision in this year's bill require \nthe Secretary of Defense to appoint a military-civilian task force to \nreview domestic violence in the military. In addition, the bill takes \nother steps to guarantee that the Services are more sensitive to this \nproblem and take steps to prevent it.\n  This bill also moves on many fronts to address modernization \nrequirements that have been deferred for too long. As the ranking \nmember on the Seapower Subcommittee, I am pleased that this bill takes \nneeded steps to ensure that the Nation's naval forces have the vessels \nand equipment they need to sustain naval operations throughout the \nworld.\n  The bill authorizes the extension of the DDG-51 destroyer procurement \nfor fiscal year 2002 and 2003 and increases multiyear procurement from \n12 to 18 ships. The bill also authorizes the Navy to enter into a 5-\nyear multiyear procurement contract for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In \naddition, it increases the budget request for the Marine Corps' MV-22 \nOsprey tilt-rotor aircraft from 10 to 12. These are all strong steps in \nstrengthening the readiness of the Nation's Navy-Marine Corps team.\n  Last year, the Defense authorization bill called for a 2 percent \nannual increase in military spending on science and technology from \n2000 to 2008. Unfortunately, the Department's proposed Fiscal Year 2000 \nbudget reduced spending on science and technology programs. The Air \nForce, alone, was slated for $95 million in cuts in science and \ntechnology funding. Such a decline would be detrimental to national \ndefense, particularly when the battlefield\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\nenvironment is becoming more and more reliant on technology. \nFortunately, under the leadership of the Chairman of the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities Committee, Senator Roberts, this bill restores \n$70 million in Air Force Science and Technology funding, to ensure that \nsufficient scientists and engineers are available to conduct research \nto address the Defense Department's technology needs for the future.\n  One of the most important technology fields is in the area of cyber-\nsecurity. The growing frequency and sophistication of attacks on the \nDepartment of Defense's computer systems are cause for concern, and \nthey highlight the need for improved protection of the Nation's \ncritical defense networks. This bill includes a substantial increase in \nresearch and development on defenses against cyber attacks. This \nincrease will greatly improve the Department's focus on this emerging \nthreat.\n  Existing threats from the cold war are also addressed in this \nlegislation. The efforts to provide financial assistance to the former \nSoviet Union for nonproliferation programs such as the Nunn-Lugar \nComprehensive Threat Reduction programs are essential for our national \nsecurity. I commend the administration's plans to continue funding \nthese valuable initiatives and the committee's support for them.\n  One of the greatest threats to our national security is the danger of \nterrorism, particularly using weapons of mass destruction. We must do \nall we can to prevent our enemies from acquiring these devastating \nweapons and from being able to conduct successful terrorist attacks on \nthe Nation. Significant progress has been made toward strengthening the \nNation's response to such attacks, but more must be done. This bill \nstrengthens counter-terrorism activities and increases support for the \nNational Guard teams that are part of this important effort.\n  I commend my colleagues on the committee for their leadership in \ndealing with the many challenges facing us on national defense. This \nmeasure is important to our national security in the years ahead and I \nurge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their hard work \nover the last few days on this very important bill. The events in \nKosovo underscore the importance of the work that we are doing here.\n  I think that we have worked to put together a good bill. It doesn't \nsatisfy everyone, I myself have some concerns about some parts of it, \nbut overall I think that it is a good bill.\n  I want to make a brief statement clarifying the substance of one of \nthe amendments in the manager's package that we passed today.\n  I want to make it clear that the amendment relating to the \nauthorization of $4,500,000 for the procurement and development of a \nhot gas decontamination facility, is directed to the development of \nsuch a facility at Hawthorne Army Depot in Hawthorne, Nevada. That \nreflects the prior agreement of the managers. The text of the amendment \ndoes not specify the location of the facility, and I want to make it \nclear in the record of the proceedings associated with this bill where \nthat facility is to be located and how that money is intended by this \nCongress to be appropriated and spent.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, \nconcerning his amendment, No. 439, on radio frequency spectrums.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to enter into this colloquy \nwith the distinguished President Pro Tempore and former Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is important and I support the \nChairman's efforts to protect critical DOD systems from harmful \ninterference. Some concerns have been raised whether the amendment is \nintended to have an adverse impact on cellular, PCS, and other wireless \nsystems that millions of Americans rely upon. I ask the Chairman \nwhether I am correct in my understanding that that is not his intended \neffort.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the gentleman from South Carolina is \ncorrect in his assessment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I look forward to working with the \ndistinguished Chairman during Conference with the House to ensure the \nsuccessful use of radio frequency spectrum by the military, appropriate \ngovernment agencies, and the private sector.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will be pleased to work with my friend \nfrom South Carolina to ensure that this important amendment has its \nintended affect.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 461\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered today is about \naccepting responsibility. On February 3, 1998, a United States Marine \nCorps EA-6B Prowler severed a ski gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy, \nplummeting twenty people nearly 400 feet to their deaths. We later \nlearned, to our great disappointment, that the pilot and the navigator \nconspired to destroy evidence of the circumstances leading to the \naccident.\n  This amendment, cosponsored by Senators Snowe, Bingaman, Leahy and \nKerrey, upholds the honor of the United States Marine Corps and our \nmilitary both here and abroad, permits the United States to accept \nresponsibility for this tragic accident, and sends an unambiguous \nmessage that we will not tolerate efforts to cover-up our mistakes.\n  The Congress has already authorized payment to rebuild the gondola we \ndestroyed. We have not yet authorized payment to help rebuild the lives \nof the families we destroyed. This amendment allows the Secretary of \nDefense to compensate the victims' families both for the accident and \nthe effort to hide evidence of the accident.\n  A similar amendment was passed by the Senate during consideration of \nthe Emergency Supplemental. The amendment passed unanimously, but was \ndropped during Conference consideration. I urge the Senate to adopt the \namendment and allow the families of the victims to begin healing.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Virginia. I understand his desire to settle \nclaims resulting from the accident involving a Marine Corps aircraft, \nwhich resulted in the unfortunate deaths of civilians in Italy. I note, \nMr. President, that this case is covered by the Status of Forces \nAgreement or SOFA, which provides a mechanism for the settlement of \nclaims. The Robb amendment would provide additional compensation, above \nand beyond that which might be provided by a SOFA settlement.\n  While, I have sympathy for the families of the victims of that \ntragedy, I must bring to the attention of my colleagues another tragic \noccurrence which took the lives of nine American servicemen. I spoke in \nsome detail on this matter last month, when I introduced Senate \nResolution 83. Let me summarize the facts of this accident.\n  On September 13, 1997, a German Luftwaffe Tupelov TU-154M collided \nwith a U.S. Air Force C-141 Starlifter off the coast of Namibia, \nAfrica. As a result of that mid-air collision nine United States Air \nForce Servicemen were killed. Accident investigations conducted by the \nUnited States and Germany both assigned responsibility for the \ncollision and deaths to the German crew, who not only filed an \ninaccurate flight plan, but were flying at the wrong altitude.\n  The families of the nine victims, having endured tremendous suffering \nand significant financial losses, are seeking compensation from the \nGerman government. Sadly, the German government has not been fully \ncooperative. Because these claims do not fall under the Status of \nForces Agreement, the families were instructed to file their claims \nwith Germany and wait for German adjudication.\n  The German government has an obligation to these American families \nwho lost loved ones because of negligence and fault of the German Air \nForce. This is a simple matter of fairness.\n  To address this matter, I introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution \ncalling upon the German government to make quick and generous \ncompensation to the families of the U.S. Servicemen. In addition, it \nprohibits payment to the families of any German national killed in the \ngondola accident caused by the United States Marine Corps aircraft \nuntil the German government has\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\nmade comparable restitution to the families of the U.S. air crew killed \nin September 1997. My Resolution will not block payment to the families \nof any victim who is not a German national.\n  Mr. President, I addressed my concerns on this matter to the \nSecretary of Defense. I requested that he give this matter his \nattention and raise this issue with the German Ministry of Defense. In \naddition, I have invited the German Ambassador to meet with me and \nfamily members of those killed in the air collision. To date, the \nAmbassador has not accepted my invitation.\n  Mr. President, the Robb amendment is unnecessary at this time. The \nclaims of family members of those killed in the ski gondola accident \nshould first go through the SOFA process. In the meantime, the German \ngovernment should quickly and fairly settle the claims of Americans \nkilled as a result of the negligence of the German Air crew. I \nreiterate that the American claims do not fall under SOFA.\n  My amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the Government of \nGermany should promptly settle with the families of members of the \nUnited States Air Force killed in a collision between a United States \nC-141 Starlifter aircraft and a German Luftwaffe Tupelov TU-154M \naircraft off the coast of Namibia on September 12, 1997. My amendment \nalso states the Sense of the Senate that the United States should not \nmake any payment to citizens of Germany as settlement of such citizens \nclaims for deaths arising from the accident involving the United States \nMarine Corps EA-6B aircraft on February 3, 1998, near Cavalese, Italy, \nuntil a comparable settlement is reached between the German Government \nand the American service members' families.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss three \ninterrelated aspects of our country's security at the brink of the new \nmillennium. There has already been discussion of NATO in this new \nworld. We have also intermittently discussed the war in the region of \nKosovo.\n  It's important to reflect on NATO's mission under changed \ncircumstances. It is critical to address the U.S. role as part of NATO. \nAt the same time, we must evaluate threats globally, and we must be \nvigilant in safeguarding our security and defense capabilities.\n  In April we celebrated NATO's 50th Anniversary. Despite the \ncircumstances, we had good reason to celebrate. After the horrors of \nWorld War I and II, U.S. decision makers sought to construct European \nstructures for integration, peace, and security. U.S. policy focused on \ntwo tracks: the Marshall Plan for economic reconstruction and NATO for \ntransatlantic security cooperation.\n  The creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949 \nacknowledged what we failed to admit after World War I. Europe was and \nis a precarious continent. Twice in the first fifty years of this \ncentury America fought against tyrannical and malevolent forces in \nEurope.\n  It is important to remember that NATO did not begin as a response to \nthe Warsaw Pact. This primary objective evolved as a de facto result of \nStalinist expansion into Central Europe.\n  Fifty years later NATO remains the strategic link between the Old \nWorld and the New. NATO achieved its Cold War mission and even now, in \na changed era and very different world, NATO is a vital element of \ntransatlantic cooperation and security.\n  We must, however, be conscious and careful in applying the lessons of \nthe past to current circumstances. None of what I've just talked about \nshould be interpreted as an argument for current NATO action in the \nregion of Yugoslavia, Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro.\n  The Administration repeatedly suggests that violence in the Balkans \nignited the First World War. This is true. A member of the Black Hand, \nA Serbian nationalist group, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand. \nSerbia, at that time was a small nation fighting for independence \nwithin a crumbling Austrian-Hungarian Empire.\n  Due to Russia's alliance with Serbia and Germany's open-ended \nmilitary pact with Austria, both Germany and Russia mobilized \nimmediately. Other than a few neutral countries--Norway, Sweden, Italy, \nSwitzerland, and Spain--the rest were locked in polarized blocs that \nset the Triple Alliance against the Triple Entente.\n  Such polarized blocks do not exist today. Serbia's aggression against \nKosovar Albanians can and has created regional instabilities. But this \nwould not lead to World War Three.\n  This is not 1914. Only one alliance dominates Europe--NATO. NATO can \nbe used as a force for peace. Acting without regard to security \nperceptions outside of NATO, however, can lead us down a very different \nand dangerous path.\n  Our current actions disregarded others' views of their own security. \nOur actions in Kosovo may yet unravel any gains achieved in nuclear \narms reductions and cooperative security alliances since the Soviet \nUnion collapsed.\n  Furthermore, NATO's response in Kosovo has accelerated and \nexacerbated regional instability. We've managed to create a \nhumanitarian crisis, while not achieving any of our military \nobjectives. Of course, any rational person could see that an air \ncampaign from 20,000 feet would not prevent executions, rapes, and \npurges on the ground. This is especially true given the five months of \ntime we gave President Milosevic to plan, prepare, and position his \nforces.\n  One relevant aspect of today's world that the Administration failed \nto mention in their arguments for involvement in this campaign is the \nimpact this would have on U.S.-Russian relations. We have a tendency to \nbelieve that Russia is so weak and needs our money so bad that we can \ndisregard their views or interests.\n  I ask you to consider two key facts: as Russia's conventional \nmilitary declines, reliance on their nuclear arsenal increases; global \nstability cannot be achieved without cooperation between the U.S. and \nRussia.\n  The reciprocal unilateral withdrawal of thousands of tactical nuclear \nwarheads between the U.S. and Russia may also be reversed. Russia has \nrecently announced its intent to redeploy components of its tactical \nnuclear arsenal. We were on a path through arms reduction and steps \ntoward increased transparency to addressing tactical weapons. These \ngains are steadily unraveling.\n  The Administration never suggested that NATO strikes against Serbs \nmay lead to a worst-case scenario over the next five years in Russian \npolitics. Russia faces Parliamentary elections this year and a \nPresidential election next.\n  According to one of the most pro-American Duma members, the U.S. \nAdministration picked the best route to influence the upcoming \nelections in favor of Communist and ultra-nationalist parties. In \nRussia, 90 percent of the public support the Serbs and are against \nNATO.\n  This war will have profoundly negative impact on the relationship \nbetween Russia and the U.S. for a long time.\n  The U.S. was supposedly not fighting for either side. We were trying \nto be the honest broker, at least in the beginning. Now, our actions \nhave created enemies. These enemies have historical ties to Russia. \nRussia's economy is in tatters, but Russia still controls the only \nmeans to obliterate the United States.\n  We feel we're in the right, because we are fighting a tyrant, one \ncapable of great evil. I don't disagree with the objectives sought, but \nI do believe that the Administration should have taken into account the \npossible political consequences of our actions on Russia's political \nfuture, as well as our future relationship with Russia.\n  There are those who suggest that NATO must be victorious in the \nKosovo conflict. Victory in Kosovo is short-term if we do not sort out \nthe broader consequences of a victory dictated on NATO's terms.\n  Russia is edging closer to China, and India. Our blatant disregard of \nother's security needs and perceptions may culminate in a Eurasian bloc \nallied against us--against NATO. And election campaigns in Russia will \nbegin very soon.\n  As European leaders converged to celebrate NATO's 50th birthday, they \nspent much time debating and deliberating on NATO's future. NATO's \npresent reflects poor policy decisions and an ineffective military \napproach.\n  Mr. President, I'd also like to take this opportunity to discuss the \ngrievous situation of our military today.\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\nRecent actions in Kosovo underscore the self-inflicted damage we have \ndone to our national security in the years since the Cold War.\n  I was one of many Senators during the 1980s who supported seeing our  \nnation's defenses bolstered in order to bring the Soviet Union to its \nknees. We defeated them--not through hot war--but by demonstrating the \nunparalleled power of American democracy and free market dominance over \na command economy.\n\n  The collapse of the Soviet state was inevitable, but it would have \ntaken a lot longer without the catalyst of our rapid defense buildup. \nThis charge greatly accelerated the breakdown in the Soviet Union's \neconomy. Their political and economic institutions unraveled in light \nof America's clear superiority.\n  In 1991, after years of focus on a strong defense, when the Iraqis \noccupied Kuwait, U.S. forces were able to demonstrate their dominance. \nThe U.S. military liberated Kuwait in a short, decisive campaign. The \nGulf war was a ground and air war. It was a full blown offensive.\n  And at no time during the Gulf war did anyone even so much as hint \nthat U.S. forces were spread too thin. There were no reports of not \nbeing able to thwart an attack from North Korea due to our commitment \nin the Gulf. Never did we hear of depleted munitions stores, shortages \nin spare parts for our equipment, or waning missile supplies.\n  Eight years later, the cracks in our defense capabilities emerged \nafter less than 60 days of an air campaign in the Kosovo region. In \nless than forty days of what have been limited air strikes, respected \nofficials reported that U.S. defenses are spread too thin. If North \nKorea or Saddam wanted to capitalize on our distraction in the Balkans, \nwe currently would not have the means to defend our interests.\n  We've been forced to divert resources from other regions in the world \nto meet NATO's needs in the Balkans. Our transport capabilities are \ninsufficient. We evidently have too few carriers. Our munitions \nreserves are depleted. And, as ludicrous as it may sound, for years our \nmilitary personnel have had to scramble to find spare parts.\n  In the early nineties, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the \nU.S. was viewed as the only remaining ``Superpower.'' Our global \neconomic and military dominance was unquestioned. That time was, in the \nwords of respected scholars and strategists, the Unipolar Moment. There \nwas no doubt that the U.S. could defend its interests in any \nsituation--whether military action or political persuasion were \nnecessary.\n  We have squandered that moment and missed many opportunities to \ncapitalize on our success. In fact, out of complacency and misplaced \nperceptions of the post-Cold War world, our defense capacity today is \ninsufficient to match the threats to our national interests.\n  Many years of self-indulgence and inattention to our nation's defense \ncannot be corrected with a one-time boost. This is a complex and long-\nterm problem. But I'm committed to ensuring that our nation's defenses \nare not further eroded. I'm fed up with the complacency that has \ncreated our current situation.\n  We must have a strong defense. We must ensure that the men and women \nin uniform have the right equipment, the best training, and are \nafforded a quality of life sufficient to keep them in the military. \nThis cannot be done by sitting on our hands and hoping that the world \nremains calm.\n  Additions to readiness accounts, ammunition, and missile stocks in \nthe emergency supplemental for Kosovo will help ensure that our \nfighting forces are not in worse shape than before this engagement. It \nprovides a small, but significant, step forward.\n  The Defense Authorization bill before us takes additional steps in \nthe right direction. I commend Senator Warner and his diligent staff on \nthe hard work they've done to balance priorities and provide for our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  Let me briefly outline some major provisions of this bill that I \nconsider important and appropriate to address some of our military's \nmost pressing needs.\n  As an additional boost to problems in readiness, this bill authorizes \nan additional $1.2 billion in operations and maintenance funding.\n  The bill also includes over $740 million for DoD and Department of \nEnergy (DoE) programs that provide assistance to Russia and other \nstates of the former Soviet Union. These programs address the most \nprevalent proliferation threat in our world today.\n  The $3.4 billion increase in military construction and family housing \nis an essential element of providing our armed forces with the quality \nof life they deserve. In addition, pay raises and improved retirement \nplans demonstrate our commitment to the people who serve in our \nmilitary.\n  I do not believe that increased pay and better retirement address the \nfull spectrum of issues that feed into retention problems. The \npreliminary findings of a GAO study requested by myself and Senator \nStevens indicate that the main problem is not pay, but rather working \nconditions. Lack of spare parts and deficient manning were the most \nfrequent reasons offered for dissatisfaction with their current \nsituation.\n  These are important findings, because it's something we can address. \nAs more conclusions come to light, we can do a better job in fixing the \nproblems that currently contribute to recruitment and retention. We \nmust pay close attention to these issues. The men and women serving in \nour military are the sole assurance of a strong, capable U.S. defense \ncapability.\n  A strong defense must be coupled with a consistent set of foreign \npolicy objectives that strive to reduce or contain security threats. At \npresent, we have neither.\n  Mr. President, it seems we must focus on shifting the balance back in \nour favor. This cannot be done ad hoc. Securing U.S. interests requires \nsustained commitment and well-planned execution. First, we must provide \nthe domestic means for strong, capable armed forces. Second, we must be \ncalculated and careful in the application of force as a fix to failed \ndiplomacy.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to state my views on the Fiscal Year \n2000 Defense Authorization bill. First, I congratulate the Chairman, \nSenator Warner, and the Ranking Member, Senator Levin, for their work \non this bill. Together they helped move this bill through the Senate in \nrecord time. The broad support for this bill provides a promising \nbeginning to Senator Warner's tenure as Chairman of the committee, and \nit is a tribute to Senator Levin's ability to work with members from \nboth parties on matters of national defense.\n  This bill provides an increase in defense spending that will maintain \nthis nation's superpower status as we enter the 21st Century. As \nalways, this defense bill relies heavily on Connecticut--the Provisions \nState. In procurement and modernization, Blackhawk helicopters, \nComanche helicopters, the F-22 program, the Joint Strike Fighter \nprogram, Joint STARS aircraft, and submarine programs were all funded \nat or above the President's request. For our military personnel, this \nbill authorizes much deserved pay and pension increases. Other \nimportant programs that this bill funds include: military construction, \ncooperative threat reduction and ballistic missile defense.\n  I commend the Senate Armed Services Committee for increasing the \nnumber of H-60 helicopters requested in this bill from 21 to 33. The \nCommittee added nine UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters for a total of 15 \nthat will begin to fill the Guard's requirement for 90 Blackhawks. I \nfeel strongly that it is important to fill this requirement, especially \nas we continue to call up our Guard and Reserve forces to serve in the \nBalkans. Those forces deserve to have the most modern equipment that \nthis country can provide. The Committee also added three CH-60 \nhelicopters, the Navy version of the Blackhawk. The CH-60 will replace \nseveral models of the Navy's helicopter fleet and will perform all the \nmissions for which those models were responsible.\n  The committee gave a vote of confidence to the Comanche helicopter \nprogram by adding over $56 million in research and development funding \nto the Administration's request. Likewise, it supported the purchase of \na fifteenth Joint STARS aircraft. Those aircraft are performing \nmagnificently\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\nin the Balkans, and I feel that this nation should continue to build \nthese aircraft until the Air Force has the 19 aircraft it needs.\n  The guided missile submarine concept received a boost by this \ncommittee in the form of $13 million in needed research and development \nfunding. The concept proposes converting four Trident submarines into \nguided missile submarines which would be capable of launching more \ntomahawk missiles than any ship afloat today. As important as the \nfunding authorization was the provision the committee included in the \nbill to reduce the lower threshold of our Trident submarine force. That \naction will allow the Navy to reduce the number of Trident submarines \nfrom 18 to 14, an adjustment to the fleet that the Chief of Naval \nOperations has requested. By including the provision, the committee \nsurmounted an obstacle to implementing the submarine concept and saved \ntaxpayers billions of dollars which would have gone towards upgrading \nTrident missiles.\n  This bill authorizes important increases in military pay and pensions \nthat this nation's servicemen and servicewomen deserve. I note that \nthis bill not only calls for more pay and higher pensions, but it also \nidentifies how this nation will pay for those important increases. \nFurthermore, through the regular hearings with Defense Department \nofficials over the last few months, the Department has had ample \nopportunity to air its views with respect to provisions of this bill \nthat address pay and pension issues. I am proud to support these \nprovisions.\n  As for the prospect of additional military base closures, a minority \nof the Senate once again sought to mandate another Base Realignment and \nClosure round in 2001. I opposed that amendment for a few reasons. Even \nafter a Defense Department report and a General Accounting Office \nreport, there is no clear accounting of how much this nation saves from \nbase closure rounds. Furthermore, the long-term environmental clean-up \ncosts are virtually impossible to estimate. I think that before we put \ncommunities across the country through the wrenching experience of \nanother base closure round, we must better understand the costs and \nbenefits of another round. Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that \nsome of the bases ordered to be closed under previous rounds have yet \nto be closed. Of those that have been closed, some have not yet been \nturned over to the surrounding communities. I would like to know the \nfull impact of the previous rounds, and I will not put communities in \nmy state at risk by rushing into another round without being absolutely \ncertain that this nation is ready.\n  The Senate wisely voted to table an amendment offered by Senator \nSpecter which would have sent a dangerous signal to Slobodan Milosevic \nthat the United States is not committed to ending his horrific campaign \nof genocide. As we debate these issues, we must be cognizant of the \nfact that our men and women in uniform are risking their lives in the \nBalkans. They deserve to know that our Nation's leaders, including the \nSenate, stand firmly behind them. An amendment which limits our \nCommander-in-Chief's ability to act sends exactly the opposite message. \nIt tells every soldier, sailor and airman and woman that the United \nStates Senate is wavering in our support for their efforts and \nsacrifices. That is a statement we must never send.\n  Similarly, we must remember that there are innocent men, women and \nchildren, desperately looking to the United States and NATO for relief \nfrom Slobodan Milosevic's hateful campaign of genocide. Approval of the \nill-advised amendment would have likewise sent a signal to the 1.4 \nmillion ethnic-Albanians who have been displaced from their homes that \nwe were wavering at the moment they needed us most.\n  As I have said time and time again, we must be mindful of the United \nStates role as a world leader and the degree to which our NATO allies \nlook to us for guidance. The Specter amendment would have precluded the \nPresident and our military from effectively responding to urgent \nmilitary requirements and putting an end to Slobodan Milosevic's \nmurderous campaign as expeditiously as possible. It would also have \nprecluded the United States from taking the lead on an important \npotential avenue to bringing a lasting peace to the Balkans.\n  In closing, I again commend the managers of this bill for their \nefforts. This legislation is a fitting tribute to our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines who protect this Nation's freedom and \nliberty. It comes at an appropriate time--just before Memorial Day when \nwe will honor the sacrifices that the members of our armed forces have \nmade.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as my colleagues in the Senate know, I \nmake a point of going through spending bills very carefully and \ncompiling lists of programs added at the request of individual members \nthat were not included in the Defense Department's budget request. I \nshould state at the outset that I believe Chairman Warner and Senator \nLevin, the ranking member, should be commended for their efforts at \nproducing a bill that addresses a number of very serious readiness \nproblems. As American pilots continue to fly missions over Yugoslavia \nand Iraq while maintaining commitments in virtually every part of the \nglobe, the care and maintenance of the armed forces cannot be taken for \ngranted--not if we wish to avoid imperiling our vital national \ninterests.\n  I would be remiss in my responsibilities, however, were I not to \nilluminate the large number of programs that were added primarily for \nparochial reasons. With our military stretched perilously thin after \nmore than a decade of declining budgets and expanding commitments, we \ncan ill afford the business-as-usual practice of adding programs not \nrequested by the military. It is for that reason that the list of \nunrequested programs that I would like to submit for the record, \ntotaling more than $4 billion, is so troubling.\n  While I continue to have concerns about the integrity of the process \nby which the service unfunded priorities lists are produced, I have \nthis year chosen to respect their legitimacy and have excluded from the \ncompilation of unrequested projects I am submitting for the Record \nthose items added by members that are reflected on the unfunded \npriority lists.\n  To wit, while I have to question the reverse economies of scale \nachieved on the C-40 program--in effect, why do two aircraft cost more \non a unit cost basis than did the one aircraft included in the budget \nsubmission--I have not included the second aircraft, added by the \ncommittee, on this list because of its inclusion on the Navy's unfunded \npriority list. Similarly, I have omitted from my list two KC-130J \naircraft because they are on the Marine Corps unfunded priority list \ndespite the incredible surplus in C-130 frames already in the U.S. \ninventory. I will mention these programs no more today.\n  Let me be very clear, however, that the process by which budgets are \nput together is seriously flawed and both fiscal responsibility and \nnational security dictate that we strive to improve it. After so many \nyears of going through this exercise, though, I find it difficult to be \noptimistic.\n  I am, for instance, bewildered by the continued annual addition to \nthe budget request of $18 million for MK-19 automatic grenade \nlaunchers. The repeated addition by Congress of the MK-19 to the \ndefense budget forces to me to wonder whether someone hasn't stockpiled \nthese things out of some psychological need to accumulate grenade \nlaunchers as a substitute for balls of string. What on earth does \nsomeone think the Marines are doing with its automatic grenade \nlaunchers that compels this body to repeatedly add them to the budget? \nHow do we justify continuing to allocate significant amounts of money \nfor a program that the Corps does not even include on its unfunded \npriorities list?\n  Every single year we add funding--this year, $15 million--for the \nNULKA anti-ship missile decoy system. An Israeli destroyer during the \nSix Day War, a British destroyer during the battle for the Falklands, \nand the USS Stark incident are all testimony to the threat of anti-ship \nmissiles. That only one U.S. ship has been so targeted since World War \nII, however, and under rather unique circumstances at that, makes it \ndifficult to understand why we spend so much money every year for \ndecoys.\n  I have been critical in the past about earmarking funds for the \nNational Automotive Center, an odd member-\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\ncreated entity that has taken on a life of its own. The bill includes \n$6.5 million for development of a Smart Truck, with half of the money \nearmarked for the National Automotive Center. Presumably, this will be \na really smart truck, inasmuch as it is taking us for over $6 million. \nI can only hope it will be able to change its own oil.\n  The Administration's military construction request was a true \nexercise in Byzantine budgeting. Incrementally funding the entire \nmilitary construction program was not somebody's better idea, and I \napplaud the committee's rejection of that proposal. I must condemn, \nhowever, that same committee's decision to add $923 million in projects \nnot requested by the services. A new $3.6 million C-17 simulator \nbuilding at Jackson Airport; a new $8.9 million C-130J simulator \nbuilding at Keesler Air Force Base; a new $6 million visiting officers' \nquarters at Niagara Falls; $17 million to replace family housing at the \nMarine Corps Air Station at Yuma; and an addition of $10 million for a \nnew education center and library at Ellsworth are just a few of the \nitems added to the budget by members for parochial reasons.\n  Let me note at this junction that many of these projects may very \nwell be meritorious upon further review. For example, I know there is a \ndire need for new family housing at the Marine base in Yuma, Arizona. \nBut is that need greater than exists at some other base? The method by \nwhich that project was added does not allow for the kind of comparative \nanalysis that should be an integral part of the process by which these \nbudgets are drafted.\n  Of particular interest is the $241 million for ammunition \ndemilitarization facilities, none of which was requested by the \nmilitary. I recognize the legitimate need to expeditiously dismantle \naging chemical weapons and deal with the environmental contamination \nresulting from their construction and storage over many years. My \nconcern lies in the perpetually uncertain environment in which spending \nbills are prepared. Are each of these facilities necessary, and does \neach one need to be funded during a fiscal year for which funding for \nit was not requested? Chemical demilitarization has been an important \npriority for the Armed Services Committee, but the case has not been \nmade that these programs had to be added to this bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I may make light of some of these programs, but the \nissue is deadly serious. Our armed forces are stretched perilously thin \nas global commitments grow and operations like those in Kosovo and the \ncontinuing operation in Bosnia continue to take their devastating toll \non our ability to remain prepared for the major regional contingencies \nthat are inarguably tied to our vital national interests. Not every \nprogram on the list that I am submitting for the Record is impractical \nor worthy of ridicule. But to argue their worth individually and in a \nvacuum is to miss the point.\n  I do not include on these lists most programs related to defense \nagainst weapons of mass destruction, and generally give classified \nprograms a free ride. The nature of the process, however, is such that \na certain amount of skepticism is warranted. It is too much a matter of \nroutine practice that items are added for primarily parochial reasons \nunder headings that sound logical and yet which are low or no priority \nfor the services. As absolutely important as areas like chemical and \nbiological defense are, it is equally important that funds allocated to \ndeal with those threats are not wasted on programs added to the budget \nsolely because a contractor convinced his or her senator that they \ndeserve $2 million to investigate that program's potential when other \nhigher priority programs already exist to fulfill the requirement.\n  I have respected the unfunded priority lists this year because they \nprovide the only roadmap as to where the services would allocate \nadditional dollars if such funding were made available. It is far from \na perfect process, but it is all we have. That there are still over $4 \nbillion in member adds in this bill is testament to the indomitable \nwill of members of this body to force projects into a strained defense \nbudget in defiance of fiscal prudence and operational requirements. \nThat is not intended as a compliment; it is simple acknowledgment that \nthere is still ample room for improvement.\n  Finally, let me also note for the record my concerns regarding the \namendment offered by Senator Lott to narrow the scope of the Pilot \nProgram for Commercial Services. I believe the amendment will restrict \nthe ability of the Secretary of Defense to explore all options for fair \nand reasonable procurement of transportation services. This will \ncontinue to artificially inflate the Defense Department's \ntransportation cost and will directly impact the findings of the \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000 MEMBER ADD-ONS, \n                          INCREASES & EARMARKS\n\n                            Army Procurement\n\nAircraft Procurement, Army (page 25):\n  LONGBOW.........................................................$45.0\n  UH-1 Mods........................................................72.5\n  ASE Mods (ATIRCM).................................................8.1\n  ASE Infrared CM...................................................6.6\nMissile Procurement, Army (page 27):\n  PATRIOT mods.....................................................60.0\nProcurement of W, Army (page 29):\n  M109A6 155mm Howitzer mods.......................................20.0\n  Field Artillery Ammunition Support Vehicle PIP...................20.0\n  M88 Improved Recovery Vehicle....................................72.0\n  Heavy Assault Bridge mod.........................................14.0\n  MK-19 40mm Grenade Launcher......................................18.3\nProcurement of Ammunition, Army (page 31):\n  40mm, all types...................................................8.0\n  60mm mortar, all types............................................9.0\n  102mm HE M934 w/mo fuse...........................................4.0\n  105mm ARTY DPICM.................................................10.0\n  Wide Area Munitions..............................................10.0\n  Arms Initiative..................................................14.0\nOther Procurement, Army (page 35):\n  High Mobility Multi-Purpose Vehicle..............................17.0\n  Army Data Distribution System....................................25.9\n  SINGCARS Family..................................................70.0\n  ACUS mod program.................................................50.0\n  Standard Integrated CMD Post System...............................9.2\n  Lightweight Maintenance Enclosure.................................3.2\n  Combat Training Centers Support...................................7.0\n  Modification of In-Service Equipment..............................8.1\n  Acquisition Stability Reserve Construction Equip.................29.6\n\n                                Army RDT\n\n  Basic Research in Counter-Terrorism..............................15.0\n  AAN Materials.....................................................2.5\n  Scramjet Technologies.............................................2.0\n  Smart Truck.......................................................6.5\n  Medteams..........................................................1.8\n  PEPS..............................................................8.0\n  Virtual Retinal Eye Display Technology............................5.0\n  Future Combat Vehicle Development................................10.0\n  Digital Situation Mapboard........................................2.0\n  Accoustic Technology Research.....................................4.0\n  Radar Power Technology............................................4.0\n  OICW.............................................................14.8\n  FIREFINDER Accel.

On behalf of the Senior Senator from Oregon and \nmyself, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the Honorable Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Armed Services on the issue of Chemical \nDemilitarization,\n  Oregon is one of the eight states with chemical weapons stored and \nawaiting destruction required by the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Our local communities surrounding the Umatilla depot have serious \nconcerns about the pending demilitarization program. These concerns \ninclude the safety of the local population and the impact on the local \ncommunities of undertaking a huge demilitarization effort to destroy \n3700 tons of chemical agent.\n  This effort will require the influx of nearly one thousand workers to \nbuild and operate the destruction facility over a period of eight \nyears. These workers will require the communities to provide \nfacilities, infrastructure and services to accommodate them. These \nefforts will cost money, and we are concerned that the economic impact \nof this effort will be a huge drain on the local communities. We are \nconcerned that, while there may be a considerable impact on the local \ncommunities, there has not been adequate attention given this issue by \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Would the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee \nagree to work with us to look into this situation so we can better \nunderstand the problem, and in so doing, find a solution?\n  Finally, I mentioned my concerns to the Secretary of Defense. He \nexpressed his willingness to work with us. I would ask that the \nChairman and Ranking Member discuss this problem with the Secretary of \nDefense and consider including language in the Conference Report on the \nissue of impact. I understand from the Office of the Secretary that the \nArmy will work with us to include some acceptable report language. We \nwant to make it clear that any discussion of impact would be restricted \nto the chemical demilitarization program and account. Again, I thank \nthe honorable Chairman and Ranking Member.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President. I thank Senators Smith and Wyden for \nraising this issue and bringing it to our attention.\n  I understand that Senators Smith and Wyden have serious concerns \nabout this situation, and that the local communities are worried about \nthe impact that this process may have on them. I would be happy to work \nwith the Senators in looking into this situation and helping to obtain \ninformation that will provide us with a fuller understanding of the \nissues relating to chemical demilitarization.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to thank you on behalf of the people of Oregon for \nyour willingness to work with us on this very important issue. There \nare indeed serious concerns surrounding chemical demilitarization, but \nOregonians are committed to working with the Army and the Chemical \nDemilitarization Program to meet the obligations under the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. The future and success of the Chemical \nDemilitarization program will depend on the communication we enter \ninto, and the cooperative solutions that we produce. This is a very \nchallenging program for both the Army and the good people of the depot \nstates. We acknowledge and appreciate all the hard work that has been \ndone thus far, and very much look forward to the completion of the \nchemical demilitarization project in Oregon.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the United States is engaged in a dangerous \nair war against Yugoslavia. More than 30,000 members of the U.S. \nmilitary have been deployed to the Balkans to prosecute this campaign. \nWhile we read the latest news from the front every morning in the \ncomfort of our homes and offices, American men and women in uniform are \nliving the harrowing details day in and day out.\n  It is fitting that the Senate, in the midst of this conflict, enact \nwithout delay the National Defense Authorization Bill. This bill-- \nwhich includes a significant pay raise for the military as well as a \nhealthy increase in funding intended to improve military readiness--\nsends a strong signal of support to the men and women of the United \nStates military, and to their families.\n  I commend Senator Warner, the new and capable Chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, and Senator Levin, the able ranking minority \nmember, for their leadership in producing an excellent bill. This \nlegislation bears testament to the skills and willingness of both of \nthese distinguished Senators to craft meaningful policy decisions in \nthe context of bipartisan consensus.\n  Earlier this week, the Senate Appropriations Committee, of which I am \nthe ranking member, approved a Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal \nYear 2000 that goes hand-in-glove with this measure. Last week, \nCongress sent to the President an emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill to fund the Kosovo operation. Together, these bills take great \nstrides toward giving our military forces the tools that they need and \nthe support that they deserve to protect the national security of the \nUnited States and to execute the military's many critical missions both \nat home and overseas.\n  While the air war over Yugoslavia is on the front pages of the \nnewspapers every day, we must never forget that behind the headlines, \nscores of other U.S. forces are engaged in difficult, and often \ndangerous, missions around the globe. From the peacekeeping patrols in \nBosnia to the dangerous skies over Iraq to the tense border between \nNorth and South Korea, U.S. military personnel face the potential peril \nof combat every day. Resources have been stretched thin while operating \ntempos are constantly being accelerated. These are difficult times for \nthe military, and I salute the dedication of the men and women who \nserve their nation so diligently. These are the individuals who stake \ntheir very lives on the policies and programs that we debate here in \nthe Senate. These are the individuals to whom we must dedicate our best \nlegislative efforts.\n  Mr. President, this bill delivers the goods. It includes a 4.8 \npercent pay raise for the military, and it restores full retirement \nbenefits to service members. It adds more than $1.2 billion to the \nnuts-and-bolts readiness accounts--base operations, infrastructure \nrepairs, training, and ammunition--that are so vitally needed to \nimprove the long term readiness of the armed forces. It funds the \npurchase of essential equipment and weapons systems. And, through the \nefforts of the newly\n\n[[Page S6273]]\n\nestablished and forward looking Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nSubcommittee, on which I am pleased to serve, it invests in programs to \ncombat the ever increasing threat to the United States of terrorist \nattack, information warfare, and chemical and biological weapons.\n  Mr. President, we cannot put a price on the sacrifices and \ncontributions of our military, but we can make sure that the best \nfighting forces in the world have the necessary tools of their trade. \nThat is the purpose of this bill. We are sending a message to the \ntroops that we have heard their concerns and we have responded to them. \nI urge the Senate to move quickly to pass this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                  BRAC\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when Congress enacted the BRAC legislation, \nit left little doubt that the local community was intended to be the \nprime beneficiary of surplused facilities. Agencies were designed and \ncreated to determine the best use of the facilities deemed surplus by \nBRAC. In many cases, it has been determined that local school districts \nare the best recipient for use of these facilities.\n  Unfortunately, local school districts and other public education \nentities today face a barrier in acquiring the surplused facility.\n  This barrier is a highly punitive fee established by the Department \nof Education that can actually discourage local education entities from \nacquiring surplus defense facilities.\n  ED has determined that certain non-instructional uses of these \nfacilities, such as the vaguely defined ``research'' disqualify the \ndistrict for a 100 percent exemption from the costs of acquiring the \nsurplus facility. Similarly, ED has determined that certain other uses \nof these facilities, such as storage, even if directly related to \ninstruction, warrants payment of a fee.\n  For example, if a school district wants to use 70% of a facility for \ninstructional purposes and 30% for storage of teaching related \nsupplies, this district could be charged upwards of $300,000.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, I find it somewhat ironic that, when the \nPresident's own education agenda calls for another federal program and \nmore federal funding to provide school construction funds, the Clinton \nadministration's Department of Education has concocted this schedule of \nfees to charge local school districts who wish to use surplus military \nproperty.\n  I know that in my state of Utah, we have a great need for additional \nfacilities. For example, of Utah's 461,000 students, 22,255 of them--or \nnearly 5% take classes in portable classrooms. That is unacceptable and \nthe arbitrary requirements that the Department of Education has set for \ndistricts to acquire disposed defense facilities are onerous and should \nbe corrected.\n  I believe every public education entity ought to be eligible for a \n100% exception from the payment of costs to acquire the facility when \nthe surplus defense facility is used for instruction or other \neducational purposes.\n  I understand that the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee does not have jurisdiction over the Education Department. He \ndoes, however, have jurisdiction over the underlying statute that the \nDepartment of Education has a role in carrying out.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree with my good friend from Utah that BRAC \nprocedures should produce reasonable opportunities for communities to \nturn facilities into productive use. I believe the Defense Base Closure \nand Realignment Act of 1990 provision does that, by allowing a cost-\nfree transfer for economic development. I don't believe anything in the \nprovision's language poses an obstacle to what the Senator from Utah \nwishes to accomplish.\n  Mr. HATCH. The problem with the language is that it's too vague. For \nthe past two days, I have asked OSD, the Army General Counsel, and the \nreal Property Administrator at the Department of Education to tell me \nhow a local school district could benefit from the President's proposal \nthat is in this provision of the bill. They could not explain it to me. \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my \nletter to the Army General Counsel.\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1999.\n     Mr. Earl Stockdale,\n     Office of General Counsel, Department of the Army, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Stockdale: Your assistance is requested in \n     clarifying the intent of the President's recent request to \n     amend the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 \n     (P.L. 101-510, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) as it relates to a filing \n     made by the Ogden-Weber School District [``District''] for a \n     warehouse facility on the former Defense Depot Ogden \n     [``DDO''], a Utah military installation closed under a prior \n     BRAC action.\n       In amending sec. 2905(b)(4), the President would \n     ``authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer property to \n     the local redevelopment authority, without consideration, \n     provided that LRAs reuse plan provides for the property to be \n     used for job creation and the LRA uses the economic benefits \n     from the property to reinvest in the economic redevelopment \n     of the installation and the surrounding community.'' The \n     change does not appear to remove the LRA's decisional \n     authority from compliance with other statutes or regulations \n     by which DOD overseas and approves the actions of the LRA.\n       My interest in this matter extends to the Ogden-Weber \n     School District which was granted eligibility by the Ogden \n     LRA to acquire a DDO warehouse. The District applied for a \n     public benefit allowance [``PBA''] to the Department of \n     Education [``ED''] under the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 484(k)(1)(A)); in \n     applying 34 CFR 12.15, ED allotted a 70 percent PBA, \n     asserting that the balance of the intended use did not serve \n     an educational purpose. I believe that ED misapplied the rule \n     in failing to realize that the balance of the facility, in \n     fact, intended an education-related use by storing materials \n     directly related to education.\n       The principal use of the facility was clearly educational \n     in nature but involved a complex vocational program to train \n     automated material handling equipment operators. This \n     function required shelving, bins, conveyors, and warehouse \n     vehicles that consumed great amounts of space.\n       My question, therefore, is twofold. First, can the District \n     make a ``split'' request for an educational PBA, with a \n     second PBA sought under the economic development category for \n     the balance of the space that did not qualify for the \n     education PBA? Second, whether the split filing procedure is \n     allowable or not, will the application for the PBA under the \n     economic development category, for whole or for part of the \n     facility, remain subject to the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act, in that the appropriate Federal \n     agency with jurisdiction rather than the Secretary of Defense \n     will determine the PBA? Or does the LRA make that \n     determination with final approval authority resting with the \n     Secretary of the Army?\n       Your reply is requested at the earliest possible time so \n     that I may advise the District accordingly.\n       I send my high regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. What I'm saying, and I know the Senator from Virginia \nagrees, is that public education is no less important than economic \ndevelopment. And, when it comes to pushing the desperately underfunded \nschool district to a position where it must purchase its facility, \nwhile some undefined economic development function gets a free \nconveyance, I can only conclude that the President has his priorities \nbadly reversed, despite his rhetoric on the importance of education.\n  At a time when we all seem to agree that we should do everything we \ncan to help our state and local education agencies, we ought to be \neliminating the requirement that local school districts jump through \nhoops just to be able to use surplus property--surplus because the \ncommunity has already been hit by an economically devastating base \nclosing.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the third reading of this \nhistoric bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will conduct a third reading.\n  The bill (S. 1059) was read the third time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nhistoric piece of legislation. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on July 1, 1999, Donald E. Meiners will \nretire from Entergy Mississippi after 39 years of service. Don started \nas a salesman in Jackson and culminated as the president and chief \nexecutive officer.\n  Mr. Meiners rose rapidly in the company and quickly became one of its \nofficers. He has worked in marketing, operations and customer services, \nand within various subsidiaries of the company requiring frequent \nmoves. Entergy recognized his leadership capabilities early, and he \nexcelled at each challenge.\n  He has also been very involved in the civic aspects of his community. \nHe has taken on different roles from steering various United Way \nCampaigns to chairing the Chambers of Commerce for Jackson and \nVicksburg, to leading MetroJackson's Housing Partnership and the \nNewcomen Society of Mississippi. Don has also supported the Executive \nWomen's International Night, Mississippi Museum of Art, International \nBallet Competition, Jackson Symphony Orchestra, and the Boys and Girls \nClub of America. His efforts have ensured that all Mississippians can \nbe exposed to the full richness of the Magnolia State's culture.\n  Mr. Meiners has made a personal commitment to education by serving on \nthe boards of the Mississippi State University Foundation, Tougaloo \nCollege, Jackson State, and the Mississippi University for Women. \nThrough these post-secondary institutions, he wanted to foster an \natmosphere that inspired all Mississippians to reach up and participate \nin our national prosperity by having essential educational skills. He \nhas also served or is currently serving on the boards of the Trustmark \nNational Bank, Institute for Technology Development and Mississippi \nManufacturers Association. Here, his focus has been to promote the \nright type of job producing capacity in my home state.\n  As a result of his contributions to Mississippi, Mr. Meiners has been \nrecognized as the Governor's Volunteer of the Year, Mississippi's \nEconomic Development Outstanding Volunteer of the Year, Goodwill's \nOutstanding Volunteer, and he received the Hope Award from \nMississippi's Multiple Sclerosis Chapter. It is clear that he has given \nhis time and energy to all facets of Mississippi.\n  Mr. Meiners is a family man caring for four generations of his \nrelatives. He is devoted to Patricia Stone, his high school sweetheart \nand wife for 42 years. He also cares for his 90-year-old father. His \nsons, Christopher and Charles, have truly made him proud, and his two \ngranddaughters, Hannah and Mallory light up his life. He is also an \nactive member of Christ United Methodist Church.\n  I must not forget to mention that Don is a Mississippi State \nUniversity Bulldog with a degree in electrical engineering. This Rebel \nfound a way to look past this personal educational flaw. No, seriously, \nI am proud to call Don, a Hazlehurst native, my friend. I respect his \nprofessionalism and dedication to Mississippi. He is a true southern \ngentleman, and he will be missed. I wish Don and Pat the best as they \npursue a well-earned retirement.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6275-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n         HONORING SOUTH DAKOTA'S SMALL BUSINESSMAN OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the values and spirit that helped early \nsettlers thrive and prosper in the harsh conditions of life on the \nprairie are alive and well today in South Dakota.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet someone who embodies many of \nthe values and ideals that the great state of South Dakota was built \nupon. Phillip Clark, owner and President of Hansen Manufacturing \nCorporation of Sioux Falls, is one of 53 persons honored this week by \nthe Small Business Administration as part of its celebration of \nNational Small Business Week. For over two decades, Phil has guided his \ncompany through a variety of complex challenges and built a thriving \nbusiness. In the process, he has made an important contribution to our \nstate, and to the city of Sioux Falls.\n  As a manufacturer of conveyer belt assemblies, Phil invented an \nenclosed belt conveyor system. Anyone who has worked in or around a \ngrain elevator knows the importance of minimizing dust; it is one of \nthe most important safety steps that can be taken to prevent fires and \nexplosions. This enclosed belt system has helped a number of grain \nfacilities improve the safety of their operations, and dramatically \nchanged the way that grain and other bulk materials are moved.\n  Phil was able to develop this system because he listened to what his \ncustomers wanted, and he acted to fill that need. it is a basic lesson \nthat every successful business owner must know: listen to your \ncustomer.\n  While Phil has maintained a clear focus on his company's future, he \nhas also taken the steps necessary to position his company to deal with \ncurrent business conditions. As a manufacturer of conveyor belt \nsystems, Hansen Manufacturing derives much of its business from grain \nelevators, feed manufacturers, and other companies that process \nagricultural goods and other bulk materials. Because of the continued \ncrisis in our agricultural markets, many of these companies have faced \nextremely difficult business conditions over the past few years, \nresulting in equally difficult times for their suppliers. Furthermore, \ndomestic weakness has been compounded by weakness in foreign markets, \nwhich have become increasingly important for Hansen Manufacturing.\n  While short-term business conditions have been challenging, Phil has \nbeen able to successfully grow his business while making critical \ninvestments in new product lines. His successful stewardship of Hansen \nManufacturing serves as an example to all small business people in \nSouth Dakota. I commend the Small Business Administration for \nrecognizing his outstanding work.\n  In South Dakota, almost all businesses are small businesses, and \nthat's true nationwide.

Mr. President, a young Alaskan, a freshman in Colony \nHigh School in the Matanuska Valley town of Wasilla, wrote an opinion \npiece in the Anchorage Daily news this week which shows thoughtfulness \nand wisdom well beyond his 15 years.\n  Travis Johnson sat down at his computer the day after the tragedy at \nColumbine High School, and wrote from the heart his feelings and his \nideas on how to prevent further tragedies like Columbine.\n  He showed the essay to his parents who were moved and impressed with \ntheir youngster's effort. His mother, a physician, and his dad, an \ninsurance executive, grew up in Anchorage. While they are not hunters \nthemselves, they have friends and family who are gun owners and who \nhunt.\n  After Travis shared his essay with his English teacher, his dad \nsuggested that he send it to the Anchorage Daily News.\n  Travis refutes the ideas that guns and violence on television and in \nfilms are responsible for incidents like Columbine.\n  Travis believes that parents must be more and more involved with \ntheir children. He asks the parents who read his opinion piece to \n``talk to your kids, even though you may not want to, and your kids may \nact like they don't want to talk to you.'' And he tells teens to talk \nto their parents.\n  Mr. President, Travis Johnson's observations and ideas are important \ninsights into how to avoid further incidents like those in Colorado and \nGeorgia, from a teen who understands how teens feel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his column from the May 25 Anchorage \nDaily News, titled ``Parents Are the Only Answer to Teens' Problems'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:]\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, May 25, 1999]\n\n             Parents Are the Only Answer to Teens' Problems\n\n                          (By Travis Johnson)\n\n       I'm sure all of those who are reading this paper have heard \n     of the recent Columbine High School shooting incident in \n     which two students walked into the school and started a \n     massacre that left 15 people dead. My heart goes out to those \n     families and their loss. Upon hearing about this incident, I \n     found myself very disturbed. How could two seemingly \n     ``normal'' high school students (I use the term lightly \n     because there is really no such thing as a normal high school \n     student) be capable of doing something like this? I listened \n     to television reports about what might be responsible for \n     this incident. The two that seemed to be most stressed were \n     harassment from peers and guns. It seemed as though the \n     combination of those two automatically justified a killing \n     spree.\n       First, let's think about the issue of harassment from \n     peers. Every day I go to school, and I am judged. So is \n     everybody else around me. I know that I've withstood my fair \n     share of insults, and they still keep coming. And I know many \n     people around me have it worse than I do, especially my \n     school's own group of trench coat wearers, commonly referred \n     to as ``Goths.'' I'm willing to admit there are firearms in \n     my household; I'm even proud of it. I'm not especially \n     popular, and I could easily find out how to make bombs on the \n     Internet. I'm sure many of the ``Goths'' at my school have \n     access to the same materials. Given this information, I think \n     that it's time I or someone else at my school went on a \n     homicidal rampage, don't you think? I don't think so! Just \n     because people are harassed doesn't justify a killing.\n       In the real world, people are harassed all the time. I \n     think it's just life. There are mean people out there. Live \n     with it. The killers at Columbine High School were lacking \n     something in their personalities to do something like this. \n     That is self-control, self-esteem and an understanding of the \n     value of life. I think this has less to do with harassment \n     and more with the killers themselves. If the killers had \n     better values, this never would have happened.\n       Maybe firearms are to blame? I'm sure many people noticed \n     that immediately after this incident, a series of gun-control \n     laws were proposed, including a proposal to raise the age \n     limit to own a handgun from 18 to 21. Do people really think \n     that if the handgun age limit was higher, this incident would \n     have never happened?\n       I hate to say it, but welcome to politics. In the world \n     today, what people want to see is action. It has to be quick, \n     it has to be cheap and it has to keep them from being \n     responsible. Politicians realize this, so immediately they \n     come up with a ``solution'' that fits these criteria. It \n     doesn't have to work; the people just have to think it \n     does. So what happens? Well, they scream, ``Guns are the \n     problem!'' and we all lose more rights.\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\n       The truth is, if somebody wants to kill someone with a \n     firearm laws banning guns aren't going to stop them. A lot of \n     guns used in robberies and murders are stolen. Well, if we \n     got rid of the runs in the world, then we would have a \n     solution, right! Nope, people would use other homemade \n     weapons, bombs, knives, etc.\n       A gun is a tool, not a weapon. It is a tool for hunting, \n     recreation and protection. It can be a historical piece, it \n     can be a keepsake, it can represent something. Guns are not \n     to blame for the Columbine High School incident.\n       By now you might be asking yourself what is to blame. \n     Unfortunately, it's a problem not many people want to face. \n     It starts at the home. It starts with a lack of discipline, a \n     lack of love, and a lack of values. I'm sure that if the \n     parents of the boys involved in this shooting incident has \n     been more involved with their kids, this incident would have \n     never occurred.\n       The parents are not completely to blame. Today's violent \n     televised society illustrates this violence as a normal \n     everyday thing. This makes it difficult to draw the line \n     between right and wrong. These things, added together, \n     resulted in the final problem: The boys responsible for this \n     shooting. In the end, it is they who are responsible.\n       So, what can be done to prevent another tragedy like this \n     one? To all the parents who are reading this talk to your \n     kid! Even though you may not want to and your kids may act \n     like they don't want to talk to you, just their knowing \n     you're willing to talk often helps. Spend time with them, \n     draw them to activities that keep them busy and feeling \n     wanted such as sports, church, even target shooting! If \n     parents teach their kids how to use and respect a firearm, \n     they'll be less likely to abuse it than if their parents \n     avoid telling them about guns.\n       To all of the kids and teens reading this: talk to your \n     parents. They can be a valuable source of information and can \n     help you when you feel there is no one else to turn.\n       Other things you can do include complimenting people \n     instead of insulting them, always remembering that you are \n     important, having good friends, and reporting to authorities \n     if anyone you know makes dangerous threats against you or \n     anyone else. By doing this we might be able to prevent \n     another incident like the one that occurred at Columbine High \n     School. I hope that everyone reading this will pray for the \n     families affected by the shooting and take my advice to \n     heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6276-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF SERVICE TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with some sadness but also with \nsome pride, that I stand before the Senate today to recognize Austin \nSmythe--a longstanding and highly respected member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee staff. After nearly 15\\1/2\\ years of service to the Senate \nand the Congress, Austin will begin employment in the private sector at \nthe end of this week.\n  Those who know Austin in this Chamber, know he is a Senator's dream \nstaffer. Austin is dedicated, loyal, intelligent, and above all else \npossessing integrity beyond reproach. He came to the Senate Budget \nCommittee in December 1983, as the committee's energy budget expert. \nOver the years, he gradually took on more responsibilities to where \ntoday, as he leaves the Senate, he is my staff director's right-hand \nman on issues related to the budget act, process reform issues, and the \noften arcane world of budget score\nkeeping.\n  He has been instrumental in the passage of many a budget resolution \nand reconciliation bills over these last many years. He has also taken \nthe lead on helping to reform the process by his work on the Federal \nCredit Reform Act of 1990, the Unfunded Mandates Control Act of 1995, \nand the Line Item Veto Act of 1996--that unfortunately was ruled \nunconstitutional. He has been my key budget committee staffer on my \nquest to get Congress to change its appropriation and budget process \ninto a biennial system--that work, I promise you Austin, will continue.\n  Along the way, Austin was able to find the time to get married and \nstart a family. It is his wife, Katie, and his two young girls that \nhave borne the real burden of Austin's dedicated service to the Senate \nand his country.\n  The American public is unaware of the role staff play in helping us \nelected officials ``to do the right thing.'' Sometimes even with good \nstaff, we get it wrong, and of course, when it doesn't come out right \nwe blame our staff. But if the legislation advances public policy in an \naffirmative way, we will take the credit for success. In truth, of \ncourse, it is to staff like Austin Smythe, who work under very \ndifficult circumstances, long hours, and sleepless nights, that we--and \nindeed the country--all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude. For without \nAustin's dedication, and staff like him, the things we have gotten \nright would never have happened.\n  I wish Austin and his family the best. And on behalf of all the \nBudget Committee members, the committee staff, and indeed the entire \nSenate, thank you Austin for a job well done. We all will miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6276-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               KIDNAPPING OF SENATOR CORDOBA IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nover the kidnapping of Colombian Senator Piedad Cordoba de Castro. \nSenator Cordoba was abducted on May 21 by paramilitary forces under the \ncommand of Carlos Castano. I urge the Government of Colombia to take \nall appropriate measures to obtain her safe release and to bring those \nresponsible for this kidnapping to justice.\n  Senator Cordoba, as President of the Colombian Senate's Human Rights \nCommission, is a strong voice in Colombia for the promotion of human \nrights. She has also been a leader in efforts to bring peace to \nColombia after fifty years of political violence. Senator Cordoba's \nrole as a leading advocate of human rights and peace makes this crime \nparticularly shocking.\n  UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has also condemned the kidnapping of \nSenator Cordoba and has urged the Colombian authorities to do \neverything possible to obtain her release. Secretary-General Annan \ncalled Senator Cordoba ``a firm supporter of peace'' who had \n``performed invaluable work towards the achievement of fundamental \nrights and freedom''.\n  It is extremely disturbing to see that paramilitary forces and \nguerrilla groups involved in Colombia's internal conflict continue to \nresort to kidnapping as a means of political pressure. This violent \naction against a prominent human rights advocate emphasizes the \nimportance of the efforts of President Pastrana to eliminate all links \nbetween the Colombian Government and the paramilitaries.\n  I urge the Government of Colombia to take all necessary and \nappropriate measures to break these links, obtain Senator Cordoba's \nrelease, and bring to justice those responsible for her kidnapping.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6276-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWERS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my \nstrong support for S. 303, the Satellite Home Viewers Act. This \nlegislation will enable many more consumers in Massachusetts and across \nthe nation to receive network signals by satellite.\n  The Act achieves a fairer balance between the interests of satellite \nTV firms, local broadcasters and cable firms. It reverses a federal \ncourt decision that has caused millions of satellite TV subscribers \nthroughout the country, including in many rural areas of Massachusetts, \nto lose their access to network television stations. Consumers will be \nmajor winners with the passage of this legislation. It means greater \nchoice, particularly to those in rural areas.\n  This legislation will also promote competition between the satellite \nand cable industries by enabling satellite providers to offer local \nbroadcast signals in the same local market. In recent years, ``must \ncarry'' rules have protected small broadcasters from being left by the \nwayside during the rapid growth of the cable industry. Similarly, this \nbill protects small broadcasters by requiring satellite carriers re-\ntransmitting local signals to the local market to comply with the \n``must carry'' rules by January 1, 2002.\n  Consumers everywhere will benefit from the passage of the Satellite \nHome Viewers Act. I commend Senator McCain and Senator Burns for their \nleadership in providing more choices and better service to consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6276-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6276-S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COSPONSORSHIP OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE RENTAL FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss concealed weapons \nlaws. Currently, in Michigan, if a person wants to obtain a permit for \na concealed weapon, he or she must apply at the local county gun board. \nEach one of these gun boards is made up of three members: the local \nsheriff, county prosecutor and a designee of the state police. The gun \nboards base their decisions on a person's demonstrated need for a gun, \nand that person's criminal record, if any, and on local conditions.\n  Local decisionmaking makes sense. Local law enforcement officials \nknow the local environment, local citizens, and can best assess the \nlocal impact of increasing the numbers of weapons carried in public. \nLast night, the Michigan State Senate passed a bill that, if signed \ninto law, would take discretion away from local gun boards and put more \nweapons on our streets and in public places. In my view, eliminating \nthe authority of local gun boards would be detrimental to public safety \nin Michigan and take us in the opposite direction than we are heading \nin Congress. More important than my opinions are the views of the law \nenforcement community in Michigan. Every major law enforcement agency \nin the state of Michigan including the State Police, Michigan \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, Michigan Prosecuting Attorneys \nAssociation, Michigan Municipal League as well as many other \norganizations such as the Michigan Municipal League have made \nstatements opposing this bill.\n  One of the bills that is now before a conference committee of the \nMichigan Legislature is referred to as a ``shall issue'' bill. The NRA \nhas been lobbying Michigan legislators to support a ``shall issue'' \npolicy. The legislation is called ``shall issue'' because it mandates \nthat if a person passes an FBI Federal background check, the gun board \n``shall issue'' him a permit to carry a concealed weapon, without \nrequiring a show of need or the condition of other local circumstances.\n  This legislation goes in the wrong direction. It would increase the \ndanger of gun violence in our communities. I have seen no evidence, \nthat people who have a legitimate need to carry a gun for protection \nare being denied the ability to do so. The numbers demonstrate that the \noverwhelming majority of requests for concealed weapons permits are \napproved. It's important for public safety that local gun boards \ncontinue to make such judgments.\n  Here in Congress, we are working hard to reduce the easy availability \nof lethal weapons to people who should not have them. I do not want to \nsee my State go in the other direction by passing a law that encourages \nthe spread of concealed weapons in public places.\n  Michigan has not been the only state targeted for these NRA-backed \nconcealed weapons bills. Yet, despite the best efforts of the NRA, the \n``shall issue'' policy has been rejected by a bipartisan group of \nlegislators in more than 10 States. That's because of the power of \npeople in those States who united to demand action. Voters in the State \nof Missouri recently defeated a ``shall issue'' proposal much like the \none in the Michigan Legislature. Missourians voted to keep in place \nprudent regulations for carrying concealed weapons--regulations that \nwere first enacted in reaction to the days of Jesse James and the \noutlaw gangs.\n  I believe the majority of Michigan's citizens feel the same way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6277-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEMORIAL DAY COMMEMORATION REMARKS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in anticipation of Memorial Day this \ncoming Monday, I wish to honor the memories of the 1.1 million \nAmericans who gave their lives in defense of America and American \nideals. Americans have fought and died in various wars spanning over \ntwo centuries. Her fallen soldiers have left indelible marks on the \nannals of history in conflicts notable for the good attained over the \nevil vanquished: independence over monarchial tyranny; freedom over \nslavery; and democracy over fascism and communism. Indeed, in this \ncentury alone, American servicemembers can be hailed for turning the \ntide of history's two world wars. As we head towards the dawn of a new \nmillennium, I ask my colleagues to join with me to give homage to \nAmerica's patriots, in deed as well as word.\n  I believe the best way to commemorate the spirit of those who gave \ntheir lives is to honor, respect, and care for the 26 million American \nveterans living today. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have striven to accomplish this goal through a number of \nlegislative measures and processes. After a successful battle over the \nbudget resolution, I and 52 of my Senate colleagues signed on to a \nletter urging the Appropriation's Committee to match the budget \nresolution's recommendation of an additional $1.66 billion for \nveterans' health care. This funding is vital to ensure that our \nnation's veterans get the highest quality of health care available. I \nhave also pushed for enactment of legislation which would increase \nveterans' education benefits; allow for a Medicare Subvention \ndemonstration project; require additional national cemeteries to be \nbuilt in areas with high veteran populations; and ensure that \nconstruction of the World War II Memorial begins next year.\n  The Athenian leader Pericles had these words to say about those who \nlost their lives in the Peloponnesian War over 24 centuries ago: ``Not \nonly are they commemorated by columns and inscriptions, but there \ndwells also an unwritten memorial of them, graven not on stone but in \nthe hearts of men.'' This Memorial Day, I challenge my colleagues to \nmake a commitment to engrave the memory of 1.1 million Americans not \nonly in our hearts, but in the legislation we enact for veterans and \nservicemembers during the remainder of the 106th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6277-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6277-S6278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ELECTION OF EHUD BARAK AS PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Ehud Barak, on his \nvictory in the recent Prime Ministerial election in Israel. Mr. Barak \nis a man of courage and a proven leader. He is eminently capable of \nleading our closest ally in the Middle East at this important juncture \nin its history. His resounding victory reaffirmed the Israeli people's \nstrong desire for peace.\n  Not only was the election a victory for Mr. Barak, it was also a \nvictory for Israeli democracy. Nearly four out of five Israeli citizens \nover the age of 18 cast ballots on May 17, 1999. That figure is even \nmore astounding when you consider that Israelis--even those living \noversees--are not permitted to cast absentee ballots. More than ten \nthousand Israelis purchased airline tickets and traveled great \ndistances in order to exercise their right to vote. This dedication to \nthe most basic pillar of democracy is enviable, for if people fail to \nexercise their right to vote they quickly lose their voice.\n  This election also marked an important milestone. For the first time \nin Israel's history, an Arab campaigned for Prime Minister. Although \nAzmi Bishara withdrew from the race shortly before the election in \norder to boost the chances of Mr. Barak, he should be commended for his \ncourage in running. While members of Israel's Arab minority have long \nbeen represented in the Knesset--Israel's parliament--Mr. Bishara's \ncampaign demonstrated that Arabs are welcome in all segments of \nIsrael's political life.\n  Mr. Barak is both a true son of Israel and a worthy leader of the \nonly democracy in the Middle East. Born on a Kibbutz six years before \nIsrael's independence, he has served his country well as its most \ndecorated soldier, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, Member \nof the Knesset, Minister of the Interior and Foreign Minister.\n  After the polls closed on May 17th, when it was clear that he had \nbeen elected, Mr. Barak traveled to Rabin Square in the center of Tel \nAviv. Standing just feet from the spot where an assassin's bullet \nstruck Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin three and a half\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\nyears ago, the Prime Minister-elect renewed his commitment to the Peace \nProcess Prime Minister Rabin courageously began. It was a fitting \ntribute to Israel's fallen leader.\n  Making peace is not an easy endeavor. Indeed, it is often more \ndifficult to make peace than to wage war. As Prime Minister Rabin often \nsaid, one does not make peace with one's friends, one makes peace with \none's enemies. Barak, like Rabin, has proven himself a great general on \nthe battlefield. Now he must prove himself worthy of the even more \nexalted title of peacemaker. I am confident that Ehud Barak will indeed \nearn that title, making Israel's second fifty-years devoid of the wars \nwhich characterized its first fifty years.\n  Mr. President, the United States is one of Israel's closest allies. \nUnder the stewardship of Mr. Barak, I am confident that relationship \nwill only grow stronger. I look forward to a close collaboration \nbetween our two nations on issues ranging from security to trade. Most \nimportantly, however, is the struggle to bring peace to a region which \nhas seen far too many wars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6278-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEMORIAL DAY OBSERVANCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I received a very touching letter from a \nVietnam Veteran from my state, who was recently awarded the Silver Star \nfor his bravery during the Vietnam Conflict.\n  Helping Al Myers get that Silver Star and the recognition he deserved \nfor so long was a very rewarding experience. Al sent me this letter. It \nis a fictional remembrance of a soldier who's name is on the Vietnam \nMemorial.\n  The letter defines the importance of paying tribute to our nation's \nhonored soldiers who have fought for, won, and kept our freedom, \nwhether that tribute comes in the form of our nation building a great \n``Black Granite Wall,'' or simply a family member putting flowers on a \nbeloved white tombstone at a veteran's cemetery. It exemplifies the \nstrength, dedication, and sacrifice our nation's military men and \nwomen, and their families, make. We are forever indebted to them, and \nit fills me with great pride and humility to honor those who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice to preserve our way of life as Americans.\n  I thought it was very important to read it in honor of the Memorial \nDay Observance on Monday. It touched my heart and I wanted to share it \nhere on the Floor today. It is called ``The Wall from the Other Side.''\n\n                      The Wall From the Other Side\n\n                             (Pat Camunes)\n\n       At first there was no place for us to go until someone put \n     up that ``Black Granite Wall.'' Now, every day and night, my \n     Brothers and Sisters wait to see the many people from places \n     afar file in front of this ``Wall.'' Many people stopping \n     briefly and many for hours and some that come on a regular \n     basis. It was hard at first, not that it's gotten any easier, \n     but it seems that many of the attitudes towards that Vietnam \n     War we were involved in have changed. I can only pray that \n     the ones on the other side have learned something, and more \n     ``Walls'' as this one, needn't be built.\n       Several members of my unit, and many that I did not \n     recognize, have called me to The Wall by touching my name \n     engraved upon it. The tears aren't necessary, but are hard \n     even for me to hold back. Don't feel guilty for not being \n     with me, my Brothers. This was my destiny as it is yours to \n     be on that side of The Wall. Touch The Wall, my Brothers, so \n     that I can share in the memories that we had. I have learned \n     to put the bad memories aside and remember only the pleasant \n     times that we had together. Tell our other Brothers out there \n     to come and visit me, not to say Good-bye but to say Hello \n     and be together again . . . even for a short time . . . and \n     to ease that pain of loss that we all still share.\n       Today, an irresistible and loving call summons me to The \n     Wall. As I approach, I can see an elderly lady . . . and as I \n     get closer, I recognize her--It's Momma! As much as I have \n     looked forward to this day, I have also dreaded it, because I \n     didn't know what reaction I would have.\n       Next to her, I suddenly see my wife and immediately think \n     how hard it must have been for her to come to this place, and \n     my mind floods with the pleasant memories of 30 years past. \n     There's a young man in a military uniform standing with his \n     arm around her--My God!--he has to be my son! Look at him \n     trying to be the man without a tear in his eye. I yearn to \n     tell him how proud I am, seeing him stand tall, straight and \n     proud in his uniform.\n       Momma comes closer and touches The Wall, and I feel the \n     soft and gentle touch I had not felt in so many years. Dad \n     has crossed to this side of The Wall, and through our touch, \n     I try to convince her that Dad is doing fine and is no longer \n     suffering or feeling pain. I see my wife's courage building \n     as she sees Momma touch The Wall and she approaches and lays \n     her hand on my waiting hand. All the emotions, feelings and \n     memories of three decades past flash between our touch and I \n     tell her that . . . it's all right . . . carry on with your \n     life and don't worry about me . . . I can see as I look into \n     her eyes that she hears and a big burden has been lifted from \n     her on wings of understanding.\n       I watch as they lay flowers and other memories of my past. \n     My lucky charm that was taken from me and sent to her by my \n     CO . . . a tattered and worn teddy bear that I can barely \n     remember having as I grew up as a child . . . and several \n     medals that I had earned and were presented to my wife. One \n     is the Combat Infantry badge that I am very proud of, and I \n     notice that my son is also wearing this medal. I had earned \n     mine in the jungles of Vietnam and he had probably earned his \n     in the deserts of Iraq.\n       I can tell that they are preparing to leave, and I try to \n     take a mental picture of them together, because I don't know \n     when I will see them again. I wouldn't blame them if they \n     were not to return, and can only thank them that I was not \n     forgotten. My wife and Momma near The Wall for one final \n     touch, and so many years of indecision, fear and sorrow are \n     let go. As they turn to leave, I feel my tears that had not \n     flowed for so many years, form as if dew drops on the other \n     side of The Wall.\n       They slowly move away with only a glance over their \n     shoulders. My son suddenly stops and slowly returns. He \n     stands straight and proud in front of me and snaps a salute. \n     Something draws him near The Wall and he puts his hand upon \n     the etched stone and touches my tears that had formed as dew \n     drops on the face of The Wall . . . and I can tell that he \n     senses my presence and the pride and love that I have for \n     him. He falls to his knees and the tears flow from his eyes \n     and I try my best to reassure him that it's all right, and \n     the tears do not make him any less of a man. As he moves back \n     wiping the tears from his eyes, he silently mouths, ``God \n     Bless you, Dad . . .''\n       God Bless You, Son . . . we Will meet someday, but in the \n     meanwhile go on your way . . . there is no hurry at all.\n       As I see them walk off in the distance, I yell loud to Them \n     and Everyone there today, as loud as I can: Thank You For \n     Remembering. . . . Thank You All For Remembering . . . and as \n     others on this side of The Wall join in, I notice the U.S. \n     Flag, Old Glory, that so proudly flies in front of us \n     everyday, is flapping and standing proudly straight out in \n     the wind from our gathering numbers this day . . . and I \n     shout again, and . . . again . . . and again . . .\n       Thanks for Remembering!\n       Thanks for Remembering!\n       Thanks for Remembering!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6278-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6278-S6280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE CONTRIBUTION OF IMMIGRANTS TO AMERICA'S ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, with Memorial Day soon upon us, I wanted \nto share with my colleagues some of the testimony from yesterday's \nSenate Immigration Subcommittee hearing on ``The Contribution of \nImmigrants to America's Armed Forces.'' It featured some dramatic \ntestimony from both immigrants and native-born individuals.\n  Let me begin by quoting the testimony of Elmer Compton, a native of \nIndiana who served in Vietnam.\n\n       When I look at my wife, son and daughter, I cannot keep \n     from thinking of one particular immigrant by the name of Al \n     Rascon and the contribution he made to me and my family on \n     March 16, 1966. The heroic and gallant actions of Al Rascon \n     on that day, I believe saved my life, as well as other \n     members of my team.\n       On March 16, 1966, Al Rascon was with the Recon Platoon on \n     a search and destroy mission known as Operation Silver City. \n     My team had engaged a well-armed enemy force. The enemy force \n     had fire superiority that immediately pinned down the entire \n     point squad with heavy machine gun fire and numerous hand \n     grenades. Through the intense fire of automatic weapons and \n     grenades, Rascon made his way to point where my squad was \n     pinned down and could not move in any direction. Wounded \n     himself, Rascon continued to work his way to my position, \n     attending to wounded as he did.\n       After reaching my position I could see that he was in great \n     pain. He began to patch me up. As I was placing M16 fire in \n     the direction of the enemy, two or three hand grenades were \n     thrown in the direction of Rascon and myself, landing no more \n     than a few feet away. Without hesitation, Rascon jumped on \n     me, taking me to the ground and covering me with his body. He \n     received numerous wounds to his body and face.\n       I truly believe his actions that day saved my life. What \n     more can a person do for God, Country and his fellow man.\n       In closing, I think of the Military Code of Conduct. The \n     First Code, I am an American fighting man, I serve in the \n     forces which guard our Country and our way of life. And\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\n     I am prepared to give my life in its defense.' The immigrants \n     I had the privilege to know and serve with upheld this Code. \n     Again, thank you for this opportunity.\n\n  Erick A. Mogollon, a Guatemalan-born immigrant and Gulf War veteran, \nis a Senior Chief Petty Officer with the U.S. Navy. At the hearing he \nsummed up the views of many immigrant soldiers and sailors when he \ntestified,\n\n       After having had the opportunity to meet so many shipmates \n     over the course of my career, I can honestly say that the \n     contribution of immigrant American's can never be fully \n     measured. These Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines, have \n     left their motherland, been welcomed by the United States and \n     have given of themselves to the defense of this nation. For \n     many immigrants, they have given and will continue to give \n     because of their deep appreciation and dedication to the\n     Untied States. They know, first hand, how it is to live \n     without the protection and security they now count on, and \n     will give their lives to protect it.\n\n  The statement of Paul Bucha, president of the Congressional Medal of \nHonor Society, also included some strong declarations that I believe \nare worth sharing. Mr. Bucha testified,\n\n       Tens of thousands of immigrants and hundreds of thousands \n     of the descendants of immigrants have died in combat fighting \n     for America. I put to you that there is a standard, a basic \n     standard, by which to judge whether America is correct to \n     maintain a generous legal immigration policy: Have immigrants \n     and their children and grandchildren been willing to fight \n     and die for the United States of America? The answer--right \n     up to the present day--remains a resounding ``yes.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the testimony delivered \nby Mr. Bucha and Senior Chief Mogollon be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Aviation Boatswain's Mate (Handling) Senior Chief (AW), \n  Erick A. Mogollon, United States Navy, Subcommittee on Immigration, \nCommittee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, on ``The Contribution \n         of Immigrants to America's Armed Forces'' May 26, 1999\n\n       Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Committee, I \n     am honored to appear before you today to talk about immigrant \n     American's contribution to the Armed Forces and our national \n     defense. I'd like to share with you a few thoughts on how I \n     became an American and why I joined the United States Navy.\n       I was born in Guatemala City, Guatemala on 24 January 1960 \n     and immigrated to the United States with my family in 1970. \n     My mother, three brothers and one sister lived outside of \n     Boston in Milford, Massachusetts. In 1973, I moved to East \n     Douglas and attended Douglas High School. I am proud to say I \n     graduated in 1979 with high honors. While in high school, I \n     entered the Delayed Entry Program and shipped out to boot \n     camp in September 1979. I joined because of the opportunity \n     to excel and to give of myself in gratitude for what this \n     great country of ours has done for me and my family. I'd like \n     to acknowledge the support of my wife, Marilyn and my \n     children, Solines (15), Erick (12), Elias (9) and Marilyn (6) \n     throughout my career. Sailors go to sea, but the family must \n     always remain behind.\n       Being able to qualify for service was itself an \n     accomplishment that encouraged me to do my best. I graduated \n     at the top of my class from ``A'' school and was assigned to \n     the world's best aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy \n     (CV-67). After serving on Kennedy, I was assigned to VR-22 \n     and VQ-2 in Rota, Spain. I have enjoyed the opportunity of \n     overseas service and earned my qualification as an Aviation \n     Warfare Specialist. While in Spain, I was fortunate and \n     honored to receive the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces \n     Europe, Leadership Award for Petty Officers. Being chosen \n     from thousands of highly qualified shipmates was truly \n     rewarding. The most important highlight of this tour was my \n     citizenship. On June 17, 1985, I became a United States \n     Citizen at Fanuiel Hall in Boston, Massachusetts.\n       After leaving Spain, I asked for reassignment to the U.S.S. \n     John F. Kennedy (CV-67). I am proud of the ship and our \n     combat service during Operations Desert Shield and Desert \n     Storm. As a newly promoted Chief Petty Officer, I served as a \n     flight deck chief during the war and was directly responsible \n     for the launching and recovery of our combat aircraft. During \n     the war, U.S.S. John F. Kennedy aircraft participated in over \n     120 combat strike missions and flew nearly 4000 strike \n     sorties. I am proud to say we did not lose any pilots or \n     aircrew during the war. The pride, professionalism and \n     dedication of our sailor's was evident in daily operations.\n       After the war, I was assigned to U.S.S. America (CV-66) as \n     the Leading Chief Petty Officer for V-3 division and was able \n     to experience the contributions of many immigrant Americans \n     who are dedicated to the defense of our nation. I now teach \n     leadership to the senior enlisted force and am assigned to \n     the Submarine School in Groton, CT. This highlight gives me \n     the opportunity to instill pride and commitment to others.\n       After having had the opportunity to meet so many shipmates \n     over the course of my career, I can honestly say that the \n     contribution of immigrant American's can never be fully \n     measured. These Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines, have \n     left their motherland, been welcomed by the United States and \n     have given of themselves to the defense of this nation. For \n     many immigrants, they have given and will continue to give \n     because of their deep appreciation and dedication to the \n     Untied States. They know, first hand, how it is to live \n     without the protection and security they now count on, and \n     will give their lives to protect it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Testimony of Paul Bucha, President, Congressional Medal of Honor \n   Society, Before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Committee on the \n   Judiciary, United States Senate, Concerning ``The Contribution of \n Immigrants to America's Armed Forces'' May 26, 1999, 10 a.m., Dirksen \n                                  226\n\n       My name is Paul Bucha, President of the Congressional Medal \n     of Honor Society, and I have asked Charles MacGillivary, a \n     past president of the society, to present my testimony. I \n     want to thank you Senator Abraham for holding this hearing \n     and, more importantly, for displaying leadership on the \n     immigration issue and reminding us of America's great \n     tradition as a nation of immigrants.\n       Let me state my position clearly: All of us owe our freedom \n     and our prosperity to the sacrifices of immigrants who gave \n     of themselves so that we might have more. We are fortunate \n     and we are forever indebted to those who have gone before.\n       The Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action \n     against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon an \n     individual serving in the U.S. Armed Services. Generally \n     presented to its recipient by the President in the name of \n     Congress, it is often called the Congressional Medal of \n     Honor. In 1946, the Medal of Honor Society was formed to \n     perpetuate and uphold the integrity of the Medal of Honor and \n     to help its recipients. In 1957, Congress passed legislation, \n     later signed by President Eisenhower, that incorporated the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n       A review of the records shows that 715 of the 3,410 \n     Congressional Medal of Honor recipients in America's \n     history--more than 20 percent--have been immigrants. I would \n     like to share the stories of some of these individuals so the \n     committee can better understand the sacrifices made by these \n     and other immigrants.\n       Lewis Albanese, an immigrant from Italy served during the \n     Vietnam War as a private first class in the U.S. Army. On \n     December 1, 1966, Albanese's platoon advanced through dense \n     terrain. At close range, enemy soldiers fired automatic \n     weapons. Albanese was assigned the task of providing security \n     for the platoon's left flank so it could move forward.\n       Suddenly, an enemy in a concealed ditch opened fire on the \n     left flank. Realizing his fellow soldiers were in danger, \n     Albanese fixed his bayonet, plunged into the ditch \n     and silenced the sniper fire. This allowed the platoon to \n     advance in safety toward the main enemy position.\n       The ditch that Lewis Albanese had entered was filled with a \n     complex of defenses designed to inflict heavy damage on any \n     who attacked the main position. The other members of the \n     platoon heard heavy firing from the ditch and some of them \n     saw what happened next: Albanese moved 100 meters along the \n     trench and killed six snipers, each of whom were armed with \n     automatic weapons. But soon, Albanese, out of ammunition, was \n     forced to engage in hand-to-hand combat with North Vietnamese \n     soldiers. He killed two of them. But he was mortally wounded \n     in the attack.\n       ``His unparalleled action saved the lives of many members \n     of his platoon who otherwise would have fallen to the sniper \n     fire,'' reads the official citation. ``Private First Class \n     Albanese's extraordinary heroism and supreme dedication to \n     his comrades were commensurate with the finest traditions of \n     the military service and remain a tribute to himself, his \n     unit, and the U.S. Army.'' Lewis Albanese was 20 years old.\n       Mexican-born immigrant Marcario Garcia was acting squad \n     leader of Company B (22nd Infantry) near Grosshau, Germany \n     during World War II. Garcia was wounded and in pain as he \n     found his company pinned down by the heavy machine gun fire \n     of Nazi troops and by an artillery and mortar barrage. Garcia \n     crawled forward up to one of the enemy's positions. He lobbed \n     hand grenades into the enemy's emplacement, singlehandedly \n     assaulted the position, and destroyed the gun, killing three \n     German soldiers.\n       Shortly after returning to his company, another German \n     machine gun started firing. Garcia returned to the German \n     position and again singlehandedly stormed the enemy, \n     destroying the gun, killing three more German soldiers, and \n     capturing four prisoners.\n       Finally, Lieutenant John Koelsch was a London-born \n     immigrant who flew a helicopter as part of a Navy helicopter \n     rescue unit during the Korean War. On July 3, 1951, he \n     received word that the North Koreans had shot down a U.S. \n     marine aviator and had him trapped deep inside hostile \n     territory. The terrain was mountainous and it was growing \n     dark. John Koelsch volunteered to rescue him.\n       Koelsch's aircraft was unarmed and due to the overcast and \n     low altitude he flew without a fighter escort. He drew enemy \n     fire as he descended beneath the clouds to search for the \n     downed aviator.\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\n       After being hit, Koelsch kept flying until he located the \n     downed pilot, who had suffered serious burns. While the \n     injured pilot was being hoisted up, a burst of enemy fire hit \n     the helicopter, causing it to crash into the side of the \n     mountain. Koelsch helped his crew and the downed pilot out of \n     the wreckage, and led the men out of the area just ahead of \n     the enemy troops. With Koelsch leading them, they spent nine \n     days on the run evading the North Koreans and caring for the \n     burned pilot. Finally, the North Koreans captured Koelsch and \n     his men.\n       ``His great personal valor and heroic spirit of self-\n     sacrifice throughout sustain and enhance the finest \n     traditions of the U.S. Naval Service,'' his citation for the \n     Medal of Honor reads. That self-sacrifice, the citation \n     notes, included the inspiration of other prisoners of war, \n     for during the interrogation he ``refused to aid his captors \n     in any manner'' and died in the hands of the North Koreans.\n       These and other immigrant Medal of Honor recipients tell \n     the story not only of America's wars but of America's people. \n     After all, we must never forget that all of us are either \n     immigrants are the descendants of immigrants.\n       Tens of thousands of immigrants and hundreds of thousands \n     of the descendants of immigrants have died in combat fighting \n     for America. I put to you that there is a standard, a basic \n     standard, by which to judge whether America is correct to \n     maintain a generous legal immigration policy: Have immigrants \n     and their children and grandchildren been willing to fight \n     and die for the United States of America? The answer--right \n     up to the present day--remains a resounding ``yes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6280-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6280-S6281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DETROIT FREE PRESS ARTICLE ON GUN-RELATED PROSECUTIONS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to a \nDetroit Free Press article, published on Tuesday of this week, \nentitled, ``Federal gun cases decrease: Decline in Michigan greater \nthan in U.S.'' This article notes that from 1993 to 1997, there has \nbeen a very significant decline in the number of gun prosecutions \nbrought in Detroit.\n  Mr. President, over the last two weeks, we in this body engaged in \nlengthy debate on the question of how effective or useful different \nproposals to regulate firearms were likely to be in stemming violent \ncrime, most especially juvenile crime. I supported some of the \nproposals and opposed others. This article, however, brings home \nanother important point raised in this debate: no matter what laws this \nCongress passes, their effect on violent crime will almost certainly be \nnegligible if the Administration is not willing to use them to \nprosecute violent criminals. Unfortunately, the Free Press article \nprovides little ground for optimism on this score.\n  According to the Free Press, between 1993 and 1997 the number of \npeople prosecuted in Detroit in cases investigated by the BATF dropped \nby 55%, compared with a 36% drop nationally. The Free Press also \nreports that there has been a nearly 50% decrease in prosecutions \ninvolving the three largest categories of federal gun laws, from 221 to \n112 respectively.\n  When asked about this, U.S. Attorney Saul Green of Detroit reportedly \nstated that the decrease in prosecutions in the Eastern District of \nMichigan follows a downward trend in crimes. In fact, however, while \nthere has been some improvement on that score, Detroit's violent crime \nrate has been falling significantly less than that of most large \nmetropolitan areas, and it remains unacceptably high. Meanwhile, the \nmuch more dramatic decline of violent crime in Richmond, Virginia, \nwhere federal officials have pursued a policy of vigorous prosecution \nof gun offenders, strongly suggests that if the Administration were \nfollowing the same course in Detroit, we would be doing better.\n  As the Detroit Free Press article points out, police records show \nthat there were 559 murders in Detroit in 1993, compared to 453 in \n1998. But that still left Detroit with the highest murder rate per \ncapita for cities with a population of approximately one million or \nmore--and the sixth highest among the U.S.'s 225 largest cities.\n  Moreover, while in 1998 the rate of reported violent crimes decreased \n6% nationally, in Detroit it actually increased by 13%, according to \nFBI figures. Nor is this simply a one-year anomaly.\n  In 1997, the number of murders in Detroit increased by 9% from 1996 \nand Detroit's murder rate ranked 5th worst among the U.S.'s 225 largest \ncities. Meanwhile, our rate of serious crime decreased by only 1%, \ncompared to a 3.2% decrease nationally. Similarly, in 1996, Detroit's \nrate of violent crimes decreased by only 3%, compared to a 7% decrease \nnationally.\n  Nor is Detroit's relatively small numerical improvement explained by \nthe fact that it is a major metropolitan area. To the contrary, it is \nmostly the biggest cities, like New York, that have seen the largest \ndrops in crime rates over the past few years.\n  The fact that Detroit is lagging behind the nation's improving \nviolent crime rates, along with the fact that it is continually among \nnation's 5-7 worst cities with respect to its homicide rate, clearly \nindicates that this is no time for anyone in Detroit, including the \nfederal government, to be relaxing our crime-fighting efforts. \nMeanwhile, recent data from Richmond, Virginia's Project EXILE strongly \nsuggest that aggressive prosecution and severe punishment of gun law \nviolations would be of major help. In 1998, the year following the \nimplementation of Project Exile in Richmond, the homicide rate in \nRichmond decreased by approximately 1/3. The rate of firearm-related \nhomicides in Richmond dropped even more--66%, from 122 in 1997 to 78 in \n1998.\n  This takes me back to where I started. I voted in favor of several of \nthe measures the Senate adopted last week because I believe that they \ncan be useful tools in stopping gun violence. But quite simply, no gun \nlaws, either those currently on the books or any new ones that Congress \nmay enact, can be effective if the Attorney General does not enforce \nthem through aggressive prosecution. The Detroit Free Press's article \nof two days ago confirms that right now, both in Detroit and \nnationally, aggressive prosecution is not what we are seeing. For our \nchildren's sake, it is high time for it to begin.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nDetroit Free Press article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Detroit Free Press, May 25, 1999]\n\n                       Federal Gun Cases Decrease\n\n\n                Decline in Michigan greater than in U.S.\n\n                             (By Tim Doran)\n\n       Federal gun law prosecutions declined sharply in the \n     eastern half of Michigan between 1993 and 1997.\n       The number of people prosecuted in cases investigated by \n     the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms plummeted \n     55 percent. Nationally, prosecutions were down 36 percent, \n     according to data analyzed by the Free Press.\n       For the three largest categories of gun law violations, the \n     number of people prosecuted in eastern Michigan dropped from \n     221 in 1993 to 112 in 1997.\n       The analysis comes at a time when Congress is debating \n     legislation to tighten access to guns, and the state \n     Legislature is considering laws to make it easier to get a \n     concealed weapons permit.\n       If the federal government wants to reduce gun crime, it \n     should enforce existing laws, said Dave LaCourse, public \n     affairs director for the Second Amendment Foundation, which \n     supports gun ownership.\n       ``But the agency that's set up to put the screws to the bad \n     guy is almost being cut in half,'' LaCourse said.\n       Last month, Wayne County and the City of Detroit sued gun \n     manufacturers and dealers, saying they used a strategy of \n     ``willful blindness,'' looking the other way when guns are \n     sold illegally. A sting by county law enforcement alleged \n     that nine of 10 dealers sold guns to people who indicated \n     they were buying on behalf of a minor or felon with them.\n       Both U.S. Attorney Saul Green of Detroit and Special Agent \n     Michael Morrisey, head of the ATF in Michigan, dispute the \n     numbers from the Free Press study. The reports analyzed for \n     the study came from the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys \n     and are made public by the Transactional Records Access \n     Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University.\n       ``The numbers have gone down,'' Green said. But he said he \n     does not accept the data the Free Press analyzed as \n     definitive.\n       Green said that the decline follows a general downward \n     trend in crimes.\n       For example, according to police records, Detroit had 559 \n     homicides in 1993 and 453 in 1998.\n       The increased use of local-federal task forces may play a \n     role in the decreased federal gun cases, he said. ``We have a \n     lot more cooperation than we had in the past and some of the \n     cases developed might go to local prosecution, rather than \n     federal.''\n       Morrisey and ATF officials in Washington said the bureau \n     shifted its investigative strategy, targeting more serious \n     violators.\n       The number of ATF investigators on the street declined both \n     nationally and in Michigan, and some of the remaining agents \n     have taken on added duties.\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\n       The number of licensed gun dealers in the state has \n     dropped, from about 11,000 in the early 1990s to 2,498 as of \n     earlier this month, and violent crime is down.\n       ``We're doing more with less,'' Morrissey said. ``I think \n     we're doing better quality with less, too.''\n       And a program started in the last two months in Detroit \n     could reverse the downward trend. Operation Countdown hopes \n     to use tough federal gun laws to take felons caught with guns \n     off the streets.\n\n\n                           reductions debated\n\n       Green and Morrissey disputed TRAC's numbers, but reports \n     from other sources, including the ATF's national office in \n     Washington, show a drop in prosecutions.\n       In March, U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., released figures \n     showing federal gun prosecutions under one program dropped 46 \n     percent between 1992 and 1998.\n       ``The senator's message is: We've seen a reduction in \n     violent crime rates overall,'' said his spokesman John Cox. \n     ``But not the reduction that we want. The effectiveness of \n     federal prosecution of gun crimes has got to be utilized.''\n       ATF's own national figures show the number of cases the \n     bureau referred for prosecution to state and federal \n     prosecutors dropped by about 48 percent from 1993-1997, said \n     agent Jeff Roehm, chief of the public information division of \n     the ATF in Washington. Numbers for 1998 show a slight \n     increase.\n       Between 1993 and 1997, the median prison term for those \n     convicted after investigation by the ATF stayed fairly \n     constant at around 30 months, which suggests if agents were \n     targeting more serious violators, they did not receive \n     greater prison time.\n       ``We gather the facts and present them to the U.S. Attorney \n     for prosecution. It is up to the court to decide the \n     sentence,'' Morrissey said. ``And often times, the sentences \n     fall under guidelines enacted by Congress.''\n       While the number of people prosecuted declined in eastern \n     Michigan, agents in the district referred more people for \n     prosecution in 1997 than in any other federal district. The \n     eastern district had a high number of referrals in 1993-1996 \n     as well.\n       The Eastern District of Michigan covers the eastern half of \n     the Lower Peninsula.\n       In the Western District of Michigan, which covers the rest \n     of the state, the number of federal prosecutions fluctuated \n     but the annual totals were much less than in the east.\n       If recent undercover investigations in Wayne County are an \n     indication, finding illegal gun sales would not be difficult.\n       Between March 24 and April 14, undercover teams who told \n     gun dealers they were juveniles and convicted felons bought \n     weapons from nine out of 10 dealers.\n       Morrissey, who took over ATF Michigan operations last \n     August, said his bureau can inspect gun dealers only once a \n     year unless the bureau has probable cause to suspect a crime.\n       His figures show the number of cases referred to \n     prosecutors by the ATF in Michigan have fluctuated between \n     1993 and 1997 but remained fairly constant. They do show, \n     however, a downward trend in prosecutions.\n       In the early 1990s, when the numbers were higher, the \n     bureau targeted more felons with guns, Morrissey said.\n       ``Those are as easy as going out and picking blades of \n     grass,'' he said.\n       But the number of guns on the street did not decline, \n     Morrissey said. The ATF began concentrating on licensed and \n     unlicensed dealers who supply guns illegally and violent \n     felons. One dealer can supply guns used in many crimes, he \n     said.\n       The ATF has 33 fewer agents on the streets of Michigan this \n     year than it had in 1992, he said. And some of those agents \n     have more duties related to their specialized training in \n     arson and explosives.\n       Some are assigned to state task forces, so the criminals \n     they help arrest might not show up in the ATF's statistics, \n     he said.\n       The ATF also assigns agents to gang reduction programs in \n     schools, and the bureau investigates cigarette bootlegging, \n     arson fires and explosions, not just gun violations.\n\n\n                          it works in richmond\n\n       While the ATF has shifted its emphasis nationally away from \n     individual felons with guns, one city that strictly enforced \n     federal firearms laws saw a reduced murder rate.\n       In Richmond, federal prosecutors began in March 1997 to \n     prosecute every gun case in the city of 200,000, said Jim \n     Comey, executive assistant U.S. attorney. Officials advertise \n     the tougher enforcement of Project Exile on billboards and \n     television, Comey said.\n       ``We have been selling deterrence the way they usually sell \n     Wrangler jeans,'' he said.\n       It has worked, Comey said. Defendants ask lawyers to stop \n     their cases from going ``Exile.'' When cops pat down suspects \n     on traffic stops, some say they are not stupid enough to \n     carry a gun.\n       It has also helped change the murder rate. The city had 140 \n     homicides in 1997 and 95 in 1998, he said. The number of \n     firearm-related homicides dropped from 122 in 1997 to 78 in \n     1998.\n       Comey doesn't give Project Exile all the credit. Crack is \n     waning in popularity; the state abolished parole three years \n     ago, and drug enforcement has increased. He and others say it \n     should not be seen as the answer for every city, although \n     both gun-rights and gun-control advocates support it.\n       Local and federal officials in Detroit have joined to start \n     a similar program. Operation Countdown, which began about two \n     months ago,is operating in a few precincts. Already eight \n     cases have been referred to federal prosecutors, said Bob \n     Agacinski, deputy chief in charge of career criminals for the \n     Wayne County Prosecutor's Office.\n       He said the program, which involves the ATF and Detroit \n     police, has strong support from both Green and Wayne County \n     Prosecutor John O'Hair.\n       ``I think it's going better than we thought,'' Agacinski \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6281-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6281-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO BURMA--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 33\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a \n6-month periodic report on the national emergency with respect to Burma \nthat was declared in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997.\n                                                  William J.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) is to continue in effect beyond May \n30, 1999, and the emergency declared with respect to the situation in \nKosovo is to continue in effect beyond June 9, 1999.\n  On December 27, 1995, I issued Presidential Determination 96-7, \ndirecting the Secretary of the Treasury, inter\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\nalia, to suspend the application of sanctions imposed on the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and to continue to block \nproperty previously blocked until provision is made to address claims \nor encumbrances, including the claims of the other successor states of \nthe former Yugoslavia. This sanctions relief, in conformity with United \nNations Security Council Resolution 1022 of November 22, 1995 \n(hereinafter the ``Resolution''), was an essential factor motivating \nSerbia and Montenegro's acceptance of the General Framework Agreement \nfor Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina initialed by the parties in Dayton, \nOhio, on November 21, 1995, and signed in Paris, France, on December \n14, 1995 (hereinafter the ``Peace Agreement''). The sanctions imposed \non the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) were \naccordingly suspended prospectively, effective January 16, 1996. \nSanctions imposed on the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities and on the \nterritory that they control within Bosnia and Herzegovina were \nsubsequently suspended prospectively, effective May 10, 1996, also in \nconformity with the Peace Agreement and the Resolution.\n  Sanctions against both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro) and the Bosnian Serbs were subsequently terminated by \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1074 of October 1, 1996. \nThis termination, however, did not end the requirement of the \nResolution that blocked those funds and assets that are subject to \nclaims and encumbrances remain blocked, until unblocked in accordance \nwith applicable law. Until the status of all remaining blocked property \nis resolved, the Peace Agreement implemented, and the terms of the \nResolution met, this situation continues to pose a continuing unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy \ninterests, and the economy of the United States. For these reasons, I \nhave determined that it is necessary to maintain in force these \nemergency authorities beyond May 30, 1999.\n  On June 9, 1998, I issued Executive Order 13088, ``Blocking Property \nof the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro), the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of Montenegro, \nand Prohibiting New Investment in the Republic of Serbia in Response to \nthe Situation in Kosovo.'' Since then, the government of President \nMilosevic has rejected the international community's efforts to find a \npeaceful settlement for the crisis in Kosovo and has launched a massive \ncampaign of ethnic cleansing that has displaced a large percentage of \nthe population and been accompanied by an increasing number of \natrocities. President Milosevic's brutal assault against the people of \nKosovo and his complete disregard for the requirements of the \ninternational community pose a threat to regional peace and stability.\n  President Milosevic's actions continue to pose a continuing unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy \ninterests, and the economy of the United States.

I agree that the role of an employee \nrepresentative is crucial to the success of this Board.

A bill to protect the right of a member of a health \nmaintenance organization to receive continuing care at a facility \nselected by that member, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             seniors' access to continuing care act of 1999\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Seniors' Access to Continuing Care Act of 1999'', a bill to protect \nseniors' access to treatment in the setting of their choice and to \nensure that seniors who reside in continuing care communities, and \nnursing and other facilities have the right to return to that facility \nafter a hospitalization.\n\n  As our population ages, more and more elderly will become residents \nof various long term care facilities. These include independent living, \nassisted living and nursing facilities, as well as continuing care \nretirement communities (CCRCs), which provide the entire continuum of \ncare. In Maryland alone, there are over 12,000 residents in 32 CCRCs \nand 24,000 residents in over 200 licenced nursing facilities.\n  More and more individuals and couples are choosing to enter \ncontinuing care communities because of the community environment they \nprovide. CCRC's provide independent living, assisted living and nursing \ncare, usually on the same campus--the Continuum of Care. Residents find \nsafety, security and peace of mind. They often prepay for the continuum \nof care. Couples can stay together, and if one spouse needs additional \ncare, it can be provided right there, where the other spouse can remain \nclose by.\n  Most individuals entering a nursing facility do so because it is \nmedically necessary, because they need a high level of care that they \ncan no longer receive in their homes or in a more independent setting, \nsuch as assisted living. But residents are still able to form \nrelationships with other residents and staff and consider the facility \ntheir ``home''. I have visited many of these facilities and have heard \nfrom both residents and operators. They have told me about a serious \nand unexpected problem encountered with returning to their facility \nafter a hospitalization.\n  Hospitalization is traumatic for anyone, but particularly for our \nvulnerable seniors. We know that having comfortable surroundings and \nfamiliar faces can aid dramatically in the recovery process. So, we \nshould do everything we can to make sure that recovery process is not \nhindered.\n  Today, more and more seniors are joining managed care plans. This \ntrend is likely to accelerate given the expansion of managed care \nchoices under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. As more and more decisions \nare made based on financial considerations, choice often gets lost. \nCurrently, a resident of a continuing care retirement community or a \nnursing facility who goes to the hospital has no guarantee that he or \nshe will be allowed by the managed care organization (MCO) to return to\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nthe CCRC or nursing facility for post acute follow up care. The MCO can \ndictate that the resident go to a different facility that is in the MCO \nnetwork for that follow up care, even if the home facility is qualified \nand able to provide the needed care.\n  Let me give you a few examples:\n  In the fall of 1996, a resident of Applewood Estates in Freehold, New \nJersey was admitted to the hospital. Upon discharge, her HMO would not \npermit her to return to Applewood and sent her to another facility in \nJackson. The following year, the same thing happened, but after strong \nprotest, the HMO finally relented and permitted her to return to \nApplewood. She should not have had to protest, and many seniors are \nunable to assert themselves.\n  A Florida couple in their mid-80's were separated by a distance of 20 \nmiles after the wife was discharged from a hospital to an HMO-\nparticipating nursing home located on the opposite side of the county. \nThis was a hardship for the husband who had difficulty driving and for \nthe wife who longed to return to her home, a CCRC. The CCRC had room in \nits skilled nursing facility on campus. Despite pleas from all those \ninvolved, the HMO would not allow the wife to recuperate in a familiar \nsetting, close to her husband and friends. She later died at the HMO \nnursing facility, without the benefit of frequent visits by her husband \nand friends.\n  Collington Episcopal Life Care Community, in my home state of \nMaryland, reports ongoing problems with its frail elderly having to \nobtain psychiatric services, including medication monitoring, off \ncampus, even though the services are available at Collington--how \ndisruptive to good patient care!\n  On a brighter note, an Ohio woman's husband was in a nursing \nfacility. When she was hospitalized, and then discharged, she was able \nto be admitted to the same nursing facility because of the Ohio law \nthat protected that right.\n  Seniors coming out of the hospital should not be passed around like a \nbaton. Their care should be decided based on what is clinically \nappropriate, NOT what is financially mandated. Why is that important? \nWhat are the consequences?\n  Residents consider their retirement community or long term care \nfacility as their home. And being away from home for any reason can be \nvery difficult. The trauma of being in unfamiliar surroundings can \nincrease recovery time. The staff of the resident's ``home'' facility \noften knows best about the person's chronic care and service needs. \nBeing away from ``home'' separates the resident from his or her \nemotional support system. Refusal to allow a resident to return to his \nor her home takes away the person's choice. All of this leads to \ngreater recovery time and unnecessary trauma for the patient.\n  And should a woman's husband have to hitch a ride or catch a cab in \norder to see his recovering spouse if the facility where they live can \nprovide the care? NO. Retirement communities and other long term care \nfacilities are not just health care facilities. They provide an entire \nliving environment for their residents, in other words, a home. We need \nto protect the choice of our seniors to return to their ``home'' after \na hospitalization. And that is what my bill does.\n  It protects residents of CCRC's and nursing facilities by: enabling \nthem to return to their facility after a hospitalization; and requiring \nthe resident's insurer or MCO to cover the cost of the care, even if \nthe insurer does not have a contract with the resident's facility.\n  In order for the resident to return to the facility and have the \nservices covered by the insurer or MCO: 1. The service to be provided \nmust be a service that the insurer covers; 2. The resident must have \nresided at the facility before hospitalization, have a right to return, \nand choose to return; 3. The facility must have the capacity to provide \nthe necessary service and meet applicable licensing and certification \nrequirements of the state; 4. The facility must be willing to accept \nsubstantially similar payment as a facility under contract with the \ninsurer or MCO.\n  My bill also requires an insurer or MCO to pay for a service to one \nof its beneficiaries, without a prior hospital stay, if the service is \nnecessary to prevent a hospitalization of the beneficiary and the \nservice is provided as an additional benefit. Lastly, the bill requires \nan insurer or MCO to provide coverage to a beneficiary for services \nprovided at a facility in which the beneficiary's spouse already \nresides, even if the facility is not under contract with the MCO, \nprovided the other requirements are met.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am committed to providing a safety \nnet for our seniors--this bill is part of that safety net. Seniors \ndeserve quality, affordable health care and they deserve choice. This \nbill offers those residing in retirement communities and long term care \nfacilities assurance to have their choices respected, to have where \nthey reside recognized as their ``home'', and to be permitted to return \nto that ``home'' after a hospitalization. It ensures that spouses can \nbe together as long as possible. And it ensures access to care in order \nto PREVENT a hospitalization. I want to thank my cosponsors Senators \nDodd, Hollings, Jeffords, Kennedy, Murray and Wellstone for their \nsupport. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important \nmeasure to protect the rights of seniors and their access to continuing \ncare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Moynihan, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Reid, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1144. A bill to provide increased flexibility in use of highway \nfunding, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                   Surface Transportation Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nSurface Transportation Act of 1999 along with my colleagues, Chairman \nChafee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Senators \nMoynihan, Jeffords, Reid, Warner, Hutchison, Reid, Lautenberg and \nLeahy. The purpose of this bill is to provide additional flexibility to \nthe States and localities in implementing the Federal transportation \nprogram.\n  Let me briefly describe the three most significant provisions of the \nbill.\n  (1) State infrastructure banks--the bill authorizes all 50 states to \nparticipate in the State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) program. SIBs are \nrevolving funds, capitalized with Federal and State contributions, \nwhich are empowered to make loans and provide other forms of non-grant \nassistance to transportation projects. Before TEA-21 was enacted, \ntransferring Federal highway funding to a State Infrastructure Bank was \nan option available to all 50 states, with 39 states actively \nparticipating. Regrettably, TEA-21 limited the SIB program to just four \nstates. This section would restore the program as it existed prior to \nTEA-21.\n  The American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials (AASHTO), the National Association of State Treasurers, and \nnumerous industry groups, including the American Road & Transportation \nBuilders (ARTBA), strongly support legislation giving all states the \nopportunity to participate in the SIB program.\n  The availability of SIB financial assistance has attracted additional \ninvestment. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, SIBs \nmade 21 loans and signed agreements for another 33 loans as of November \n1, 1998. Together, these 54 projects are scheduled to receive SIB loan \ndisbursements totaling $408 million to support project investments of \nmore than $2.3 billion--resulting in a leverage ratio of about 5.6 to 1 \n(total project investment to amount of SIB investment).\n  (2) High priority project flexibility--the bill includes a provision \nthat allows States the flexibility to advance a ``high priority'' \nproject faster than is allowed by TEA-21, which provides the funding \nfor high priority projects spread over the six-year life of TEA-21. \nThis provision would allow States to accelerate the construction of \ntheir ``high priority'' projects by borrowing funds from other highway \nfunding categories (e.g., NHS, STP, CMAQ). The flexibility is \nparticularly important for states who are ready to construct some of \nthe high priority projects in the first few years of TEA-21, and \nwithout this provision, may need to defer completion until the later \nyears of TEA-21.\n  (3) Funding flexibility for Intercity passenger rail--the bill also \ngives States the option to use their National Highway System, \nCongestion Mitigation\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\nand Air Quality funds, and Surface Transportation Program funds to fund \ncapital expenses associated with intercity passenger rail service, \nincluding high-speed rail service. The National Governors' Association, \nhas passed a resolution requesting this additional flexibility for \nstates to meet their transportation needs. In testimony before the \ncommittee, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Council of \nState Legislatures also requested this additional flexibility.\n  In closing, I would like to encourage my colleagues to support this \nbill, especially for members whose states who are supportive of the \nState Infrastructure Bank program, have high priority projects that are \nready-to-go, or would like the option of using available Federal \ntransportation funding to support intercity passenger rail needs in \ntheir state.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation. I \nask that a section by section description of the bill be printed into \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Summary of the Surface Transportation Act of 1999\n\n     Summary\n       The purpose of this bill is to provide additional \n     flexibility to States and localities in implementing the \n     Federal transportation program. This bill does not affect the \n     funding formula agreed to in TEA 21 or modify the overall \n     level of funding for any program.\n\n\n                           section by section\n\n     Section 1--Short Title\n     Section 2--State Infrastructure Banks\n       This section authorizes all 50 states to participate in the \n     State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) program. SIBs are revolving \n     funds, capitalized with Federal and State contributions, \n     which are empowered to make loans and provide other forms of \n     non-grant assistance to transportation projects. Before the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21) was \n     enacted, transferring Federal highway funding to a State \n     Infrastructure Bank was an option available to all 50 states, \n     with 39 states actively participating. Regrettably, TEA 21 \n     took the program backwards and limited the SIB program to \n     just four states. This section would restore the program as \n     it existed prior to TEA 21. The bill extends thru FY 2003 the \n     SIB program, which was authorized in the National Highway \n     System Designation Act.\n       The American Association of State Highway and \n     Transportation Official (AASHTO), the National Association of \n     State Treasurers, and numerous industry groups, including the \n     American Road & Transportation Builders (ARTBA), strongly \n     support legislation giving all states the opportunity to \n     participate in the SIB program. At their annual meeting in \n     November 1998, AASHTO members adopted a resolution supporting \n     expansion of the SIB program.\n       Availability of SIB financial assistance has attracted \n     additional investment. According to U.S. DOT, SIBs made 21 \n     loans and signed agreements for another 33 loans as of \n     November 1, 1998. Together, these 54 projects are scheduled \n     to receive SIB loan disbursements totaling $408 million to \n     support project investments of more than $2.3 billion--\n     resulting in a leverage ratio of about 5.6 to 1 (total \n     project investment to amount of SIB investment).\n     Section 3--High Priority Project Flexibility\n       Subsection (a) allows States the flexibility to advance a \n     ``high priority'' project faster than is allowed by TEA 21, \n     which provides the funding for high priority projects spread \n     over the six-year life of TEA 21. This provision would allow \n     States to accelerate the construction of their ``high \n     priority'' projects by borrowing funds from other highway \n     funding categories (e.g., NHS, STP, CMAQ). This flexibility \n     is particularly important for states who are ready to \n     construct some of the high priority projects in the first few \n     years of TEA 21, and without this provision may need to defer \n     completion until the later years of TEA 21.\n     Section 4--Funding Flexibility and High Speed Rail Corridors\n       Subsection (a) gives States the option to use their \n     National Highway System, Congestion Mitigation and Air \n     Quality funds, and Surface Transportation Program funds to \n     fund capital expenses associated with intercity passenger \n     rail service, including high-speed rail service. The National \n     Governors' Association, has passed a resolution requesting \n     this additional flexibility for states to meet their \n     transportation needs. In testimony before the committee, the \n     U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Council of State \n     Legislatures also requested this additional flexibility.\n       Subsection (b) specifies how funds transferred for \n     intercity passenger rail services are to be administered.\n     Section 5--Historic Bridges\n       This section eliminates a restriction that caps the amount \n     of Federal-aid highway funds that can be spent on a historic \n     bridge to an amount equal to the cost of demolition. The \n     restriction unnecessarily limits States' flexibility to \n     preserve historic bridges, and limits spending on these \n     historic bridges for the enhancements program for alternative \n     transportation uses. A similar provision was included in the \n     Senate-passed version of the reauthorization, but was not \n     considered by the conferees due to time constraints.\n     Section 6--Accounting Simplification\n       This section makes a minor change to the distribution of \n     the Federal-aid obligation limitation that simplifies \n     accounting for states. Currently, a very small amount of the \n     obligation authority directed to the minimum guarantee \n     program is made available for one-year even though the \n     overwhelming majority is made available for several years. \n     This section would make all obligation authority for this \n     program available as multi-year funding. Therefore, this \n     section eliminates the need to account for the States to plan \n     for the small amount of funding separately.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Robb, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1145. A bill to provide for the appointment of addition Federal \ncircuit and district judges, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   The Federal Judgeship Act of 1999\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal \nJudgeship Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senators Inouye, Sarbanes, \nReid, Robb, Akaka, and Schumer are joining me as original cosponsors of \nthis measure.\n  Our bill creates 69 new judgeships across the country to address the \nincreased caseloads of the Federal judiciary. Specifically, our \nlegislation would: create 7 additional permanent judgeships and 4 \ntemporary judgeships for the U.S. Courts of Appeal; create 33 \nadditional permanent judgeships and 25 temporary judgeships for the \nU.S. District Courts; and convert 10 existing temporary district \njudgeships to permanent positions.\n  This bill is based on the recommendations of the Judicial Conference \nof the United States, the nonpartisan policy-making arm of the judicial \nbranch. Federal judges across the nation believe that the continuing \nheavy caseload of our courts of appeals and district courts merit these \nadditional judges. Indeed, the Chief Justice of the United States in \nhis 1998 year-end report of the U.S. Judiciary declared: ``The number \nof cases brought to federal courts is one of the most serious problems \nfacing them today.''\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist is right. The filings of cases in our Federal \ncourts has reached record heights. For instance, criminal case filings \nin Federal courts rose 15 percent in 1998--nearly tripling the 5.2 \npercent increase in 1997. The number of criminal cases filed since 1991 \nincreased 25 percent with the number of criminal defendants rising 21 \npercent. In fact, the filings of criminal cases and defendants reached \ntheir highest levels since the Prohibition Amendment was repealed in \n1933.\n  Federal civil caseloads have similarity increased. For the past eight \nyears, total civil case filings have increased 22 percent in our \nFederal courts. This increase includes jumps of 145 percent in personal \ninjury product liability cases, 112 percent in civil rights filings, 71 \npercent in social security cases, 49 percent in copyright, patent and \ntrademark filings, and 29 percent prisoner petitions from 1991 to 1998.\n  But despite these dramatic increases in case filings, Congress has \nfailed to authorize new judgeships since 1990, thus endangering the \nadministration of justice in our nation's Federal courts.\n  Historically, every six years Congress has reviewed the need for new \njudgeships. In 1984, Congress passed legislation to address the need \nfor additional judgeships. Six years later, in 1990, Congress again \nfulfilled its constitutional responsibility and enacted the Federal \nJudgeship Act of 1990 because of a sharply increasing caseload, \nparticularly for drug-related crimes. But in the last two Congresses, \nthe Republican majority failed to follow this tradition. Two years ago \nthe Judicial Conference requested an additional 55 judgeships to \naddress the growing backlog. My legislation, based on the Judicial \nConference's 1997 recommendations, S. 678, the Judicial Judgeship Act \nof 1997, languished in the Judicial Committee without action during \nboth sessions of the last Congress.\n  It is now nine years since Congress last seriously reexamined the \ncaseload of the federal judiciary and the need\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\nfor more federal judges. Congress ignores the needs of the Federal \njudiciary at the peril of the American people. Overworked judges and \nheavy caseloads slow down the judicial process and delay justice. In \nsome cases, justice is in danger of being denied because witnesses and \nevidence are lost due to long delays in citizens having their day in \ncourt.\n  We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people \naround the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence \nof our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability \nto act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long \nprotected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary \ncheck on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible \nto the gusts of the political winds of the moment.\n  We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the \nFederal Judiciary in this country who do a tremendous job under \ndifficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-working public \nservants that make up the federal government. They deserve our respect \nand our support.\n  Let us act now to ensure that justice is not delayed or denied for \nanyone. I urge the Senate to enact the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999 \nwithout further delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1146. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \naccess of veterans to emergency medical care in non-Department of \nVeterans Affairs medical facilities; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n           the veterans' access to emergency care act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the American people continue to say they \nwant a comprehensive, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. Toward that \ngoal, several of my Democratic colleagues and I introduced S. 6, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, earlier this year. That \nlegislation, which we first introduced in the 105th Congress, addresses \nthe growing concerns among Americans about the quality of care \ndelivered by health maintenance organizations. I am disappointed that \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle prevented the \nSenate from considering managed care reform legislation last year. But \nI remain hopeful that the Republican leadership will allow an open and \nhonest debate on this important issue this year.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will also take a moment to listen to \nveterans in this country who are raising legitimate concerns about the \nmedical care they receive from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \nMany veterans are understandably concerned that the Administration \nrequested approximately $18 billion for VA health care in FY00--almost \nthe same amount it requested last year. They fear that if this flat-\nlined budget is enacted, the VA would be forced to make significant \nreductions in personnel, health care services and facilities. I share \ntheir concerns and agree that we simply cannot allow that to happen. On \nthe contrary, Congress and the Administration need to work together to \nprovide the funds necessary to improve the health care that veterans \nreceive.\n  Toward that end, and as we prepare to celebrate Memorial Day, I am \nreintroducing the Veterans' Access to Emergency Care Act of 1999. I am \npleased that Senator Rockefeller, the distinguished Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, is joining me in this effort. \nThis legislation, which was S. 2619 last year, calls for veterans to be \nreimbursed for emergency care they receive at non-VA facilities.\n  The problem addressed in the bill stems from the fact that veterans \nwho rely on the VA for health care often do not receive reimbursement \nfor emergency medical care they receive at non-VA facilities. According \nto the VA, veterans may only be reimbursed by the VA for emergency care \nat a non-VA facility that was not pre-authorized if all of the \nfollowing criteria are met:\n  First, care must have been rendered for a medical emergency of such \nnature that any delay would have been life-threatening; second, the VA \nor other federal facilities must not have been feasibly available; and, \nthird, the treatment must have been rendered for a service-connected \ndisability, a condition associated with a service-connected disability, \nor for any disability of a veteran who has a 100-percent service-\nconnected disability.\n  Many veterans who receive emergency health care at non-VA facilities \nare able to meet the first two criteria. Unless they are 100-percent \ndisabled, however, they generally fail to meet the third criterion \nbecause they have suffered heart attacks or other medical emergencies \nthat were unrelated to their service-connected disabilities. \nConsidering the enormous costs associated with emergency health care, \ncurrent law has been financially and emotionally devastating to \ncountless veterans with limited income and no other health insurance. \nThe bottom line is that veterans are forced to pay for emergency care \nout of their own pockets until they can be stabilized and transferred \nto VA facilities.\n  During medical emergencies, veterans often do not have a say about \nwhether they should be taken to a VA or non-VA medical center. Even \nwhen they specifically ask to be taken to a VA facility, emergency \nmedical personnel often transport them to a nearby hospital instead \nbecause it is the closest facility. In many emergencies, that is the \nonly sound medical decision to make. It is simply unfair to penalize \nveterans for receiving emergency medical care at non-VA facilities. \nVeterans were asked to make enormous sacrifices for this country, and \nwe should not turn our backs on them during their time of need.\n  There should be no misunderstanding. This is a widespread problem \nthat affects countless veterans in South Dakota and throughout the \ncountry. I would like to cite just three examples of veterans being \ndenied reimbursement for emergency care at non-VA facilities in western \nSouth Dakota.\n  The first involves Edward Sanders, who is a World War II veteran from \nCuster, South Dakota. On March 6, 1994, Edward was taken to the \nhospital in Custer because he was suffering chest pains. He was \nmonitored for several hours before a doctor at the hospital called the \nVA Medical Center in Hot Springs and indicated that Edward was in need \nof emergency services. Although Edward asked to be taken to a VA \nfacility, VA officials advised him to seek care elsewhere. He was then \ntransported by ambulance to the Rapid City Regional Hospital where he \nunderwent a cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass \ngrafting. Because the emergency did not meet the criteria I mentioned \npreviously, the VA did not reimburse Edward for the care he received at \nRapid City Regional. His medical bills totaled more than $50,000.\n  On May 17, 1997, John Lind suffered a heart attack while he was at \nwork. John is a Vietnam veteran exposed to Agent Orange who served his \ncountry for 14 years until he was discharged in 1981. John lives in \nRapid City, South Dakota, and he points out that he would have asked to \nbe taken to the VA Medical Center in Fort Meade for care, but he was \nsemi-conscious, and emergency medical personnel transported him to \nRapid City Regional. After 4 days in the non-VA facility, John incurred \nnearly $20,000 in medical bills. Although he filed a claim with the VA \nfor reimbursement, he was turned down because the emergency was not \nrelated to his service-connected disability.\n  Just over one month later, Delmer Paulson, a veteran from Quinn, \nSouth Dakota, suffered a heart attack on June 26, 1997. Since he had no \nother health care insurance, he asked to be taken to the VA Medical \nCenter in Fort Meade. Again, despite his request, the emergency medical \npersonnel transported him to Rapid City Regional. Even though Delmer \nwas there for just over a day before being transferred to Fort Meade, \nhe was charged with almost a $20,000 medical bill. Again, the VA \nrefused to reimburse Delmer for the unauthorized medical care because \nthe emergency did not meet VA criteria.\n  The Veterans' Access to Emergency Care Act of 1999 would address this \nserious problem. It would authorize the VA to reimburse veterans \nenrolled in the VA health care system for the cost of emergency care or \nservices received in non-VA facilities when there is ``a serious threat \nto the life or health of a veteran.'' Rep. Lane Evans introduced\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\nsimilar legislation in the House of Representatives earlier this year. \nI am encouraged that the Administration's FY00 budget request includes \na proposal to allow veterans with service-connected disabilities to be \nreimbursed by the VA for emergency care they receive at non-VA \nfacilities. This is a step in the right direction, but I think that all \nveterans enrolled in the VA's health care system--whether or not they \nhave a service-connected disability--should be able to receive \nemergency care at non-VA facilities. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with Senator Rockefeller and my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure that veterans receive the health care they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support to \nthe Veterans' Access to Emergency Care Act of 1999. This bill will \nauthorize VA to cover emergency care at non-Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) facilities for those veterans who have enrolled with VA \nfor their health care. I join my colleague, Senator Daschle, in \ncosponsoring this valuable initiative and thank him for his leadership.\n  Currently, VA is restricted by law from authorizing payment of \ncomprehensive emergency care services in non-VA facilities except to \nveterans with special eligibility. Most veterans must rely on other \ninsurance or pay out of pocket for emergency services.\n  I remind my colleagues that VA provides a standard benefits package \nfor all veterans who are enrolled with the VA for their health care. In \nmany ways, this is a very generous package, which includes such things \nas pharmaceuticals. Enrolled veterans are, however, missing out on one \nessential part of health care coverage: the standard benefits package \ndoes not allow for comprehensive emergency care. So, in effect, we are \nasking veterans to choose VA health care, but leaving them out in the \ncold when it comes to emergency care.\n  Mr. President, we have left too many veterans out in the cold \nalready. When veterans call their VA health care provider in the middle \nof the night, many reach a telephone recording. This recording likely \nurges that veterans who have emergencies dial ``911.'' Veterans who \ncall for help are then transported to non-VA facilities. After the \nemergency is over, veterans are presented with huge bills. These are \nbills which VA cannot, in most cases, pay and which are, therefore, \npotentially financially crushing. We cannot abandon these veterans in \ntheir time of need.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about some of the problems that veterans \nface because of the restriction on emergency care. In January of this \nyear, a low income, non-service-connected, World War II veteran with a \nhistory of heart problems, from my State of West Virginia, presented to \nthe nearest non-VA hospital with severe chest pain. In an attempt to \nget the veteran admitted to the VA medical center, the private \nphysician placed calls to the Clarksburg VA Medical Center, where the \nveteran was enrolled, on three separate occasions, over the course of \nthree days. The response was always the same--``no beds available.''\n  Ultimately, a different VA medical center, from outside the veteran's \nservice area, accepted the patient, and two days later transferred him \nback to the Clarksburg VA Medical Center where he underwent an \nemergency surgical procedure to resolve the problem. By this time, \nhowever, complications had set in, and the veteran was critically ill.\n  The veteran's wife told me that ``no one should have to endure the \npain and suffering'' they had to endure over a five-day period to get \nthe emergency care her husband needed. But in addition to that \nemotional distress, the veteran now also faces a medical bill of almost \n$800 at the private hospital, the net amount due after Medicare paid \nits portion. This is an incredible burden for a veteran and his wife \nwhose sole income are their small Social Security checks.\n  In another example from my state, in February 1998, a 100 percent \nservice-connected veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder suffered \nan acute onset of mid-sternal chest pain, and an ambulance was called. \nThe ambulance took him to the nearest hospital, a non-VA facility. \nStaff at the private facility contacted the Clarksburg VA Medical \nCenter and was told there were no ICU beds available and advised \ntransferring the patient to the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center.\n  When contacted, Pittsburgh refused the patient because of the length \nof necessary transport. A call to the Beckley VAMC was also fruitless. \nThe doctor was advised by VA staff that the trip to Beckley would be \n``too risky for the three hour ambulance travel.''\n  The veteran was kept overnight at the private hospital for \nobservation, and then was billed for the care--$900, after Medicare \npaid its share.\n  Two more West Virginia cases quickly come to mind involving 100 \npercent service-connected combat veterans, both of whom had to turn to \nthe private sector in emergency situations.\n  One veteran had a heart attack and as I recall, his heart stopped \ntwice before the ambulance got him to the closest non-VA hospital. The \nHuntington VA Medical Center was his health care provider and it was \nmore than an hour away from the veteran's home. This veteran had \nMedicare, but he was still left with a sizeable medical bill for the \nemergency services that saved his life.\n  The other veteran suffered a fall that rendered him unconscious and \ncaused considerable physical damage. He also was taken to the closest \nnon-VA hospital--and was left with a $4,000 bill after Medicare paid \nits share.\n  Both contacted me to complain about the unfairness of these bills. As \n100 percent service-connected veterans, they rely totally on VA for \ntheir health care. I can assure you that neither of them, nor the other \ntwo West Virginia veterans I referred to, ever expected to be in the \nsituation in which they all\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\nsuddenly found themselves--strapped with large health care bills \nbecause they needed emergency treatment in life-threatening situations, \nwhen they were miles and miles from the nearest VA medical center.\n  Coverage of emergency care services for all veterans is supported by \nthe consortium of veterans services organizations that authored the \nIndependent Budget for Fiscal Year 2000--AMVETS, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars. The concept is also included in the Administration's FY \n2000 budget request for VA and the Consumer Bill of Rights, which \nPresident Clinton has directed every federal agency engaged in managing \nor delivering health care to adopt.\n  To quote from the Consumer Bill of Rights, ``Consumers have the right \nto access emergency health care services when and where the need \narises. Health plans should provide payment when a consumer presents to \nan emergency department with acute symptoms of sufficient severity--\nincluding severe pain--such that a 'prudent layperson' could reasonably \nexpect the absence of medical attention to result in placing their \nhealth in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or \nserious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.'' This ``prudent \nlayperson'' standard is included in the Veterans' Access to Emergency \nCare Services Act of 1999 and is intended to protect both the veteran \nand the VA.\n  To my colleagues who would argue that this expansion of benefits is \nsomething which the VA cannot afford, I would say that denying veterans \naccess to care should not be the way to balance our budget. The Budget \nResolution includes an additional $1.7 billion for VA. I call on the \nappropriators to ensure that this funding makes its way to VA hospitals \nand clinics across the country.\n  Truly, approval of the Veterans' Access to Emergency Services Act of \n1999 would ensure appropriate access to emergency medical services. \nThus, we would be providing our nation's veterans greater continuity of \ncare.\n  Mr. President, veterans currently have the opportunity to come to VA \nfacilities for their care, but they lack coverage for the one of the \nmost important health care services. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs to \nmake this proposal a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kohl, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 1147. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit against tax employers who provide child care assistance for \ndependents of their employees, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n              worksite child care development act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely proud to introduce the \n``Worksite Child Care Development Act of 1999'' with Senators \nHutchison, Kohl, and Jeffords. This measure will make child care more \naccessible and affordable to the many millions of Americans who find it \nnot only important, but necessary, to work.\n  This legislation would grant tax credits to employers who assist \ntheir employees with child care expenses by providing:\n  A one-time 50 percent tax credit not to exceed $100,000 for startup \nexpenses, including expansion and renovations of an employer-sponsored \nchild care facility;\n  A 50 percent tax credit for employers not to exceed $25,000 annually \nfor the operating costs to maintain a child care facility; and\n  A 50 percent tax credit yearly not to exceed $50,000 for this \nemployers who provide payments or reimbursements for their employees' \nchild care costs.\n  Why is this legislation important?\n  First, the workplace has changed over the years. In 1947, just over \none-quarter of all mothers will children between 6 and 17 years of age \nwere in the labor force. By 1996, their labor force participation rate \nhad tripled.\n  Indeed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 65 percent of all \nwomen with children under 18 years of age are now working and that the \ngrowth in the number of working women will continue into the next \ncentury.\n  Second, child care is one of the most pressing social issues of the \nday. It impacts every family, including the poor, the working poor, \nmiddle class families, and stay-at-home parents.\n  Last June, I hosted a Florida statewide summit on child care where \nover 500 residents of my State shared with me their concerns and \nfrustration on child care issues.\n  They told me that quality child care, when available, is often not \naffordable.\n  Those who qualify told me there are often long waiting lists for \nsubsidized child care.\n  They told me that working parents struggle to find ways to cope with \nthe often conflicting time demands of both work and child care.\n  They told me that their school-age children are at risk because \nbefore and after-school supervised care programs are not readily \navailable.\n  Mr. President, quality child care should be a concern to all \nAmericans. The care and nurturing that children receive early in life \nhas a profound influence on their future--and their future is our \nfuture.\n  In the 21st century, women will comprise more than 60 percent of all \nnew entrants into the labor market. A large proportion of these women \nare expected to be mothers of children under the age of 6.\n  The implications for employers are clear. They understand that our \nNation's work force is changing rapidly and that those employers who \ncan help their employees with child care will have a competitive \nadvantage. In Florida, for instance, Ryder System's Kids' Corner in \nMiami has enrolled approximately 100 children in a top-notch day care \nprogram.\n  I commend the many corporations in Florida and across the nation that \nhave taken the important step of providing child care for its \nemployees. Many smaller businesses would like to join them, but do not \nhave the resources to offer child care to employees. Our legislation \nwould help to lower the obstacle to on-site child care.\n  Mr. President, we believe that this legislation will assist \nbusinesses in providing attractive, cost-effective tools for recruiting \nand retaining employees in a tight labor market.\n  We believe that encouraging businesses to help employees care for \nchildren will make it easier for parents to be more involved in their \nchildren's education.\n  Most of all, Mr. President, we believe that this bill is good for \nemployers and families and will go far in addressing the issue of child \ncare for working families of America. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from \nthe Chief Executive Officers of the Ryder Corporation and Bright \nHorizons Corporation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  Bright Horizons,\n\n\n                                             Family Solutions,\n\n                                                      May 6, 1999.\n     Hon. Robert Graham,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank you for allowing our company the \n     opportunity to review and comment on the Worksite Child Care \n     Development Center Act of 1999. We strongly support this bill \n     and want to do all that we can to support you as the primary \n     sponsor.\n       We applaud your strategy of targeting tax credits for small \n     businesses. Your approach makes perfect sense. Experience has \n     shown that employer-supported child care is not as \n     financially feasible for many small businesses. Since the \n     majority of working parents work for small businesses, their \n     needs have not been adequately addressed. We believe that \n     your bill will have far reaching impact by making it possible \n     for a greater number of working parents to benefit from \n     support offered by their employers.\n       For your consideration, we respectfully submit comments and \n     suggestions, which we think will strengthen the impact of \n     your bill. I welcome the opportunity to share our experience \n     with you and to discuss these or any other ideas you may \n     have, so please feel free to call me.\n       Thank you for your willingness to champion the cause for \n     more and better child care for today's working families. Our \n     company shares this important mission with you. We look \n     forward to supporting you in your efforts to pass this \n     historic legislation.\n           All my best,\n                                                   Roger H.

Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I am writing to commend you on your introduction \n     of the Worksite Child Care Development Center Act of 1999. \n     The problem of finding high quality, affordable child care is \n     one of the most difficult challenges faced by the modern \n     American workforce. Companies should be encouraged to provide \n     these services on site--as Ryder has done with great success \n     at our Kids' Corner facility--whenever possible. Your bill \n     will provide incentives for other businesses to do just that. \n     We wish you great success with this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Tony.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 1148. A bill to provide for the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee \nSioux Tribe of Nebraska certain benefits of the Missouri River Basin \nPick-Sloan project, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n  yankton sioux tribe and santee sioux tribe of nebraska development \n                             trust fund act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncompensate the Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota and the Santee Sioux \nTribe of Nebraska for losses the tribes suffered when the Fort Randall \nand Gavins Point dams were constructed on the Missouri River over four \ndecades ago.\n  As a result of the construction of these dams, more than 3,259 acres \nof land owned by the Yankton Sioux Tribe was flooded or subsequently \nlost to erosion. Approximately 600 acres of land located near the \nSantee village and 400 acres on the Niobrara Island of the Santee Sioux \nTribe Indian Reservation also was flooded. The flooding of these \nfertile lands struck a significant blow at the economies of these \ntribes, and the tribes have never adequately been compensated for that \nloss. Passage of this legislation will help compensate the tribes for \ntheir losses by providing the resources necessary to rebuild their \ninfrastructure and their economy.\n  To appreciate fully the need for this legislation, it is important to \nunderstand the historic events that preceded its development. The Fort \nRandall and Gavins Point dams were constructed in South Dakota pursuant \nto the Flood Control Act (58 Stat. 887) of 1944. That legislation \nauthorized implementation of the Missouri River Basin Pick-Sloan Plan \nfor water development and flood control for downstream states.\n  The Fort Randall dam, which was an integral part of the Pick-Sloan \nproject, initially flooded 2,851 acres of tribal land, forcing the \nrelocation and resettlement of at least 20 families, including the \ntraditional and self-sustaining community of White Swan, one of the \nfour major settlement areas on the reservation. On other reservations, \nsuch as Crow Creek, Lower Brule, Cheyenne River, Standing Rock and Fort \nBerthold, communities affected by the Pick-Sloan dams were relocated to \nhigher ground. In contrast, the White Swan community was completely \ndissolved and its residents dispersed to whatever areas they could \nsettle and start again.\n  The bill I am introducing today is the latest in a series of laws \nthat have been enacted in the 1990s to address similar claims by other \ntribes in South Dakota for losses caused by the Pick-Sloan dams. In \n1992, Congress granted the Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold \nReservation and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe compensation for direct \ndamages, including lost reservation infrastructure, relocation and \nresettlement expenses, the general rehabilitation of the tribes, and \nfor unfulfilled government commitments regarding replacement \nfacilities. In 1996 Congress enacted legislation compensating the Crow \nCreek tribe for its losses, while in 1997, legislation was enacted to \ncompensate the Lower Brule tribe. The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee \nSioux Tribe have not yet received fair compensation for their losses. \nTheir time has come.\n  Mr. President, the flooding caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched \nevery aspect of life on the Yankton and Santee Sioux reservations, as \nlarge portions of their communities were forced to relocate wherever \nthey could find shelter. Never were these effects fully considered when \nthe federal government was acquiring these lands or designing the Pick-\nSloan projects.\n\n  The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska \nDevelopment Trust Fund Act represents an important step in our \ncontinuing effort to compensate fairly the tribes of the Missouri River \nBasin for the sacrifices they made decades ago for the construction of \nthe dams. Passage of this legislation not only will right a historic \nwrong, but in doing so it will improve the lives of Native Americans \nliving on these reservations.\n  It has taken decades for us to recognize the unfulfilled federal \nobligation to compensate the tribes for the effects of the dams. We \ncannot, of course, remake the lost lands that are now covered with \nwater and return them to the tribes. We can, however, help provide the \nresources necessary to the tribe to improve the infrastructure on their \nreservations. This, in turn, will enhance opportunities for economic \ndevelopment that will benefit all members of the tribe. Now that we \nhave reached this stage, the importance of passing this legislation as \nsoon as possible cannot be stated too strongly.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to approve this legislation this year. \nProviding compensation to the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux \nTribe of Nebraska for past harm inflicted by the federal government is \nlong-overdue and any further delay only compounds that harm. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) by enacting the Act of December 22, 1944, commonly \n     known as the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'' (58 Stat. 887, \n     chapter 665; 33 U.S.C. 701-1 et seq.) Congress approved the \n     Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Pick-Sloan program'')--\n       (A) to promote the general economic development of the \n     United States;\n       (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa;\n       (C) to protect urban and rural areas from devastating \n     floods of the Missouri River; and\n       (D) for other purposes;\n       (2) the waters impounded for the Fort Randall and Gavins \n     Point projects of the Pick-Sloan program have inundated the \n     fertile, wooded bottom lands along the Missouri River that \n     constituted the most productive agricultural and pastoral \n     lands of, and the homeland of, the members of the Yankton \n     Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe;\n       (3) the Fort Randall project (including the Fort Randall \n     Dam and Reservoir)--\n       (A) overlies the western boundary of the Yankton Sioux \n     Tribe Indian Reservation; and\n       (B) has caused the erosion of more than 400 acres of prime \n     land on the Yankton Sioux Reservation adjoining the east bank \n     of the Missouri River;\n       (4) the Gavins Point project (including the Gavins Point \n     Dam and Reservoir) overlies the eastern boundary of the \n     Santee Sioux Tribe;\n       (5) although the Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects are \n     major components of the Pick-Sloan program, and contribute to \n     the economy of the United States by generating a substantial \n     amount of hydropower and impounding a substantial quantity of \n     water, the reservations of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the \n     Santee Sioux Tribe remain undeveloped;\n       (6) the United States Army Corps of Engineers took the \n     Indian lands used for the Fort Randall and Gavins Point \n     projects by condemnation proceedings;\n       (7) the Federal Government did not give Yankton Sioux Tribe \n     and the Santee Sioux Tribe an opportunity to receive \n     compensation for direct damages from the Pick-Sloan program, \n     even though the Federal Government gave 5 Indian reservations \n     upstream from the reservations of those Indian tribes such an \n     opportunity;\n       (8) the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe did \n     not receive just compensation for the taking of productive \n     agricultural Indian lands through the condemnation referred \n     to in paragraph (6);\n       (9) the settlement agreement that the United States entered \n     into with the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe \n     to provide compensation for the taking by condemnation \n     referred to in paragraph (6) did not take into account the \n     increase in property values over the years between the date \n     of taking and the date of settlement; and\n       (10) in addition to the financial compensation provided \n     under the settlement agreements referred to in paragraph \n     (9)--\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\n       (A) the Yankton Sioux Tribe should receive an aggregate \n     amount equal to $34,323,743 for--\n       (i) the loss value of 2,851.40 acres of Indian land taken \n     for the Fort Randall Dam and Reservoir of the Pick-Sloan \n     program; and\n       (ii) the use value of 408.40 acres of Indian land on the \n     reservation of that Indian tribe that was lost as a result of \n     stream bank erosion that has occurred since 1953; and\n       (B) the Santee Sioux Tribe should receive an aggregate \n     amount equal to $8,132,838 for the loss value of--\n       (i) 593.10 acres of Indian land located near the Santee \n     village; and\n       (ii) 414.12 acres on Niobrara Island of the Santee Sioux \n     Tribe Indian Reservation used for the Gavins Point Dam and \n     Reservoir.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today, I join with my colleagues to \nintroduce the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe of \nNebraska Development Trust Fund Act. This legislation will provide \ncompensation to the Yankton and Santee Sioux Tribes for\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\ndamages incurred by the development of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River \nBasin program.\n  As a result of the construction of Pick-Sloan development projects on \ntribally-held land adjacent to the Missouri river, Tribes were \nsubjected to forced land takings, involuntary resettlement of families, \nand the loss of irreplaceable reservation resources.\n  The Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska lost approximately 600 acres of \nIndian land located near the Santee village and an additional 400 acres \non the Nebraska Island of the Santee Sioux Tribe Indian Reservation.\n  Congress provided compensation to other Native American Tribes for \nlosses caused by the Pick-Sloan projects. However, the Yankton and the \nSantee Sioux Tribes were not provided opportunities to receive \ncompensation by Congress. Instead, they received settlements for the \nappraised value of their property through condemnation proceedings in \nU.S. District Court. But these Tribes did not receive rehabilitation \ncompensation. As a result, the Yankton and Santee Sioux Tribes are \nentitled to this additional compensation.\n  This legislation seeks to utilize revenues from the sale of \nhydropower generated by the Pick-Sloan dams to redress tribal claims \nfor land takings. Congress has endorsed this approach on three separate \noccasions by enacting legislation which established compensation for \nseveral other Tribes adversely impacted by the Pick-Sloan projects.\n  We propose to establish trust funds for the Yankton and Santee Sioux \nTribes from a portion of the revenues of hydropower sales made by the \nWestern Areas Power Administration. More specifically, the Santee Sioux \nTribe of Nebraska would received a yearly payment of interest earned on \nthe principal in the trust fund. Our legislation encourages the Santee \nSioux Tribe to craft an economic development plan for use of the \ninterest income. This self-governance approach will enable the Santee \nSioux Tribe to continue to address improving the quality of life of its \ntribal members.\n  This legislation values the importance of redressing tribal claims \nand self-governance for Nebraska Native American Tribes. It will enable \nthe Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska to address past grievances and look \nforward to investing in its future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1149. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to increase \nconsumer confidence in safe drinking water and source water \nassessments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n              THE DRINKING WATER RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Drinking \nWater Right-To-Know Act of 1999. This legislation is designed to give \nthe public the Right to Know about contaminants in their drinking water \nthat are unregulated, but still may present a threat to their health.\n  Mr. President, when we passed the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments \nof 1996, I praised the bill because I believed it would enhance both \nthe quality of our drinking water and America's confidence in its \nsafety. While the bill did not require that states perform every \nmeasure necessary to protect public health, it provided tremendous \nflexibility and discretion to allow the states to do so.\n  I was especially hopeful that in my state--the most densely-populated \nstate in the country, a state with an unfortunate legacy of industrial \npollution, a state in which newspaper articles describing threats to \ndrinking water seem to appear every few days--that our state agencies \nwould exercise their discretion to be more protective of public health \nthan the minimum required under our 1996 bill.\n  Mr. President, I am sad to say I have been disappointed. I am sad to \nsay that in my state, and probably in some of my colleagues' as well, \nthe state agency has clung too closely to the bare minimum \nrequirements. A good example of this is in the ``Source Water \nAssessment Plan,'' proposed by the state of New Jersey last November, \nas required by the 1996 law.\n  Under the law, the state is required to perform Source Water \nAssessments to identify geographic areas that are sources of public \ndrinking water, assess the water systems' susceptibility to \ncontamination, and inform the public of the results. The state's Source \nWater Assessment Plan describes the program for carrying out the \nassessments.\n  An aggressive Source Water Assessment program is essential if a state \nis going to achieve the goals we had for the 1996 Safe Drinking Water \nAct. Source Water Assessment is the keystone of the program by which \nthe state will prevent--not just remediate and treat, but prevent--\ncontamination of our drinking water resources. Source Water Assessment \nalso underpins what I believe will be the most far-reaching provisions \nof the law--those giving the public the Right to Know about potential \nthreats to its drinking water.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are serious deficiencies in my state's proposed \nSource Water Assessment Plan. These are deficiencies that I fear may \ncharacterize other states' plans as well.\n  First, under the proposed plan, the state will not identify and \nevaluate the threat presented by contaminants unless they are among the \n80 or so specifically regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nUnder its proposed plan, the state might ignore even contaminants known \nto be leaching into drinking water from toxic waste sites. For example, \nthe chemical being studied as a possible cause of childhood cancer at \nToms River, New Jersey would not be evaluated under the state's plan. \nRadium 224, recently discovered in drinking water across my state, \nmight not be evaluated under the state's plan until specifically \nregulated. With gaps like that in our information, what do I tell the \nfamilies when they want to know what is in their drinking water?\n  In addition, under its proposed plan, the state would not consult the \npublic in identifying and evaluating threats to drinking water. This \nexclusion would almost certainly result in exclusion of the detailed \ninformation known to the watershed groups and other community groups \nwhich exist across New Jersey and across the country. Also, the state's \nplan to disclose the assessments are vague and imply that only summary \ndata would be made available to the public. The public must have \ncomplete and easy access to assessments for the Right to Know component \nof the drinking water program to be effective.\n  The Drinking Water Right-To-Know Act of 1999 will address these \ndeficiencies by amending the Safe Drinking Water Act to improve Source \nWater Assessments and Consumer Confidence Reports. First, under my \nbill, when the state performs Source Water Assessments, it will assess \nthe threat posed, not just by regulated contaminants, but by certain \nunregulated contaminants believed by EPA and U.S. Geological Survey to \ncause health problems, and contaminants known to be released from local \npollution sites, such as Superfund sites, other waste sites, and \nfactories. The bill will also require the state to identify potential \ncontamination of groundwater, even outside the immediate area of the \nwell, perform the assessments with full involvement from the public, \nand update the assessments every five years.\n  Second, the Drinking Water Right-To-Know Act of 1999 will make \nseveral improvements to the ``Consumer Confidence Reports'' required \nunder the 1996 law to notify the public of water contamination. The \nbill will require monitoring and public notification, not only of \nregulated contaminants, but of significant unregulated contaminants \nidentified through the Source Water Assessments, and of sources of \ncontamination. The bill will not require local water purveyors to \nmonitor for every conceivable contaminant--only those identified by the \nstate as posing a threat and having been released by a potentially \nsignificant source. In addition, the bill will require notification of \nnew or sharply-increased contamination within 30 days. The bill will \nalso require reporting not just to ``customers,'' but to ``consumers,'' \nsuch as apartment-dwellers, who do not receive water company bills. \nFinally, the bill will require that consumers be provided information \non how they can protect themselves from contamination in their drinking \nwater.\n  Third, the bill will require that testing for the presence of radium \n224 take place within 48 hours of sampling the\n\n[[Page S6295]]\n\ndrinking water, so that public water supplies can have an accurate \nassessment of this rapidly-decaying radioactive contaminant.\n  Mr. President, the public has the Right-to-Know about the full range \nof contaminants they might find in their tap water. The Drinking Water \nRight-To-Know Act of 1999 will guarantee them that right. I urge my \ncolleagues to co-sponsor this legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to more \naccurately codify the depreciable life of semiconductor manufacturing \nequipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the semiconductor equipment investment act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Semiconductor \nInvestment Act of 1999. I am joined by Senators Baucus, Feinstein, Kyl, \nRobb, and Bingamin. This bill is designed to help the American \nsemiconductor industry compete globally by shortening the depreciable \nlife of semiconductor manufacturing equipment from 5 years to 3.\n  The U.S. semiconductor industry employs more than 275,000 Americans,\n\n[[Page S6296]]\n\nsells over $67 billion of products annually, and currently controls 55 \npercent of the $122 billion world market. Its products form the \nfoundation of practically every electronic device used today. Growth in \nthis industry translates directly into new employment opportunities for \nAmerican workers and to economic growth for the nation as a whole.\n  The American semiconductor industry is a success story because it has \ninvested heavily in the most productive, cutting-edge technology \navailable, and currently spends 14% of its revenues on research and \ndevelopment and 19% on capital investment. Unfortunately, Mr. \nPresident, our semiconductor industry is threatened.\n  While the equipment used to manufacture semiconductors has a useful \nlife of only about 3 years, current tax depreciation rules require that \ncost of the equipment be written off over a full 5 years. The \nSemiconductor Investment Act would correct this flaw, Mr. President, by \nallowing equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductors to be \ndepreciated over a more appropriate 3-year period. Given the massive \nlevel of investment in the semiconductor industry, accurate \ndepreciation is critical to industry success.\n  The key reason for this 3-year depreciation period is that the \nequipment used to make semiconductors grows technologically obsolete \nmore quickly than other manufacturing equipment. Research indicates \nthat semiconductor manufacturing equipment almost completely loses its \nability to produce sellable products after less than 3 years. Today's \n5-year period simply doesn't reflect reality. A quicker write-off \nperiod would help semiconductor manufacturers finance the large \ninvestment in equipment they need for the next generation of products.\n  The National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors reinforced this \nconclusion. Congress founded the committee in 1988, and it consisted of \nPresidential appointees from both the public and private sectors. In \n1992, the committee recommended a 3-year schedule would increase the \nindustry's annual capital investment rate by a full 11 percent.\n  By comparison, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea employ much more generous \ndepreciation schedules for similar equipment, and all three nations \nprovide stiff competition for America's semiconductor manufacturers. \nFor example, under Japanese law, a company can depreciate up to 88 \npercent of its semiconductor equipment cost in the first year, while \nUnited States law permits a mere 20-percent depreciation over the same \nperiod. When multinational semiconductor firms are deciding where to \ninvest, a depreciation gap this large can be decisive.\n  This legislation will help ensure that America's semiconductor \nindustry retains its hard-earned preeminence, a preeminence that yields \nabundant opportunities for high-wage, high-skill employment. Mr. \nPresident, my home State of Utah, provides an outstanding example of \nthe industry's job-creating capacity. Thousands of Utahns earn their \nliving in the State's flourishing semiconductor industry. Firms such as \nMicron Technology, National Semiconductor, Intel, and Varian have \nreinforced Utah's strong position in high-technology industries. With \nthe fair tax treatment this bill brings, all Utahns can look forward to \na more secure and prosperous future.\n  Mr. President, the Semiconductor Investment Act of 1999 will help \nlevel the playing field between U.S. and foreign semiconductor \nmanufacturers, and provides fair tax treatment to an industry that is \none of the Nation's greatest success stories of recent years. I hope \nthat my fellow Senators will join me in supporting this legislation. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act \nto streamline the application of cost accounting standards; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              cost accounting standards amendments of 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on \nbehalf of myself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and \nSenator Lieberman, the Committee's ranking minority member, and \nSenators Warner and Levin, the chairman and ranking minority member of \nthe Armed Services Committee. This legislation will benefit the \nprocurement process in all agencies across the Federal government.\n\n  In recent years, Congress has enacted two major acquisition reform \nstatutes--the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) and \nthe Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. These statutes changed the trend in \ngovernment contracting toward simplifying the government's acquisition \nprocess and eliminating many government-unique requirements. The goal \nof these changes in the government's purchasing processes has been to \nmodify or eliminate unnecessary and burdensome legislative mandates, \nincrease the use of commercial items to meet government needs, and give \nmore discretion to contracting agencies in making their procurement \ndecisions.\n  Since the early 1900's, the Federal government has required certain \nunique accounting standards or criteria designed to protect it from the \nrisk of overpaying for goods and services by directing the manner or \ndegree to which Federal contractors apportion costs to their contracts \nwith the government. The Cost Accounting Standards (CAS standards) are \na set of 19 accounting principles developed and maintained by the Cost \nAccounting Standards (CAS) Board, a body created by Congress to develop \nuniform and consistent standards. The CAS standards require government \ncontractors to account for their costs on a consistent basis and \nprohibit any shifting of overhead or other costs from commercial \ncontracts to government contracts, or from fixed-priced contracts to \ncost-type contracts.\n  FASA and the Clinger-Cohen Act took significant steps to exempt \ncommercial items from the applicability of the CAS standards. \nNonetheless, executive agencies, particularly the Department of \nDefense, and others in the public and private sectors continue to \nidentify the CAS standards as a continuing barrier to the integration \nof commercial items into the government marketplace. Advocates of \nrelaxing the CAS standards argue that they require companies to create \nunique accounting systems to do business with the government in cost-\ntype contracts. They believe that the added cost of developing the \nrequired accounting systems has discouraged some commercial companies \nfrom doing business with the government and led others to set up \nseparate assembly lines for government products, substantially \nincreasing costs to the government.\n  This bill carefully balances the government's need for greater access \nto commercial items, particularly those of nontraditional suppliers, \nwith the need for a strong set of CAS standards to protect the \ntaxpayers from overpayments to contractors. The bill would\n\n[[Page S6297]]\n\nmodify the CAS standards to streamline their applicability, while \nmaintaining the applicability of the standards to the vast majority of \ncontract dollars that are currently covered. In particular, the bill \nwould raise the threshold for coverage under the CAS standards from $25 \nmillion to $50 million; exempt contractors from coverage if they do not \nhave a contract in excess of $5 million; and exclude coverage based on \nfirm, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of adequate price \ncompetition without the submission of certified cost or pricing data.\n  The bill also would provide for waivers of the CAS standards by \nFederal agencies in limited circumstances. This would allow contracting \nagencies to handle this contract administration function, in limited \ncircumstances, as part of their traditional role in administering \ncontracts. Our intent is that waivers would be available for contracts \nin excess of $10 million only in ``exceptional circumstances.'' The \n``exceptional circumstances'' waiver may be used only when a waiver is \nnecessary to meet the needs of an agency, and i.e., the agency \ndetermines that it would not be able to obtain the products or services \nin the absence of a waiver.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cost Accounting Standards \n     Amendments of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to ensure that \ncoverage of bone mass measurements is provided under the health \nbenefits program for Federal employees; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n   osteoporosis federal employee health benefits standardization act\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce \nlegislation that will standardize coverage for bone mass measurement \nfor people at risk for osteoporosis under the Federal Employee Health \nBenefits Program. This legislation is similar to my bill which was \nenacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act to standardize coverage of \nbone mass measurement under Medicare. The bill I reintroduce today \nguarantees the same uniformity of coverage to Federal employees and \nretirees as Congress provided to Medicare beneficiaries two years ago.\n\n  Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 28 million \nAmericans, who either have the disease or are at risk due to low bone \nmass; 80 percent of its victims are women. This devastating disease \ncauses 1.5 million fractures annually at a cost of $13.8 billion--$38 \nmillion per day--in direct medical expenses. In their lifetime, one in \ntwo women and one in eight men over the age of 50 will fracture a bone \ndue to osteoporosis. Amazingly, a woman's risk of a hip fracture is \nequal to her combined risk of contracting breast, uterine, and ovarian \ncancer.\n  Osteoporosis is largely preventable and thousands of fractures could \nbe avoided if low bone mass were detected early and treated. Though we \nnow have drugs that promise to reduce fractures by 50 percent and new \ndrugs have been proven to actually rebuild bone mass, a bone mass \nmeasurement is the only way to diagnose osteoporosis and determine \none's risk for future fractures. And we have learned that there are \nsome prominent risk facts: age, gender, race, a family history of bone \nfractures, early menopause, risky health behaviors such as smoking and \nexcessive alcohol consumption, and some medications all have been \nidentified as contributing factors to bone loss. But identification of \nrisk factors alone cannot predict how much bone a person has and how \nstrong bone is--experts estimate that without bone density tests, up to \n40 percent of women with low bone mass could be missed.\n  Unfortunately, coverage of bone density tests under the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) is inconsistent. Instead of a \ncomprehensive national coverage policy, FEHBP leaves it to each of the \nnearly 500 participating plans to decide who is eligible to receive a \nbone mass measurement and what constitutes medical necessity. Many \nplans have no specific rules to guide reimbursement and cover the tests \non a case-by-case basis. Some plans refuse to provide consumers with \ninformation indicating when the plan covers the test and when it does \nnot and some plans cover the test only for people who already have \nosteoporosis.\n  Mr. President, we owe the people who serve our Government more than \nthat. We know that osteoporosis is highly preventable, but only if it \nis discovered in time. There is simply no substitute for early \ndetection. My legislation standardizes coverage for bone mass \nmeasurement under the FEHBP and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1153.

Mr. President, today I am introducing important \nlegislation to assist rural America, the Rural Telecommunications \nImprovement Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nour distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, as well as \nSenators Dorgan, Baucus, Conrad, Wellstone, Johnson, Wyden, Reid, \nKerrey, Rockefeller and Murray. I would like to thank each of them for \njoining me in this effort to promote the interests of rural America \nwithin the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\n  Our legislation will establish an Office of Rural Advocacy within the \nFCC to promote access to advanced telecommunications in rural areas. \nThe Rural Advocate will be responsible for focusing the Commission's \nattention on the importance of rural areas to the future of American \nprosperity, as well as on ensuring that Universal Service provisions \nmandated by the Communications Act and the Telecommunications Act are \nbeing met and implemented.\n  Our proposal is modeled on the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy, which has been very successful in promoting the interests \nof small business within the U.S. government.\n  Under our bill, the Office of Rural Advocacy will have 9 chief \nresponsibilities:\n  To promote access to advanced telecommunications service for \npopulations in the rural United States;\n  To develop proposals to better fulfill the commitment of the Federal \nGovernment to universal service and access to advanced \ntelecommunications services in rural areas;\n  To assess the effectiveness of existing Federal programs for \nproviders of telecommunications services in rural areas;\n  To measure the costs and other effects of Federal regulations on \ntelecommunication carriers in rural areas;\n  To determine the effect of Federal tax laws on providers of \ntelecommunications services in rural areas;\n  To serve as a focal point for the receipt of complaints, criticisms \nand suggestions concerning policies and activities of any department or \nagency of the Federal Government which affect the receipt of \ntelecommunications services in rural areas;\n  To counsel providers of telecommunications services in rural areas;\n  To represent the views and interests of rural populations and \nproviders of telecommunications services in rural areas; and\n  To enlist the cooperation and assistance of public and private \nagencies, businesses, and other organizations in providing information \nabout the telecommunications programs and services of the Federal \nGovernment which benefit rural areas and telecommunications companies.\n  Mr. President, such an office within the FCC is needed for one very \nimportant reason, no bureau or Commissioner at the FCC has as an \ninstitutional role with the responsibility to promote the interests of \nrural telecommunications. The FCC has a great number of issues to \nconsider due to the ever changing role of communications.\n  Our legislation will ensure the FCC has the resources necessary to \nfocus the Commission's attention on rural issues and will help \nestablish an agenda at the FCC to address rural America's \ntelecommunications needs, something the Commission has not done in the \nrecent past. For example, the FCC's report on Advanced \nTelecommunications Services stated ``deployment of advanced \ntelecommunications generally appear, at present, reasonable and \ntimely.'' I can tell you Mr. President, this is not the case in Iowa \nwhere, according to the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB), approximately 8% of \nour exchanges have no access to the Internet. Additionally, access in \nmany rural areas is of low speed and poor quality. This doesn't even \ninclude access to broadband, or high-speed Internet access, which is \nnot available in numerous rural areas and small towns in Iowa and \nacross the country.\n  Other examples of the FCC's lack of focus on rural issues include a \nfailure to understand how rural telephone cooperatives interact with \ntheir members, such as preventing rural telephone cooperatives from \ncalling members to check on long distance preference changes, and an \nFCC definition that establishes a 3000 hertz level of basic voice grade \nservice, when such a low level prevents Internet access on longer loops \nin rural areas.\n  In order to effectively influence policy on rural telecommunications, \nthis legislation gives the Rural Advocate the rank of a bureau chief \nwithin the FCC. The Rural Advocate will also have the authority to file \ncomments or reports on any matter before the Federal Government \naffecting rural telecommunications without having to clear the \ntestimony with the OMB or the FCC. Additionally, the Rural Advocate can \nfile reports with the Administration, Congress and the FCC to recommend \nlegislation or changes in policy. Finally, the Rural Advocate will be \nappointed directly by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, in short, this legislation would allow rural America \nto enter the fast lane of the Information Superhighway. Again, thank \nyou to my colleagues who have joined me in sponsoring this proposal. I \nurge all Senators to consider joining us in moving this initiative \nforward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of our proposal be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enable States to use Federal funds more \neffectively on behalf of young children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           prenatal, infant and child development act of 1999\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith several of my Senate colleagues that will address the physical, \ncognitive and social development of an often-overlooked segment of our \nnation's population--children from prenatal to three years old.\n  Our bill, the ``Prenatal, Infant and Child Development Act of 1999,'' \nwill give states the necessary tools to help children cultivate the \nbasic learning patterns and abilities that they will use throughout \ntheir lives. We need to do all that we can to create healthy, early \nchildhood development systems across the country, and Senator Graham \nand I believe it is within the most important years of a child's life--\nprenatal to three--that the most beneficial influence can be provided \nby parents, grandparents and caregivers.\n  Every field of endeavor has peak moments of discovery, when past \nknowledge converges with new information, new insights and new \ntechnologies to produce startling opportunities for advancement. For \nthe healthy development of young children--we are faced with one such \nmoment. Today, thanks to decades of research on brain chemistry and \nsophisticated new technologies, neuroscientists have the data that \ntells us the experiences that fill a baby's first days, months, and \nyears have a decisive impact on the architecture of the brain and on \nthe nature and extent of one's adult capabilities. It is the education, \nthe love and the nurturing that our children receive during the years \nprenatal to three that will help determine who they become 10, 20 and \n30 years down the road.\n  Consequently, a tremendous opportunity exists to assist those \nindividuals and families most at risk in the area of prenatal care \nthrough age three. We must work to create systems that support and \neducate families expecting a baby and those already with young \nchildren. We must present a message that is perfectly clear--education \ndoes not and cannot begin in kindergarten, or even in a quality \npreschool.\n  Mr. President, in 1997, I served as Chairman of the National \nGovernors' Association (NGA). My focus during my tenure as Chairman, \nwas the National Education Goal One, that by the year 2000, all \nchildren in America will start school ready to learn.\n  We developed goals, model indicators, and measures of performance of \nchild and family well-being in order to impact school readiness. The \nresults-oriented goals focused states on the improved conditions of \nyoung children and their families. We encouraged state and local \ngovernments to look across a variety of delivery systems--health care, \nchild care, family support, and education--to make sure these systems \nwould work together effectively for young children and their families. \nBased on that effort, between 1997 and 1998, 42 governors made early \nchildhood development a keynote issue as they outlined their state \nagendas.\n  Improving education is really about the process of ``lifelong \nlearning,'' which includes efforts based on what doctors and \nresearchers have said about the importance of positive early childhood \nlearning experiences. The traditional primary and secondary education \ncommunity needs to recognize that investments in early childhood aid \ntheir ultimate goal--that is, a classroom that can continue to move the \nlearning process forward. To achieve that goal, a significant tenet of \nour education agenda must be to ensure that our children enter school \nready to learn. Thus, we must support parents and caregivers, to help \nthem understand that day-to-day interaction with young children helps \nchildren develop cognitively, socially and emotionally.\n  To ensure that children have the best possible start in life, \nsupports must exist to help parents and other adults who care for young \nchildren. Supports that are critical for young children from prenatal \nthrough age three include health care, nutrition programs, childcare, \nearly development services adoption assistance, education programs, and \nother support services.\n  There are three ways we can enhance these supports and create new \nones. The first is to build on existing programs well underway in the \nstates and the local communities by protecting and increasing federal \ncommitments to worthwhile programs such as WIC (Women, Infants, and \nChildren), CCDBG (Child Care and Development Block Grant), and S-CHIP \n(State-Children's Health Insurance Program).\n  The second is to improve coordination among federal agencies in the \nadministration of early childhood programs. As Chairman of the Senate \nGovernment Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, \nRestructuring, and the District of Columbia. I am taking steps to \nensure, for example, that the Department of Education and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services communicate with each other \nabout the early childhood programs for which they are responsible in \norder to determine which are duplicative and which are most successful.\n  The Results Act contemplates that agencies should be using their \nPerformance Plans to demonstrate how daily activities, including \ncoordination, contribute to the achievement of strategic goals. GAO \nevaluated the\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\nDepartments of Education and Health and Human Services 5-year Strategic \nPlans, and FY 1999 and FY 2000 Annual Performance Plans with regard to \ntheir coordination efforts. GAO found that both departments' plans are \nnot living up to their full potential. While they address the issue of \ncoordination, the plans provide little detail about their intentions to \nimplement such coordination efforts. I met with both departments and \nasked that they submit an amended Performance Plan that provided a more \ndetailed compilation of coordination activities and examples. We should \nemerge from this exercise with a consensus on the most promising \nprograms for our children.\n  The third way to improve support services is to encourage states to \nmake prenatal to three development a priority. Our bill gives state and \nlocal governments additional resources to provide these necessary \nsupport services. At the same time, it recognizes that tight spending \nrestraints limit available resources. Consequently, it is a modest, \nincremental bill that encourages collaboration and integration among \nexisting programs and services and provides additional flexibility to \nstates and local governments if they implement programs to provide \ncoordinated services dedicated to meeting the needs of young children.\n\n  Most child advocacy groups rank collaboration on the local level as \nfundamental and essential to successful programs for healthy childhood \ndevelopment. Under the bill, funds will be provided through the CCDBG \nprogram and will reward states that initiate such collaboration in \ncreating state and local councils. It will also encourage states with \nexisting collaboratives to help them expand their focus to social, \nemotional and cognitive development so that children have the best \npossible start in life. Funds could be used for a variety of \ncoordinated services, such as child care, child development, pediatric \nliteracy, parent education, home visits, or health services. States \nwill lay out plans that identify ways to further promote the importance \nof early childhood care and education. Plans should also identify \nexisting supports available for these children and ways that state and \nlocal councils can work with already established early development \nprograms.\n  In addition, the bill focuses on three particular areas to increase \npublic awareness and enhance training opportunities for parents and \nother adults caring for young children.\n  The first would provide funding to expand a satellite television \nnetwork nationally. In order to help parents and caregivers do a better \njob of creating an environment where kids can learn, the legislation \nprovides funds to support satellite television network services \ndirectly connected to child care centers, preschools, colleges, Early \nHead Start sites and the Internet. These services include high quality \ntraining, news, jobs and medical information dedicated to the specific \nneeds of the Head Start staff and others in the early childhood \ncommunity. In my state of Ohio, we already have networks in place at \n1,500 sites.\n  The bill provides for a partnership between at least one non-profit \norganization and other public or private entities specializing in \nbroadcast programs for parents and professionals in the early childhood \nfield. The goal is to blend the latest in satellite technology with \nsound ``prenatal to three'' information and training principles, \npotentially reaching more than 140,000 caregivers and parents each \nmonth.\n  The second would provide financial incentives for child-care workers \nto pursue credentialing or accreditation in early childhood education. \nAlthough many states do not have formal credentialing standards, there \nare several national organizations with accreditation curricula. The \nlegislation encourages caregivers to pursue skills-based training \n(including via satellite or on the Internet) that leads to \ncredentialing or accreditation by the state or national organization. \nWhatever qualified incentive program is initiated, employers would be \nrequired to match each dollar of the Federal contribution.\n  The third would reauthorize and expand the multimedia parenting \nresources through video, print and interactive resources in the PBS \n``Ready to Learn'' initiative. These resources include:\n  Expanded Internet offerings that enable parents to reinforce PBS' \n``Ready to Learn'' curriculum at home. ``Ready to Learn'' material \nwould be directly accessible from the web for parents to utilize in \nreinforcing their child's appreciation of public television programs \nprior to and after program viewing.\n  Expanded national programming, such as Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street.\n  Formalized and expanded ``Ready to Learn Teachers'' training and \ncertificate programs using ``The Whole Child'' video courseware, \ncollateral print materials and the development of new video and print \ncourseware.\n  Expanded caregiver/parent training which would include workshops, \ndistribution of material, and broadcasting of educational video \nvignettes regarding developmentally appropriate activities for young \nchildren.\n  Deployment of a 24-hour channel of Ready to Learn-based children's \nprogramming and parenting training through digital technology.\n  Our bill would also allow the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n(TANF) program to serve young children in a more effective manner by \nallowing states the ability to transfer up to 10 percent of a state's \nTANF grant to the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG). Originally, the \n1996 welfare reform bill allowed states this flexibility. However, this \nwas restricted in 1998 to allow states to transfer just 4.25 percent of \ntheir TANF grant as an offset to help pay for new highway investments \nin TEA-21. Social Services Block Grants (Title XX of the Social \nSecurity Act) are a flexible source of funds that states may use to \nsupport a wide variety of social services for children and families, \nincluding child day care, protective services for children, foster \ncare, and home-based services.\n  The bill would also allow an additional 15 percent transfer of TANF \nmoney to the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) for \nexpenditures under a state early childhood collaboration program. \nCurrently, states are permitted to transfer up to 30 percent of TANF to \na combination of the CCDBG and SSBG. The Welfare Reform Act \nrestructured federal childcare programs, repealed three welfare-related \nchildcare programs and amended the Child Care Development Block Grant \n(CCDBG). Under current law, states receive a combination of mandatory \nand discretionary grants, part of which is subject to a state match. \nThese funds would allow states to create or expand local early \nchildhood development coordination councils (10 percent of the transfer \nauthority), or to enhance child care quality in existing programs (5 \npercent of the transfer authority).\n  Using these new resources, states can implement coordinated programs \nat the local level, such as ``one-stop shopping'' for parents with \nyoung children. Under this particular program, parents could have a \nwell-baby care visit, meet with a counselor to discuss questions and \nconcerns about the baby's development or receive referrals for help in \nenrollment in child-care.\n  Further, the legislation would alter the high performance bonus find \nwithin TANF to include criteria related to child welfare. The current \ncriteria are based upon the recommendations of the National Governors' \nAssociation (NGA) high performance bonus fund work group. The bonus \nfund currently provides $200 million annually to states for meeting \ncertain work-related performance targets, such as improvement of long-\nterm self-sufficiency rates by current and former TANF recipients. The \nperformance targets should be expanded to include family- and child-\nrelated criteria, such as increases in immunization rates, literacy and \npreschool participation.\n\n  Finally, our bill encourages States to use their Maternal and Child \nHealth Services Block Grant to target activities that address the needs \nof children from prenatal to three. The Maternal and Child Health \nServices Block Grant funds a broad range of health services to mothers \nand children, particularly those with low income or limited access to \nhealth services. Its goals are to reduce infant mortality, prevent \ndisease and handicapping conditions among children and increase the \navailability of prenatal, delivery and postpartum care to mothers.\n  States are required to use 30 percent of their block grant for \npreventive and primary care services for children, 30 percent for \nservices to children with special health care needs, and 40 percent at \nthe states' discretion for either of these groups or for other \nappropriate maternal and child health activities.\n\n[[Page S6301]]\n\nUsing this existing funding, this legislation encourages states to \ndesign programs to address the social and emotional development needs \nof children under the age of five. It encourages states to provide \ncoordinated early development services, parent education, and \nstrategies to meet the needs of state and local populations. It does \nnot mandate any specific model, nor does it require that states set-\naside a specific amount of money from this block grant. Rather, it is \nintended to give states flexibility in finding money to devote more \nresources to existing or new healthy early childhood development \nsystems.\n  Mr. President, the pace at which children grow and learn during the \nfirst three years of life makes that period the most critical in their \noverall development. Children who lack proper nutrition, health care \nand nurturing during their early years tend to also lack adequate \nsocial, motor and language skills needed to perform well in school.\n  I believe that all children, parents, and caregivers should have \naccess to coordinated information and support services appropriate for \nhealthy early childhood development in the first three years of life. \nThe changing structure of the family requires that states streamline \nand coordinate healthy early childhood development systems of care to \nmeet the needs of parents and children in the 21st century.\n  The Federal Government's role in the development of these systems of \ncare is minimal; it must give states the flexibility to implement \nprograms that respond to local needs and conditions. Although it's just \na modest step, that's exactly what our bill does.\n  Our children are our most precious natural resource. They are our \nhope and they are our future. Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to \nco-sponsor our legislation, and I urge the Senate during the 106th \nCongress to make prenatal to three a priority for the sake of our \nchildren.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1154\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Babies are born with all of the 100,000,000,000 brain \n     cells, or neurons, that the babies will need as adults.\n       (2) By age 3, children have nearly all of the necessary \n     connections, or synapses, between brain cells that cause the \n     brain to function properly.\n       (3) The pace at which children grow and learn during the \n     first years of life makes that period the most critical in \n     their overall development.\n       (4) Children who lack proper nutrition, health care, and \n     nurturing during their first years tend to also lack adequate \n     social, motor, and language skills needed to perform well in \n     school.\n       (5) All young children, and parents and caregivers of these \n     children, should have access to information and support \n     services appropriate for promoting healthy early childhood \n     development in the first years of life, including health \n     care, early intervention services, child care, parenting \n     education, and other child development services.\n       (6) The changing structure of the family requires that \n     States streamline and coordinate healthy early childhood \n     development systems of care to meet the needs of parents and \n     children in the 21st century.\n       (7) The Federal Government's role in the development of \n     these systems of care should be minimal. The Federal \n     Government must give States the flexibility to implement \n     systems involving programs that respond to local needs and \n     conditions.\n    TITLE I--FUNDS PROVIDED UNDER THE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY \n                            FAMILIES PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 101.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) In 1994, Congress and the Department collaborated to \n     make a long-term, meaningful and public investment in the \n     principle that high-quality preschool television programming \n     will help children be ready to learn by the time the children \n     entered first grade.\n       ``(2) The Ready to Learn Television Program through the \n     Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and local public television \n     stations has proven to be an extremely cost-effective \n     national response to improving early childhood development \n     and helping parents, caregivers, and professional child care \n     providers learn how to use television as a means to help \n     children learn, develop, and play creatively.\n       ``(3) Independent research shows that parents who \n     participate in Ready to Learn workshops are more critical \n     consumers of television and their children are more active \n     viewers. A University of Alabama study showed that parents \n     who had attended a Ready to Learn workshop read more books \n     and stories to their children and read more minutes each time \n     than nonattendees. The parents did more hands-on activities \n     related to reading with their children. The parents engaged \n     in more word activities and for more minutes each time. The \n     parents read less for entertainment and more for education. \n     The parents took their children to libraries and bookstores \n     more than nonattendees. For parents, participating in a Ready \n     to Learn workshop increases their awareness of and interest \n     in educational dimensions of television programming and is \n     instrumental in having their children gain exposure to more \n     educational programming. Moreover, 6 months after \n     participating in Ready to Learn workshops, parents who \n     attended generally had set rules for television viewing by \n     their children. These rules related to the amount of time the \n     children were allowed to watch television daily, the hours \n     the children were allowed to watch television, and the tasks \n     or chores the children must have accomplished before the \n     children were allowed to watch television.\n       ``(4) The Ready to Learn (RTL) Television Program is \n     supporting and creating commercial-free broadcast programs \n     for young children that are of the highest possible \n     educational quality. Program funding has also been used to \n     create hundreds of valuable interstitial program elements \n     that appear between national and local public television \n     programs to provide developmentally appropriate messages to \n     children and caregiving advice to parents.\n       ``(5) Through the Nation's 350 local public television \n     stations, these programs and programming elements reach tens \n     of millions of children, their parents, and caregivers \n     without regard to their economic circumstances, location, or \n     access to cable. In this way, public television is a partner \n     with Federal policy to make television an instrument, not an \n     enemy, of preschool children's education and early \n     development.\n       ``(6) The Ready to Learn Television Program extends beyond \n     the television screen. Funds from the Ready to Learn \n     Television Program have funded thousands of local workshops \n     organized and run by local public television stations, almost \n     always in association with local child care training agencies \n     or early childhood development professionals, to help child \n     care professionals and parents learn more about how to use \n     television effectively as a developmental tool. These \n     workshops have trained more than 320,000 parents and \n     professionals who, in turn, serve and support over 4,000,000 \n     children across the Nation.\n       ``(7)(A) The Ready to Learn Television Program has \n     published and distributed millions of copies of a quarterly \n     magazine entitled `PBS Families' that contains--\n       ``(i) developmentally appropriate games and activities \n     based on Ready to Learn Television programming;\n       ``(ii) parenting advice;\n       ``(iii) news about regional and national activities related \n     to early childhood development; and\n       ``(iv) information about upcoming Ready to Learn Television \n     activities and programs.\n       ``(B) The magazine described in subparagraph (A) is \n     published 4 times a year and distributed free of charge by \n     local public television stations in English and in Spanish \n     (PBS para la familia).\n       ``(8) Because reading and literacy are central to the ready \n     to learn principle Ready to Learn Television stations also \n     have received and distributed millions of free age-\n     appropriate books in their communities as part of the Ready \n     to Learn Television Program. Each station receives a minimum \n     of 200 books each month for free local distribution. Some \n     stations are now distributing more than 1,000 books per \n     month. Nationwide, more than 300,000 books are distributed \n     each year in low-income and disadvantaged neighborhoods free \n     of charge.\n       ``(9) In 1998, the Public Broadcasting Service, in \n     association with local colleges and local public television \n     stations, as well as the Annenberg Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting Project housed at the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting, began a pilot program to test the formal \n     awarding of a Certificate in Early Childhood Development \n     through distance learning. The pilot is based on the local \n     distribution of a 13-part video courseware series developed \n     by Annenberg Corporation for Public Broadcasting and WTVS \n     Detroit entitled `The Whole Child'. Louisiana Public \n     Broadcasting, Kentucky Educational Television, Maine Public \n     Broadcasting, and WLJT Martin, Tennessee, working with local \n     and State regulatory agencies in the child care field, have \n     participated in the pilot program with a high level of \n     success. The certificate program is ready for nationwide \n     application using the Public Broadcasting Service's Adult \n     Learning Service.\n       ``(10) Demand for Ready To Learn Television Program \n     outreach and training has increased dramatically, with the \n     base of participating Public Broadcasting Service member \n     stations growing from a pilot of 10 stations to nearly 130 \n     stations in 5 years.\n       ``(11) Federal policy played a crucial role in the \n     evolution of analog television by funding the television \n     program entitled `Sesame Street' in the 1960's. Federal \n     policy should continue to play an equally crucial role for \n     children in the digital television age.\n\n     ``SEC. 3302.

Mr. President, today I rise as an original co-\nsponsor of the Prenatal Child and Infant Development Act, a bipartisan \nbill to provide states with the flexibility they need to address the \nneeds of children during their formative years.\n  Children are born into this world with all the potential they need to \nmake their dreams come true. The ages of birth to 3 are the most \ncritical for a child's development both mentally and socially. They \nhave all the 100 billion brains cells they will need as adults. By age \nthree, children have nearly all the necessary connections between the \nbrain cells needed for the brain to function fully and properly. It is \nup to us, families, teachers, childcare providers, and communities to \nhelp our children live up to their potential. It is important that our \nchildren are ready to learn and we allow them the opportunity to \nmaximize their potential. What income bracket a child is born into \nshould not determine that child's future. If a child is not provided \nwith proper health care, nutritional food, and a nurturing environment \nto grow up in, we are leading down a very dark path.\n  Sadly, it has been confirmed that children who lack proper nutrition, \nhealth care, and nurturing during their first years also lack the \nadequate social, motor, and language skills needed to perform well in \nschool and in life. That is why I have joined efforts with Senator \nVoinovich and Senator Graham and support the Prenatal Child and Infant \nDevelopment Act. This initiative has bipartisan support because it is \nimportant legislation that addresses something we should all have in \ncommon, helping our children prepare for the future. A child birth to 3 \nyears old that is in need of assistance can not do it on her own.\n  Specifically, this bill will allow States to transfer up to 45% of \nthe money they receive for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to \nthe Child Care Development Block Grant or the Social Services Block \nGrant. The 15% increase in transferability will go towards increasing \nlocal early childhood development coordination councils and to enhance \nchild care quality under the existing Child Care Development Block \nGrant. This new flexibility will allow states to spend the money needed \nto ensure our children are not sentenced to unfulfillment of their \ndreams just because they were denied child care services during their \nmost vital development stages.\n  In Indiana, there are over 488,000 children under the age of six. 70% \nof those children are in child care. Indiana is one of those states \nthat has transferred the entire amount currently allowed from Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families funds to the Child Care Development Block \nGrant for child care services and quality initiatives. Even after the \nState was able to provide services for 65,185 children, there still \nremains a need to help at least an additional 267,500 children. There \nis a need in my State to have the flexibility to transfer and utilize \nfunds that otherwise are not being spent so these children can be \nserved.\n  One of the programs this new flexibility will allow to expand in \nIndiana is the Building Bright Beginnings Coalition. This coalition is \nfocused on assisting children that are prenatal to four years old. They \nhave reached over 150,000 parents of newborns through their publication \n``A Parent's Guide to Raising Health, Happy Babies''. The coalition has \nimplemented the ``See and Demand Quality Child Care'' campaign \nconsisting of public service announcements, billboards, pamphlets, and \na toll-free telephone line for parent information in cooperation with \nlocal resources and referral agencies. It also makes loans available to \nchild care providers who are considered non-traditional borrowers, and \nit has formed an institute that creates a public private partnership \nwith higher education as well as the health, education, and early \nchildhood communities. In the short time this program has been in \nplace, it has helped over 100,000 parents of newborns be better \ninformed, over 10,000 new public private partnerships have been formed, \nand it has directly impacted the lives of over 15,000 children. We need \nmore programs like this and in order for them to exist States need more \nflexibility with their funding streams.\n  These quality initiatives are administered by Indiana's Step Ahead \nCouncils. Step Ahead Councils are the types of councils this bill hopes \nto promote. Indiana has had a council in each of its 92 counties since \n1991. These councils allow for locally focused solutions and \ninitiatives to locally based challenges with child care, parent \ninformation, early intervention, child nutrition and health screening. \nLocal responses to local problems can create better solutions. This \nbill encourages such local involvement.\n  In addition, there are several other important goals this bill helps \nto accomplish. It will allow more programs to address the needs of \nprenatal to three year olds, it will increase satellite training for \nHead Start and other childhood program staff, it will increase direct \nchild care and health services, and will encourage States to implement \ntraining programs for childcare providers.\n  As a Senator and a father of two 3\\1/2\\ year old boys, I am proud to \nsupport\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\nthis bill and publically voice the need to invest in all children. \nThere is no better way to utlize a dollar than to invest it in our \nfuture. Thank you Senator Voinovich and Senator Graham for initiating \nthis legislation, I urge my colleagues, when the time comes, to support \nthis bill and the message behind it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1156. A bill to amend provisions of law enacted by the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 to ensure full \nanalysis of potential impacts on small entities of rules proposed by \ncertain agencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness.\n\n\n small business advocacy review panel technical amendments act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Small \nBusiness Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999.'' I am \npleased to be joined by Senator Kerry, the Ranking Member on the Small \nBusiness Committee, which I chair. Our bill is simple and \nstraightforward. It clarifies and amends certain provisions of law \nenacted as part of my ``Red Tape Reduction Act,'' the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. In 1996, this body led the \nway toward enactment of this important law. With a unanimous vote, we \ntook a major step to ensure that small businesses are treated fairly by \nfederal agencies.\n  Like the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which it amended, the Red Tape \nReduction Act is a remedial statute, designed to redress the fact that \nuniform federal regulations impose disproportionate impacts on small \nentities, including small business, small not-for-profits and small \ngovernments. A recent study conducted for the Office of Advocacy of the \nSmall Business Administration documented, yet again, that small \nbusinesses continue to face higher regulatory compliance costs than \ntheir big-business counterparts. With the vast majority of businesses \nin this nation being small enterprises, it only makes sense for the \nrulemaking process to ensure that the concerns of such small entities \nget a fair airing early in the development of a federal regulation.\n  The bill Senator Kerry and I are introducing focuses on Section 244 \nof the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, \nwhich amended chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (commonly known \nas the Regulatory Flexibility Act). As a result, each ``covered \nagency'' is required to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel \n(Panel) to receive advice and comments from small entities. \nSpecifically, under section 609(b), each covered agency is to convene a \nPanel of federal employees, representing the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget, the \nChief Counsel of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and the \ncovered agency promulgating the regulation, to receive input from small \nentities prior to publishing an initial Regulatory Flexibility analysis \nfor a proposed rule with a significant economic impact on a substantial \nnumber of small entities. The Panel, which convenes for 60 days, \nproduces a report containing comments from the small entities and the \nPanel's own recommendations. The report is provided to the head of the \nagency, who reviews the report and, where appropriate, modifies the \nproposed rule, initial regulatory analysis or the decision on whether \nthe rule significantly impacts small entities. The Panel report becomes \na part of the rulemaking record.\n  Consistent with the overall purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act \nand the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the \nobjective of the Panel process is to minimize the adverse impacts and \nincrease the benefits to small entities affected by the agency's \nactions. Consequently, the true proof of each Panel's effectiveness in \nreducing the regulatory burden on small entities is not known until the \nagency issues the proposed and final rules. So far, the results are \nencouraging.\n\n  Under current law, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are the only \nagencies currently covered by the Panel process. Our bill adds the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) as a covered agency. In 1996, the Red \nTape Reduction Act expressly included the IRS under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act; however, the Treasury Department has interpreted the \nlanguage in the law in a manner that essentially writes them out of the \nlaw. The Small Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act \nof 1999 clarifies which interpretative rules involving the internal \nrevenue code are to be subject to compliance with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, for those rules with a significant economic impact on \na substantial number of small entities, the IRS would be required to \nconvene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel.\n  If the Treasury Department and the IRS had implemented the Red Tape \nReduction Act as Congress originally intended, the regulatory burdens \non small businesses could have been reduced, and small businesses could \nhave been saved considerable trouble in fighting unwarranted rulemaking \nactions. For instance, with input from the small business community \nearly in the process, the IRS' 1997 temporary regulations on the \nuniform capitalization rules could have had taken into consideration \nthe adverse effects that inventory accounting would have on farming \nbusinesses, and especially nursery growers. Similarly, if the IRS had \nconducted an initial Regulatory Flexibility, it would have learned of \nthe enormous problems surrounding its limited partner regulations prior \nto issuing the proposal in January 1997. These regulations, which \nbecame known as the ``stealth tax regulations,'' would have raised \nself-employment taxes on countless small businesses operated as limited \npartnerships or limited liability companies, and also would have \nimposed burdensome new recordkeeping and collection of information \nrequirements.\n  Specifically, the bill strikes the language in section 603 of title 5 \nthat included IRS interpretative rules under the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct, ``but only to the extent that such interpretative rules impose on \nsmall entities a collection of information requirement.'' The Treasury \nDepartment has misconstrued this language in two ways. First, unless \nthe IRS imposes a requirement on small businesses to complete a new \nOMB-approved form, the Treasury says Reg Flex does not apply. Second, \nin the limited circumstances where the IRS has acknowledged imposing a \nnew reporting requirement, the Treasury has limited its analysis of the \nimpact on small businesses to the burden imposed by the form. As a \nresult, the Treasury Department and the IRS have turned Reg Flex \ncompliance into an unnecessary, second Paperwork Reduction Act.\n  To address this problem, our bill revises the critical sentence in \nSection 603 to read as follows:\n\n       In the case of an interpretative rule involving the \n     internal revenue laws of the United States, this chapter \n     applies to interpretative rules (including proposed, \n     temporary and final regulations) published in the Federal \n     Register for codification in the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Coverage of the IRS under the Panel process and the technical changes \nI have just described are strongly supported by the Small Business \nLegislative Council, the National Association for the Self-Employed, \nand many other organizations representing small businesses. Even more \nsignificantly, these changes have the support of the Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy. I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record following \nthis statement copies of letters and statements from these small \nbusiness advocates.\n  The remaining provisions of our bill address the mechanics of \nconvening a Panel and the selection of the small entity representatives \ninvited to submit advice and recommendations to the Panel. While these \nprovisions are very similar to the legislation introduced in the other \nbody (H.R. 1882) by our colleagues Representatives Talent, Velazquez, \nKelly, Bartlett, and Ewing, Senator Kerry has expressed some specific \nconcerns regarding the potential for certain provisions to be \nmisconstrued. I have agreed to work with him to address his concerns in \nreport language and, if necessary, with minor revisions to the bill \ntext.\n  Our mutual goal is to ensure that the views of small entities are \nbrought forth through the Panel process and taken to heart by the \n``covered agency'' and other federal agencies represented on the \nPanel--in short, to\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\ncontinue the success that EPA and OSHA have shown this process has for \nsmall businesses. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nsupport, and ask unanimous consent that the Small Business Advocacy \nReview Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 be printed, following \nthis statement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC), I would like to offer our strong \n     support for your legislation to expand the Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) to encompass \n     more of the activities of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n       As you know, there is nothing more annoying to the small \n     business community than when the IRS issues a proposed rule \n     and it is obvious the authors have little or no understanding \n     of the business practices of the small businesses to be \n     covered by the rule.\n       OSHA and the EPA have also been identified in the past as \n     agencies guilty of acting without a solid understanding of an \n     industry. Thanks to your leadership, the 104th Congress fixed \n     the problem in the case of EPA and OSHA by enacting SBREFA. \n     Those two agencies must go out and collect information on \n     small business before they finish development of a proposed \n     rule. The law requires the OSHA and EPA to increase small \n     business participation in agency rulemaking activities by \n     convening a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel for a \n     proposed rule with a significant economic impact on small \n     entities. For such rules, the agencies must notify SBA's \n     Chief Counsel of Advocacy that the rule is under development \n     and provide sufficient information so that the Chief Counsel \n     can identify affected small entities and gather advice and \n     comments on the effects of the proposed rule. A Small \n     Business Advocacy Review Panel, comprising Federal government \n     employees from the agency, the Office of Advocacy, and OMB, \n     must be convened to review the proposed rule and to collect \n     comments from small businesses. Within 60 days, the panel \n     must issue a report of the comments received from small \n     entities and the panel's findings, which become part of the \n     public record.\n       As we have said many times before, we believe your ``red \n     tape cutting'' law, SBREFA, is one of the most significant \n     small business laws of all time. As you know first hand, for \n     a variety of reasons, the IRS was not included. This omission \n     should be corrected. If there is one agency with ongoing \n     rulemaking responsibilities that have an impact on small \n     business, it is the IRS.\n       In addition, the other provisions of SBREFA apply only to \n     the IRS when the interpretative rule of the IRS will ``impose \n     on small entities a collection of information requirement.'' \n     We already know the IRS has embraced an extraordinarily \n     narrow interpretation of that phrase. We should take this \n     opportunity to amend SBREFA to ensure the IRS complies with \n     SBREFA any time it issues an interpetative regulation.\n       As you know, the SBLC is a permanent, independent coalition \n     of eighty trade and professional associations that share a \n     common commitment to the future of small business. Our \n     members represent the interests of small businesses in such \n     diverse economic sectors as manufacturing, retailing, \n     distribution, professional and technical services, \n     construction, transportation, tourism and agriculture. Our \n     policies are developed through a consensus among our \n     membership. Individual associations may express their\n\n[[Page S6309]]\n\n     own views.

Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bond: This is in response to your request for \n     my views as to whether the Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA) should be amended \n     to include more activities of the Internal Revenue Service \n     (IRS).\n       The proposed amendments to SBREFA are constructive. In \n     particular, applying the requirement that IRS convene Small \n     Business Advocacy Review Panels to consider the impact of \n     proposed rules involving the internal revenue laws is a goal \n     that certainly would give small businesses a stronger voice \n     in a process that affects them so dramatically.\n       The panel process has applied since 1996 to the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). A panel, comprising \n     the administrator of EPA or OSHA, the Chief Counsel for \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and the \n     director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, \n     collects comments from representatives of small entities. \n     Then the panel issues a report on the comments and the \n     panel's findings within 60 days. This process has been \n     extremely helpful in identifying the likely impact of major \n     rules on small entities, yet its tight timetable has assured \n     that needed rules are not delayed unduly.\n       Tax regulations impose the most widespread burdens on small \n     business. Therefore, it is important to have small business \n     input at the earliest possible stage of rulemaking. This \n     amendment builds on an existing panel process that is working \n     well. The panel process would bring a new level of scrutiny \n     to tax regulations, some of which have added immensely to \n     small entity burdens in the past.\n       At the same time, I am mindful that this expansion will add \n     significantly to the workload of both the Office of Advocacy \n     and the IRS, and I hope suitable staffing adjustments to \n     accommodate this important added work will be made.\n       Thank you for soliciting my views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jere W. Glover,\n                                       Chief Counsel for Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Ranking Democrat on the Committee on \nSmall Business, I join Committee Chairman Bond in introducing the Small \nBusiness Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999. While \nthere are a few minor points that Chairman Bond and I have agreed to \nwork out before the Committee considers the bill, we both agree that \nthis is an important piece of legislation which should be enacted \npromptly to facilitate the Small Business Enforcement Fairness Act \nprocess. This process enables small entity representatives to \nparticipate in rulemakings by the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and, \nunder this bill, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the Department \nof Treasury.\n  This bill improves and enhances the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act of 1996, which has not only reduced regulatory \nburdens that otherwise would have been placed on small businesses, but \nalso has begun to institute a fundamental change in the way Federal \nagencies promulgate rules that could have ``a substantial economic \nimpact on a substantial number of small businesses.'' Federal agencies \nare required under existing law to form so-called SBREFA panels in \nconjunction with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in \nthe Office of Management and Budget, and with small entities, or their \nrepresentatives. These SBREFA panels are charged with creating flexible \nregulatory options that would allow small businesses to continue to \noperate without sacrificing the environmental, or health and safety \ngoals of the proposed rule.\n  These panels have been highly effective in saving small businesses \nregulatory compliance costs. To date, seventeen (17) Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act panels have been convened by the \nEPA, and three (3) by the OSHA. According to SBA's Office of Advocacy, \nsince the law's enactment in 1996, the EPA SBREFA panels have saved \nsmall businesses almost $1 billion, and the OSHA SBREFA panels have \nsaved small businesses about $2 billion.\n  While the process has obviously worked well to date, there are a few \ntechnical changes that we are proposing to help the process work even \nbetter. These changes were recommended by selected small entity \nrepresentatives who have experience with the SBREFA panel process, and \nwho testified at a joint hearing held by the House Small Business \nCommittee's Subcommittees on Regulatory Reform and Paperwork Reduction, \nand Government Programs and Oversight on March 11, 1999.\n  Let me take a minute to describe the provisions of the bill.\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\n  This bill would lengthen by thirty (30) days the time that small \nentity representatives have to review the usually technical and \nvoluminous materials to be considered during panel deliberations. For \nthose small businessmen and women who would like to participate but do \nnot have a great deal of time to review technical data, the bill \nrequires OSHA, EPA and IRS to prepare detailed summaries of background \ndata and information.\n  The bill would also allow a small entity representative, if he or she \nso chooses to, make an oral presentation to the panel.\n  Many small entities have expressed their interest in reviewing the \npanel report before the rule is proposed, and this bill would require \nthe panel report to be printed in the Federal Register either as soon \nas practicable or with the proposed rule, but in no case, later than \nsix (6) months after the rule is proposed.\n  Moreover, the bill would add certain rules issued by Internal Revenue \nService to the panel requirements of SBREFA. Many small businesses \ncomplain that they are overwhelmed with the large burdens that the IRS \nplaces on them. It is the goal of this bill to hold the IRS accountable \nfor the interpretative rules they issue that have a major impact on \nsmall business concerns, and to open up the rulemaking process so small \nentities can participate.\n  This new authority would significantly increase the workload of SBA's \nOffice of Advocacy, the Federal office charged with monitoring agency \ncompliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, including SBREFA. \nChairman Bond and I agree that it is important that the Office of \nAdvocacy have adequate resources to fulfill the new responsibilities \nmandated by this bill. Therefore, we plan to send a letter jointly to \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and State Chairman and \nRanking Member Senators Gregg and Hollings requesting them to approve \nadditional funding for the Office of Advocacy to handle these \nadditional responsibilities under the law.\n  I am proud to support this legislation. I believe it will result in \nsignificant savings for small businesses and will improve the mechanism \nfor their voices to be heard.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Bond and his staff for their \nefforts working with me and my staff to produce this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Thurmond, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1157. A bill to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act and the Copeland Act; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                     davis-bacon repeal act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nthe Davis-Bacon Repeal Act of 1999. This legislation would repeal the \nDavis-Bacon Act of 1931, which guarantees high wages for workers on \nFederal construction projects, and the Copeland Act, which imposes \nweekly payroll reporting requirements.\n  Davis-Bacon requires contractors on Federal construction projects \ncosting over $2,000 to pay their workers no less than the ``prevailing \nwage'' for comparable work in their local area. The U.S. Department of \nLabor has the final say on what the term ``prevailing wage'' means, but \nthe prevailing wage usually is based on union-negotiated wages.\n  My bill would allow free market forces, rather than bureaucrats at \nthe Labor Department in Washington, DC., to determine the amount of \nconstruction wages. There is simply no need to have the Labor \nDepartment dictating wage rates for workers on Federal construction \nprojects in every locality in the United States.\n  The Department of Labor's Office of the Inspector General recently \nissues a devastating report showing that inaccurate information had \nbeen used in Davis-Bacon wage determinations in several states. The \nerrors caused wages or fringe benefits to be overstated by as much as \n$1.00 per hour, in some cases. If Davis-Bacon were repealed, American \ntaxpayers would save more than $3 billion over a 5-year period, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Davis-Bacon also stifles competition in Federal bidding for \nconstruction projects, especially with respect to small businesses. \nSmall construction companies are not knowledgeable about Federal \ncontracting procedures; and they simply cannot afford to hire the staff \nneeded to comply with Davis-Bacon's complex work rules and reporting \nrequirements.\n  Congress passed Davis-Bacon during the Great Depression, a period in \nwhich work was scarce. In those days, construction workers were willing \nto take what jobs they could find, regardless of the wage rate; most \nconstruction was publicly financed; and there were no other Federal \nworker protections on the books.\n  Conditions in the construction industry have changed a lot since \nthen, however. Today, unemployment rates are low, and public works \nconstruction makes up only about 20 percent of the construction \nindustry's activity. Also, we now have many Federal laws on the books \nto protect workers. Such laws include the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n1938, which imposes a general minimum wage, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970, the Miller Act of 1935, the Contract Work House and \nSafety Standards Act of 1962, and the Social Security Act.\n  Yet the construction industry still has to operate under Davis-\nBacon's inflexible 1930s work requirements and play by its payroll \nreporting rules. Under the law's craft-by-craft requirements, for \nexample, contractors must pay Davis-Bacon wages for individuals \nwho perform a given craft's work. In many cases, that means a \ncontractor either must pay a high wage to an unskilled worker for \nperforming menial tasks, or he must pay a high wage to an experienced \nworker for these menial tasks. These requirements reduce productivity.\n\n  A related problem with Davis-Bacon is that it reduces entry-level \njobs and training opportunities for the disadvantaged. Because the law \nmakes it costly for contractors to hire lower-skilled workers on \nconstruction projects, the statute creates a disincentive to hire \nentry-level workers and provide on-the-job training.\n  The Congressional Budget Office raised this issue in its analysis, \n``Modifying the Davis-Bacon Act: Implications for the Labor Market and \nthe Federal Budget.'' As stated in that 1983 study:\n\n       Although the effect of Davis-Bacon on wages receives the \n     most attention, the Act's largest potential cost impact may \n     derive from its effect on the use of labor. For one thing, \n     DOL wage determinations require that, if an employee does the \n     work of a particular craft, the wage paid should be for the \n     craft.\n       For example, carpentry work must be paid for at carpenters' \n     wages, even if performed by a general laborer, helper or \n     member of another craft.\n\n  Moreover, the General Accounting Office has maintained that the \nDavis-Bacon Act is no longer needed. GAO began to openly question \nDavis-Bacon in the 1960s; and in 1979, it issued a report calling for \nthe Act's repeal. Titled ``The Davis-Bacon Act Should Be Repealed,'' \nthe report states: ``[o]ther wage legislation and changes in economic \nconditions and in the construction industry since the law was passed \nmake the law obsolete; and the law is inflationary.''\n  To those who remain unconvinced that Davis-Bacon is bad public \npolicy, I urge a review of the Act's legislative history. Some early \nsupporters of Davis-Bacon advocated its passage as a means to \ndiscriminate against minorities. For instance, Clayton Allgood, a \nmember of the 71st Congress, argued on the House floor that Davis-Bacon \nwould keep contractors from employing ``cheap colored labor'' on \nconstruction projects. As stated by Congressman Allgood on February 28, \n1931, ``it is labor of that sort that is in competition with white \nlabor throughout the country.'' Unfortunately, Davis-Bacon still has \nthe effect of keeping minority-owned construction firms from competing \nfor Federal construction contract, because many such firms are small \nbusinesses.\n  Early supporters of Davis-Bacon also believed that the law would \nprevent outside contractors from undermining local firms in the Federal \nbidding process. In practice, however, Davis-Bacon wages hurt local \nbusinesses and make it more likely that outside contractors will win \nbids for Federal projects.\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\n  Mr. President, for all of the above reasons, I believe that the \nDavis-Bacon Act should be repealed. I urge my colleagues to support the \nDavis-Bacon Repeal Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1157\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DAVIS-BACON ACT.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--The Act of March 3, 1931 (40 U.S.C. 276a et \n     seq.) (commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon Act) is \n     repealed.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in any law to a wage \n     requirement of the Act of March 3, 1931, shall after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act be null and void.\n\n     SEC. 2. COPELAND ACT.\n\n       Section 2 of the Act of June 13, 1934 (40 U.S.C. 276c) \n     (commonly referred to as the ``Copeland Act'') is repealed.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by sections 1 and 2 shall take effect \n     30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act but shall \n     not affect any contract in existence on such date of \n     enactment or made pursuant to invitation for bids outstanding \n     on such date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to join Senator Bob Smith as a \ncosponsor of the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act of 1999.\n  I believe Davis-Bacon repeal is long overdue. This 68-year-old \nlegislation requires contractors to pay workers on federally-subsidized \nprojects what the Labor Department determines is the local prevailing \nwage. What Davis-Bacon actually does is cost the Federal Government \nbillions of dollars, divert funds out of vitally important projects, \nand limit opportunities for employment.\n  In my own State of Oklahoma, it has been proven that many \n``prevailing wages'' have been calculated using fictitious projects, \nghost workers, and companies established to pay artificially high \nwages. Oklahoma officials have reported that many of the wage survey \nforms submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor to calculate Federal \nwage rates in Oklahoma were wrong or fraudulent.\n  Records showed that an underground storage tank was built using 20 \nplumbers and pipefitters paid $21.05 an hour but no such tank was ever \nbuilt. In another case, several asphalt machine operators were reported \nto have been employed at $15 an hour to build a parking lot but the lot \nwas made of concrete, there were no asphalt operators, and the actual \nDavis-Bacon wage should have been $8 an hour. Ultimately, the Oklahoma \nSecretary of Labor established that at least two of the inflated \nOklahoma reports were filled out by union officials.\n  The Davis-Bacon Act also diverts urgently needed Federal funds. After \nthe 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City, Mayor \nRon Norick of Oklahoma City estimated that the city could have saved \n$15 million in construction costs had the President waived the Davis-\nBacon Act.\n  This money could have been used to provided additional assistance to \nthose impacted by the bombing and to further rebuild the area around \nthe Murrah site. The Federal role in disaster situations should be to \nempower communities and foster flexibility so that rebuilding efforts \ncan proceed in the best manner possible.\n  The Congress should repeal a law that discourages, rather than \nencourages, the employment of lower skilled or non-skilled workers.\n  Davis-Bacon began as a way to keep small and minority businesses out \nof the government pie, and today it still does, reaching even further. \nRepeal of the act will take wage setting out of the hands of \nbureaucrats and return the determination of labor costs on construction \nprojects to the efficiencies of the competitive marketplace. This would \nresult in a more sound fiscal policy through payment of actual market-\nbased local wage rates; more entry-level jobs in construction industry \nfor youth, minorities, and women; and more small businesses bidding on \nFederal contracts.\n  The Davis-Bacon Repeal Act will provide increased job opportunities \nfor those who might not ordinarily have the chance to enter the \nworkforce, the opportunity to learn a trade, and the opportunity to \nclimb the economic ladder.\n  I applaud Senator Smith for his efforts and appreciate the chance to \ncosponsor this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 1158. A bill to allow the recovery of attorney's fees and costs by \ncertain employers and labor organizations who are prevailing parties in \nproceedings brought against them by the National Labor Relations Board \nor by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             FAIR ACCESS TO INDEMNITY AND REIMBURSEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my honor today to \nintroduce the ``Fair Access to Indemnity and Reimbursement Act'' (the \n``FAIR Act''), which will amend the National Labor Relations Act and \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act to provide that a small employer \nprevailing against either agency will be automatically entitled to \nrecover the attorney's fees and expenses it incurred to defend itself.\n  The FAIR Act is necessary because the National Labor Relations Board \n(``NLRB'') and Occupational Safety and Health Agency (``OSHA'') are two \naggressive, well-funded agencies which share a ``find and fine'' \nphilosophy. The destructive consequences that small businesses suffer \nas a result of these agencies' ``find and fine'' approach are magnified \nby the abuse of ``salting'' or the placement of paid union organizers \nand their agents in non-union workplaces for the sole purpose of \ndisrupting the workforce. ``Salting abuse'' occurs when ``salts'' \ncreate labor law violations or workplace hazards and then file \nfrivolous claims with the NLRB or OSHA. Businesses are then often \nforced to spend thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of \ndollars to defend themselves against NLRB or OSHA as these agencies \nvigorously prosecute these frivolous claims. Accordingly, many \nbusinesses, when faced with the cost of a successful defense, make a \nbottom-line decision to settle these frivolous claims rather than going \nout of business or laying off employees in order to finance costly \nlitigation.\n  The ``FAIR Act'' will allow these employers to defend themselves \nrather than settling, and, more importantly, it will force the NLRB or \nOSHA to ensure that the claims they pursue are worthy of their efforts. \nThe FAIR Act will accomplish this by allowing employers with up to 100 \nemployees and a net worth of up to $7,000,000 to recover their \nattorneys fees and litigation expense directly from the NLRB or OSHA, \nregardless of whether those agencies' decision to pursue the case was \n``substantially justified'' or ``special circumstances'' make an award \nof attorneys fees unjust. Thus, the Congressional intent behind the \nbroadly supported, bi-partisan ``Equal Access to Justice Act'' \n(``EAJA'') to ``level the playing field'' for small businesses will \nfinally be realized.\n  The ``FAIR Act'' is solid legislation; it is a common sense attempt \nto give small businesses the means to defend themselves against unfair \nactions. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues for their cooperation and \nassistance as I work to ensure that the ``FAIR Act'' is enacted into \nlaw.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Levin, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. \n        Thurmond):\n  S. 1159. A bill to provide grants and contracts to local educational \nagencies to initiate, expand, and improve physical education programs \nfor all kindergarten through 12th grade students; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  physical education for progress act\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I send to the desk and introduce \nthe Physical Education for Progress--or ``PEP''--Act. My bill would \nprovide incentive grants for local school districts to develop minimum \nweekly requirements for physical education, and daily physical \neducation if possible.\n  Every student in our Nation's schools, from kindergarten through \ngrade 12, should have the opportunity to participate in quality \nphysical education. Children need to know that physical activity can \nhelp them feel good, be successful in school and work, and stay \nhealthy.\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\n  Engaging in sports activities provides lessons about teamwork and \ndealing with defeat. In my judgment, physical activity and sports are \nan important educational tool, and the lessons of sports may help \nresolve some of the problems that lead to violence in schools.\n  Regular physical activity produces short-term health benefits and \nreduces long-term risks for chronic disease, disability and premature \ndeath. Despite the proven benefits of being physically active, more \nthan 60 percent of American adults do not engage in levels of physical \nactivity necessary to provide health benefits.\n  More than a third of young people in our country aged 12 to 21 years \ndo not regularly engage in vigorous physical activity, and the \npercentage of overweight young Americans has more than doubled in the \npast 30 years. Daily participation in high school physical education \nclasses dropped from 42 percent in 1991 to 27 percent in 1997. Right \nnow, only one state in our union--Illinois--currently requires daily \nphysical education for grades K through 12. I think that is a \nstaggering statistic. Only one State requires daily physical education \nfor our children.\n  The impact of our poor health habits is staggering: obesity-related \ndiseases now cost the Nation more than $100 billion per year, and \ninactivity and poor diet cause more than 300,000 deaths per year in the \nUnited States.\n  We know from the Centers for Disease Control and others that lifelong \nhealth-related habits, including physical activity and eating patterns, \nare often established in childhood. Because ingrained behaviors are \ndifficult to change as people grow older, we need to reach out to young \npeople early, before health-damaging behaviors are adopted.\n  To me, schools provide an ideal opportunity to make an enormous, \npositive impact on the health of our Nation. The PEP Act, to me, is an \nimportant step toward improving the health of our Nation. The PEP Act \nwould help schools get regular physical activity back into their \nprograms. We can, and should, help our youth establish solid health \nhabits at an early age.\n  The incentive grants provided for by my bill could be used to provide \nphysical education equipment and support to students, to enhance \nphysical education curricula, and to train and educate physical \neducation teachers.\n  The future cost savings in health care for emphasizing the importance \nof physical activity to a long and healthy life, to me, are immense.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1160. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986 to \nprovide marriage penalty relief, incentives to encourage health \ncoverage, and increased child care assistance, to extend certain \nexpiring tax provisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n              tax relief for working americans act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am being joined by Senator \nFeinstein in introducing the ``Tax Relief for Working Americans Act of \n1999''. Congresswoman Nancy Johnson is introducing companion \nlegislation in the House. We're here today to declare victory in the \ndebate over whether or not we should have significant tax relief for \nthe American people. The President and most congressional Democrats \nhave now joined Republicans in support of cutting taxes. The question \nnow is not whether there should be tax cuts, but what kind, and how \nmuch. I can't think of a better problem to have.\n\n  With our core tax cut plan, we're proposing a major first step in \nsending hard-earned dollars out of Washington and back to the taxpayer. \nI support an across the board tax cut. But, I'm afraid that if we do \nthat first, we won't have any money left over to pay for tax cuts that \npeople are telling me they really want, like addressing the marriage \npenalty, providing health care tax relief, and more help for education. \nThey want these problems in the tax code fixed first. An across the \nboard cut won't fix these problems, it'll only compound them. That \nisn't fair. And we're saying fairness should come first.\n  The President only offered modest tax cuts, along with a new \nretirement savings proposal that nobody understands, and many question \nwhether it will work. And then, he wants to raise other taxes to pay \nfor it. The President wants it both ways. He wants to be able to take \ncredit for a tax cut on the one hand, while he's raising taxes on the \nother. We deserve what we get, if we let him get away with the double \ntalk we all know so well.\n  We have two alternatives. One is to push for an across the board tax \ncut first, and let the President and some in Congress play the class \nwarfare card they play so well. And in the end, we probably end up with \nno tax relief. Senator Feinstein and I are saying that we should take \nthe initiative and push for major tax relief that people really want \nand both Republicans and Democrats support. Our package will provide \nclose to $300 billion in tax relief over ten years. I, for one, view \nthis as a very strong starting point in determining how the coming on-\nbudget surplus will be used.\n  Among other things, our bill will provide tax relief for senior \ncitizens, those who are married, those who need to buy their own health \ninsurance, and those who purchase long-term care insurance. Moreover, \nit will include provisions to ensure that parents who make use of \neducation or child care tax credits are not hurt by the Alternative \nMinimum Tax. We also hope to improve the living standards of Americans \nthrough tax relief for urban revitalization, rural preservation, rental \nhousing, and economic growth. We also provide needed tax assistance to \nfarmers by shielding them from the Alternative Minimum Tax, and \nallowing them to set up special tax-deferred savings accounts to help \nthem weather the ups and downs of farming. And, we help improve the \nenvironment by extending the production tax credit for wind energy and \nexpanding the credit for biomass. I've strongly supported both of these \nalternative energies since taking the lead on them back in 1992.\n  We think this package is a good start in the process of delivering \ntax relief to the American people, and I urge my colleagues to join us \nin this effort.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise, along with my colleague from \nIowa, to introduce the Tax Relief for Working Americans Act--what I \nconsider to be a ``fair share'' tax plan. This bill, while protecting \nour Social Security and Medicare needs, will also allow all Americans \nto benefit from our economic prosperity.\n  The American people are responsible for the more than $4 trillion in \nbudget surpluses over the next 15 years, so it makes sense to give them \nsome needed and deserved tax relief.\n  The Tax Relief for Working Americans Act is a sensible and moderate \nbill that provides needed tax relief for working families. It does so, \nmoreover, in a fiscally responsible manner which protects Social \nSecurity and Medicare. This tax plan is estimated to provide tax relief \nof $271 billion over ten years, fitting within the budget framework set \nout by the President to protect Social Security and Medicare.\n  The legislation will provide relief to 21 million working couples who \nincur the marriage penalty by increasing the standard deduction to put \nthem on equal footing with unmarried couples. A married couple in the \n28% bracket, for example, will save $392.\n  It includes tax incentives for the over 30 million Americans who \npurchase their own health insurance or who pay more than 50% of their \nemployer provided health care insurance. This means a family that earns \n$60,000 and pays $4,000 a year for health insurance will receive a tax \ncredit of $2,400.\n\n  And it will raise the Social Security Earnings test to $30,000, so \nthat the 1.1 million seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 who earn \nmore than $15,500 would be able to keep more of their hard earned \ndollars. For a 67 year old secretary who earns $30,000 a year this \nwould mean she will save nearly $5,000.\n  Under this legislation, millions of Americans who struggle to afford \ndecent child care, will receive increased benefits from the Dependent \nCare Tax Credit. The credit will increase from 30% to 50% by 2004 and \nmillions more will qualify for the maximum credit. When fully in \neffect, a family which earns $30,000 and spends $5,000 a year on child \ncare for their two children will receive a $2,400 tax credit which \nshould eliminate any federal tax liability.\n  This legislation will also help to expand our economy by making \npermanent the Research and Development tax credit. Research and \ndevelopment\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nis the backbone of our new technology driven economy. It is creating \nmillions of high wage, high skilled jobs. The R credit has been \nextended 9 times since 1981, but it has been allowed to expire 4 times \nduring that period. Now is the time to make it permanent.\n  There are also other important provisions in this legislation to \npromote long-term care, create more affordable housing, make education \nmore affordable, and to help our farmers.\n  I believe that this tax plan is one which can, and will, receive \nbroad bipartisan support. It is a tax plan which Congress can pass and \nthe President can sign. I urge my colleagues to work with the Senator \nfrom Iowa and myself, and to pass the Tax Relief for Working Americans \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Torricelli):\n  S. 1163. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nresearch and services with respect to lupus; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               lupus research and care amendments of 1999\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nLupus Research and Care Amendments of 1999. This legislation would \nauthorize additional funds for lupus research and grants for state and \nlocal governments to support the delivery of essential services to low-\nincome individuals with lupus and their families. The National \nInstitute of Health (NIH) spent about $42 million less than one half of \none percent of its budget on lupus research last year. I believe that \nwe need to increase the funds that are available for research of this \ndebilitating disease.\n\n  Lupus is not a well-known disease, nor is it well understood. Yet, at \nleast 1,400,000 Americans have been diagnosed with lupus and many more \nare either misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. More Americans have \nlupus than AIDS, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, sickle-cell anemia \nor cystic fibrosis. Lupus is a disease that attacks and weakens the \nimmune system and is often life-threatening. Lupus is nine times more \nlikely to affect women than men. African-American women are diagnosed \nwith lupus two to three times more often than Caucasian women. Lupus is \nalso more prevalent among certain minority groups including Latinos, \nNative Americans and Asians.\n  Because lupus is not well understood, it is difficult to diagnose, \nleading to uncertainty on the actual number of patients suffering from \nlupus. The symptoms of lupus make diagnosis difficult because they are \nsporadic and imitate the symptoms of many other illnesses. If diagnosed \nearly and with proper treatment, the majority of lupus cases can be \ncontrolled. Unfortunately, because of the difficulties in diagnosing \nlupus and inadequate research, many lupus patients suffer debilitating \npain and fatigue. The resulting effects make it difficult, if not \nimpossible, for individuals suffering from lupus to carry on normal \neveryday activities including the demands of a job. Thousands of these \ndebilitating cases needlessly end in death each year.\n  Title I of the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1999 authorizes \n$75 million in grants starting in fiscal year 2000 to be earmarked for \nlupus research at NIH. This new authorization would amount to less than \none half of one percent of NIH's total budget but would greatly enhance \nNIH's research.\n  Title II of the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1999 authorizes \n$40 million in grants to state and local governments as well as to \nnonprofit organizations starting in fiscal year 2000. These funds would \nsupport the delivery of essential services to low-income individuals \nwith lupus and their families. I would urge all my colleagues, Mr. \nPresident, to join Senator Murray, Senator Torricelli, Senator Schumer, \nand myself in sponsoring this legislation to increase funding to fight \nlupus.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Mack)\n  S. 1164. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify certain rules relating to the taxation of United States \nbusiness operating abroad, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n international tax simplification for american competitiveness act of \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleagues \nSenators Baucus and Mack to introduce the International Tax \nSimplification for American Competitiveness Act of 1999. This bill will \nprovide much-needed tax relief from complex and inconsistent tax laws \nthat burden our American-owned companies attempting to complete in the \nworld marketplace.\n  Our foreign tax code is in desperate need of reform and \nsimplification. The rules in this arena are way too complex and, often, \ntheir results are perverse.\n  Mr. President, the American economy has experienced significant \ngrowth and prosperity. That success, however, is becoming more and more \nintertwined with the success of our business in the global marketplace. \nThis has become even more obvious during the recent financial distress \nin Asia and Latin America. Yet, most people still do not realize the \nimportant contributions to our economy from U.S. companies with global \noperations. We have seen the share of U.S. corporate profits attributed \nto foreign operations rise from 7.5 percent in the 1960's to 17.7 \npercent in the 1990's.\n  As technology blurs traditional boundaries, and as competition \ncontinues to increase from previously lesser-developed nations, it is \nimperative that American-owned businesses be able to compete \neffectively.\n  It seems to me that any rule, regulation, requirement, or tax that we \ncan alleviate to enhance competitiveness will inure to the benefit of \nAmerican companies, their employees, and shareholders.\n  There are many barriers that the U.S. economy must overcome in order \nto remain competitive that Congress cannot hurdle by itself. For \nexample, we have international trade negotiators working hard to remove \nthe barriers to foreign markets that discourage and hamper U.S. trade. \nIt is ironic, therefore, that one of the largest trade barriers is \nimposed by our own tax code on American companies operating abroad. \nMake no mistake: the complexities and inconsistencies in this section \nof the Tax Code have an appreciable adverse effect on our domestic \neconomy.\n  The failure to deal with the barriers in our own backyard will serve \nonly to drive more American companies to other countries with simple, \nmore favorable tax treatment. We just saw this occur with the merger of \nDaimler Benz and Chrysler. The new corporation will be headquartered in \nGermany due to the complex international laws of the United States.\n  The business world is changing at an increasingly rapid pace. Tax \nlaws have failed to keep pace with the rapid changes in the world \ntechnology and economy. Too many of the international provisions in the \nInternal Revenue Code have not been substantially debated and revised \nin over a decade. Since that time, existing international markets have \nchanged significantly, and we have seen new markets created. The U.S. \nTax Code needs to adapt to the changing times as well. Our current \nconfusing and archaic tax code is woefully out of step with commercial \nrealities as we approach the 21st century.\n  U.S. businesses frequently find themselves at a competitive \ndisadvantage to their foreign competitors due to the high taxes and \nstiff regulations they often face. A U.S. company selling products \nabroad is often charged a higher tax rate by our own government, than a \nforeign company is. For example, when Kodak sells film in the U.K. or \nGermany, they pay higher taxes than their foreign competitor Fuji does \nfor those same sales.\n  If we close American companies out of the international arena due to \ncomplex and burdensome tax rules on exports and foreign production, \nthen we are denying them the ability to compete. Dooming them, and \nourselves, to anemic economic growth and all its adverse subsidiary \neffects.\n  The bill we are introducing today is not a comprehensive solution, \nneither is it a set of bold new initiatives. Instead, this bill \ncontains a set of important intermediate steps which will take us a \nlong way toward simplifying the rules and making some sense of the \ninternational tax regime. The bill contains provisions to simplify and \nupdate the tax treatment of controlled foreign corporations, fix some \nof the rules relating to the foreign tax credit, and\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\nmake other changes to international tax law.\n  Some of these changes are in areas that are in dire need of repair, \nand others are changes that take into consideration the changes we have \nseen in international business practices and environments during the \nlast decade.\n  One example of the need for updating our laws is the financial \nservices industry. This industry has seen rapid technological and \nglobal changes that have transformed the very nature of the way these \ncorporations do business both here and abroad. This bill contains \nseveral provisions to help adapt the foreign tax regime to keep up with \nthese changes.\n  In the debate about the globalization of our economy, we absolutely \ncannot forget the taxation of foreign companies with U.S. operations \nand subsidiaries. These companies are an important part of our growing \neconomy. They employ 4.9 million American workers. In my home state of \nUtah, employees at U.S. subsidiaries constitute 3.6 percent of the work \nforce. We must ensure that U.S. tax law is written and fairly enforced \nfor all companies in the United States.\n  This bill is not the end of the international tax debate. If we were \nto pass every provision it contains, we would still not have a simple \nTax Code. We would need to make more reforms yet. We cannot limit this \ndebate to only the intermediate changes such as those in this bill. We \nmust not lose sight of the long term. I intend to urge broader debate \nabout other areas in need of reform such as interest allocation, issues \nraised by the European Union, and subpart F itself. I believe that we \nmust address these concerns in the next five years if we are to put \nU.S. corporations and the U.S. economy in a position to maintain \neconomic position in the global economy of tomorrow.\n  This bill is important to the future of every American citizen. \nWithout these changes, American businesses will see their ability to \ncompete diminished, and the United States will have an uphill battle to \nremain the preeminent economic force in a changing world. This modest, \nbut important package of international tax reforms will help to keep \nour businesses and our economy competitive and a driving force in the \nworld economic picture. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the text of the bill \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe limitation on the amount of receipts attributable to military \nproperty which may be treated as exempt foreign trade income; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              defense jobs and trade promotion act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Defense Jobs and \nTrade Promotion Act of 1999. This bill, cosponsored by Senator \nFeinstein and 16 of our colleagues, will eliminate a provision of tax \nlaw which discriminates against United States exporters of defense \nproducts.\n  Other nations have systems of taxation which rely less on corporate \nincome taxes and more on value-added taxes. By rebating the value-added \ntaxes for products that are exported, these nations lower the costs of \ntheir exports and provide their companies a competitive advantage that \nis not based on quality, ingenuity, or resources but rather on tax \npolicy.\n  In an attempt to level the playing field, our tax code allows U.S. \ncompanies to establish Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) through which \nU.S.-manufactured products may be exported. A portion of the profits \nfrom FSC sales are exempted from corporate income taxes, to mitigate \nthe advantage that other countries give their exporters through value-\nadded tax rebates.\n  But the tax benefits of a FSC are cut in half for defense exporters. \nThis 50% limitation is the result of a compromise enacted 23 years ago \nas part of\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\nthe predecessor to the FSC provisions. This compromise was not based on \npolicy considerations, but instead merely split the difference between \nmembers who believed that the U.S. defense industry was so dominant in \nworld markets that the foreign tax advantages were inconsequential, and \nmembers who believed that all U.S. exporters should be treated equally.\n  Today, U.S. defense manufacturers face intense competition from \nforeign businesses. With the sharp decline in the defense budget over \nthe past decade, exports of defense products play a prominent role in \nmaintaining a viable U.S. defense industrial base. It makes no sense to \nallow differences in international tax systems to stand as an obstacle \nto exports of U.S. defense products. We must level the international \nplaying field for U.S. defense product manufacturers.\n  The fifty percent exclusion for sales of defense products makes even \nless sense when one considers that the sale of every defense product to \na foreign government requires the determination of both the President \nand the Congress that the sale will strengthen the security of the \nUnited States and promote world peace. This is more than a matter of \nfair treatment for all U.S. exporters. National security is enhanced \nwhen our allies use U.S.-manufactured military equipment, because of \nits compatibility with equipment used by our armed forces.\n  The Department of Defense supports repeal of this provision. In an \nAugust 26, 1998 letter, Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre wrote \nTreasury Secretary Rubin about the FSC. Hamre wrote, ``The Department \nof Defense (DoD) supports extending the full benefits of the FSC \nexemption to defense exporters * * * [P]utting defense and non-defense \ncompanies on the same footing would encourage defense exports that \nwould promote standardization and interoperability of equipment among \nour allies. It also could result in a decrease in the cost of defense \nproducts to the Department of Defense.''\n  The bill we are introducing today supports the DoD recommendation. It \nrepeals the provision of the Foreign Sales Corporation laws that \ndiscriminates against U.S. defense product manufacturers, enhancing \nboth the competitiveness of U.S. companies in world markets and our \nnational security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthat natural gas gathering lines are 7-year property for purposes of \ndepreciation; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 natural gas classification legislation\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I have introduced legislation to \nclarify the proper depreciation of natural gas gathering lines. While \ndepreciation is an arcane and technical area of the tax laws, continued \nuncertainty regarding the proper depreciation of these assets is having \nreal and adverse impacts on members of the natural gas industry.\n  The purpose of this bill is quite simple--to clarify that natural gas \ngathering lines are assets that are properly depreciated over seven \nyears. The legislation would codify the seven-year treatment of these \nassets as well as providing a sufficient definition for the term \n``natural gas gathering line'' to distinguish these lines from \ntransmission pipelines for depreciation purposes.\n  I believe that these assets should currently be depreciated over \nseven years under existing law, and that this is the long standing \npractice of members of the industry. However, it has come to my \nattention that the Internal Revenue Service has been asserting both on \naudits and in litigation that seven-year depreciation is available only \nfor gathering assets owned by producers. The IRS has asserted that all \nother gathering equipment is to be depreciated as transmission \npipelines over a fifteen-year period. This confounding position ignores \nnot only the plain language of the asset class guidelines governing \ndepreciation, but would result in disparate treatment of the same \nassets based upon ownership for no discernible policy reason. Moreover, \nthis position ignores the fundamental distinction between gathering and \ntransmission of natural gas long enshrined in energy regulation and \nrecognized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as well as other \nstate and federal regulatory bodies.\n  Nonetheless, the IRS' position on this issue has resulted in the past \nin a division of authority among the lower courts. Although the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit recently held that the \nseven-year cost recovery period was properly applied to natural gas \ngathering systems under existing law, this legislation is needed to \nprovide certainty and uniformity regarding the proper depreciation of \nthese assets throughout the country. With extensive gathering systems \ntotaling many thousands of miles, we cannot afford to allow the proper \ndepreciation of these substantial investments to remain subjects of \ndispute. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in securing the adoption \nof this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1168. A bill to eliminate the social security earnings test for \nindividuals who have attained retirement age, to protect and preserve \nthe social security trust funds, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                protect social security now legislation\n\n  Mr. McCAIN: Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nwhich will give older Americans the freedom to work and protect the \nSocial Security system by taking it off budget, putting it in the \nblack, and keeping it out of the hands of politicians. Our seniors and \nall working Americans deserve nothing less.\n  The promise of Social Security is sacred and must not be broken. \nMillions of Americans count on Social Security to provide the bulk of \ntheir retirement income, because that is what the system has promised \nthem. Allowing the federal government to continue spending the tax \ndollars in the Social Security Trust Fund on more government threatens \nthe financial security of our nation's retirement system.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will finally stop the \ngovernment from stealing money from Social Security. It will lock up \nthe Trust Fund and shore it up with the excess taxes collected by the \nfederal government. It will guarantee that today's seniors who have \nworked and invested in the Social Security system will receive the \nbenefits they were promised, without placing an unfair burden on \ntoday's workers.\n  The legislation does three simple, but very important things.\n  First, it repeals the burdensome and unfair Social Security earnings \ntest that penalizes Americans between the ages of 65 and 70 for working \nand remaining productive after retirement. Under the current law, a \nsenior citizen loses $1 of Social Security benefits for every $3 earned \nover the established limit, which is $15,500 in 1999.\n  Because of this cap on earnings, our senior citizens are burdened \nwith a 33.3 percent tax on their Social Security benefits. When this is \ncombined with Federal, State, local and other Social Security taxes on \nearned income, it amounts to an outrageous 55 to 65 percent tax bite on \ntheir total income, and sometimes it can be even higher. An individual \nwho is struggling to make ends meet by holding a job where they earn \njust $15,500 a year should not be faced with an effective marginal tax \nrate which exceeds 55 percent.\n  What is most disturbing about the earnings test is the tremendous \nburden it places upon low-income senior citizens. Many older Americans \nneed to\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\nwork in order to cover their basic expenses: food, housing and health \ncare. These lower-income seniors are hit hardest by the earnings test, \nwhile most wealthy seniors escape unscathed. This is because \nsupplemental ``unearned'' income from stocks, investments and savings \nis not affected by the earnings test.\n  For too long, many have given lip service to eliminating the earnings \ntest, but to no avail. It is time that we finally eliminate this \nridiculous policy. In his State of the Union speech, President Clinton \nindicated that he may finally be ready to repeal the unfair Social \nSecurity earnings test, as originally promised during his 1992 \ncampaign. However, the President did not include repeal of the earnings \ntest in his budget proposal for 2000.\n  Hard-working senior citizens who need to work to help pay for their \nfood, rent, prescription drugs, and daily living expenses are tired of \nempty promises. They are tired of being penalized for working. \nRepealing the unfair earnings test, as proposed in this legislation, is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Seond, the bill protects the money in the Social Security Trust Funds \nby taking Social Security ``off budget'' and keeping this money out of \nthe hands of politicians. This provision is similar to other ``lock \nbox'' proposals, except that it eliminates all the loopholes and \nexceptions, and truly locks up the money.\n  I support and applaud the efforts of my Republican colleagues to move \nforward on the Social Security Lock Box legislation that has been \ndelayed by members of the other party. However, I am concerned that it \ncontains loopholes which would allow Social Security funds to be spent \non items other than retirement benefits for seniors. It includes \nexceptions for emergencies, including economic recession, and allows \nthe surpluses to be used to reduce the public debt. While I understand \nthe intent of these provisions, I believe that we must stop making \nexceptions and lock up Social Security funds for Social Security \npurposes only.\n  For too long, Social Security funds have been used to pay for \nexisting federal programs, create new government programs, and to mask \nour nation's deficit. We must stop using Social Security to fund \ngeneral government activities. We must save Social Security to pay \nretirement benefits to hard-working Americans, as promised in the law.\n  The legislation I am introducing puts the Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses safely away in a ``lock box'' without holes, so that neither \nwe nor our successors can spend the people's retirement money on \nanything other than their retirement.\n  Finally, the legislation requires that 62 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity budget surpluses from fiscal year 2001 through 2009 be \ntransferred into the Social Security Trust Funds to strengthen and \nextend the solvency of the system. This amounts to $514 billion, based \non current estimates of the non-Social Security surplus, which would \nshore up the system and ensure the availability of benefits for today's \nseniors and those working and paying into the system today.\n  Locking up the Social Security Trust Fund and shoring up the fund \nwith $514 billion in new money will extend the solvency of the system \nuntil about 2057, more than 20 years beyond the date when the system is \ncurrently expected to be bankrupt. This bill will provide senior \ncitizens with the peace of mind that their Social Security checks will \ncontinue arriving each and every month. It will provide time for the \nAdministration, the Congress, and the American people to develop and \nagree upon a structural reform plan which will save Social Security for \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. President, I would like to note that the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare has reviewed this legislation and \nhas provided a letter in support of it that I would like to insert in \nthe Record at this point.\n  Mr. President, this is legislation that will truly preserve and \nprotect Social Security for the future, and it will remove the unfair \ntax on working seniors. I urge my colleagues to support the bill and I \nintend to work for its passage this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1168\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n         TITLE I--ELIMINATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY EARNINGS TEST\n\n     SEC. 101.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DEDICATING ADDITIONAL \n                   SURPLUS AMOUNTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate if the budget surplus in \n     future years is greater than the currently projected surplus, \n     serious consideration should be given to directing more of \n     the surplus to strengthening the social security trust funds.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the approximately five \n     million members and supporters of the National Committee, I \n     commend your leadership on the issue of protecting the Social \n     Security trust funds and eliminating the Social Security \n     earnings test.\n       The National Committee's members earnestly believe in the \n     future of the Social Security system and its critical \n     importance to America's hard working families.\n       Your legislation would not only safe-guard the Social \n     Security surpluses and reaffirm Social Security's off-budget \n     status, but would also strengthen the program's solvency by \n     committing 62 percent of projected off-budget surpluses to \n     Social Security. Using the off-budget surpluses to fortify \n     Social Security is fiscally responsible and will help our \n     nation better meet the challenge of the baby-boom \n     generation's retirement.\n       We also commend you for your long commitment to eliminating \n     the earnings test for individuals who have reached normal \n     retirement age. Encouraging seniors to remain in the work \n     force as long as they are willing and able to work \n     strengthens their ability to remain financially independent \n     throughout their retirement years.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Max Richtman,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1169. A bill to require that certain multilateral development \nbanks and other lending institutions implement independent third party \nprocurement monitoring, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n              competition in foreign commerce act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I along with Senators Cochran and Burns \nare proud to introduce the Fair Competition in Foreign Commerce Act of \n1999, to address the serious problem of waste, fraud and abuse \nresulting from bribery and corruption in international development \nprojects. This legislation will set conditions for U.S. funding through \nmultilateral development banks. These conditions will require the \ncountry receiving aid to adopt substantive procurement reforms and \nindependent third-party procurement monitoring of their international \ndevelopment projects.\n  During the cold war, banks and governments often looked the other way \nas pro-western leaders in developing countries treated national \ntreasuries as their personal treasury troves. Today, we cannot afford \nto look the other way when we see bribery and corruption running \nrampant in other countries because these practices undermine our goals \nof promoting democracy and accountability, fostering economic \ndevelopment and trade liberalization, and achieving a level playing \nfield throughout the world for American businesses.\n  The United States is increasingly called upon to lead multilateral \nefforts to provide much-needed economic assistance to developing \nnations. The American taxpayers make substantial contributions to the \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nInternational Development Association, the International Finance \nCorporation, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International \nMonetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American \nInvestment Corporation, the North American Development Bank, and the \nAfrican Development Fund.\n  However, it is critical that we take steps to ensure that Americans' \nhard-earned tax dollars are being used appropriately. The Fair \nCompetition in Foreign Commerce Act of 1999 is designed to decrease the \nstifling effects of bribery and corruption in international development \ncontracts. By doing so, we will (1) enable U.S. businesses to become \nmore competitive when bidding against foreign firms which secure \ngovernment contracts through bribery and corruption; (2) encourage \nadditional direct investment to developing nations, thus increasing\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\ntheir economic growth, and (3) increase opportunities for U.S. \nbusinesses to export to these nations as their economies expand and \nmature.\n  Multilateral lending efforts are only effective in spurring economic \ndevelopment if the funds are used to further the intended development \nprojects, not to line the pockets of foreign bureaucrats and their \nwell-connected political allies.\n  When used for its intended purpose, foreign aid yields both short- \nand long-term benefits to U.S. businesses. Direct foreign aid assists \ndeveloping nations to develop their infrastructure. A developed \ninfrastructure is vital to creating and sustaining a modern dynamic \neconomy. Robust new economies create new markets to which U.S. \nbusinesses can export their goods and services. Exports are key to the \nU.S. role in the constantly expanding and increasingly competitive \nglobal economy.\n  The current laws and procedures designed to detect and deter \ncorruption after the fact are inadequate and meaningless. This bill \nseeks to ensure that U.S. taxpayers' hard-earned dollars contributed to \ninternational projects are used appropriately, by detecting and \neliminating bribery and corruption before they can taint the integrity \nof international projects. Past experience illustrates that it is \nineffective to attempt to reverse waste, fraud, and abuse in large-\nscale foreign infrastructure projects, once the abuse has already \nbegun. Therefore, it is vital to detect the abuses before they occur.\n  The Fair Competition in Foreign Commerce Act of 1999 requires the \nUnited States Government, through its participation in multilateral \nlending institutions and in its disbursement of non-humanitarian \nforeign assistance funds, to: (1) require the recipient international \nfinancial institution to adopt an anti-corruption plan that requires \nthe aid recipient to use independent third-party procurement monitoring \nservices, at each stage of the procurement process to ensure openness \nand transparency in government procurements, and (2) require the \nrecipient nation to institute specific strategies for minimizing \ncorruption and maximizing transparency in procurements at each stage of \nthe procurement process. The legislation directs the Secretary of the \nTreasury to instruct the United States Executive Directors of the \nvarious international institutions to use the voice and vote of the \nUnited States to prevent the lending institution from providing funds \nto nations which do not satisfy the procurement reforms criteria.\n  This Act has two important exceptions. First, it does not apply to \nassistance to meet urgent humanitarian needs such as providing food, \nmedicine, disaster, and refugee relief. Second, it also permits the \nPresident to waive the funding restrictions with respect to a \nparticular country, if making such funds available is important to the \nnational security interest of the United States.\n  Independent third-party procurement monitoring is a system where an \nuninvolved entity conducts a program to eliminate bias, to promote \ntransparency and open competition, and to minimize fraud and \ncorruption, waste and inefficiency and other misuse of funds in \ninternational procurements. The system does this through an independent \nevaluation of the technical, financial, economic and legal aspects of \neach stage of a procurement, from the development and issuance of \ntechnical specifications, bidding documents, evaluation reports and \ncontract preparation, to the delivery of goods and services. This \nmonitoring takes place throughout the entire term of the international \ndevelopment project.\n  Mr. President, this system has worked for other governments. \nProcurement reforms and third-party procurement monitoring resulted in \nthe governments of Kenya, Uganda, Colombia, and Guatemala experiencing \nsignificant cost savings in recent procurements. For instance, the \nGovernment of Guatemala experienced an overall savings of 48% when it \nadopted a third-party procurement monitoring system and other \nprocurement reform measures in a recent contract for pharmaceuticals.\n  Mr. President, bribery and corruption have many victims. Bribery and \ncorruption hamper vital U.S. interests. Both harm consumers, taxpayers, \nand honest traders who lose contracts, production, and profits because \nthey refuse to offer bribes to secure foreign contracts.\n  Bribery and corruption have become a serious problem. A World Bank \nsurvey of 3,600 firms in 69 countries showed 40% of businesses paying \nbribes. More startling is that Germany still permits its companies to \ntake a tax deduction for bribes. Commerce Secretary Daley summed up the \nserious impact of bribery and corruption upon American businesses \nability to compete for foreign contracts in 1997:\n\n       Since mid-1994, foreign firms have used bribery to win \n     approximately 180 commercial contracts valued at nearly $80 \n     billion. We estimate that over the past year, American \n     companies have lost at least 50 of these contracts, valued at \n     $15 billion. And since many of these contracts were for \n     groundbreaking projects--the kind that produce exports for \n     years to come--the ultimate cost could be much higher.\n\n  Since then American companies have continued to lose international \ndevelopment contracts because of unfair competition from businesses \npaying bribes. This terrible trend must be brought to a halt.\n  Exports will continue to play an increasing role in our economic \nexpansion. We can ill afford to allow any artificial impediments to our \nability to export. Bribery and corruption significantly hinder American \nbusinesses' ability to compete for lucrative overseas government \ncontracts. American businesses are simply not competitive when bidding \nagainst foreign firms that have bribed government officials to secure \noverseas government contracts. Openness and fairness in government \ncontracts will greatly enhance opportunities to compete in the rapidly \nexpanding global economy. Exports equate to jobs. Jobs equate to more \nmoney in hard-working Americans' pockets. More money in Americans' \npockets means more money for Americans to save and invest in their \nfutures.\n  Bribery and corruption also harm the country receiving the aid \nbecause bribery and corruption often inflate the cost of international \ndevelopment projects. For example, state sponsorship of massive \ninfrastructure projects that are deliberately beyond the required \nspecification needed to meet the objective is a common example of the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse inherent in corrupt procurement practices. \nHere, the cost of corruption is not the amount of the bribe itself, but \nthe inefficient use of resources that the bribes encourage.\n\n  Bribery and corruption drive up costs. Companies are forced to \nincrease prices to cover the cost of bribes they are forced to pay. A \n2% bribe on a contract can raise costs by 15%. Over time, tax revenues \nwill have to be raised or diverted from other more deserving projects \nto fund these excesses. Higher taxes and the inefficient use of \nresources both hinder growth.\n  The World Bank and the IMF both recognize the link between bribery \nand corruption, and decreased economic growth. Recent studies also \nindicate that high levels of corruption are associated with low levels \nof investment and growth. Furthermore, corruption lessens the \neffectiveness of industrial policies and encourages businesses to \noperate in the unofficial sector in violation of tax and regulatory \nlaws. More important, corruption breeds corruption and discourages \nlegitimate investment. In short, bribery and corruption create a \n``lose-lose'' situation for the U.S. and developing nations.\n  The U.S. recognizes the damaging effects bribery and corruption have \nat home and abroad. The U.S. continues to combat foreign corruption, \nwaste, and abuse on many fronts--from prohibiting U.S. firms from \nbribing foreign officials, to leading the anti-corruption efforts in \nthe United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (``OECD''). The \nU.S. was the first country to enact legislation (the Foreign Corrupt \nPractices Act) to prohibit its nationals and corporations from bribing \nforeign public officials in international and business transactions.\n  However, we must do more. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prevents \nU.S. nationals and corporations from bribing foreign officials, but \ndoes nothing to prevent foreign nationals and corporations from bribing \nforeign officials to obtain foreign contracts. Valuable resources are \noften diverted or squandered because of corrupt officials or the use of \nnon-transparent specifications, contract requirements and the\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\nlike in international procurements for goods and services. Such corrupt \npractices also minimize competition and prevent the recipient nation or \nagency from receiving the full value of the goods and services for \nwhich it bargained. In addition, despite the importance of \ninternational markets to U.S. goods and service providers, many U.S. \ncompanies refuse to participate in international procurements that may \nbe corrupt.\n  This legislation is designed to provide a mechanism to ensure, to the \nextent possible, the integrity of U.S. contributions to multilateral \nlending institutions and other non-humanitarian U.S. foreign aid. \nCorrupt international procurements, often funded by these multilateral \nbanks, weaken democratic institutions and undermine the very \nopportunities that multilateral lending institutions were founded to \npromote. This will encourage and support the development of transparent \ngovernment procurement systems, which are vital for emerging \ndemocracies constructing the infrastructure that can sustain market \neconomies.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of Americans who will \nbenefit from increased opportunities for U.S. businesses to participate \nin the global economy, and the billions of people in developing nations \nthroughout the world who are desperate for economic assistance, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation and demonstrate their \ncontinued commitment to the orderly evolution of the global economy and \nthe efficient use of American economic assistance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1169\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) The United States makes substantial contributions and \n     provides significant funding for major international \n     development projects through the International Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development, the International Development \n     Association, the International Finance Corporation, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary \n     Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American \n     Investment Corporation, the North American Development Bank, \n     the African Development Fund, and other multilateral lending \n     institutions.\n       (2) These international development projects are often \n     plagued with fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, and \n     misuse of funding.\n       (3) Fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, misuse, and \n     abuse are major impediments to competition in foreign \n     commerce throughout the world.\n       (4) Identifying these impediments after they occur is \n     inadequate and meaningless.\n       (5) Detection of impediments before they occur helps to \n     ensure that valuable United States resources contributed to \n     important international development projects are used \n     appropriately.\n       (6) Independent third-party procurement monitoring is an \n     important tool for detecting and preventing such impediments.\n       (7) Third-party procurement monitoring includes evaluations \n     of each stage of the procurement process and assures the \n     openness and transparency of the process.\n       (8) Improving transparency and openness in the procurement \n     process helps to minimize fraud, corruption, waste, \n     inefficiency, and other misuse of funding, and promotes \n     competition, thereby strengthening international trade and \n     foreign commerce.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to build on the \n     excellent progress associated with the Organization on \n     Economic Development and Cooperation Agreement on Bribery and \n     Corruption, by requiring the use of independent third-party \n     procurement monitoring as part of the United States \n     participation in multilateral development banks and other \n     lending institutions and in the disbursement of \n     nonhumanitarian foreign assistance funds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The continuing gap between \nAmerican students and those in other countries, combined with the \ngrowing needs of working and the growing popularity of extending both\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\nthe school day and the school year, have made this educational option a \nvaluable one for many school districts.\n  Students in the United States currently attend school an average of \nonly 180 days per year, compared to 220 days in Japan, and 222 days in \nboth Korea and Taiwan. American students also receive fewer hours of \nformal instruction per year compared to their counterparts in Taiwan, \nFrance, and Germany. We cannot expect our students to remain \ncompetitive with those in other industrialized countries if they must \nlearn the same amount of information in less time.\n  Our school calendar is based on a no longer relevant agricultural \ncycle that existed when most American families lived in rural areas and \ndepended on their farms for survival. The long summer vacation allowed \nchildren to help their parents work in the fields. Today, summer is a \ntime for vacations, summer camps, and part-time jobs. Young people can \ncertainly learn a great deal at summer camp, and a job gives them \nmaturity and confidence. However, more time in school would provide the \nsame opportunities while helping students remain competitive with those \nin other countries. As we debate the need to bring in skilled workers \nfrom other countries, the need to improve our system of education has \nbecome increasingly important.\n  In 1994, the Commission on Time and Learning recommended keeping \nschools open longer in order to meet the needs of both children and \ncommunities, and the growing popularity of extended-day programs is \nsignificant. Between 1987 and 1993, the availability of extended-day \nprograms in public elementary schools has almost doubled. While school \nsystems have begun to respond to the demand for lengthening the school \nday, the need for more widespread implementation still exists. \nExtended-day programs are much more common in private schools than \npublic schools, and only 18 percent of rural schools have reported an \nextended-day program.\n  This bill would authorize $25 million per year over the next five \nyears for the Department of Education to administer a demonstration \ngrant program. Local education agencies would then be able to conduct a \nvariety of longer school day and school year programs, such as \nextending the school year, studying the feasibility of extending the \nschool day, and implementing strategies to maximize the quality of \nextended core learning time.\n  The constant changes in technology, and greater international \ncompetition, have increased the pressure on American students to meet \nthese challenges. Providing the funding for programs to lengthen the \nschool day and school year would leave American students better \nprepared to meet the challenges facing them in the next \ncentury.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Helms, Mr. Lott, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Craig, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \n        Reid):\n  S. 1171. A bill to block assets of narcotics traffickers who pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n          legislation to block assets of narcotics traffickers\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleague from California, Senator Feinstein, in introducing \nlegislation that will intensify our fight against the terrible scourge \nof drugs. A version of this bill was originally introduced on March 2. \nSince then, we have conferred with various agencies, including the \nDepartment of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the \nDepartment of Justice, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy. \nAll are supportive of this concept. The current bill includes some of \ntheir comments and suggestions.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, this legislation decertifies the drug \nkingpins by preventing them, and any of their associates or associated \ncampanies, from conducting business with the United States. The bill \ncodifies and expands a 1995 Executive Order created under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which targeted \nColombia drug traffickers. The bill expands the existing Executive \nOrder to include other foreign drug traffickers considered a threat to \nour national security. The bill freezes the assets of the identified \ndrug traffickers and their associates and prohibits these individuals \nand organizations from conducting any financial or commercial dealings \nwith the United States.\n  In the case of the Cali cartel in Colombia, this tool was remarkably \neffective in weakening the drug kingpins. The United States targeted \nover 150 companies and nearly 300 individuals involved in the ownership \nand management of the Colombian drug cartels' non-narcotics business \nempire, everything from drugstores to poultry farms. Once labeled as \ndrug-linked businesses, these companies found themselves financially \nisolated. Banks and legitimate companies chose not to do business with \nthe blacklisted firms, cutting off key revenue flows to the cartels.\n  The goal is to isolate the leaders of the drug cartels and prevent \nthem from doing business with the United States. Taking legitimate U.S. \ndollars out of drug dealers' pockets is a vital step in destroying \ntheir ability to traffick narcotics across our borders. This is a bold \nbut necessary new tool to wage war against illegal drugs and to curb \nthe increasing power of the drug cartels.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 1173. A bill to provide for a teacher quality enhancement and \nincentive program; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n               teacher quality enhancement incentive act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nTeacher Quality Enhancement and Incentive Act. I rise to focus the \nnation's attention on the potentially critical shortage of school \nteachers we will be facing in upcoming years. While K-12 enrollments \nare steadily increasing the teacher population is aging. There is a \nneed, now more than ever, to attract competent, capable, and bright \ncollege graduates or mid-career professionals to the teaching \nprofession.\n  The Department of Education projects that 2 million new teachers will \nhave to be hired in the next decade. Shortage, if they occur, will most \nlikely be felt in urban or rural regions of the country where working \nconditions may be difficult or compensation low. We cannot create a \nhigh quality learning environment for our students if they are forced \ninto over-crowded classrooms with under-qualified instructors. If our \nstudents are to receive a high quality education and remain competitive \nin the global market we must attract talented and motivated people to \nthe teaching profession in large numbers.\n  Law firms, technology firms, and many other industries typically \noffer signing bonuses in order to attract the best possible candidates \nto their organizations. Part of making the teaching profession \ncompetitive with the private sector is to match these institutional \nperks.\n  This bill would authorize $15 million per year over the next five \nyears for the Department of Education to award grants to local \neducational agencies (LEAs) for the purpose of attracting highly \nqualified individuals to teaching. These grants will enable LEAs in \nhigh poverty and rural areas to award new teachers a $15,000 tax free \nsalary bonus, spread over their first two years of employment, over and \nabove their regular starting salary. These bonuses will attract \nteachers to districts where they are most needed.\n  On an annual basis, LEAs will use competitive criteria to select the \nbest and brightest teaching candidates based on objective measures, \nincluding test scores, grade point average or class rank and such other \ncriteria as each LEA may determine. The number of bonuses awarded \ndepends upon the number of students enrolled in the LEA.\n  Teachers who receive the bonus will be required to teach in low \nincome or rural areas for a minimum of four years. If they fail to work \nthe four year minimum they will be required to repay the bonus they \nreceived.\n  By making this funding available. America's schools will better be \nable to compete with businesses for the best and brightest college \ngraduates. These new teachers will, in turn, produce better students \nand lower the risk of a possible teacher shortage. With arguably the \nmost successful economy of\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nany nation in history, we should be doing more to make teaching an \nattractive career alternative for qualified and motivated individuals. \nThe Teacher Quality Enhancement and Incentive Act will be an excellent \nfirst step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 1175. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require \nthat fuel economy labels for new automobiles include air pollution \ninformation that consumers can use to help communities meet Federal air \nquality standards; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n         Automobile Emissions Consumer Information Act of 1999\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill give consumers important information many will want to factor into \ntheir decisions when they shop for a new vehicle. My legislation will \nensure that consumers have the information they need to compare the \npollution emissions of new vehicles. The Automobile Emissions Consumer \nInformation Act of 1999 simply takes data already collected by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and requires that this information be \npresented to consumers in an understandable format as they purchase \ncars. This proposal, if enacted into law, will benefit both the \nconsumer and the environment.\n  This measure is modeled after existing requirements for gas mileage \ninformation. It ensures that emissions information will be on the \nwindow stickers of new cars just as fuel efficiency information is \ncurrently displayed. Additionally, emissions information for all new \nvehicles will be published by the EPA in an easy-to-understand booklet \nfor consumers.\n  This information is already collected by the EPA, but is disseminated \nin an extremely burdensome way. First, consumers must pro-actively \nrequest emissions information. Then, after securing the relevant EPA \ndocuments, the consumer is presented with an overload of complicated \ndata in spreadsheet form. Furthermore, the EPA organizes emissions data \nby engine type and not by the more commonly compared model and make \ncategories.\n  Let me refer to a page from the EPA's 1999 Annual Certification Test \nResults of emission standards. As my colleagues can see, it is an \nextraordinarily difficult document to read and interpret. The \ncomplicated nature of this document becomes increasingly apparent when \nthis table is compared with the simplified information currently \nprovided to consumers about fuel mileage. The federal government should \nbe aiding consumers who want to consider emissions in choosing which \nvehicle to purchase. This bill will do just that.\n  Mr. President, this is not a new idea. The Clean Air Act Amendments \nof 1970 mandated that the EPA make available to the public the data \ncollected from manufacturers on emissions. The 1970 Amendments further \nrequired, ``Such results shall be described in such nontechnical manner \nas  will responsibly disclose to prospective ultimate purchasers of new \nmotor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines the comparative \nperformance of the vehicles and engines tested.'' Mr. President, \nclearly, the EPA is not abiding by the letter and spirit of the 1970 \nlaw.\n\n  It is important to note that the Automobile Emissions Consumer \nInformation Act of 1999 does not require either motor vehicle \nmanufacturers or the EPA to conduct new tests. Manufacturers must \nalready test emissions of all new vehicles and submit the test results \nto the EPA. Unfortunately, the gathering of this information does not \ntranslate into useful information for consumers.\n  While all vehicles must meet the Federal standards, some vehicles \nexceed the standards. Consumers who are concerned about vehicle \nemissions deserve to be able to exercise their right to buy from \nmanufacturers who take extra steps in reducing emissions, if they so \nchose.\n  Representative Brian Bilbray of California is introducing this bill \nin the House of Representatives today. I greatly appreciate his \nleadership on this issue and his bringing this common-sense proposal to \nmy attention. He is clearly committed to protecting both consumers and \nthe environment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting the \nAutomobile Emissions Consumer Information Act, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that one page from the EPA's 1999 Annual Certification Test \nResults of emissions standards be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  CERTIFICATION AND FUEL ECONOMY INFORMATION SYSTEM (CFEIS), 1999 ANNUAL CERTIFICATION TEST RESULTS, ALL SALES AREA--LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AND LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS\n                     [Manufacturer: 20; DaimlerChrysler; Engine Family/Test Group: XCRXA0318H11; Engine System: 1; Evaporative/Refueling Family: RXE0174G4H; Evap System: 1]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            Emission    Eng.

A bill to provide for greater access to child care services \nfor Federal employees; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               CHILD CARE SERVICES FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation to assist \nfederal workers seeking affordable care for their young children.\n  Many federal facilities provide child care centers for their \nemployees' use. But for many lower and middle income employees, these \nservices are simply unaffordable--their costs put them beyond the reach \nof these families. The bill I am introducing today, along with Senators \nWarner and Sarbanes, will make this option affordable for these \nemployees.\n  This legislation authorizes federal agencies to use appropriated \nfunds to help lower and middle income federal workers better afford the \nchild care services they need. Let me emphasize that these funds have \nalready been appropriated, meaning no new government spending is \ninvolved. This is a modest, cost-effective solution that will certainly \nease the minds of parents who are understandably concerned about their \nchild care needs.\n  Our federal employees should not have to choose between their desire \nfor public service and their need for child care services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1178. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain parcels of land acquired for the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre \nCanal features of the Oahe Irrigation Project, South Dakota, to the \nCommission of Schools and Public Lands of the State of South Dakota for \nthe purpose of mitigating lost wildlife habitat, on the condition that \nthe current preferential leaseholders shall have an option to purchase \nthe parcels from the Commission, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    THE BLUNT RESERVOIR AND PIERRE CANAL LAND CONVEYANCE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Blunt \nReservoir and Pierre Canal Land Conveyance Act\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\nof 1999. This proposal is the culmination of more than 2 years of \ndiscussion with local landowners, the South Dakota Water Congress, the \nU.S. Bureau of Reclamation, local legislators, representatives of South \nDakota sportsmen groups and affected citizens. It lays out a plan to \nconvey certain parcels of land acquired for the Blunt Reservoir and \nPierre Canal features of the Oahe Irrigation Project in South Dakota to \nthe Commission of School and Public Lands of the State of South Dakota \nfor the purpose of mitigating lost wildlife habitat, and provides the \noption to preferential leaseholders to purchase their original parcels \nfrom the Commission.\n  In order to more fully understand the issues addressed by the \nlegislation, it is necessary to review some of the history related to \nthe Oahe Unit of the Missouri River Basin project in South Dakota.\n  The Oahe Unit was originally approved as part of the overall plan for \nwater development in the Missouri River Basin that was incorporated in \nthe Flood Control Act of 1944. Subsequently, Public Law 90-453 \nauthorized construction and operation of the initial stage. The \npurposes of the Oahe Unit as authorized were to provide for the \nirrigation of 190,000 acres of farmland, conserve and enhance fish and \nwildlife habitat, promote recreation and meet other important goals.\n  The project came to be known as the Oahe Irrigation Project, and the \nprincipal features of the initial stage of the project contained the \nOahe pumping plant located near Oahe Dam to pump water from the Oahe \nReservoir, a system of main canals, including the Pierre Canal, running \neast from the Oahe Reservoir, and the establishment of regulating \nreservoirs, including the Blunt Dam and Reservoir located approximately \n35 miles east of Pierre, South Dakota.\n  Under the authorizing legislation, 42,155 acres were to be acquired \nby the Federal government in order to construct and operate the Blunt \nReservoir feature of the Oahe Irrigation Project. Land acquisition for \nthe proposed Blunt Reservoir feature began in 1972 and continued \nthrough 1977. A total of 17,878 acres actually were acquired from \nwilling sellers.\n  The first land for the Pierre Canal feature was purchased in July \n1975 and included the 1.3 miles of Reach lB. An additional 21-mile \nreach was acquired from 1976 through 1977, also from willing sellers.\n  Organized opposition to the Oahe Irrigation Project surfaced in 1973 \nand continued to build until a series of public meetings were held in \n1977 to determine if the project should continue. In late 1977, the \nOahe project was made a part of President Carter's Federal Water \nProject review process.\n  The Oahe project construction was then halted on September 30, 1977, \nwhen Congress did not include funding in the FY1978 appropriations.\n  Thus, all major construction contract activities ceased and land \nacquisition was halted. The Oahe Project remained an authorized water \nproject with a bleak future and minimal chances of being completed as \nauthorized. Consequently, the Department of Interior, through the \nBureau of Reclamation, gave to those persons who willingly had sold \ntheir lands to the project the right for them and their descendants to \nlease those lands and use them as they had in the past until needed by \nthe Federal government for project purposes.\n  During the period from 1978 until the present, the Bureau of \nReclamation has administered these lands on a preference lease basis \nfor those original landowners or their descendants and on a non-\npreferential basis for lands under lease to persons who were not \npreferential leaseholders. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation \nadministers 12,978 acres as preferential leases and 4,304 acres as non-\npreferential leases in the Blunt Reservoir.\n  As I noted previously, the Oahe Irrigation Project is related \ndirectly to the overall project purposes of the Pick-Sloan Missouri \nBasin program authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1944. Under \nthis program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed four major \ndams across the Missouri River in South Dakota. The two largest \nreservoirs formed by these dams, Oahe Reservoir and Sharpe Reservoir, \ncaused the loss of approximately 221,000 acres of fertile, wooded \nbottomland which constituted some of the most productive, unique and \nirreplaceable wildlife habitat in the State of South Dakota. This \nincluded habitat for both game and non-game species, including several \nspecies which are now listed as threatened or endangered. Merriweather \nLewis, while traveling up the Missouri River in 1804 on his famous \nexpedition, wrote in his diary, ``Song birds, game species and \nfurbearing animals abound here in numbers like none of the party has \never seen. The bottomlands and cottonwood trees provide a shelter and \nfood for a great variety of species, all laying their claim to the \nriver bottom.''\n  Under the provisions of the Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, the \nState of South Dakota has developed a plan to mitigate a part of this \nlost wildlife habitat as authorized by Section 602 of Title VI of \nPublic Law 105-277, October 21, 1998, known as the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and State of South Dakota Terrestrial \nWildlife Habitat Restoration Act.\n  The State's habitat mitigation plan has received the necessary \napproval and interim funding authorizations under Sections 602 and 609 \nof Title VI.\n  The State's habitat mitigation plan requires the development of \napproximately 27,000 acres of wildlife habitat in South Dakota. \nTransferring the 4,304 acres of non-preferential lease lands in the \nBlunt Reservoir feature to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish \nand Parks would constitute a significant step toward satisfying the \nhabitat mitigation obligation owed to the state by the Federal \ngovernment and as agreed upon by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the South Dakota Department of \nGame, Fish and Parks.\n  As we developed this legislation, many meetings occurred among the \nlocal landowners, South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, \nbusiness owners, local legislators, the Bureau of Reclamation, as well \nas representatives of sportsmen groups. It became apparent that the \nbest solution for the local economy, tax base and wildlife mitigation \nissues would be to allow the preferential leaseholders (original \nlandowner or descendant or operator of the land at the time of \npurchase) to have an option to purchase the land from the Commission of \nSchool and Public Lands after the preferential lease parcels are \nconveyed to the Commission. This option will be available for a period \nof 10 years after the date of conveyance to the Commission. During the \ninterim period, the preferential leaseholders shall be entitled to \ncontinue to lease from the Commissioner under the same terms and \nconditions they have enjoyed with the Bureau of Reclamation. If the \npreferential leaseholder fails to purchase a parcel within the 10-year \nperiod, that parcel will be conveyed to the South Dakota Department of \nGame, Fish and Parks to be used to implement the 27,000-acre habitat \nmitigation plan.\n  The proceeds from these sales will be used to finance the \nadministration of this bill, support public education in the state of \nSouth Dakota, and will be added to the South Dakota Wildlife Habitat \nMitigation Trust Fund to assist in the payment of local property taxes \non lands transferred from the Federal government to the state of South \nDakota.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the State of South Dakota, the Federal \ngovernment, the original landowners, the sportsmen and wildlife will \nbenefit from this bill. It provides for a fair and just resolution to \nthe private property and environmental problems caused by the Oahe \nIrrigation Project some 25 years ago. We have waited long enough to \nright some of the wrongs suffered by our landowners and South Dakota's \nwildlife resources.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will act quickly on this legislation. \nOur goal is to enact a bill that will allow meaningful wildlife habitat \nmitigation to begin, give certainty to local landowners who sacrificed \ntheir lands for a defunct federal project they once supported, ensure \nthe viability of the local land base and tax base, and provide well \nmaintained and managed recreation areas for sportsmen. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe sale, delivery, or other transfer of any type of firearm to a \njuvenile, with certain exceptions.\n\n\n                  youth access to firearms act of 1999\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week during consideration of \nthe juvenile justice bill, the Senate passed some reasonable, common-\nsense proposals to control the proliferation of guns in this country. I \nbelieve the Senate's action was an important first step. But there is \nmore to be done. And, today, I am introducing legislation to prohibit \nthe sale and transfer of any gun to a juvenile, unless it comes from a \nparent, grandparent, or legal guardian.\n  Let me start, Mr. President, with a review of current law. A \nfederally licensed firearms dealer--that is, someone who runs a gun \nstore--cannot sell a handgun to someone under the age of 21 and cannot \nsell any other type of gun to someone under the age of 18.\n  The law is different, however, for private transactions. Those are \nsales or transfers by unlicensed individuals at gun shows, at flea \nmarkets, or in a private home. Since 1994, it has been illegal for \nanyone under the age of 18 to buy a handgun in these cases. But it is \nnot illegal for a juvenile to buy a long-gun--that is, a rifle, a \nshotgun, or a semiautomatic assault weapon--in a private transaction. \nAnd, it is not illegal for a long-gun to be transferred--given--to a \njuvenile.\n  This is not right. An 18-year-old cannot buy a can of beer. An 19-\nyear-old cannot buy a bottle of liquor or a bottle of wine. Anyone \nunder 18 cannot buy a pack of cigarettes. And, as I mentioned, since \n1994, if you are under 18, you cannot buy a handgun.\n  There is a reason for this. There is a reason we keep certain things \naway from juveniles. And, it does not make sense to me to say that it \nis illegal to sell cigarettes, alcohol, and handguns to a kid, but it \nis okay to sell them a rifle or a shotgun or a semiautomatic assault \nweapon.\n  So, my bill--the Youth Access to Firearms Act--simply says that it \nwould be illegal to sell, deliver, or transfer any firearm to anyone \nunder the age of 18.\n  Now, in recognition of the culture and circumstances in many areas of \nthis country, my bill does contain some exceptions to this prohibition.\n  First, the bill would not make possession of a long-gun by a juvenile \na crime. It would only make the sale or transfer illegal.\n  Second, the bill would not apply to a rifle or shotgun given to a \njuvenile by that person's parent, grandparent, or legal guardian.\n  Third, it would not apply to another family member giving a juvenile \na rifle or shotgun with the permission of the juvenile's parent, \ngrandparent, or legal guardian.\n  Fourth, it would not apply to a temporary transfer--a loan--of a \nrifle or shotgun for hunting purposes.\n  And, fifth, it would not apply to the temporary transfer of a gun to \na juvenile for employment, target shooting, or a course of instruction \nin the safe and lawful use of a firearm, if the juvenile has parental \npermission.\n  I have put these exceptions into the bill to make it clear what I am \ntrying to do here. I am not trying to stop teenagers from having or \nresponsibly using a rifle or a shotgun. I am not trying to stop \nteenagers from going hunting. I am not trying to prevent a parent or \ngrandparent from giving a rifle or shotgun as a birthday present. But, \nwhat I am saying is that juveniles should not be able to buy a gun on \ntheir own--or be given one without the knowledge of their parents.\n  This is precisely what happened in Littleton, Colorado. The two \nteenage boys who shot up Columbine High School used four guns. Three of \nthose four guns--two shotguns and a rifle--were given to them by an 18-\nyear-old female friend. Under federal law, that was perfectly legal.\n  I should not be. You should not be able to sell a gun to a juvenile. \nAnd you should not be able to give a gun to a juvenile, unless you are \nthe parent or grandparent.\n  As I said earlier, there are certain things that are legally off-\nlimits to juveniles. Selling and giving them guns, if you are not their \nparent, should be one of those things.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1180. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965, to reauthorize and make improvements to that Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n          educational excellence for all children act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce President \nClinton's proposal for reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, the ``Educational Excellence for All Children Act of \n1999,'' along with Senators Dodd, Daschle, Murray, Schumer, Levin, and \nDorgan. This is another strong step by the President to ensure that all \nchildren have the benefit of the best possible education.\n\n  Since 1993, President Clinton has consistently led the way on \nimproving schools and making sure that all children meet high \nstandards.\n  Today, as a result, almost every state has established high standards \nfor its students. ``High standards'' is no longer just a term for \nacademics experts and policy makers--it is becoming a reality for the \nnation's schools and students.\n  The recently released National Assessment of Title I shows that \nstudent achievement is improving--and that the federal government is an \neffective partner in that success. This result is good news for \nschools, good news for parents, and good news for students--and it \nshould be a wake up call to Congress. We need to do more to build on \nthese emerging successes to ensure that every child has the opportunity \nfor an excellent education.\n  At dinner tables and boardrooms across America, the topic of \ndiscussion is education. As a result of the progress we have made the \npast few years, we can look at the education glass on the table and say \nit's ``half full''--not ``half empty'' as critics of public schools \nwould have the country believe.\n  Since the reauthorization of Title I in 1994, a non-partisan \nIndependent Review Panel of twenty-two experts from across the country \nhas been overseeing the evaluation of the program. As the largest \nfederal investment in improving elementary and secondary schools, Title \nI is improving education for 11 million children in 45,000 schools with \nhigh concentrations of poverty. It helps schools provide professional \ndevelopment for teachers, improve curriculums, and extend learning \ntime, so that students meet high state standards of achievement.\n  Under the 1994 amendments to Title I, states were no longer allowed \nto set lower standards for children in the poorest communities than for \nstudents in more affluent communities. The results are clear. Students \ndo well when expectations are set high and they are given the support \nthey need and deserve.\n  Student achievement in reading and math has increased--particularly \nthe achievement of the poorest students. Since 1992, reading \nachievement for 9-year- olds in the highest poverty schools has \nincreased by one whole grade level nationwide. Between 1990 and 1996, \nmath scores of the poorest students also rose by a grade level.\n  Students are meeting higher state standards. According to state-\nreported results, students in the highest poverty elementary schools \nimproved in 5 of 6 states reporting three-year data in reading and in 4 \nout of 5 states in math. Students in Connecticut, Maryland, North \nCarolina, and Texas made progress in both subjects.\n  Many urban school districts report that achievement also improved in \ntheir highest-poverty schools. In 10 of\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\n13 large urban districts that report three-year trend data, more \nelementary students in the highest poverty schools are now meeting \ndistrict or state standards of proficiency in reading or math. Six \ndistricts, including Houston, Dade County, New York, Philadelphia, San \nAntonio, and San Francisco, made progress in both subjects.\n  Federal funds are increasingly targeted to the poorest schools. The \n1994 amendments to Title I shifted funds away from low-poverty schools \nand into high-poverty schools. Today, 95 percent of the highest-poverty \nschools receive Title I funds, up from 80 percent in 1993.\n  In addition, Title I funds help improve teaching and learning in the \nclassroom. 99 percent of Title I funds go to the local level. 93 \npercent of those federal dollars are spent directly on instruction, \nwhile only 62 percent of all state and local education dollars are \nspent on instruction.\n  The best illustrations of these successes are in local districts and \nschools. In Baltimore County, Maryland, all but one of the 19 Title I \nschools increased student performance between 1993 and 1998. The \nsuccess has come from Title I support for extended year programs, \nimplementation of effective programs in reading, and intensive \nprofessional development for teachers.\n  At Roosevelt High School in Dallas, Texas, where 80 percent of the \nstudents are poor, Title I funds were used to increase parent \ninvolvement, train teachers to work more effectively with parents, and \nmake other changes to bring high standards into every classroom. \nStudent reading scores have nearly doubled, from the 40th percentile in \n1992 to the 77th percentile in 1996. During the same period, math \nscores soared from the 16th to the 73rd percentile, and writing scores \nrose from the 58th to the 84th percentile.\n  In addition to the successes supported by Title I, other indicators \ndemonstrate that student achievement is improving. U.S. students scored \nnear the top on the latest international assessment of reading. \nAmerican 4th graders out-performed students from all other nations \nexcept Finland.\n  At Baldwin Elementary School in Boston, where 80 percent of the \nstudents are poor, performance on the Stanford 9 test rose \nsubstantially from 1996 to 1998 because of increases in teacher \nprofessional development and implementation of a whole-school reform \nplan to raise standards and achievement for all children. In 1996, 66 \npercent of the 3rd grade students scored in the lowest levels in math. \nIn 1998, 100 percent scored in the highest levels. In 1997, 75 percent \nof 4th graders scored in the lowest levels in reading. In 1998, no 4th \ngraders scored at the lowest level, and 56 percent scored in the \nhighest levels.\n\n  The combined verbal and math scores on the SAT increased 19 points \nfrom 1982 to 1997, with the largest gain of 15 points occurring between \n1992 and 1997. The average math score is at its highest level in 26 \nyears.\n  Students are taking more rigorous subjects than ever--and doing \nbetter in them. The proportion of high school graduates taking the core \ncourses recommended in the 1983 report, A Nation At Risk, had increased \nto 52 percent by 1994, up from 14 percent in 1982 and 40 percent in \n1990. Since 1982, the percentage of graduates taking biology, \nchemistry, and physics has doubled, rising from 10 percent in 1982 to \n21 percent in 1994. With increased participation in advanced placement \ncourses, the number of students that scored at 3 or above on the AP \nexams has risen nearly five-fold since 1982, from 131,871 in that year \nto 635,922 in 1998.\n  Clearly, the work is not done. These improvements are gratifying, but \nthere is no cause for complacency. We must do more to ensure that all \nchildren have a good education. We must do more to increase support for \nprograms like Title I to build on these successes and make them \navailable to all children.\n  President Clinton's ``Educational Excellence for All Children Act of \n1999'' builds on the success of the 1994 reauthorization of ESEA, which \nensured that all children are held to the same high academic standards. \nThis bill makes high standards the core of classroom activities in \nevery school across the country--and holds schools and school districts \nresponsible for making sure all children meet those standards. The bill \nfocuses on three fundamental ways to accomplish this goal: improving \nteacher quality, increasing accountability for results, and creating \nsafe, healthy, and disciplined learning environments for children.\n  This year, the nation set a new record for elementary and secondary \nstudent enrollment. The figure will reach an all-time high of 53 \nmillion students--500,000 more students than last year. Communities, \nthe states, and Congress must work together to see that these students \nreceive a good education.\n  Serious teacher shortages are being caused by the rising student \nenrollments, and also by the growing number of teacher retirements. The \nnation's schools need to hire 2.2 million public school teachers over \nthe next ten years, just to hold their own. If we don't act now, the \nneed for more teachers will put even greater pressure in the future on \nschool districts to lower their standards and hire more unqualified \nteachers. Too many teachers leave within the first three years of \nteaching--including 30-50% of teachers in urban areas--because they \ndon't get the support and mentoring they need. Veteran teachers need \non-going professional development opportunities to enhance their \nknowledge and skills, to integrate technology into the curriculum, and \nto help children meet high state standards.\n  Many communities are working hard to attract, keep, and support good \nteachers--and often they're succeeding. The North Carolina Teaching \nFellows Program has recruited 3,600 high-ability high school graduates \nto go into teaching. The students agree to teach for four years in the \nstate's public schools, in exchange for a four-year college \nscholarship. School principals in the state report that the performance \nof the fellows far exceeds that of other new teachers.\n  In Chicago, a program called the ``Golden Apple Scholars of \nIllinois'' recruits promising young men and women into teaching by \nselecting them during their junior year of high school, then mentoring \nthem through the rest of high school, college, and five years of actual \nteaching. 60 Golden Apple scholars enter the teaching field each year, \nand 90 percent of them stay in the classroom.\n  Colorado State University's ``Project Promise'' recruits prospective \nteachers from fields such as law, geology, chemistry, stock trading and \nmedicine. Current teachers mentor graduates in their first two years of \nteaching. More than 90 percent of the recruits go into teaching, and 80 \npercent stay for at least five years.\n  New York City's Mentor Teacher Internship Program has increased the \nretention of new teachers. In Montana, only 4 percent of new teachers \nin mentoring programs left after their first year of teaching, compared \nwith 28 percent of teachers without the benefit of mentoring.\n  New York City's District 2 has made professional development the \ncentral component for improving schools. The idea is that student \nlearning will increase as the knowledge of educators grows--and it's \nworking. In 1996, student math scores were second in the city.\n  Massachusetts has invested $60 million in the Teacher Quality \nEndowment Fund to launch the 12-to-62 Plan for Strengthening \nMassachusetts Future Teaching Force. The program is a comprehensive \neffort to improve recruitment, retention, and professional development \nof teachers throughout their careers.\n  Congress should build on and support these successful efforts across \nthe country to ensure that the nation's teaching force is strong and \nsuccessful in the years ahead.\n  The Administration's proposal makes a major investment in ensuring \nquality teachers in every classroom, especially in areas where the \nneeds are greatest. It authorizes funds to help states and communities \nimprove the recruitment, retention, and on-going professional \ndevelopment of teachers. It will provide states and local school \ndistricts with the support they need to recruit excellent teacher \ncandidates, to retain and support promising beginning teachers through \nmentoring programs, and to provide veteran teachers with the on-going \nprofessional development\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\nthey need to help all children meet high standards of achievement. It \nwill also support a national effort to recruit and train school \nprincipals.\n  In recognition of the national need to recruit 2.2 million teachers \nover the next decade, the Administration's proposal will fund projects \nto recruit and retain high-quality teachers and school principals in \nhigh-need areas. The Transition to Teaching proposal will continue and \nexpand the successful ``Troops to Teachers'' initiative by recruiting \nand supporting mid-career professionals in the armed forces as \nteachers, particularly in high-poverty school districts and high-need \nsubjects.\n  The proposal holds states accountable for having qualified teachers \nin the classroom. It requires that within four years, 95 percent of all \nteachers must be certified, working toward full certification through \nan alternative route that will lead to full certification within three \nyears, or are fully certified in another state and working toward \nmeeting state-specific requirements. It also requires states to ensure \nthat at least 95 percent of secondary school teachers have academic \ntraining or demonstrated competence in the subject area in which they \nteach.\n  Parents and educators across the country also say that reducing class \nsize is at the top of their priorities for education reform. It is \nobvious that smaller class sizes, particularly in the early grades, \nimprove student achievement. We must help states and communities reduce \nclass sizes in the early grades, when individual attention is needed \nmost. Congress made a down-payment last year on helping communities \nreduce class size, and we can't walk away from that commitment now.\n  The Educational Excellence for All Children Act authorizes the full 7 \nyears of this program, so that communities will be able to hire 100,000 \nteachers across the country.\n  We know qualified teachers in small classes make a difference for \nstudents. There is also mounting evidence that the President and \nCongress took the right step in 1994 by making standards-based reform \nthe centerpiece of the 1994 reauthorization. In schools and school \ndistricts across the country that have set high standards and required \naccountability for results, student performance has risen, and the \nnumbers of failing schools has fallen.\n  Nevertheless, 10 to 15 percent of high school graduates today--up to \n340,000 graduates each year--do not continue their education. Often, \nthey cannot balance a checkbook or write a letter to a credit card \ncompany to explain an error on a bill. Even worse, 11 percent of high \nschool students never make it to graduation.\n  We are not meeting our responsibility to these students--and it is \nunconscionable to continue to abdicate our responsibility. Every day, \nchildren--poor children, minority children, English language learners, \nchildren with disabilities--face barriers to a good education, and also \nface the high-stakes consequences of failing in the future because the \nsystem is failing them now.\n  Schools and communities must do more to see that students obtain the \nskills and knowledge they need in order to move on to the next grade \nand to graduate. If students are socially promoted or forced to repeat \nthe same grade without changing the instruction that failed the first \ntime, they are more likely to drop out. Clearly, these practices must \nend.\n  The Administration's proposal makes public schools the centers of \nopportunity for all children--and holds schools accountability for \nproviding this opportunity.\n  It requires schools, school districts, and states to provide parents \nwith report cards that include information about student performance, \nthe condition of school buildings, class sizes, quality of teachers, \nand safety and discipline in their schools. These report cards give \nparents the information they need to see that their schools are \nimproving and their children are getting the education they deserve.\n  The proposal also holds schools and districts accountable for \nchildren meeting the standards. The bill requires schools and districts \nto end the unsound educational practices of socially promoting children \nor making them repeat a grade. States must collect data on social \npromotion and retention rates as an indicator of whether children are \nmeeting high standards, and schools must implement responsible \npromotion policies. The proposal is designed to eliminate the dismal \nchoice between social promotion and repeating a grade. It does so in \nseveral ways--by increasing support for early education programs, by \nimproving early reading skills, by improving the quality of the \nteaching force, by providing extended learning time through after-\nschool and summer-school programs, and by creating safe, disciplined \nlearning environments for children.\n  Last year in Boston, School Superintendent Tom Payzant ended social \npromotion and traditional grade retention. With extensive community \ninvolvement, Mayor Menino, Superintendent Payzant, and the School \nCommittee implemented a policy to clarify for everyone--schools, \nteachers, parents, and students--the requirements needed to advance \nfrom one grade to the next, and to graduate from a Boston public \nschool.\n  The call for a new promotion and retention policy came primarily from \nmiddle and high schools, where teachers were facing students who had \nnot mastered the skills they needed in order to go on to a higher \ngrade. Now, all students will have to demonstrate that they have \nmastered the content and skills in every grade. If they fail to do so, \nschools and teachers must intervene with proven effective practices to \nhelp the students, such as attending summer-school and after-school \nprograms, providing extra help during the regular school day, and \nworking more closely with parents to ensure better results. In ways \nlike these, schools and teachers are held accountable for results.\n  The Administration's proposal gives children who have fallen behind \nin their school work the opportunities they need to catch up, to meet \nlegitimate requirements for graduation, to master basic skills, and \nmeet high standards of achievement. A high school diploma should be \nmore than a certificate of attendance. It should be a certificate of \nachievement.\n  Finally, the President's proposal helps create safe, disciplined, and \nhealthy environments for children. Last year, President Clinton led a \nsuccessful effort to increase funding for after-school programs in the \ncurrent year. But far more needs to be done.\n  Effective programs are urgently needed for children of all ages \nduring the many hours they are not in school each week and during the \nsummer. The ``Home Alone'' problem is serious, and deserves urgent \nattention. Every day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years \nold, are left alone after school. Juvenile crime peaks in the hours \nbetween 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. A recent study of gang crimes by juveniles in \nOrange County, California, shows that 60 percent of all juvenile gang \ncrimes occur on schools days and peak immediately after school \ndismissal. Children left unsupervised are more likely to be involved in \nillegal activities and destructive behavior. We need constructive \nalternatives to keep children off the streets, away from drugs, and out \nof trouble.\n  We need to do all we can to encourage communities to develop after-\nschool activities that will engage children. The proposal will triple \nour investment in after-school programs, so that one million children \nwill have access to worthwhile activities.\n  The Act also requires school districts and schools to have sound \ndiscipline policies that are consistent with the Individual with \nDisabilities Education Act, are fair, and are developed with the \nparticipation of the school community. In addition, the Safe and Drug-\nFree Schools and Communities Act is strengthened to support research-\nbased prevention programs to address violence and drug-use by youth.\n  In order to develop a healthy environment for children, local school \ndistricts will be able to use 5 percent of their funds to support \ncoordinated services, so that children and their families will have \nbetter access to social, health, and educational services necessary for \nstudents to do well in school.\n  In all of these ways and more ways, President Clinton's proposal will \nhelp schools and communities bring high standards into every classroom \nand ensure that all children meet them. Major new investments are \nneeded to\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\nimprove teacher quality--hold schools, school districts, and states \naccountable for results--increase parent involvement--expand after-\nschool programs--reduce class size in the early grades--and ensure that \nschools meet strict discipline standards. With investments like these, \nwe are doing all we can to ensure that the nation's public schools are \nthe best in the world.\n  Education must continue to be a top priority in this Congress. We \nmust address the needs of public schools, families, and children so \nthat we ensure that all children have an opportunity to attend an \nexcellent public school now and throughout the 21st Century.\n  President Clinton's proposal is an excellent series of needed \ninitiatives, and it deserves broad bipartisan support. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to make it the heart of this year's ESEA \nReauthorization Bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  The Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999--Section-By-\n                            Section Analysis\n\n       Section 2. Table of Contents. Section 2 of the bill would \n     set out the table of contents for the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq., \n     hereinafter in the section-by-section analysis referred to as \n     ``the ESEA'') as it would be amended by the bill.\n       Section 3. America's Education Goals. Section 3 of the bill \n     would rename the National Education Goals (currently in Title \n     I of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, P.L. 103-227), as \n     ``America's Education Goals'' and update the Goals to reflect \n     our Nation's continuing need for the Goals. Even though all \n     the Goals will not have been reached by the year 2000 as \n     originally hoped, nor accomplished to equal degrees, the \n     Goals were purposely designed to set high expectations for \n     educational performance at every stage of an individual's \n     life, and there is a continued need to reaffirm these Goals \n     as a benchmark to which all students can strive and attain. \n     With policymakers, educators, and the public united in an \n     effort to achieve America's Education Goals, the Nation will \n     be able to raise its overall level of educational \n     achievement.\n       Section 3(a) of the bill would contain findings concerning \n     America's Education Goals, as well as descriptions of areas \n     in which the Nation as a whole, as well as individual States, \n     have been successful (or unsuccessful) at making progress \n     toward achieving the various Goals during the last decade.\n       In order to reflect the overarching importance to America's \n     Education Goals, section 3(b) of the bill would amend the \n     ESEA to place the Goals in a proposed new section 3 of the \n     ESEA. Proposed new section 3(a) of the ESEA would state the \n     purpose of America's Education Goals as: setting forth a \n     common set of national goals for the education of our \n     Nation's students that the Federal Government and all States \n     and local communities will work to achieve; identifying the \n     Nation's highest education priorities related to preparing \n     students for responsible citizenship, further learning, and \n     the technological, scientific, economic, challenges of the \n     21st century; and establishing a framework for educational \n     excellence at the national, State, and local levels. Proposed \n     new section 3(b) of the ESEA would state the Goals.\n       Title I of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, the current \n     authority for the National Education Goals, would be repealed \n     by section 1211 of the bill.\n       Section 4. Transition. Section 4 of the bill would specify \n     the actions that the Secretary must, and a recipient of ESEA \n     funds may, take as part of the transition between the \n     requirements of the ESEA as in effect the day before the date \n     of enactment of the Educational Excellence for All Children \n     Act of 1999, and the requirements of the ESEA as amended by \n     the bill.\n       Under section 4(a) of the bill, the Secretary would be \n     required to take such steps as the Secretary determines to be \n     appropriate to provide for the orderly transition to programs \n     and activities under the ESEA, as amended by the bill, from \n     programs and activities under the ESEA, as it was in effect \n     the date before the date of enactment of the bill.\n       Under section 4(b) of the bill, a recipient of funds under \n     the ESEA, as it was in effect the date before the date of \n     enactment of the bill, may use such funds to carry out \n     necessary and reasonable planning and transition activities \n     in order to ensure a smooth implementation of programs and \n     activities under the ESEA, as amended by the bill.\n       Section 5. Effective Dates. Section 5 of the bill would set \n     out the effective dates for the bill. The bill would take \n     effect July 1, 2000, except for those amendments made by the \n     bill that pertain to programs administered by the Secretary \n     on a competitive basis, and the amendments made by Title VIII \n     of the bill (Impact Aid), which would take effect with \n     respect to appropriations for fiscal year 2001 and subsequent \n     fiscal years, and amendments made by section 4 of the bill \n     (transition requirements), which would take effect upon \n     enactment.\n\n\n      TITLE I--HELPING DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN MEET HIGH STANDARDS\n\n       Section 101, declaration of policy and statement of purpose \n     [ESEA, Sec. 1001]. Section 101(a) of the bill would amend the \n     statement of policy in section 1001(a) of the ESEA by \n     deleting paragraph (2), which called for an annual increase \n     in appropriations of at least $750 million from fiscal year \n     1996 through 1999.\n       Section 101(b) would amend the statement of need in section \n     1001(b) of the ESEA to reflect the bill's proposal to move \n     the text of the National Education Goals from the Goals 2000: \n     Educate America Act to section 3 of the ESEA, and to add a \n     paragraph (6) noting the benefits of holding local \n     educational agencies (LEAs) and schools accountable for \n     results.\n       Section 101(c) would update the statement, in section \n     1001(c), of what has been learned, to reflect experience and \n     research since that statement was enacted in 1994, including \n     the addition of six new findings.\n       Section 101(d) would add, to the list of activities through \n     which Title I's purpose is to be achieved, promoting \n     comprehensive schoolwide reforms that are based on reliable \n     research and effective practices.\n       Section 102, authorization of appropriations [ESEA, \n     Sec. 1002]. Section 102 of the bill would restate, in its \n     entirety, section 1002 of the ESEA, which authorizes the \n     appropriation of funds to carry out the various Title I \n     programs. As revised, section 1002 would authorize the \n     appropriations of ``such sums as may be necessary'' for \n     fiscal years 2001 through 2005 for grants to LEAs under Part \n     A, the Even Start program under Part B, the education of \n     migratory children under Part C, State agency programs for \n     neglected or delinquent children under Part D, the Reading \n     Excellence program (to be transferred to Part E from Title \n     II), and certain Federal activities under section 1502 (to be \n     redesignated as section 1602). Funds would no longer be \n     authorized for capital expenses relating to the provision of \n     Title I services to children in private schools. In addition, \n     certain school-improvement activities would be funded by \n     requiring States to dedicate a portion of their Title I \n     grants to those activities, rather than through a separate \n     authorization as in current law.\n       Section 103, reservations for accountability and evaluation \n     [ESEA, Sec. 1003]. Section 103 of the ESEA, to require each \n     SEA to reserve 2.5 percent of its annual Basic Grant under \n     Part A of Title I to carry out the LEA and school improvement \n     activities described in sections 1116 and 1117 in fiscal \n     years 2001 and 2002, and 3.5 percent of that amount for that \n     purpose in subsequent fiscal years. This requirement, which \n     is an important component of the bill's overall emphasis on \n     accountability for results, will ensure that each \n     participating State devotes a sufficient portion of its Part \n     A funds to the critical activities described in those \n     sections. In addition, the SEA would have to allocate at \n     least 70 percent of the reserved amount directly to LEAs in \n     accordance with certain specified priorities or use at least \n     that portion of the reserved amount to carry out an \n     alternative system of school and LEA improvement and \n     corrective action described in the State plan and approved by \n     the Secretary.\n       Section 1003(b) of the ESEA would permit the Secretary to \n     reserve up to 0.30 percent of each year's Title I \n     appropriation to conduct evaluations and studies, collect \n     data, and carry out other activities under section 1501.\n     PART A--basic grants\n       Section 111, State plans [ESEA, Sec. 1111). Section \n     111(1)(A) of the bill would amend section 1111(a)(1) of the \n     ESEA, which requires a State that wishes to receive a Basic \n     Grant under Part A of Title I to submit a State plan to the \n     Secretary of Education (the Secretary). Section 111(1)(A)(i) \n     would add language emphasizing that the purpose of a State's \n     plan is to help all children achieve to high State standards \n     and to improve teaching and learning in the State.\n       Section 111(1)(A)(ii) would add, to the list of other \n     programs with which the plan must be coordinated, a specific \n     reference to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     (IDEA) and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \n     Education Act of 1998. This section would also delete a \n     reference to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which \n     another provision of the bill would repeal, and delete a \n     cross-reference to a section in Title XIV that another \n     provision of the bill would repeal.\n       Section 111(1)(B) would improve the readability of section \n     1111(a)(2), which permits a State to submit its Part A plan \n     as part of a consolidated plan under section 14302 (to be \n     redesignated as Sec. 11502).\n       Section 111(2)(A) would add a reference to accountability \n     to the heading of section 1111(b), to reflect the proposed \n     addition of language on that topic as section 1111(b)(3).\n       Section 111(2)(B)(i) would streamline section \n     1111(b)(1)(B), which requires that the challenging content \n     and student-performance standards each State must use in \n     carrying out Part A be the same standards that the State uses \n     for all schools and children in the State, to reflect the \n     progress that States are expected to have made under current \n     law by the effective date of the bill.\n       Section 111(2)(B)(ii) would delete outdated language from \n     section 1111(b)(1)(C), which provides that, if a State has \n     not adopted content and student-performance standards for all \n     students, it must have those standards for children served \n     under Part A in subjects\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\n     determined by the State, which must include at least \n     mathematics and reading or language arts.\n       Section 111(2)(C) would delete current section 1111(b)(2), \n     which requires States to describe, in their plans, what \n     constitutes adequate yearly progress by LEAs and schools \n     participating in the Part A program. This requirement would \n     be replaced by the new provisions on accountability in \n     section 1111(b)(3), described below. Section 111(2)(C) would \n     also redesignate paragraph (3) of section 1111(b), relating \n     to assessments, as paragraph (2).\n       Section 111(2)(D)(i) would clarify that States must start \n     using the yearly assessments described in current paragraph \n     (3) of section 1111(b) (which the bill would redesignate as \n     paragraph (2)) no later than the 2000-2001 school year.\n       Section 111(2)(D)(ii) would amend subparagraph (F) of \n     current section 1111(b)(3), relating to the assessments of \n     limited English proficient (LEP) children. Clauses (iv) and \n     (v) would be added to require, respectively, that: (1) LEP \n     students who speak Spanish be assessed with tests written in \n     Spanish, if Spanish-language tests are more likely than \n     English-language tests to yield accurate and reliable \n     information on what those students know and can do in content \n     areas other than English; and (2) tests written in English be \n     used to assess the reading and language arts proficiency of \n     any student who has attended school in the United States for \n     three or more consecutive years.\n       Section 111(2)(E) would add a new provision on \n     accountability as section 1111(b)(3). It would replace the \n     current requirement that States establish criteria for \n     ``adequate yearly progress'' in LEAs and schools with a \n     requirement that they submit an accountability plan as part \n     of their State applications, reflecting the critical role \n     that accountability plays as a component of overall systems. \n     In particular, each State would have to have an \n     accountability system that is based on challenging standards, \n     includes all students, promotes continuous improvement, and \n     includes rigorous criteria for identifying and intervening in \n     schools and districts in need of improvement. This proposal \n     addresses concerns that many current accountability systems \n     focus only on overall school performance and divert attention \n     away from the students who need the greatest help.\n       Section 111(2)(F) would make a conforming amendment to \n     section 1111(b)(4).\n       Section 111(2)(G) would delete paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) \n     from section 1111(b). Paragraph (5) requires States to \n     identify languages other than English that are present in the \n     participating school population, to indicate the languages \n     for which assessments are not available, and to make every \n     effort to develop those assessments. This provision is \n     burdensome and unnecessary. Paragraph (6) describes the \n     schedule, established in 1994, for States to develop the \n     necessary standards and assessments, while paragraph (7) \n     governs the transition period during which States were not \n     required to have ``final'' standards and assessments in \n     place. These provisions would be obsolete by the time the \n     bill takes effect. Instead, section 112(2)(G) would enact \n     a new paragraph (5), providing that while a State may \n     revise its assessments at any time, it must comply with \n     the statutory timelines for identifying, assisting, and \n     taking corrective action with respect to, LEAs and schools \n     that need to improve.\n       Section 111(2) (H) and (I) would redesignate paragraph (8) \n     of section 1111(b) as paragraph (6) and make conforming \n     amendments to cross-references in that paragraph.\n       Section 111(3) of the bill would amend section 1111(c) of \n     the ESEA, to significantly shorten the list of assurances \n     that each State must include in its plan.\n       Section 111(4)(A) would delete section 1111(d)(2), relating \n     to withholding of funds from States whose plans don't meet \n     section 1111's requirements. That provision duplicates Part D \n     of the General Education Provisions Act, which establishes \n     uniform procedures and rules for withholding and other \n     enforcement actions across a broad range of programs, \n     including the ESEA programs, administered by the Department \n     of Education.\n       Section 111(4)(B) would make technical amendments to \n     section 1111(d)(1).\n       Section 111(4)(C) would amend current section 1111(d)(1)(B) \n     to require the Secretary to include experts on educational \n     standards, assessments, accountability, and the diverse \n     educational needs of students in the peer-review process used \n     to review State plans.\n       Section 111(5) would amend section 1111(e) to require each \n     State to submit its plan to the Secretary for the first year \n     for which Part A is in effect following the bill's enactment.\n       Section 111(6) would replace subsection (g) of section \n     1111, which is obsolete by its terms, with language \n     permitting the Secretary to take any of the actions described \n     in proposed section 11209 if the Secretary determines that a \n     State is not carrying out its responsibilities under the new \n     accountability provisions in section 1111(b)(3). These \n     actions, which apply under section 11209 in the case of a \n     State that fails to carry out its responsibilities under \n     proposed Part B of Title XI (relating to teacher quality, \n     social promotion, LEA and school report cards, and school \n     discipline) would afford the Secretary a broad range of \n     actions, ranging from providing technical assistance to \n     withholding funds.\n       Section 112, local educational agency plans [ESEA, \n     Sec. 1112] Section 112(1) of the bill would amend section \n     1112(a)(1) of the ESEA, which requires an LEA that wishes to \n     receive subgrants under Part A of Title I to have a plan on \n     file with, and approved by, the State educational agency. The \n     bill would add, to the list of other programs with which the \n     plan must be coordinated, a specific reference to the IDEA \n     and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education \n     Act of 1998. The bill would also delete a reference to the \n     Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which another provision of \n     the bill would repeal, and delete an inappropriate cross-\n     reference.\n       Section 112(2)(A) would add language to section 1112(b) to \n     emphasize that the purpose of an LEA's plan is to help all \n     children achieve to high standards.\n       Section 112(2)(B) would amend section 1112(b)(1), relating \n     to any student assessments that the LEA uses (other than \n     those described in the State plan under section 1111), to \n     require the LEA's plan to describe any such assessments that \n     it will use to determine the literacy levels of first graders \n     and their need for interventions and how it will ensure that \n     those assessments are developmentally appropriate, use \n     multiple measures to provide information about the variety of \n     relevant skills, and are administered to students in the \n     language most likely to yield valid results.\n       Section 112(2)(C) would amend section 1112(b)(3) to require \n     an LEA's professional development strategy under Part A to \n     also be a component of its professional development plan \n     under the new Title II, if it receives Title II funds.\n       Section 112(2)(D) would amend section 1112(b)(4)(B) to \n     remove an obsolete reference; conform that provision to the \n     proposed repeal of Subpart 2 of Part 2 of Title I, relating \n     to local programs for neglected or delinquent children; and \n     include Indian children served under Title IX of the ESEA in \n     the categories of children for whom an LEA's plan must \n     describe the coordination of Title I services with other \n     educational services those children receive.\n       Section 112(2)(F) would amend section 1112(b)(9), relating \n     to preschool programs, to replace language in that provision \n     with a cross-reference to new language that the bill would \n     add to section 1120B.\n       Section 112(2)(G) would amend section 1112(b) to require \n     LEAs to include two additional items in their plans: (1) a \n     description of the actions it will take to assist its low-\n     performing schools, if any, in making the changes needed to \n     educate all children to the State standards; and (2) a \n     description of how the LEA will promote the use of extended \n     learning time, such as an extended school year, before- and \n     after-school programs, and summer programs.\n       Section 112(3) would amend section 112(c), which describes \n     the assurances that an LEA must include in its application, \n     to conform to other provisions in the bill and to delete \n     obsolete provisions relating to the Head Start program. \n     Instead, the new Head Start standards would be incorporated \n     into proposed section 1120B. Section 112(3) would also \n     require that an LEA include new assurances that it will: (1) \n     annually assess the English proficiency of all LEP children \n     participating in Part A programs, use the results of those \n     assessments to help guide and modify instruction in the \n     content areas, and provide those results to the parents of \n     those children; and (2) comply with the requirements of \n     section 119 regarding teacher qualifications and the use of \n     paraprofessionals.\n       Section 112(4) would amend section 1112(d), relating to the \n     development and duration of an LEA's plan, to require the LEA \n     to submit the plan for the first year for which Part A, as \n     amended by the bill, is in effect, and to require an LEA to \n     submit subsequent revisions to its plan to the LEA for its \n     approval.\n       Section 112(5) would amend section 1112(e), relating to \n     State review and approval of LEA plans, to require that \n     States use a peer-review process in reviewing those plans, \n     and to remove some obsolete language.\n       Section 113, eligible school attendance areas [ESEA, \n     Sec. 1113]. Section 113(1) of the bill would amend section \n     1113, relating to eligible school attendance areas, to \n     clarify language relating to waivers of the normal \n     requirements for school attendance areas covered by State-\n     ordered or court-ordered desegregation plans approved by the \n     Secretary.\n       Section 113(2)(C) would restore to section 1112 the \n     authority for an LEA to continue serving an attendance area \n     for one year after it loses its eligibility. This language, \n     which was removed from the Act in 1994, would give LEAs \n     flexibility to prevent the abrupt loss of services to \n     children who can clearly benefit from them, as individual \n     attendance areas move in and out of eligibility from year to \n     year.\n       Section 113(3)(A) would add, as section 1113(c)(2)(C), \n     language to clarify that an LEA may allocate greater per-\n     child amounts of Title I funds to higher-poverty areas and \n     schools than it provides to lower-poverty areas and schools.\n       Section 113(3)(B) would amend section 1113(c)(3) to require \n     an LEA to reserve sufficient funds to serve homeless children \n     who do not attend participating schools, not just when the \n     LEA finds it ``appropriate''. Some LEAs have invoked the \n     current language as a justification for failing to provide \n     services that they should provide.\n       Section 114, schoolwide programs [ESEA, Sec. 1114]. Section \n     114(a)(1) and (2) of the bill would amend section 1114(a) of \n     the ESEA, which describes the purposes of, and eligibility \n     for, schoolwide programs under section 1114, by revising the \n     subsection heading to\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\n     more accurately reflect subsection (a)'s contents, and to \n     delete current paragraph (2), which is obsolete.\n       Section 114(a)(3)(A) would make a conforming amendment to \n     section 1114(a)(4)(A) to reflect the bill's redesignation of \n     section 1114(b)(2) as section 1114(c).\n       Section 114(a)(3)(B) would amend the prohibition on using \n     IDEA funds to support a schoolwide program to reflect the \n     fact that section 613(a)(2)(D) of the IDEA, as enacted by the \n     IDEA Amendments of 1997, now permits funds received under \n     Part B of that Act to be used to support schoolwide programs, \n     subject to certain conditions.\n       Section 114(a)(4) would delete paragraph (5) of section \n     1114(a), relating to professional development in schoolwide \n     programs. That topic is addressed by other applicable \n     provisions, including the revised statement of the required \n     elements of schoolwide programs. See, especially, proposed \n     sections 1114(b)(2)(C) and 1119.\n       Section 114(b)(1) would delete section 1114(c), which \n     duplicates other provisions relating to school improvement, \n     and section 114(b)(2) would redesignate current subsection \n     (b)(2) as subsection (c). Under this revised structure, \n     subsection (b) would list the required components of a \n     schoolwide program, and subsection (c) would describe the \n     contents of a plan for a schoolwide program.\n       Section 114(c) would revise the statement of the elements \n     of a schoolwide program in section 1114(b) in its entirety. \n     The revised statement would strengthen current law, to \n     reflect experience and research over the past several years, \n     including significant aspects of the Comprehensive School \n     Reform Demonstration program.\n       Section 114(d)(1)-(4) would amend the requirements of \n     section 1114 relating to plans for schoolwide programs \n     (current subsection (b)(2), which the bill would redesignate \n     as subsection (c)), to delete an obsolete reference and make \n     technical and conforming amendments.\n       Section 114(d)(5) would add, as section 1114(c)(3), \n     language requiring peer review and LEA approval of a \n     schoolwide plan before the school implements it.\n       Section 115, targeted assistance schools [ESEA, Sec. 1115]. \n     Section 115(1)(A)(i)(I) would make a technical amendment to \n     section 1115(b)(1)(A) of the ESEA.\n       Section 115(1)(A)(ii) would delete the requirement that \n     children be at an age at which they can benefit from an \n     organized instructional program provided at a school or other \n     educational setting in order to be eligible for services \n     under section 1115. This change would make clear that \n     preschool children of any age may be served under Part A as \n     long as they can benefit from an organized instructional \n     program.\n       Section 115(1)(B)(i) would amend section 1115(b)(2), which \n     addresses the eligibility of certain groups of children, by \n     deleting references to children who are economically \n     disadvantaged. The current reference to that category of \n     children is confusing, because it erroneously assumes that \n     there are specific eligibility requirements for them.\n       Section 115(1)(B)(ii) would clarify that children who, \n     within the prior two years, had received Title I preschool \n     services are eligible for services under Part A, as are \n     children who participated in a Head Start or Even Start \n     program in that period.\n       Section 115(1)(B)(iii) and (iv) would amend section \n     1115(b)(2)(C) and (D) to clarify that certain other groups of \n     children are eligible for services under section 1115.\n       Section 115(2)(C) would streamline section 1115(c)(1)(E), \n     relating to coordination with, and support of, the regular \n     education program.\n       Section 115(2)(D) would amend section 1115(c)(1)(F) to \n     emphasize that instructional staff must meet the standards \n     set out in revised section 1119.\n       Section 115(2)(E) would make a technical amendment to \n     section 1115(c)(1)(G).\n       Section 115(2)(F) would correct an error in section \n     1115(c)(1)(H).\n       Section 115(3) would delete section 1115(e)(3), relating to \n     professional development, because other provisions of Part A \n     would address that topic.\n       Section 115A, school choice (ESEA, Sec. 1115A]. Section \n     115A of the bill would make a conforming change to section \n     1115A(b)(4) of the ESEA.\n       Section 116, assessment and local educational agency and \n     school improvement [ESEA, Sec. 1116]. Section 116(a) of the \n     bill would revise subsections (a) through (d) of section 1116 \n     of the HSEA, in their entirety, as follows:\n       Section 1116(a), relating to LEA reviews of schools served \n     under Part A. would be revised to conform to amendments that \n     the bill would make section 1111 (State plans).\n       Section 1116(b) would provide examples of the criteria a \n     State could use in designating Distinguished Schools, and \n     would delete the cross-reference to section 1117, to reflect \n     the bill's streamlining of that section.\n       Section 1116(c)(1)-(3), relating to an LEA's obligation to \n     identify participating schools that need improvement, and to \n     take various actions to bring abut that improvement, would be \n     strengthened, consistent with the bill's overall emphasis on \n     greater accountability. In particular, section 1116(c)(3)(A) \n     would require each school so identified by an LEA, within \n     three months of being identified, to develop or revise a \n     school plan, in consultation with parents, school staff, the \n     LEA, and a State school support team or other outside \n     experts. The plan would have to have the greatest likelihood \n     of improving the performance of participating children in \n     meeting the State student performance standards, address the \n     fundamental teaching and learning needs in the school, \n     identify and address the need to improve the skills of the \n     school's staff through effective professional development, \n     identify student performance targets and goals for the next \n     three years, and specify the responsibilities of the LEA and \n     the school under the plan. The LEA would have to submit \n     the plan to a peer-review process, work with the school to \n     revise the plan as necessary, and approve it before it is \n     implemented.\n       Section 1116(c)(5)(C) would be revised to make clear that, \n     with limited exceptions, an LEA would have to take at least \n     one of a list of specified corrective actions in the case of \n     a school that fails to make progress within three years of \n     its identification as being in need of improvement. The list \n     would be limited to four possible actions, each of which is \n     intended to have serious consequences for the school, to \n     ensure that the LEA takes action that is likely to have a \n     positive effect.\n       Section 116(d), relating to SEA review of LEA programs, \n     would similarly be revised to conform to other provisions of \n     the bill relating to accountability for achievement; to \n     remove obsolete provisions; and to require an LEA that has \n     been identified by the SEA as needing improvement to submit a \n     revised Part A plan to the SEA for peer review and approval. \n     In addition, the bill would strengthen and clarify language \n     relating to the corrective actions that SEAs must take in the \n     case of an LEA that fails to make sufficient progress within \n     three years of being identified by the SEA as in need of \n     improvement.\n       Section 117, State assistance for school support and \n     improvement [ESEA, Sec. 1117]. Section 117 of the bill would \n     substantially streamline section 1117 of the ESEA, relating \n     to State support for LEA and school support and improvement. \n     Much of current section 1117 is needlessly prescriptive and \n     otherwise unnecessary, particularly in light of the \n     strengthened provisions on LEA and school improvement and \n     corrective actions in revised sections 1003(a)(2) and 1116.\n       Section 1117(a) would retain the requirement of current law \n     that each SEA establish a statewide system of intensive and \n     sustained support and improvement for LEAs and schools, in \n     order to increase the opportunity for all students in those \n     LEAs and schools to meet State standards.\n       Section 1117(b) would replace the statement of priorities \n     in current section 1117(1) with a 3-step statement of \n     priorities. The SEA would first provide support and \n     assistance to LEAs that it has identified for corrective \n     action under section 1116 and to individual schools for which \n     an LEA has failed to carry out its responsibilities under \n     that section. The SEA would then support and assist other \n     LEAs that it has identified as in need of improvement under \n     section 1116, but that it has not identified as in need of \n     corrective action. Finally, the SEA would support and assist \n     other LEAs and schools that need those services in order to \n     achieve Title I's purpose.\n       Section 1117(c) would provide examples of approaches the \n     SEA could use in providing support and assistance to LEAs and \n     schools.\n       Section 1117(d) would direct each SEA to use the funds \n     available to it for technical assistance and support under \n     section 1003(a)(1) (other than the 70 percent or more that it \n     reserves under section 1003(a)(2)) to carry out section 1117, \n     and would permit the SEA to also use the funds it reserves \n     for State administration under redesignated section 1701(c) \n     (current section 1603(c)) for that purpose.\n       Section 118, parental involvement [ESEA, Sec. 1118]. \n     Section 118 (1), (2), and (3) would make conforming \n     amendments to section 1118, relating to parental involvement \n     in Part A programs.\n       Section 118(4) would amend section 1118(f) so that the \n     requirement to provide full opportunities for participation \n     by parents with limited English proficiency and parents with \n     disabilities, to the extent practicable, applies to all Part \n     A activities, not just to the specific provisions relating to \n     parental involvement.\n       Section 118(5) would repeal subsection (g) of section 1118, \n     to reflect the bill's proposed repeal of the Goals 2000: \n     Educate America Act.\n       Section 119, teacher qualification and professional \n     development [ESEA, Sec. 1119]. Section 119(1) would change \n     the heading of section 1119 to ``High-Quality Instruction'' \n     to reflect amendments made to this section that are designed \n     to ensure that participating children receive high-quality \n     instruction.\n       Section 119(2) of the bill would delete subsection (f) of \n     section 1119, which is not needed, and redesignate \n     subsections (b) through (e) and (g) of that section as \n     subsections (d) through (h).\n       Section 119(3) would insert a new subsection (a) in section \n     1119 to require that each participating LEA hire qualified \n     instructional staff, provide high-quality professional \n     development to staff members, and use at least five percent \n     of its Part A grant for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, and 10 \n     percent of its grant for each year thereafter, for that \n     professional development.\n       Section 119(4) would insert new subsections (b) and (c) in \n     section 1119 to specify the minimum qualifications for \n     teachers and for paraprofessionals in programs supported with \n     Part A funds. These requirements are designed to ensure that \n     participating children receive high-quality instruction and \n     assistance, so that they can meet challenging State \n     standards.\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\n       Section 119(5)(A) would revise the list of required \n     professional development activities in current section \n     1119(b), which would be redesignated as section 1119(c), to \n     reflect experience and research on the most effective \n     approaches to professional development.\n       Section 119(5)(B)(iii) would add child-care providers to \n     those with whom an LEA could choose to conduct joint \n     professional development activities under redesignated \n     section 1119(d)(2)(H) (current section 1119(b)(2)(H)).\n       Section 119(6) would make a conforming amendment to section \n     1119(g), which would be redesignated as section 1119(h), \n     relating to the combined use of funds from multiple sources \n     to provide professional development.\n       Section 120, participation of children enrolled in private \n     schools [ESEA, Sec. 1120]. Section 120(1)(A) of the bill \n     would add, to section 1120(a)'s statement of an LEA's \n     responsibility to provide for the equitable participation of \n     students from private schools, language to make clear that \n     the services provided those children are to address their \n     needs, and that the teachers and parents of these students \n     participate on an equitable basis in services and activities \n     under sections 1118 and 1119 (parental involvement and \n     professional development).\n       Section 120(1)(B) would amend section 1120(a)(4) to give \n     each LEA the option of determining the number of poor \n     children in private schools every year, as under current law, \n     or every two years.\n       Section 120(2)(A) (ii) and (iii) would amend section \n     1120(b)(1), relating to the topics on which an LEA consults \n     with private school officials about services to children in \n     those schools, to include: (1) how the results of the \n     assessments of the services the LEA provides will be used to \n     improve those services; (2) the amounts of funds generated by \n     poor children in each participating attendance area; (3) the \n     method or sources of data that the LEA uses to determine the \n     number of those children; and (4) how and when the LEA will \n     make decisions about the delivery of services to those \n     children.\n       Section 120(2)(B)(i) would amend section 1120(b)(2) to \n     require that an LEA's consultation with private school \n     officials include meetings. Consultations through telephone \n     conversations and similar methods, while still permissible, \n     would not, by themselves, be sufficient.\n       Section 120(2)(B)(ii) would amend section 1120(b)(2) to \n     clarify that LEA-private school consultations are to continue \n     throughout the implementation and assessment of the LEA's \n     Part A program.\n       Section 120(3) would revise cross-references in section \n     1120(d)(2) to reflect the redesignation of sections by other \n     provisions of the bill.\n       Section 120(4) would delete subsection (e) of section \n     1120(b), which authorizes the award of separate grants to \n     States to help them pay for capital expenses that States and \n     LEAs incur in providing services to children who attend \n     private schools. In light of the Supreme Court's 1997 \n     decision in Agostini v. Felton, which allows LEAs to provide \n     Title I services on the premises of parochial schools, this \n     authority is no longer needed.\n       Section 120A, fiscal requirements [ESEA, Sec. 1120A]. \n     Section 120A(1) of the bill would make a conforming amendment \n     to a cross-reference in section 1120A(a) of the ESEA, which \n     requires an LEA to maintain fiscal effort as a condition of \n     receiving Part A funds.\n       Section 120a(2) would amend section 1120A(c) of the ESEA, \n     which requires a participating LEA to ensure that it provides \n     services in Title I schools, from State and local sources, \n     that are at least comparable to the services it provides in \n     its other schools.\n       Section 120a(2)(A) would amend section 1120A(c)(2) to \n     replace the current criteria for determining comparability \n     with three criteria that would capture the concept of \n     comparability more fairly and thoroughly. LEAs would be given \n     until July 1, 2002, to comply with these new criteria.\n       Section 120A(2)(B) would amend section 1120A(c)(3)(B) to \n     require LEAs to update their records documenting compliance \n     with the comparability requirement annually, rather than \n     every two years.\n       Section 120B, preschool services and coordination \n     requirements [ESEA, Sec. 1120B]. Section 120B(1) of the bill \n     would amend the heading of section 1120B of the ESEA to read \n     ``Preschool Services; Coordination Requirements'' to more \n     accurately reflect its content.\n       Section 120B(2) would make a technical amendment to section \n     1120B(c), relating to coordination of Title I regulations \n     with Head Start regulations issued by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, to reflect enactment of the Head \n     Start Amendments of 1998.\n       Section 120B(3) would add a subsection (d) to section 1120B \n     to provide additional direction to preschool programs carried \n     out with Part A funds, and to ensure that those programs are \n     of high quality. This language replaces, and builds on, \n     current section 1112(c)(1)(H).\n       Section 120C, allocations [ESEA, Sec. Sec. 1121-1127]. \n     Section 120C(a) of the bill would amend section 1121(b) of \n     the ESEA, which authorizes assistance to the outlying areas, \n     to correct an internal cross-reference in paragraph (1) and \n     to make the $5 million total for assistance to the Freely \n     Associated States (FAS) a maximum rather than a fixed annual \n     amount. The Secretary should have the flexibility to \n     determine that an amount less than the full $5 million may be \n     warranted for the FAS in any given year, particularly in \n     light of possible revisions to their respective compacts of \n     free association.\n       Section 120C(b) would amend section 1122 of the ESEA, which \n     governs the allocation of Part A funds to the States, by: (1) \n     removing provisions that have expired; (2) describing the \n     amount to be available for targeted assistance grants under \n     section 1125; (3) providing for proportionate reductions in \n     State allocations in case of insufficient appropriations; and \n     (4) retaining the provisions on ``hold-harmless'' amounts \n     that apply to fiscal year 1999. Most of the substance of law \n     that is currently applicable would be retained, but the \n     section as a whole would be significantly shortened.\n       Section 120C(c)(1)(A) would clarify (without substantive \n     change) section 1124(a)(1), relating to the allocation of \n     basic grants to LEAs.\n       Section 120C(c)(1)(B) would redesignate paragraphs (3) and \n     (4) of section 1124(a) as paragraphs (4) and (5).\n       Section 120C(c)(1)(C) would revise, in their entirety, the \n     statutory provisions governing the calculation of LEA basic \n     grants in section 1124(a)(2) and move some of those \n     provisions to section 1124(a)(3) to improve the section's \n     structure and readability. As amended, section 1124(a)(2)(A) \n     would direct the Secretary to make allocations on an LEA-by-\n     LEA basis, unless the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce \n     (who is responsible for the decennial census and other \n     activities of the Bureau of the Census) determine the LEA-\n     level data on poor children is unreliable or that its use \n     would otherwise be inappropriate. In that case, the two \n     Secretaries would announce the reasons for their \n     determination, and the Secretary would make allocations on \n     the basis of county data, rather than LEA data, in accordance \n     with new paragraph (3).\n       For any fiscal year for which the Secretary allocates funds \n     to LEAs, rather than to counties, section 1124(a)(2)(B) would \n     clarify that the amount of a grant to any LEA with a \n     population of 20,000 or more is the amount determined by the \n     Secretary. For LEAs with fewer people, the SEA could either \n     allocate the amount determined by the Secretary or use an \n     alternative method, approved by the Secretary, that best \n     reflects the distribution of poor families among the State's \n     small LEAs.\n       For any fiscal year for which the Secretary allocates funds \n     to counties, rather than to LEAs, section 1124(a)(3) would \n     direct the States to suballocate those funds to LEAs, in \n     accordance with the Secretary's regulations. A State could \n     propose to allocate funds directly to LEAs without regard to \n     the county allocations calculated by the Secretary if a large \n     number of its LEAs overlap county boundaries, or if it \n     believes it has data that would better target funds than \n     allocating them initially by counties.\n       In general, paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 1124(a) would \n     retain current law, while eliminating extraneous or obsolete \n     provisions, and making this portion of the statute much \n     easier to read and understand than current law.\n       Section 120C(c)(1)(D) would revise language relating to \n     Puerto Rico's Part A allocation (current section 1124(a)(3), \n     which the bill would redesignate as section 1124(a)(4)) so \n     that, over a 5-year phase-in period, its allocation would be \n     determined on the same basis as are the allocations to the 50 \n     States and the District of Columbia.\n       Section 120C(c)(2) would amend section 1124(b), relating to \n     the minimum number of poor children needed to qualify for a \n     basic grant, to improve its readability and to delete \n     obsolete language.\n       Section 120C(c)(3)(A)(ii) would amend section 1124(c)(1), \n     which describes the children to be counted in determining an \n     LEA's eligibility for, and the amount of, a basic grant, to \n     delete subparagraph (B), which permits the inclusion of \n     certain children whose families have income above the poverty \n     level. The number of these children is now quite small, and \n     collection of reliable data on them is burdensome.\n       Section 120C(c)(3)(A)(iii) would amend section \n     1124(c)(1)(C), relating to counts of certain children who are \n     neglected or delinquent, to give the Secretary the \n     flexibility to use the number of those children for either \n     the preceding year (required by current law) or for the \n     second preceding year.\n       Section 120C(c)(3)(B)(ii) would delete the 3rd and 4th \n     sentences of section 1124(c)(2), which provide a special, and \n     unwarranted, benefit to a single LEA.\n       Section 120C(c)(3)(C) would update section 1124(c)(3), \n     relating to census updates.\n       Section 120C(c)(3)(D) would repeal section 1124(c)(4), \n     relating to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, \n     which has been completed, and redesignate paragraphs (5) and \n     (6) of section 1124(c) as paragraphs (4) and (5).\n       Section 120C(c)(3)(E)(i) would delete the first sentence of \n     current section 1124(c)(5), which the bill would redesignate \n     as section 1124(c)(4). This language, relating to counts of \n     certain children from families with incomes above the poverty \n     level, would no longer be needed in light of the deletion of \n     these children from the count of children under section \n     1124(c)(1), described above.\n       Section 120C(c)(3)(E)(iii) and (F) would move, from current \n     section 1124(c)(6) to current section 1124(c)(5) (to be \n     redesignated as section 1124(c)(4)) a sentence about the \n     counting of children in correctional institutions. This \n     provides a more logical location for this provision.\n       Section 120C(c)(4)(B) would make a conforming amendment to \n     section 1124(d).\n       Section 120C(d)(1)(A)(i) would remove obsolete language \n     from section 1124A(a)(1)(A) of\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\n     the ESEA, which sets eligibility criteria for LEAs to receive \n     concentration grants under section 1124A. The current \n     eligibility criteria would be retained.\n       Section 120C(d)(1)(A)(ii) would make conforming amendments \n     to section 1124A(a)(1)(B), relating to minimum allocations to \n     States.\n       Section 120C(d)(1)(B) would replace the lengthy and \n     complicated language in section 1124A(a)(4), relating to \n     calculation of LEA concentration grant amounts, with a simple \n     cross-reference to the streamlined allocation provisions in \n     section 1124(a)(3) and (4). Since the applicable rules are \n     the same, there is no need to repeat them. In addition, the \n     revised section 1124A(a)(4)(B) would retain the authority, \n     unique to the allocation of concentration grants, under which \n     a State may use up to two percent of its allocation for \n     subgrants to LEAs that meet the numerical eligibility \n     thresholds but are located in ineligible counties.\n       Section 120C(d)(2) would delete subsections (b) and (c) \n     from section 1124A and redesignate subsection (d) as \n     subsection (b). Subsection (b), relating to the total amount \n     available for concentration grants, would be replaced by \n     section 1122(a)(2). Subsection (c), providing for ratably \n     reduced allocations in the case of insufficient funds, \n     duplicates proposed section 1122(c).\n       Section 120C(e)(1) would make conforming amendments to \n     section 1125(b) of the ESEA, relating to the calculation of \n     targeted assistance grants under section 1125.\n       Section 120C(e)(2) would amend section 1125(c), which \n     establishes weighted child counts used to calculate targeted \n     assistance grants for both counties and LEAs, by deleting \n     obsolete provisions and making technical and conforming \n     amendments.\n       Section 120C(e)(3) would replace the lengthy and \n     complicated language in section 1125(d), relating to \n     calculation of targeted assistance grant amounts, with a \n     simple cross-reference to the streamlined allocation \n     provisions in section 1124(a)(3) and (4). Since the \n     applicable rules are the same, there is no need to repeat \n     them.\n       Section 120C(e)(4) would make a conforming amendment to \n     section 1125(e).\n       Section 120C(f) would repeal section 1125A(e) of the ESEA, \n     which authorizes appropriations for education finance \n     incentive programs under section 1125A, and make conforming \n     amendments to that section. Appropriations for this provision \n     would be covered by the general authorization of \n     appropriations for Part A of Title I in section 1002(a).\n       Section 120C(g) would make a conforming amendment to \n     section 1126(a)(1), relating to allocations for neglected \n     children.\n       Section 120D, program indicators [ESEA, Sec. 1131]. Section \n     120D of the bill would add a new Subpart 3, Program \n     Indicators, to Part A of Title I of the ESEA. Subpart 3 would \n     contain only one section, Sec. 1131, which would identify 7 \n     program indicators relating to schools participating in the \n     Part A program, on which States would report annually to the \n     Secretary.\n     Part B--Even Start\n       Part B of Title I of the bill would amend Part B of Title I \n     of the ESEA, which authorizes the Even Start program.\n       Section 121, statement of purpose [ESEA, Sec. 1201]. \n     Section 121 of the bill would amend the Even Start statement \n     of purposes in section 1201 of the ESEA by requiring that the \n     existing community resources on which Even Start programs are \n     built be of high quality, and by adding a requirement that \n     Even Start programs be based on the best available research \n     on language development, reading instruction, and prevention \n     of reading difficulties. These amendments would reflect \n     amendments made to other provisions of the Even Start statute \n     in 1998 and enactment of the Reading Excellence Act (Title \n     II, Part C of the ESEA) in that same year.\n       Section 122, program authorized [ESEA, Sec. 1201]. Section \n     122(1) of the bill would amend section 1202(a) of the ESEA, \n     which directs the Secretary to reserve 5 percent of each \n     year's Even Start appropriation for certain populations and \n     areas. As revised, section 1202(a) would emphasize that \n     programs funded under the 5-percent reservation are meant to \n     serve as national models; retain the current requirement to \n     support projects for the children of migratory workers, \n     Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and the outlying \n     areas; specify that the amount reserved each year for the \n     outlying areas is one-half of one percent of the available \n     funds; and permit the Secretary to fund projects that serve \n     additional populations (such as homeless families, families \n     that include children with severe disabilities, and families \n     that include incarcerated mothers of young children). The \n     latter provision would replace the current requirement to \n     award a grant for a program in a woman's prison when \n     appropriations reach a certain level.\n       Section 122(2) of the bill would amend section 1202(b) of \n     the ESEA, which authorizes the Secretary to reserve up to 3 \n     percent of each year's appropriation for evaluation and \n     technical assistance. Because other provisions of the bill \n     would provide a new authority to fund evaluations across the \n     entire range of ESEA programs, the specific reference to \n     evaluations would be deleted here, and the maximum set-aside \n     for technical assistance (the remaining activity under this \n     provision) would be one percent. In addition, section 1202(b) \n     would permit the Secretary to provide technical assistance \n     directly, as well as through grants and contracts.\n       Section 122(3) of the bill would amend section 1202(c) of \n     the ESEA, which directs the Secretary to spend $10 million \n     each year on competitive grants for interagency coordination \n     of statewide family literacy initiatives, to make these \n     awards permissive rather than mandatory, and to remove the \n     specific dollar amount that must be devoted to these awards \n     each year. The Secretary should have the flexibility to \n     determine the ongoing need for these awards, as well as the \n     amount devoted to them, and whether program funds should be \n     devoted instead to services to children and families.\n       Section 122(4) and (5) would make technical and conforming \n     amendments to section 1202(d) and (e).\n       Section 122(5)(A) would amend the definition of ``eligible \n     organization'' in section 1202(e)(2) to permit for-profit, as \n     well as nonprofit, organizations to qualify as providers of \n     technical assistance under section 1202(b). The current \n     limitation unnecessarily limits the pool of providers, \n     excluding some who are highly qualified.\n       Section 123, State programs [ESEA, Sec. 1203]. Section \n     123(1) of the bill would redesignate subsections (a) and (b) \n     of section 1203 of the ESEA as subsections (b) and (c) and \n     insert a new subsection (a) relating to State plans. New \n     subsection (a)(1) would require a State that wants an Even \n     Start grant to submit a State plan to the Secretary, \n     including certain key information specified in the bill, \n     including the State's indicators of program quality, which \n     the 1998 amendments require each State to develop. Subsection \n     (a)(2) would parallel language relating to State plans under \n     Part A of Title I by providing that each State's plan would \n     cover the duration of its participation in the program and \n     requiring the State to periodically review it and revise it \n     as necessary.\n       Section 123(3) and (4) of the bill would make technical and \n     conforming amendments to section 1203.\n       Section 124, uses of funds [ESEA, Sec. 1204]. Section \n     124(1) of the bill would amend section 1204(a) of the ESEA, \n     relating to the permissible uses of Even Start funds, by \n     replacing a reference to ``family-centered education \n     programs'' with ``family literacy services''. ``Family \n     literacy services'' is the term used elsewhere in the statute \n     and defined in section 1202(e)(3).\n       Section 124(2) would make a conforming amendment to section \n     1204(b)(1).\n       Section 125, program elements [ESEA, Sec. 1205]. Section \n     125 of the bill would restate, in its entirety, section 1205 \n     of the ESEA, which lists the required elements of each Even \n     Start program. This restatement would provide helpful \n     clarification and greater readability for some of these \n     elements; reorder the elements in a more logical sequence; \n     add some new elements; and move certain requirements that \n     now apply to local applications and State award of \n     subgrants (under sections 1207(c)(1) and 1208(a)(1)) to \n     the list of program elements, where they more logically \n     belong.\n       In particular, career counseling and job-placement services \n     would be added to the examples of services that can be \n     offered as a way to accommodate participants' work schedules \n     and other responsibilities under paragraph (3). Paragraph (4) \n     would be revised to require that instructional programs \n     integrate all the elements of family literacy services and \n     use instructional approaches that, according to the best \n     available research, will be most effective. Paragraph (5) \n     would contain new requirements relating to the qualifications \n     of instructional staff and paraprofessionals that parallel \n     the requirements proposed, under section 1119, for Part A and \n     that are designed to ensure that Even Start participants \n     receive high-quality services. Paragraph (6) (currently (5)) \n     would add a new requirement that staff training be aimed at \n     helping staff obtain certification in relevant instructional \n     areas, as well as the necessary skills. Paragraph (8) \n     (currently (9)) would add (to language incorporated from \n     current section 1207(c)(1)(E)(ii)) a specific reference to \n     individuals with disabilities as included among those who may \n     be most in need of services. Paragraph (9) would clarify and \n     consolidate, into a single element, the various statutory \n     provisions that promote the retention of families in Even \n     Start programs, including the requirement of current \n     paragraph (7) to operate on a year-round basis, the \n     requirement of current section 1208(a)(1)(C) to provide \n     services for at least a 3-year age range, and the language in \n     current section 1207(c)(1)(E)(iii) about encouraging \n     participating families to remain in the program for a \n     sufficient period of time to meet their program goals.\n       This updated statement of program elements reflects \n     experience and research over the past several years. It will \n     promote better program planning and higher quality programs, \n     with better results for participating families.\n       Section 126, eligible participants [ESEA, Sec. 1206]. \n     Section 126 of the bill would amend section 1206(a)(1)(B) of \n     the ESEA to restore the eligibility of teenage parents who \n     are attending school, but who are above the State's age for \n     compulsory school attendance. As amended in 1994, the current \n     statute terminates a parent's eligibility when he or she is \n     no longer within the State's age range for compulsory school \n     attendance, excluding many teen parents and their children \n     who could benefit from Even Start services.\n       Section 127, applications [ESEA, Sec. 1207]. Section 127(a) \n     of the bill would amend section 1207(c) of the ESEA, relating \n     to local Even Start plans, by emphasizing the importance of \n     continuous program improvement; requiring a local program's \n     goals to include outcome goals for participating children and\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\n     families that are consistent with the State's program \n     indicators; emphasize that the program must address each of \n     the program elements in the revised section 1205; and require \n     each program to have a plan for rigorous and objective \n     evaluation. Current subparagraphs (E) and (F) of section \n     1207(c)(1) would be deleted because the substance of those \n     provisions would be addressed in the revised statement of \n     program elements in section 1205.\n       Section 127(b) of the bill would delete subsection (d) of \n     section 1207, which purports to allow an eligible entity to \n     submit its local Even Start plan as part of an SEA's \n     consolidated application under Title XIV of the ESEA. This \n     provision has had no practical effect.\n       Section 128, award of subgrants [ESEA, Sec. 1208]. Section \n     128(a)(1) of the bill would amend section 1208(a)(1) of the \n     ESEA, relating to a State's criteria for selecting local \n     programs for Even Start subgrants, by deleting subparagraph \n     (C), which refers to a three-year age range for providing \n     services, because that provision would be converted to a \n     program element under section 1205. Section 128(a)(1) would \n     also make technical and clarifying amendments to section \n     1208(a)(1).\n       Section 128(a)(2) would amend section 1208(a)(3) to require \n     a State's review panel to include an individual with \n     expertise in family literacy programs, to enhance the quality \n     of the panel's review and selections. Inclusion of one or \n     more of the types of individuals described in section \n     1208(a)(3)(A)-(E) would be made optional, rather than \n     mandatory.\n       Section 128(b) of the bill would add a new authority, as \n     section 1208(c), for each State to continue Even Start \n     funding, for up to two years beyond the statutory 8-year \n     limit, for not more than two projects in the State that have \n     been highly successful and that show substantial potential to \n     serve as models for other projects throughout the Nation and \n     as mentor sites for other family literacy projects in the \n     State. This would allow States and localities to learn \n     valuable lessons from well-tested, proven programs.\n       Section 129, evaluation [ESEA, Sec. 1209]. Section 129 of \n     the bill would delete paragraph (3) from the national \n     evaluation provisions in section 1209 of the ESEA. That \n     paragraph describes certain technical assistance activities \n     that are more appropriately addressed under section 1202(b).\n       Section 130, program indicators [ESEA, Sec. 1210]. Section \n     130 of the bill would amend section 1210 of the ESEA to set a \n     deadline of September 30, 2000 for States to develop the \n     indicators of program quality required by the 1998 \n     amendments. Those amendments did not include any deadline for \n     the development of those indicators. In addition, the bill \n     would add, to the current indicators that States are to \n     develop, indicators relating to the levels of intensity of \n     services and the duration of participating children and \n     adults needed to reach the outcomes the States specifies for \n     the currently required indicators.\n       Section 130A, repeal and redesignation [ESEA, \n     Sec. Sec. 1211 and 1212]. Section 131(a) of the bill would \n     repeal section 1211 of the ESEA, relating to research. The \n     essential elements of this section would be incorporated into \n     the revised section on evaluations (Sec. 1209). Section \n     131(b) of the bill would redesignate section 1212 of the ESEA \n     as section 1211.\n     Part C--Education of migratory children\n       Part C of Title I of the bill would amend Part C of Title I \n     of the ESEA, which authorizes grants to State educational \n     agencies to establish and improve programs of education for \n     children of migratory farmworkers and fishers, to enable them \n     to meet the same high academic standards as other children.\n       Section 131, State allocations [ESEA, Sec. 1301]. Section \n     131(1) of the bill would amend section 1303(a) of the ESEA, \n     which describes how available funds are allocated to States \n     each year. The bill would replace the current provisions \n     relating to the count of migratory children, which are based \n     on estimates and full-time equivalents (FTE) of these \n     children. These provisions are ambiguous, and require either \n     a burdensome collection of data or the continued use of \n     increasingly dated FTE adjustment factors based on 1994 data. \n     The bill would base a State's child count on the number of \n     eligible children, aged 3 thru 21, residing in the State in \n     the previous year, plus the number of those children who \n     received services under Part C in summer or intersession \n     programs provided by the State. This approach would be simple \n     to understand and administer, minimize data-collection burden \n     on States, and encourage the identification and recruitment \n     of eligible children. The double weight given to children \n     served in summer or intersession programs would reflect the \n     greater cost of those programs, and would encourage States to \n     provide them.\n       Section 131(1) would also add, to section 1303(a), a new \n     paragraph (2), which would establish minimum and maximums for \n     annual State allocations. No State would be allocated more \n     than 120 percent, or less than 80 percent, of its allocation \n     for the previous year, except that each State would be \n     allocated at least $200,000. The link to a State's prior-year \n     allocation would ameliorate the disruptive effects of \n     substantial increases and decreases in State child counts \n     from year to year, which are typical among migratory \n     children. The $200,000 minimum would ensure that each \n     participating State receives enough funds to carry out an \n     effective program, including the costs of finding eligible \n     children and encouraging them to participate in the program.\n       Section 131(2) would revise subsection (b), which describes \n     the computation of Puerto Rico's allocation, so that, over a \n     5-year phase-in period, its allocation would be determined on \n     the same basis as are the allocations of the 50 States.\n       Section 131(3) would delete subsections (d) and (e) of \n     section 1303, relating to certain consortia formed by LEAs \n     and the mehods the Secretary must follow to detemine the \n     estimated number of migratory children in each State, \n     respectively. Subsection (d) is unduly burdensome for States \n     and the Department to administer, and consortia can be \n     addressed more effectively through incentive grants under \n     section 1308(d). Subsection (e) would have no further \n     relevance under the revised child-count provisions of section \n     1303(a)(1).\n       Section 132, State applications [ESEA, Sec. 1304]. Section \n     132 of the bill would amend section 1304 of the ESEA, which \n     requires States to submit applications for grants under the \n     Migrant Education program, describes the children who are to \n     be given priority for services, and authorizes the provision \n     of services to certain categories of children who are no \n     longer migratory.\n       Section 131(1)(A) would amend section 1304(b)(1) to require \n     the State's application to include certain material that is \n     now required to be in its comprehensive plan (but not in its \n     application) under section 1306(a). This reflects the \n     proposed repeal of the requirement for a comprehensive \n     service-delivery plan that is separate from the State's \n     application for funds, in order to streamline program \n     requirements and reduce paperwork burden on States.\n       Section 132(1)(B) would amend section 1304(b)(5) to clarify \n     the factors that States are to consider when making subgrants \n     to local operating agencies.\n       Section 132(1)(C) would redesignate paragraphs (5) and (6) \n     of section 1304(b) as paragraphs (6) and (7), respectively.\n       Section 132(1)(D) would insert a new paragraph (5) in \n     section 1304(b) to require a State's application to describe \n     how the State will encourage migratory children to \n     participate in State assessments required under Part A of \n     Title I.\n       Section 132(2)(A) and (B) would make technical and \n     conforming amendments to section 1304(c)(1) and (2).\n       Section 132(2)(C) would strengthen the requirements of \n     section 1304(c)(3) relating to the involvement of parents and \n     parent advisory councils.\n       Section 132(2)(D) would make a conforming amendment to \n     section 1304(c)(7) to reflect the bill's amendments relating \n     to child counts.\n       Section 133, authorized activities [ESEA, Sec. 1306]. \n     Section 133 of the bill would restate, in its entirety, \n     section 1306 of the ESEA, to delete the requirement that a \n     participating State develop a comprehensive service-\n     delivery plan that is separate from its application for \n     funds under section 1304. The important elements of this \n     plan would be incorporated into section 1304, as amended \n     by section 132 of the bill. In addition, section 1306(a) \n     would clarify current provisions regarding priority in the \n     use of program funds; the use of those funds to provide \n     services described in Part A to children who are eligible \n     for services under both the Migrant Education program and \n     Part A; and the prohibition on using program funds to \n     provide services that are available from other sources.\n       Section 134, coordination of migrant education activities \n     [ESEA, Sec. 1308]. Section 134 of the bill would amend \n     section 1308 of the ESEA, which authorizes various activities \n     to support the interstate and intrastate coordination of \n     migrant-education activities.\n       Section 134(1)(A) would make for profit entities eligible \n     for awards under section 1308(a). The current restriction to \n     nonprofit entities has made it difficult to find \n     organizations with the necessary technical expertise and \n     experience to carry out certain important activities, such as \n     the 1-800 help line and the program support center.\n       Section 134(1)(B) would make a technical amendment to \n     section 1308(a)(2).\n       Section 134(2) would amend section 1308(b) to remove \n     obsolete provisions relating to the records of migratory \n     children and to conform to the proposed deletion of \n     references in section 1303 to the ``full-time equivalent'' \n     numbers of those students in determining child counts.\n       Section 134(3) would increase, from $6,000,000 to \n     $10,000,000, the maximum amount that the Secretary could \n     reserve each year from the appropriation for the Migrant \n     Education program to support coordination activities under \n     section 1308. This increase would be consistent with the \n     Department's appropriations Acts for the two most recent \n     fiscal years, increase the amount available for State \n     incentive grants under section 1308(d), and make funds \n     available to assist States and LEAs in transferring the \n     school records of migratory students.\n       Section 134(4) would amend section 1308(d), which \n     authorizes incentive grants to States that form consortia to \n     improve the delivery of services to migratory children whose \n     education is interrupted. These grants would be permitted, \n     rather than required as under current law, so that the \n     Secretary would have the flexibility to determine, from year \n     to year, whether funds ought to be devoted to other \n     activities under section 1308. The maximum amount that could \n     be reserved for these grants would be increased from $1.5 \n     million to $3 million so that, in years when these grants are \n     warranted, they can be made to more than a token number of \n     States. The requirement to make these awards on a competitive \n     basis would be deleted because it is needlessly restrictive \n     and\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\n     results in an unduly complicated process of determining the \n     merits of applications in relation to each other in years \n     when all applications warrant approval and sufficient funds \n     are available. Deleting this requirement would provide the \n     Secretary with flexibility to, for example, award equal \n     amounts to each consortium with an approvable application, or \n     to provide larger awards to consortia including States that \n     receive relatively small allocations under section 1303.\n       Section 135, definitions [ESEA, Sec. 1309). Section 135 of \n     the bill would delete two references to a child's guardian in \n     the definition of ``migratory child'' in section 1309(2) of \n     the ESEA, because the term ``parent''. which is also used in \n     that section, is defined in section 14101(22) of the ESEA \n     (which the bill would redesignate as section 11101(22)) to \n     include ``a legal guardian or other person standing in loco \n     parentis''.\n     Part D--Neglected and delinquent\n       Part D of Title I of the bill would amend Part D of Title I \n     of the ESEA, which authorizes assistance to States and, \n     through the States, to local agencies, to provide educational \n     services to children and youth who are neglected or \n     delinquent.\n       Section 141, program name. Section 141 of the bill would \n     amend the heading of Part D of Title I of the ESEA to read, \n     ``State Agency Programs for Children and Youth Who Are \n     Neglected or Delinquent''. This name would more accurately \n     reflect the bill's proposed deletion of the authority for \n     local programs in Subpart 2 of Part D.\n       Section 142 findings; purpose; program authorized [ESEA, \n     Sec. 1401]. Section 142(a) of the bill would update the \n     findings in section 1401(a) of the ESEA, and shorten them to \n     reflect the proposed deletion of Subpart 2.\n       Section 142(b) would amend the statement of purpose in \n     section 1401(b) to reflect the proposed deletion of Subpart \n     2.\n       Section 142(c) would amend the statement of the program's \n     authorization in section 1401(b) to reflect the proposed \n     deletion of Subpart 2.\n       Section 143, payments for programs under Part D [ESEA, \n     Sec. 1402]. Section 143 of the bill would delete section \n     1402(b) of the ESEA, which requires that States retain funds \n     generated throughout the State under Part A of Title I (Basic \n     Grants) on the basis of youth residing in local correctional \n     facilities or attending community day programs for delinquent \n     children and youth, and use those Part A funds for local \n     programs under subpart 2 of Part D. This conforms to the \n     bill's proposal to delete Subpart 2. Section 142 would also \n     make other conforming amendments to section 1402.\n       Section 144, allocation of funds [ESEA, Sec. 1412]. Section \n     144 of the bill would amend section 1412(b) of the ESEA, \n     which describes the computation of Puerto Rico's allocation \n     under Part D, so that, over a 5-year phase-in period, its \n     allocation would be determined on the same basis as are the \n     allocations of the 50 States. Section 144 would also make \n     conforming and technical amendments to section 1412(a).\n       Section 145, State plan and State agency applications \n     [ESEA, Sec. 1414]. Section 145(2)(A) of the bill would amend \n     section 1414(a)(2) of the Act, relating to the contents of a \n     State's plan, to require the plan to provide that \n     participating children will be held to the same challenging \n     academic standards, as well as given the same opportunity to \n     learn, as they would if they were attending local public \n     schools. Section 145 would also correct erroneous citations \n     in section 1414.\n       Section 146, use of funds [ESEA, Sec. 1415]. Section 146 of \n     the bill would correct an erroneous citation in section 1415 \n     of the ESEA, relating to the permissible use of Part D funds.\n       Section 147, local agency programs [ESEA, Sec. Sec. 1412-\n     1426]. Section 147 of the bill would repeal Subpart 2 (Local \n     Agency Programs) of Part D and redesignate Subpart 3 (General \n     Provisions) as Subpart 2. The local agency program is unduly \n     complicated for States to administer and does not promote \n     effective services for children who are, or have been, \n     neglected or delinquent. Those services are better provided \n     through other local, State, and Federal programs, including \n     other ESEA programs, such as Basic Grants under Part A.\n       Section 148, program evaluations [ESEA, Sec. 1431]. Section \n     148(1) of the bill would amend section 1431(a) of the ESEA, \n     relating to the scope of evaluations under Part D, to conform \n     to the proposed repeal of Subpart 2.\n       Section 148(2) would amend section 1431(b) to require that \n     the multiple measures of student progress that a State agency \n     must use in conducting program evaluations, while consistent \n     with section 1414's requirement to provide participating \n     children the same opportunities to learn and to hold them to \n     the same standards that would apply if they were attending \n     local public schools, must be appropriate for the students \n     and feasible for the agency. This modification would \n     recognize that, for a variety of reasons, it may not be \n     appropriate to administer the same tests to students who are, \n     or have been, neglected or delinquent, as are given to \n     children of the same age who are in traditional public \n     schools.\n       Section 148(3) of the bill would amend section 1431(c), \n     relating to the results of evaluations, to reflect the \n     proposed repeal of Subpart 2.\n       Section 149, definitions [ESEA, Sec. 1432]. Section 149 of \n     the bill would delete the definition of ``at-risk youth'' in \n     paragraph (2) of section 1432, and renumber the remaining \n     paragraphs. The deleted term is used only in Subpart 2, which \n     would be repealed.\n     Part E--Federal evaluations, demonstrations, and transition \n         projects\n       Section 151, evaluations, management information, and other \n     Federal activities [ESEA, Sec. 1501]. Section 151 of the bill \n     would amend, in its entirety, section 1501 of the ESEA, which \n     authorizes the Secretary to conduct evaluations and \n     assessments, collect data, and carry out other activities \n     that support the Title I programs and provide information \n     useful to those who authorize and administer that title. As \n     revised, section 1501 would support the activities that are \n     essential for the Secretary to carry out over the next \n     several years: evaluating Title I programs; helping States, \n     LEAs, and schools develop management-information systems; \n     carrying out applied research, technical assistance, \n     dissemination, and recognition activities; and obtaining \n     updated census information so that funds are allocated using \n     the most up-to-date information about low-income families. \n     Section 1501 would also provide for the continued conduct of \n     the national assessment of Title I and the national \n     longitudinal study of Title I schools.\n       Section 1502, demonstrations of innovative practices. \n     Section 152 of the bill would make conforming amendments to \n     section 1502 of the ESEA.\n     Part F--General provisions\n       Section 161, general provisions [ESEA, Sec. Sec. 1601-\n     1604]. Section 161(1) of the bill would repeal sections 1601 \n     and 1602 of the ESEA. Section 1601 sets out highly \n     prescriptive requirements relating to regulations under Title \n     I that should not be retained. Instead, Title I, like other \n     ESEA programs, should remain subject to the rulemaking \n     requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and of \n     section 437 of the General Education Provisions Act. Section \n     1602 requires the Secretary to issue a program assistance \n     manual and to respond to certain inquiries within 90 days. \n     These are similarly inappropriate and unwarranted \n     restrictions on the Secretary's discretion in administering \n     the Title I program.\n       Section 161(2) would redesignate sections 1603 and 1604 as \n     sections 1601 and 1602.\n     Part G--Reading excellence\n       Section 171, reading and literacy grants to State \n     educational agencies [ESEA, Sec. 2253]. Section 171 of the \n     bill would amend section 2253 of the ESEA (which directs the \n     Secretary to award grants to SEAs to carry out the reading \n     and literacy activities described in Part C of Title II of \n     the ESEA), which section 178(B)(1) of the bill would transfer \n     to Part E of Title I, as follows:\n       Paragraph (1) would amend the current limit of one grant \n     per State, in section 2252(a)(2)(A), to permit a State to \n     receive sequential, but not simultaneous, grants. Thus, a \n     State could receive a second grant after its first grant \n     period is over.\n       Paragraph (2) would add, to the State application \n     requirements in section 2253(b)(2)(B), a clause (ix) to \n     require an SEA's application to include the process and \n     criteria it will use to review and approve LEA applications \n     for the two types of subgrants available under this part: \n     local reading improvement subgrants under section 2255 and \n     tutorial assistance subgrants under section 2256, including a \n     peer-review process that includes individuals with relevant \n     expertise.\n       Paragraph (3) would clarify the unclear language in section \n     2253(c)(2)(C), which requires the Federal peer-review panel, \n     in making funding recommendations to the Secretary, to give \n     priority to States that have modified, are modifying, or will \n     modify their teacher certification requirements to require \n     effective training of prospective teachers in methods of \n     reading instruction that reflect scientifically based reading \n     research.\n       Paragraph (4) would make a technical amendment to section \n     2253(d)(3), which permits States to use certain consortia or \n     similar entities that it formed before enactment of the \n     Reading Excellence Act on October 21, 1998, in lieu of a \n     partnership that meets that Act's requirements.\n       Section 172, use of amounts by State educational agencies \n     [ESEA, Sec. 2254]. Section 172 of the bill would amend \n     section 2254 of the ESEA so that the State's cost of \n     administering the program of tutorial assistance subgrants \n     under section 2256 would be subject to the overall five \n     percent limit on State administrative costs. That amount \n     should be sufficient for all the State's costs of \n     administering the Reading Excellence program. Any amounts set \n     aside under the 15 percent limit in section 2254(2) would \n     have to be used for the actual subgrants to LEAs and not for \n     State administrative expenses.\n       Section 173, local reading improvement subgrants [ESEA, \n     Sec. 2255]. Section 173(a) of the bill would amend section \n     2255(a) of the ESEA, which describes the LEAs that are \n     eligible to apply for a local reading improvement subgrant \n     under section 2255, to limit eligibility to LEAs that operate \n     schools for grades 1 through 3. LEAs that serve only middle \n     and/or high school students should not be eligible for this \n     program, which is intended to help children read well and \n     independently by the third grade.\n       Section 173(b) would amend section 2255(d)(i), which \n     describes the activities that an LEA may carry out with its \n     subgrant, to require that the schools in which reading \n     instruction is provided serve children in the first through \n     third grades. As with the provision described above relating \n     to LEA eligibility, this amendment will ensure that the\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\n     program's objective of helping children to read by the 3rd \n     grade is met.\n       Section 174, tutorial assistance subgrants [ESEA, \n     Sec. 2256]. Section 174(a) and (b) of the bill would make \n     amendments to section 2256 of the ESEA, which authorizes \n     subgrants to LEAs for tutorial assistance, that correspond to \n     the amendments to section 2255 (local reading improvement \n     subgrants) that ensure that the program focuses on its \n     intended age range, children from pre-kindergarten through \n     3rd grade.\n       Section 174(a) would also make the following amendments to \n     section 2256:\n       Paragraph (1)(B) would delete subsection (a)(1)(A), which \n     makes an LEA eligible for a tutorial assistance subgrant if \n     any school in its jurisdiction is located in an empowerment \n     zone or enterprise community, because LEAs are not eligible \n     through this route for local reading improvement subgrants \n     under section 2255. Making the eligibility criteria the same \n     for the two types of subgrants, as provided by this \n     amendment, will increase the likelihood that tutorial \n     activities are carried out in the same LEAs that receive \n     local reading improvement subgrants, promoting the \n     coordination of the activities supported by the two types of \n     subgrants.\n       Paragraph (5) would delete, from current section \n     2256(a)(2)(B), which the bill would redesignate as section \n     2256(a)(3)(B), language conditioning the receipt of all Title \n     I funds by each LEA that is currently eligible under section \n     2256 on its providing public notice of the tutorial \n     assistance program to parents and possible providers of \n     tutoring services. This provision is grossly disproportionate \n     in its severity and is not logically related to the large \n     amounts of funds it affects under the other Title I programs. \n     Any failure to provide the notice described in this section \n     should be subject to the same range of consequences that \n     attach to possible noncompliance with any other requirement \n     of the statute.\n       Paragraph (6) would make conforming amendments to current \n     section 2256(a)(3), which the bill would redesignate as \n     section 2256(a)(4), to reflect the proposed deletion of \n     eligibility of LEAs on the basis of having a school located \n     in an empowerment zone or enterprise community under section \n     2256(a)(1)(A).\n       Paragraph (7) would make technical and conforming \n     amendments to current subsection (a)(4), which the bill would \n     redesignate as subsection (a)(5).\n       Section 175, national evaluation [ESEA, Sec. 2257). Section \n     175 of the bill would amend section 2257 of the ESEA, which \n     provides for a national evaluation of the program under this \n     part, to remove a cross-reference to a current provision that \n     earmarks funds for the evaluation. Other provisions of the \n     will would provide the Secretary with authority to pay for \n     evaluations of all ESEA programs, removing the need for \n     individual evaluation earmarks.\n       Section 176 information dissemination [ESEA, Sec. 2258]. \n     Section 176(1) of the bill would amend section 2258 of the \n     ESEA, which provides for the dissemination of program \n     information, to reflect the transfer of the program's \n     authorization of appropriations to section 1002(e) of the \n     ESEA. It would also add authority for the National Institute \n     for Literacy, which administers section 2258, to use up to \n     five percent of the amount available each year to pay for the \n     costs of administering that section.\n       Section 176(2) would add, as subsection (c) of section \n     2258, authority for the Secretary to reserve up to one \n     percent of each fiscal year's appropriation for the Reading \n     Excellence program for technical assistance, program \n     improvement, and replication activities.\n       Section 177, authorization of appropriations [ESEA, \n     Sec. 2260]. Section 177 of the bill would repeal section 2260 \n     of the ESA, which authorizes appropriations for the program, \n     to reflect the transfer of the program's authorization of \n     appropriations to section 1002(e) of the ESEA.\n       Section 178, transfer and redesignations. Section 178 of \n     the bill would transfer the authority for the Reading \n     Excellence program, currently in Part C of Title II of the \n     ESEA, to Part E of Title I, redesignate current Parts E and F \n     of Title I as Parts F and G, and make other technical and \n     conforming amendments.\n\n\n               TITLE II--HIGH STANDARDS IN THE CLASSROOM\n\n       Section 201 of the bill would amend Title II of the ESEA in \n     its entirety, as follows:\n     Part A--Teaching to high standards\n       Part A of Title II would authorize a new program in the \n     ESEA by consolidation the existing Eisenhower State Grants \n     (Title II) and Innovative Education Program Strategies (Title \n     VI) programs in the ESEA and Title III of the Goals 2000: \n     Educate America Act.\n       Subpart 1--Findings, purpose and Authorization of \n           appropriations\n       Section 2111, findings. Section 2111 would set out findings \n     for Part A.\n       Section 2112, purpose. Section 2112 would state that the \n     purpose of Part A is to: (1) Support States and LEAs in \n     continuing the task of developing challenging content and \n     student performance standards and aligned assessments, \n     revising curricula and teacher certification requirements, \n     and using challenging content and student performance \n     standards to improve teaching and learning; (2) ensure that \n     teachers and administrators have access to professional \n     development that is aligned with challenging State content \n     and student performance standards in the core academic \n     subjects; (3) provide assistance to new teachers during their \n     first three years in the classroom; and (4) support the \n     development and acquisition of curricular materials and other \n     instructional aids that are not normally provided as part of \n     the regular instructional program and that will advance local \n     standards-based school reform efforts.\n       Section 2113, authorizations of appropriations. Section \n     2113 would authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of the two operational subparts of Part A \n     for fiscal years 2001, through 2005.\n       Subpart 2--State and local activities.\n       Section 2121, allocations to States. Section 2121 would \n     provide for allocations to the States, including the District \n     of Columbia and Puerto Rico; the outlying areas; and schools \n     operated or funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The \n     Secretary would reserve a total of one percent for the \n     outlying areas and the BIA. The remaining funds would be \n     allocated to States, based one-half on each State's share \n     of funds under Part A of Title I for the previous fiscal \n     year and one-half on each state's relative share of the \n     population aged 5 to 17. No State may receive a grant that \n     is less than one-half of one percent of the amount \n     available for State grants.\n       Section 2122, priority for professional development in \n     mathematics and science. Section 2122(a) would establish \n     rules for the use of Part A funds for professional \n     development in mathematics and science at various \n     appropriations levels. A key priority of the Teaching to High \n     Standards proposal is directing Federal sources to support \n     professional development that strengthens instruction in the \n     core academic content areas, instead of professional \n     development that uses general strategies for improving \n     classroom instruction that are not based on academic content. \n     Toward that end, the bill would require States and LEAs to \n     use funds for professional development only in the academic \n     content areas and would increase the current Eisenhower \n     program's $250 million set-aside for professional development \n     in mathematics and science to $300 million. This ``trigger'' \n     means that if the annual appropriation for Part A is $300 \n     million or less, each State would be required to devote its \n     entire allocation to supporting professional development in \n     mathematics and science (including all funds retained at the \n     State level and those distributed by the SEA and the State \n     agency for higher education (SAHE) as grants to LEAs). For \n     years in which the appropriation is higher than $300 million, \n     each State would be required to allocate a percentage of its \n     funding toward mathematics and science professional \n     development that is at least as much as the State would have \n     received had the appropriation been $300 million. The SEA and \n     the SAHE would jointly determine how the State would \n     structure the use of State-level funding and grants to LEAs \n     to meet this requirement.\n       Section 2122(b) would provide that, for purposes of meeting \n     the priority requirements of subsection (a), professional \n     development in mathematics and science may include \n     interdisciplinary activities, as long as these activities \n     include a strong focus on mathematics and science. Subsection \n     (c) would require that funds in excess of the $300 million \n     appropriation be used in one or more of the core academic \n     subjects, including mathematics and science.\n       Section 2123, State application. Section 2123 would require \n     each State to submit an application that is developed by the \n     SEA in consultation with the SAHE, community-based and other \n     nonprofit organizations with experience in \n     providing professional development, and institutions of \n     higher education (IHEs). This section would also describe \n     what States must include in their applications. The \n     Secretary would have to approve a State application if a \n     peer-review panel determines that it satisfactorily \n     addresses the application requirements and holds \n     reasonable promise of achieving the purposes of the \n     program.\n       Section 2124, annual State reports. Section 2124 would \n     require a State to submit annual reports to the Secretary \n     that describe its activities under this program, report on \n     the progress of subgrant recipients against program \n     performance indicators that the Secretary identifies and any \n     other indicators that the State requires, and contain other \n     information that the Secretary requires.\n       Section 2125, within-State allocations. Section 2125 would \n     allow an SEA to reserve up to 10 percent of the State \n     allocation for State-level activities, program evaluations, \n     and administration. Not more than one third of this \n     reservation could be used for administration. The SEA would \n     also have to make available to the SAHE an amount equal to \n     what the State's allocation would be if the amount of the \n     appropriation for this subpart were $60 million. From the \n     amount remaining, the SEA would make formula and competitive \n     subgant awards to LEAs. Of the amount that is reserved for \n     LEAs, the SEA would allocate 50 percent to LEAs in proportion \n     to the relative numbers of children, aged 5 to 17, from low-\n     income families within the LEA and award 50 percent to LEAs \n     on a competitive basis.\n       Section 2126, State-level activities. Section 2126 would \n     provide examples of activities that SEAs could carry out with \n     the funds they reserve for State-level activities to promote \n     high-quality instruction.\n       Section 2127, subgrants to partnerships of institutions of \n     higher education and local educational agencies. Section 2127 \n     would allow\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\n     SAHEs to reserve not more than 3\\1/3\\ percent of their \n     allocation for administrative activities and program \n     evaluations and require them, in cooperation with the SEA, to \n     award competitive subgrants to, or enter into contracts or \n     cooperative agreements with, IHEs or nonprofit organizations \n     to provide professional development in the core academic \n     subjects. These awards would be for 3 years (which would be \n     extended for 2 more years if the subgrantee is making \n     substantial progress) and made using a peer-review process. \n     The SAHE would give priority to projects that focus on \n     teacher induction programs and could make awards only to \n     projects that include an LEA, are coordinated with activities \n     carried out under Title II of the Higher Education Act of \n     1965 (if the LEA or IHE is participating in that program), \n     and involve the IHE's school or department of education and \n     the school or departments in the specific disciplines in \n     which the professional development will be provided.\n       Section 2127 would also describe the activities that award \n     recipients must carry out and require them to submit an \n     annual report to the SAHE, beginning with fiscal year 2002, \n     on their progress against indicators of program performance \n     that the Secretary may establish. The SAHE would provide the \n     SEA with copies of these reports.\n       Section 2128, competitive local awards. Section 2128 would \n     require SEAs to award competitive subgrants to LEAs from the \n     funds reserved for that purpose under section 2125. The SEA \n     would use a peer-review process that includes reviewers who \n     are knowledgeable in the academic content areas. SEAs would \n     award subgrants based on the quality of the applicants' \n     proposals and their likelihood of success, and on the \n     demonstrated need of applicants, based on specified criteria.\n       Section 2128 would also require SEAs to adopt strategies to \n     ensure that LEAs with the greatest need are provided a \n     reasonable opportunity to receive an award. Subgrants would \n     be for a three-year period, which the SEA would extend for an \n     additional two years if it determines that the LEA is making \n     substantial progress toward meeting the goals in the LEA's \n     district-wide plan for raising student achievement against \n     State standards and against the performance indicators \n     identified by the Secretary under section 2136.\n       Section 2129, local applications. Section 2129 would \n     require an LEA to submit an application to the SEA in order \n     to be eligible to receive a formula or competitive subgrant. \n     The application would include a district-wide plan that \n     describes how the LEA will raise student achievement against \n     State standards by: (1) supporting the alignment of curricula \n     assessments, and professional development to challenging \n     State and local content standards. (2) providing professional \n     development in the core academic content areas; (3) carrying \n     out activities to assist new teachers during their first \n     three years in the classroom; and (4) ensuring that teachers \n     employed by the LEA are proficient in teaching skills and \n     content knowledge.\n       In addition, the LEA application would: (1) identify \n     specific goals for achieving the purposes of the program; (2) \n     describe how the LEA will address the needs of high-poverty, \n     low-performing schools; (3) describe how the LEA will address \n     the needs of teachers of students with limited English \n     proficiency and other students with special needs; (4) \n     include an assurance that the LEA will collect data that \n     measures progress toward the indicators of program \n     performance that the Secretary identifies; (5) describe how \n     the LEA will coordinate funds under this subpart with \n     professional development activities funded through other \n     State and Federal programs; (6) describe how the LEA will use \n     its subgrant funds awarded by formula to address the items in \n     the district-wide plan described above; and (7) describe how \n     it would use the additional funds from a competitive \n     subgrant, if it is applying for one, to implement that plan.\n       Section 2130, uses of funds. Section 2130 would describe \n     the activities an LEA may conduct with program funds in order \n     to implement its district-wide plan.\n       Section 2131, local accountability. Section 2131 would \n     require each LEA to submit an annual report to the SEA, \n     beginning in fiscal year 2002, that contains: (1) information \n     on its progress against the indicators of program performance \n     that the Secretary identifies and against the LEA's program \n     goals; (2) data disaggregated by school poverty level, as \n     defined by the Secretary; and (3) a description of the \n     methodology the subgrantee used to gather the data.\n       Section 2132, local cost-sharing requirement. Section 2132 \n     would provide that the Federal share of activities carried \n     out under Subpart 2 with funds received by formula may not \n     exceed 67 percent for any fiscal year. The Federal share of \n     activities carried out under this subpart with funds awarded \n     on a competitive basis could not exceed 85 percent during the \n     first year of the subgrant, 75 percent during the second \n     year, 65 percent during the third year, 55 percent during the \n     fourth year, and 50 percent during the fifth year.\n       Section 2133, maintenance of effort. Section 2133 would \n     require each participating LEA to maintain its fiscal effort \n     for professional development at the average of its \n     expenditures over the previous three years.\n       Section 2134, equipment and textbooks. Section 2134 would \n     provide that subgrantees may not use program funds for \n     equipment, computer hardware, textbooks, telecommunications \n     fees, or other items, that would otherwise be provided by the \n     LEA or State, or by a private school whose students receive \n     services under the program.\n       Section 2135, supplement, not supplant. Section 2135 would \n     require an LEA to use program funds only to supplement the \n     level of funds or resources that would otherwise be made \n     available from non-Federal sources, and not to supplant those \n     non-Federal funds or resources.\n       Section 2136, program performance indicators. Section 2136 \n     would require the Secretary to identify indicators of program \n     performance against which recipients would report their \n     progress.\n       Section 2137, definitions. Section 2137 would define ``core \n     academic subjects'', ``high-poverty local educational \n     agency'', ``low-performing school'', and ``professional \n     development''.\n       Subpart 3--National activities for the improvement of \n           teaching and school leadership\n       Section 2141, program authorized. Section 2141 would \n     authorize the Secretary to make awards to a wide variety of \n     public and private agencies and entities to support: (1) \n     activities of national significance that are not supported \n     through other sources and that the Secretary determines will \n     contribute to the improvement of teaching and school \n     leadership in the Nation's schools; (2) activities of \n     national significance that will contribute to the recruitment \n     and retention of highly qualified teachers and principals in \n     high-poverty LEAs; (3) a national evaluation of the Part A \n     program; and (4) the National Board for Professional Teaching \n     Standards. Section 2141(b)(5) would direct the Secretary to \n     provide support for the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for \n     Mathematics and Science Education under section 2142.\n       Section 2142, Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for \n     Mathematics and Science Education. Section 2142 would retain, \n     with few changes, the authority in current section 2102(b) \n     for the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Mathematics and \n     Science Education, as follows:\n       Subsection (a) would provide authority for the \n     Clearinghouse.\n       Subsection (b) would authorize activities and establish \n     certain requirements related to the Clearinghouse, including \n     the application and award process, the duration of the grant \n     or contract, the activities the award recipient must carry \n     out, the submission of materials to the Clearinghouse, and \n     the establishment of a steering committee.\n     Part B--Transition to teaching; troops to teachers\n       Section 2111, findings. Section 2211 of the ESEA would set \n     out the Congressional findings for the new Part B. In the \n     next decade, school districts will need to hire more than 2 \n     million teachers, especially in the areas of math, science, \n     foreign languages, special education, and bilingual \n     education. The need for teachers able to teach in high-\n     poverty school districts will be particularly high. To meet \n     this need, talented Americans of all ages should be recruited \n     to become successful, qualified teachers.\n       Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have \n     neither a major nor a minor in their main assignment fields. \n     This problem is even more actuate in high-poverty areas, \n     where the out-of-field percentage is 39.\n       Additionally, the Third International Math and Science \n     Study (TIMSS) ranked U.S. high school seniors last among 16 \n     countries in physics, and next to last in math. Based mainly \n     on TIMSS data, it is also evident that a stronger emphasis \n     needs to be placed on the academic preparation of our \n     children in math and science.\n       Further, one-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very \n     difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly \n     half of public school teachers have students in their \n     classrooms for whom English is a second language.\n       Many career-changing professionals with strong content-area \n     skills are interested in making a transition to a teaching \n     career, but need assistance in getting the appropriate \n     pedagogical training and classroom experience. The Troops to \n     Teachers model has been highly successful in linking high-\n     quality teachers to teach in high-poverty school districts.\n       Section 2212, purpose. Section 2212 of the ESEA would \n     establish the statement of purpose for the program, which \n     would be to address the need of high-poverty school districts \n     for highly qualified teachers in subject areas such as \n     mathematics, science, foreign languages, bilingual education, \n     and special education needed by those school districts. This \n     would be accomplished by continuing and enhancing the \n     Transition to Teaching model for recruiting and supporting \n     the placement of such teachers, and by recruiting, preparing, \n     placing, and supporting career-changing professionals who \n     have knowledge and experience that would help them become \n     such teachers.\n       Section 2213, program authorized. Section 2213 of the ESEA \n     would establish the program authority and the authorization \n     of appropriations for the Transition to Teaching program. \n     Under section 2213(a), the Secretary would be authorized to \n     use funds appropriated under section 2213(c) for each fiscal \n     year to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to \n     institutions of higher education and public and private \n     nonprofit agencies or organizations to carry out programs \n     authorized by this part.\n       Section 2213(b)(1)(A) would provide that, before making any \n     awards under section\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\n     2213(a), the Secretary would be required to consult with the \n     Secretaries of Defense and Transportation with respect to the \n     appropriate amount of funding necessary to continue and \n     enhance the Troops to Teachers program. Additionally, section \n     2213(b)(1)(B) would provide that, upon agreement, the \n     Secretary would transfer the amount under section \n     2213(b)(1)(A) to the Department of Defense to carry out the \n     Troops to Teachers program. Further, section 2213(b)(2) would \n     allow the Secretary to enter into a written agreement with \n     the Department of Defense and Transportation, or take such \n     steps as the Secretary determines are appropriate to ensure \n     effective continuation of the Troops to Teachers program.\n       Finally, section 2213(c) would authorize the appropriation \n     of such sums as may be necessary to carry out Part B for \n     fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n       Section 2214, application. Section 2214 of the ESEA would \n     establish the application requirements. Section 2214 would \n     provide that an applicant that desires a grant under Part B \n     must submit to the Secretary an application containing such \n     information as the Secretary may require. Applicants would be \n     required to: (1) include a description of the target group of \n     career-changing professionals on which they would focus in \n     carrying out their programs under this part, including a \n     description of the characteristics of that target group that \n     shows how the knowledge and experience of its members is \n     relevant to meeting the purpose of this part; (2) describe \n     how it plans to identify and recruit program participants; \n     (3) include a description of the training program \n     participants would receive and how that training would relate \n     to their certification as teachers; (4) describe how it would \n     ensure that program participants were placed and would teach \n     in high-poverty LEAs; (5) include a description of the \n     teacher induction services that program participants would \n     receive throughout at least their first year of teaching; (6) \n     include a description of how the applicant would collaborate, \n     as needed, with other institutions, agencies, or \n     organizations to recruit, train, place, and support program \n     participants under this part, including evidence of the \n     commitment of the institutions, agencies, or organizations to \n     the applicant's program; (7) include a description of how the \n     applicant would evaluate the progress and effectiveness of \n     its program, including the program's goals and objectives, \n     the performance indicators the applicant would use to measure \n     the program's progress, and the outcome measures that would \n     be used to determine the program's effectiveness; and (8) \n     submit an assurance that the applicant would provide to the \n     Secretary such information as the Secretary determines \n     necessary to determine the overall effectiveness of programs \n     under this part.\n       Section 2215, uses of funds and period of service. Section \n     2215 of the ESEA would describe the activities authorized \n     under Part B. Under section 2215(a), Part B funds could be \n     used to: (1) recruit program participants, including \n     informing them of opportunities under the program and putting \n     them in contact with other institutions, agencies, or \n     organizations that would train, place, and support them; (2) \n     authorize training stipends and other financial incentives \n     for program participants, not to exceed $5,000, in the \n     aggregate, per participant; (3) assist institutions of higher \n     education or other providers of teacher training to meet the \n     particular needs of professionals who are changing their \n     careers to teaching; (4) authorize placement activities, \n     including identifying high-poverty LEAs with needs for \n     particular skills and characteristics of the newly trained \n     program participants and assisting those participants to \n     obtain employment in those LEAs; and (5) authorize post-\n     placement induction or support activities for program \n     participants.\n       Section 2215(b) would establish the required period of \n     service for program participants. Under section 2215(b), a \n     program participant who completes his or her training would \n     be required to teach in a high-poverty LEA for at least three \n     years. Section 2215(c) would allow the Secretary to establish \n     appropriate requirements to ensure that program participants \n     who receive a training stipend or other financial incentive, \n     but fail to complete their service obligation, repay all or a \n     portion of such stipend or other incentive.\n       Section 2216, equitable distribution. Section 2216 of the \n     ESEA would require the Secretary, to the extent practicable, \n     to make awards under Part B that support programs in \n     different geographic regions of the Nation.\n       Section 2217, definitions. Section 2217 of the ESEA would \n     establish definitions for the program. Section 2217(1) would \n     define the term ``high-poverty local educational agency'' as \n     an LEA in which the percentage of children, ages 5 though 17, \n     from families below the poverty line is 20 percent or \n     greater, or the number of such children exceeds 10,000. \n     Section 2217(2) would define the term ``program \n     participants'' as career-changing professionals who hold at \n     least a baccalaureate degree, demonstrate interest in, and \n     commitment to, becoming a teacher, and have knowledge and \n     experience relevant to teaching a high-need subject area in a \n     high-poverty LEA.\n     Part C--Early childhood educator professional development\n       Section 2301, purpose. Section 2301 of the ESEA would \n     establish the purpose of the new Part C program, which is to \n     support the national effort to attain the first of America's \n     Education Goals by enhancing school readiness and preventing \n     reading difficulties in young children, through early \n     childhood education programs that improve the knowledge and \n     skills of early childhood educators working in high-poverty \n     communities. The program would help meet the need for early \n     childhood educators in high-poverty communities with limnited \n     acess to early childhood education and to high-quality early \n     childhood education professionals.\n       Section 2302, program authorized. Section 2302(a) of the \n     ESEA would authorize the Secretary to make competitive grants \n     to eligible partnerships. An eligible partnership would \n     consist of: (1) at least one institution of higher education \n     that provides professional development for early childhood \n     educators who work with children from low-income families in \n     high-need communities, or another public or private, \n     nonprofit entity that provides that professionals \n     development; and (2) at least one other public or private \n     nonprofit agency or organization, such as an LEA, an SEA, a \n     State human services agency, a State or local agency \n     administering programs under the Child Care and Development \n     Block Grant Act of 1990, or a Head Start agency.\n       Section 2302(b) would direct the Secretary to give a \n     priority to applications from partnerships that include at \n     least one LEA that operates early childhood programs for \n     children from low-income families in high-need communities.\n       Section 2302(c) would authorize grants for up to four \n     years, and limit each grantee to one grant under this \n     program.\n       Section 2303, applications. Section 2303 of the ESEA would \n     set out requirements for applications for funds. Among other \n     information, each application would include a description of \n     the high-need community to be served; information on the \n     quaity of the early childhood educator professional \n     development program currently being conducted by a member of \n     the partnership; the results of the applicant's assessment of \n     the professional development needs of early childhood \n     education providers to be served by the partnership and in \n     the broader community and how the project will address those \n     needs; a description of how the proposed project would be \n     carried out; descriptions of the project's specific \n     objectives and how progress toward those objectives will be \n     measured; how the applicant plans to institutionalize \n     project activities once Federal funding ends; an assurance \n     that, where applicable, the project will provide \n     appropriate professional development to volunteer staff, \n     as well as to paid staff; and an assurance that the \n     applicant consulted with, and will consult with, relevant \n     agencies and organizations that are not members of the \n     partnership.\n       Section 2304, selection of grantees. Section 2304 of the \n     ESEA would require the Secretary to select grantees according \n     to both the community's need for assistance and the quality \n     of applications, and seek to ensure that communities in urban \n     and rural communities and in difference regions of the Nation \n     are served.\n       Section 2305, uses of funds. Section 2305 of the ESEA would \n     require that, in general, grant recipients use grant funds to \n     carry out activities that will improve the knowledge and \n     skills of early childhood educators who are working in early \n     childhood programs serving concentrations of poor children in \n     high-need communities. Allowable professional development \n     activities for early childhood educators include, but would \n     not be limited to, activities that: familiarize early \n     childhood educators with recent research on child, language, \n     and literacy development and on early childhood pedagogy; \n     train them to work with parents, and with children with \n     limited English proficiency, disabilities, and other special \n     needs; assist educators during their first three years in the \n     field; development and implementation of professional \n     development programs for early childhood educators using \n     distance learning and other technologies; and data \n     collection, evaluation, and reporting activities necessary to \n     meet program accountability requirements.\n       Section 2306, accountability. Section 2306(a) of the ESEA \n     would require the Secretary to announce performance \n     indicators, designed to measure the quality of the \n     professional development on the early childhood education \n     provided by the individuals trained, and such other measures \n     of program impact as the Secretary determines. Section \n     2306(b) would require projects to report annually on their \n     progress in meeting these performance indicators. The \n     Secretary could terminate a grant if the grantee is not \n     making satisfactory progress against the Secretary's \n     indicators.\n       Section 2307, cost-sharing. Section 2307 of the ESEA would \n     require each grantee to contribute at least half of the \n     overall cost of its project, including at least 20 percent in \n     each year, from other sources, which may include other \n     Federal sources. The Secretary could waive or modify this \n     requirement in the case of demonstrated financial hardship.\n       Section 2308, definitions. Section 2308 of the ESEA would \n     define the terms ``high-need community'', ``low-income \n     family'', and ``early childhood educator''.\n       Section 2309, Federal coordination. Section 2309 of the \n     ESEA would direct the Secretaries of Education and Health and \n     Human Services to coordinate activities of this program and \n     other early childhood programs that they administer.\n       Section 2310, authorization of appropriations. Section 2310 \n     of the ESEA would authorize the appropriation of such sums as \n     may be\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\n     necessary for fiscal year 2001 and each of the four \n     succeeding fiscal years to carry out Part C.\n     Part D--Technical assistance programs\n       Section 2401, findings. Section 2401 of the ESEA would \n     state the Congressional findings for Part D as follows: (1) \n     sustained, high-quality technical assistance that responds to \n     State and local demand supported by widely disseminated, \n     research-based information on what constitutes high-quality \n     technical assistance and how to identify high-quality \n     technical assistance providers, can enhance the opportunity \n     for all children to achieve to challenging State academic \n     content and student performance standards; (2) an integrated \n     system for acquiring, using, and supplying technical \n     assistance is essential to improving programs and affording \n     all children this opportunity; (3) States, LEAs, tribes, and \n     schools serving students with special needs, such as \n     educationally disadvantaged students and students with \n     limited English proficiency, have clear needs for technical \n     assistance in order to use funds under the ESEA to provide \n     those students with opportunities to achieve to challenging \n     State academic content standards and student performance \n     standards; (4) current technical assistance and dissemination \n     efforts are insufficiently responsive to the needs of States, \n     LEAs, schools, and tribes for help in identifying their \n     particular needs for technical assistance and developing and \n     implementing their own integrated systems for using the \n     various sources of funding for technical assistance \n     activities under the ESEA (as well as other Federal, State, \n     and local resources) to improve teaching and leaning and to \n     implement more effectively the programs authorized by the \n     ESEA; and (5) the Internet and other forms of advanced \n     telecommunications technology are an important means of \n     providing information and assistance in a cost-effective way.\n       Section 2402, purpose. Section 2402 of the ESEA would state \n     the purpose for Part D as being to create a comprehensive and \n     cohesive, national system of technical assistance and \n     dissemination that is based on market principles in \n     responding to the demand for, and expanding the supply of, \n     high-quality technical assistance. This system would support \n     States, LEAs, tribes, schools, and other recipients of funds \n     under the ESEA in implementing standards-based reform and \n     improving student performance through: (1) the provision of \n     financial support and impartial, research-based information \n     designed to assist States and high-need LEAs to develop and \n     implement their own integrated systems of technical \n     assistance and select high-quality technical assistance \n     activities and providers for use in those systems; (2) the \n     establishment of technical assistance centers in areas that \n     reflect identified national needs, in order to ensure the \n     availability of strong technical assistance in those areas; \n     (3) the integration of all technical assistance and \n     information dissemination activities carried out or supported \n     by the Department of Education in order to ensure \n     comprehensive support for school improvement; (4) the \n     creation of a technology-based system, for disseminating \n     information about ways to improve educational practices \n     throughout the Nation, that reflects input from students, \n     teachers, administrators, and other individuals who \n     participate in, or may be affected by, the Nation's \n     educational system; and (5) national evaluations of effective \n     technical assistance.\n       Subpart 1--Strengthening the capacity of State and local \n           educational agencies to become effective, informed \n           consumers of technical assistance\n       Section 2411, purpose. Section 2411 of the ESEA would state \n     the purposes of Subpart 1 of Part D of Title II. Section \n     2411(1) would state one such purpose as being to provide \n     grants to SEAs and LEAs in order to: (1) respond to the \n     growing demand for increased local decisionmaking in \n     determining technical assistance needs and appropriate \n     technical assistance services; (2) encourage SEAs and LEAs to \n     assess their technical assistance needs and how their various \n     sources of funding for technical assistance under the ESEA \n     and from other sources can best be coordinated to meet those \n     needs (including their needs to collect and analyze data); \n     (3) build the capacity of SEAs and LEAs to use technical \n     assistance effectively and thereby improve their ability to \n     provide the opportunity for all children to achieve to \n     challenging State academic content standards and student \n     performance standards; and (4) assist SEAs and LEAs in \n     acquiring high-quality technical assistance.\n       Section 2411(2) would state the other purpose of Subpart 1 \n     as being to establish an independent source of consumer \n     information regarding the quality of technical assistance \n     activities and providers, in order to assist SEAs and LEAs, \n     and other consumers of technical assistance that receive \n     funds under the ESEA, in selecting technical assistance \n     activities and providers for their use.\n       Section 2412, allocation of funds. Section 2412 of the ESEA \n     would describe how funds appropriated to carry out Subpart 1 \n     would be allocated. From those appropriations for any fiscal \n     year, the Secretary would first allocate one percent of the \n     funds to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Outlying Areas, \n     in accordance with their respective needs for such funds (as \n     determined by the Secretary) to carry out activities that \n     meet the purposes of Subpart 1. The Secretary would \n     allocate two-thirds of the remaining funds to SEAs in \n     accordance with the formula described in section 2413 and \n     allocate one-third of the remaining funds to the 100 LEAs \n     with the largest number of children counted under section \n     1124(c) of the ESEA, in accordance with the formula \n     described in section 2416.\n       Section 2413, formula grants to State educational agencies. \n     Section 2413 of the ESEA would set out the formula for \n     awarding grants to States. The Secretary would allocate funds \n     among the States in proportion to the relative amounts each \n     State would have received for Basic Grants under Subpart 2 of \n     Part A of Title I of the ESEA for the most recent fiscal \n     year, if the Secretary had disregarded the allocations under \n     that subpart to LEAs that are eligible to receive direct \n     grants under new section 2416. This allocation would be \n     adjusted as necessary to ensure that, of the total amount \n     allocated to States and to LEAs under section 2416, the \n     percentage allocated to a State under section 2413 and to \n     localities in the State under section 2416 is at least the \n     percentage used for the small-State minimum under section \n     1124(d) for the previous fiscal year. The Secretary would \n     also reallocate to other States any amount of any State's \n     allocation under section 2413 of the ESEA that would not be \n     required to carry out the activities for which such amount \n     has been allocated for a fiscal year.\n       Section 2414, State application. Section 2414 of the ESEA \n     would describe the application requirements for State formula \n     grants. Each State seeking a grant under Subpart 1 would be \n     required to submit an application to the Secretary at such \n     time, in such manner, and containing such information as the \n     Secretary may require. Each such application would be \n     required to describe: (1) the State's need for, and the \n     capacity of the SEA to provide, technical assistance in \n     implementing programs under the ESEA (including assistance on \n     the collection and analysis of data) and in implementing the \n     State plan or policies for comprehensive, standards-based \n     education reform; (2) how the State will use the funds \n     provided under this subpart to coordinate all its sources of \n     funds for technical assistance, including all sources of such \n     funds under the ESEA, into an integrated system of providing \n     technical assistance to LEAs, and other local recipients of \n     funds under the ESEA, within the State and implement that \n     system; (3) the SEA's plan for using funds from all sources \n     under the ESEA to build its capacity, through the acquisition \n     of outside technical assistance and other means, to provide \n     technical assistance to LEAs and other recipients within the \n     State; (4) how, in carrying out technical assistance \n     activities using funds provided from all sources under the \n     ESEA, the State will assist LEAs and schools in providing \n     high-quality education to all children served under the ESEA \n     to achieve to challenging academic standards, give the \n     highest priority to meeting the needs of high-poverty, low-\n     performing LEAs (taking into consideration any assistance \n     that the LEAs may be receiving under section 2416), and give \n     special consideration to LEAs and other recipients of funds \n     under the ESEA serving rural and isolated areas. The \n     Secretary would be required to approve a State's application \n     for funds if it meets these requirements and is of sufficient \n     quality to meet the purposes of Subpart 1. In determining \n     whether to approve a State's application, the Secretary would \n     be required to take into consideration the advice of peer \n     reviewers, and could not disapprove any application without \n     giving the State notice and opportunity for a hearing.\n       Section 2415, State uses of funds. Section 2415 of the ESEA \n     would describe the permissible uses of State formula grant \n     funds under Subpart 1. The SEA could use these funds to: (1) \n     build its capacity (and the capacity of other State agencies \n     that implement ESEA programs) to use ESEA technical \n     assistance funds effectively through the acquisition of high-\n     quality technical assistance, and the selection of high-\n     quality technical assistance activities and providers, that \n     meet the technical assistance needs identified by the State; \n     (2) develop, coordinate, and implement an integrated system \n     that provides technical assistance to LEAs and other ESEA \n     recipients within the State, directly, through contracts, or \n     through subgrants to LEAs, or other ESEA recipients of funds, \n     for activities that meet the purposes of Subpart 1, and uses \n     all sources of funds provided for technical assistance, \n     including all ESEA sources; and (3) acquire the technical \n     assistance it needs to increase opportunities for all \n     children to achieve to challenging State academic content \n     standards and student performance standards, and to implement \n     the State's plan or policies for comprehensive standards-\n     based education reform.\n       A State's integrated system of providing technical \n     assistance could include assistance on such activities as: \n     (1) implementing State standards in the classroom, including \n     aligning instruction, curriculum, assessments, and other \n     aspects of school reform with those standards; (2) \n     collecting, disaggregating, and using data to analyze and \n     improve the implementation, and increase the impact, of \n     educational programs; (3) conducting needs assessments and \n     planning intervention strategies that are aligned with \n     State goals and accountability systems; (4) planning and \n     implementing effective, research-based reform strategies, \n     including schoolwide reforms, and strategies for making \n     schools safe, disciplined, and drug-free; (5) improving \n     the quality of teaching and the ability of teachers to \n     serve students with special needs (including educationally \n     disadvantaged students and students with limited English \n     proficiency); and (6) planning\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\n     and implementing strategies to promote opportunities for \n     all children to achieve to challenging State academic \n     content standards and student performance standards.\n       Section 2416, Grants to large local educational agencies. \n     Section 2416 of the ESEA would describe the formula for \n     providing grants under Subpart 1 to the 100 largest, high-\n     need LEAs. Under section 2416, the Secretary would allocate \n     funds among the LEAs described in section 2412(2)(B) in \n     proportion to the relative amounts allocated to each such LEA \n     for Basic Grants under Subpart 2 of Part A of Title I for the \n     most recent fiscal year. As under the State formula in \n     section 2413, the Secretary would be required to reallocate \n     unused LEA allocations.\n       Section 2417, local application. Section 2417 of the ESEA \n     would detail the application requirements that the LEAs must \n     meet to receive direct grants under Subpart 1. Each LEA would \n     be required to submit an application to the Secretary at such \n     time, in such manner, and containing such information as the \n     Secretary may require. Each application would be required to \n     describe: (1) the LEA's need for technical assistance in \n     implementing ESEA programs (including assistance on the use \n     and analysis of data) and in implementing the State's, or its \n     own, plan or policies, for comprehensive standards-based \n     education reform; (2) how the LEA will use the grant funds to \n     coordinate all its various sources of funds for technical \n     assistance, including all ESEA sources and other sources, \n     into an integrated system for acquiring and using outside \n     technical assistance and other means of building its own \n     capacity to provide the opportunity for all children to \n     achieve to challenging State academic content standards and \n     student performance standards implementing programs under the \n     ESEA, and implement that system. In determining whether to \n     approve a State's application, the Secretary would be \n     required to take into consideration the advice of peer \n     reviewers, and could not disapprove any application without \n     giving the State notice and opportunity for a hearing.\n       Section 2418, local uses of funds. Section 2418 of the ESEA \n     would describe the ways in which an LEA could use direct \n     grant funds awarded under Subpart 1. The LEA could use those \n     funds to: (1) build its capacity to use ESEA technical \n     assistance funds through the acquisition of high-quality \n     technical assistance and the selection of high-quality \n     technical assistance activities and providers that meet its \n     technical assistance needs; (2) develop, coordinate, and \n     implement an integrated system of providing technical \n     assistance to its schools using all sources of funds provided \n     for technical assistance, including all ESEA sources; and (3) \n     acquire the technical assistance it needs to increase \n     opportunities for all children to achieve to challenging \n     State academic content standards and student performance \n     standards and to implement the State's, or its own, plan or \n     policies for comprehensive standards-based education reform. \n     An LEA may use these funds for technical assistance \n     activities such as those described in section 2415(b) of the \n     ESEA.\n       Section 2419, equitable services for private schools. \n     Section 2419 of the ESEA would describe how equitable \n     services would be provided to private schools. First, if an \n     SEA or LEA uses funds under Subpart 1 to provide professional \n     development for teachers or school administrators, the SEA or \n     LEA would be required to provide for professional development \n     for teachers or school administrators in private schools \n     located in the same geographic area on an equitable basis. \n     Similarly, if an SEA or LEA uses funds under Subpart 1 to \n     provide information about State educational goals, standards, \n     or assessments, the SEA or LEA would be required to provide \n     that information, upon request to private schools located in \n     the same geographic area. However, if an SEA or LEA is \n     prohibited by law from meeting these requirements, or the \n     Secretary determines the SEA or LEA has substantially failed \n     or is unwilling to comply with these requirements, the \n     Secretary shall waive these requirements and arrange for the \n     provision of professional development services for the \n     private school teachers or school administrators, consistent \n     with applicable State goals and standards and section 11806 \n     of the ESEA.\n       Section 2419A, consumer information. Section 2419A of the \n     ESEA would require the Secretary to establish, through one or \n     more contracts, an independent source of consumer information \n     regarding the quality and effectiveness of technical \n     assistance activities and providers available to States, \n     LEAs, and other recipients of funds under the ESEA, in \n     selecting technical assistance activities and providers for \n     their use. Such a contract could be awarded for a period of \n     up to five years, and the Secretary could reserve, from \n     the funds appropriated to carry out Subpart 1 for any \n     fiscal year, such sums as the Secretary determines \n     necessary to carry out section 2419A.\n       Section 2419B, authorization of appropriations. Section \n     2419B of the ESEA would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2001 and for each of \n     the four succeeding fiscal years to carry out Subpart 1.\n       Subpart 2--Technical assistance centers serving special \n           needs\n       Section 2421, general provisions. Section 2421 of the ESEA \n     would set out the general provisions applicable to all \n     technical assistance providers that receive funds under \n     Subpart 2, all consortia that receive funds under proposed \n     Subpart 2 of Part B of Title III of the ESEA (as amended by \n     Title III of the bill), and the educational laboratories, and \n     clearinghouses of the Educational Resources Information \n     Center, supported under the Educational Research, \n     Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act. Each \n     provider, consortium, laboratory or clearinghouse would be \n     required to: (1) participate in a technical assistance \n     network with the Department and other federally supported \n     technical assistance providers in order to coordinate \n     services and resources; (2) ensure that the services they \n     provide are high-quality, cost-effective, reflect the best \n     information available from research and practice, and are \n     aligned with State and local education reform efforts; (3) in \n     collaboration with SEAs in the States served, educational \n     service agencies (where appropriate), and representatives of \n     high-poverty, low-performing urban and rural LEAs in each \n     State served, develop a targeted approach to providing \n     technical assistance that gives priority to providing \n     intensive, ongoing services to high-poverty LEAs and schools \n     that are most in need of raising student achievement (such as \n     schools identified as in need of improvement under section \n     1116(c) of the ESEA); (4) cooperate with the Secretary in \n     carrying out activities (including technical assistance \n     activities authorized by other ESEA programs) such as \n     publicly disseminating materials and information that are \n     produced by the Department and are relevant to the purpose, \n     expertise, and mission of the technical assistance provider; \n     and (5) use technology, including electronic dissemination \n     networks and Internet-based resources, in innovative ways to \n     provide high-quality technical assistance.\n       Section 2422, centers for technical assistance on the needs \n     of special populations. Section 2422 of the ESEA would \n     authorize the Secretary to award grants, contracts, or \n     cooperative agreements to public or private nonprofit \n     entities (or consortia of those entities) to operate two new \n     centers to provide technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, \n     schools, tribes, community-based organizations, and other \n     recipients of funds under the ESEA concerning how to address \n     the specific linguistic, cultural, or other needs of limited \n     English proficient, migratory, Indian, and Alaska Native \n     students, and educational strategies for enabling those \n     students to achieve to challenging State academic content and \n     performance standards. An entity could receive an award to \n     operate a center only if it demonstrates, to the satisfaction \n     of the Secretary, that it has expertise in these needs and \n     strategies, and an award under section 2422 could be up to 5 \n     years in duration.\n       Under section 2422(c), each center would be required to \n     maintain appropriate staff expertise, and provide support, \n     training, and assistance to SEAs, tribes, LEAs, schools, and \n     other ESEA funding recipients in meeting the needs of the \n     students in these special populations, including the \n     coordination of other Federal programs and State and local \n     programs, resources, and reforms. Each center would be \n     required to give priority to providing services to schools, \n     including Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded schools, that \n     educate the students described in subsection (a)(1)(A) and \n     have the highest percentages or numbers of children in \n     poverty and the lowest student achievement levels.\n       Under section 2422(d), the Secretary would be required to: \n     (1) develop a set of performance indicators that assesses \n     whether the work of the centers assists in improving teaching \n     and learning under the ESEA for students in the special \n     populations described; (2) conduct surveys every two years of \n     entities to be served under this section to determine if they \n     are satisfied with the access to, and quality of, the \n     services provided; (3) collect, as part of the Department's \n     reviews of ESEA programs, information about the availability \n     and quality of services provided by the centers, and share \n     that information with the centers; and (4) take whatever \n     steps are reasonable and necessary to ensure that each center \n     performs its responsibilities in a satisfactory manner, which \n     may include termination of an award under this part, the \n     selection of a new center, and any necessary interim \n     arrangements. All of these activities are designed to ensure \n     the quality and effectiveness of the proposed centers.\n       Section 2422(e) would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2001 and for each of \n     the four succeeding fiscal years to carry out the purposes of \n     section 2422.\n       Section 2423, parental information and resource centers. \n     Section 2423 of the ESEA would authorize Parental Information \n     and Resource Centers (PIRCs), which are currently authorized \n     under Title IV of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.\n       Section 2423(a) would authorize the Secretary to award \n     grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to nonprofit \n     organizations that serve parents (particularly those \n     organizations that make substantial efforts to reach low-\n     income, minority, or limited English proficient parents) to \n     establish PIRCs. The PIRCs would coordinate the efforts of \n     Federal, State, and local parent education and family \n     involvement initiatives. In addition, the PIRCs would provide \n     training, information, and support to SEAs, LEAs \n     (particularly LEAs with high-poverty and low-performing \n     schools), schools (particularly high-poverty and low-\n     performing schools), and organizations that support family-\n     school partnerships (such as parent teacher organizations). \n     In making awards, the Secretary would be required, to the\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\n     greatest extent possible, to ensure that each State is served \n     by at least one award recipient. Currently, there are PIRCs \n     in all 50 States. The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and \n     each territory.\n       Section 2423(b) would establish the application \n     requirements for the PIRCs. Applicants desiring assistance \n     under section 2423 would be required to submit an application \n     at such time, and in such manner, as the Secretary shall \n     determine. At a minimum, the application would include: a \n     description of the applicant's capacity and expertise to \n     implement a grant under section 2423; a description of how \n     the applicant would use its award to help SEAs and LEAs, \n     schools, and non-profit organizations in the State \n     (particularly those organizations that make substantial \n     efforts to reach a large number or percentage of low-income \n     minority, or limited English proficient children) to: (1) \n     identify barriers to parent or family involvement in schools, \n     and strategies to overcome those barriers; and (2) implement \n     high-quality parent education and family involvement programs \n     that improve the capacity of parents to participate more \n     effectively in the education of their children, support the \n     effective implementation of research-based instructional \n     activities that support parents and families in promoting \n     early language and literacy development and support schools \n     in promoting meaningful parent and family involvement; a \n     description of the applicant's plan to disseminate \n     information on high-quality parent education and family \n     involvement programs to LEAs, schools, and non-profit \n     organizations that serve parents in the State; a description \n     of how the applicant would coordinate its activities with the \n     activities of other Federal, State, and local parent \n     education and family involvement programs and with national, \n     State and local organizations that provide parents and \n     families with training, information, and support on how to \n     help their children prepare for success in school and achieve \n     to high academic standards; a description of how the \n     applicant would use technology, particularly the Worldwide \n     Web, to disseminate information; and a description of the \n     applicant's goals for the center, as well as baseline \n     indicators for each of the goals, a timeline for achieving \n     the goals, and interim measures of success toward achieving \n     the goals.\n       Section 2423(c) would limit the Federal share to not more \n     than 75 percent of the cost of a PIRC. The non-Federal share \n     may be in cash or in kind. Under current law, a grant \n     recipient must provide a match in each fiscal year after the \n     first year of the grant, but does not specify the amount of \n     the match.\n       Section 2423(d)(1) would establish the allowable uses for \n     program funds. Recipients would be required to use their \n     awards to support SEAs and LEAs, schools, and non-profit \n     organizations in implementing programs that provide parents \n     with training, information, and support on how to help their \n     children achieve to high academic standards. Such activities \n     could include: assistance in the implementation of programs \n     that support parents and families in promoting early language \n     and literacy development and prepare children to enter school \n     ready to succeed in school; assistance in developing networks \n     and other strategies to support the use of research-based, \n     proven models of parent education and family involvement, \n     including the ``Parents as Teachers'' and ``Home Instruction \n     Program for Preschool Youngsters'' programs, to promote \n     children's development and learning; assistance in preparing \n     parents to communicate more effectively with teachers and \n     other professional educators and support staff, and providing \n     a means for on-going, meaningful communication between \n     parents and schools; assistance in developing and \n     implementing parent education and family involvement programs \n     that increase parental knowledge about standards-based school \n     reform; and disseminating information on programs, resources, \n     and services available at the national, State, and local \n     levels that support parent and family involvement in the \n     education of their school-age children.\n       Section 2423(d)(2) would require that each recipient use at \n     least 75 percent of its award to support activities that \n     serve areas with large numbers or concentrations of low-\n     income families. Currently, recipients are required to use 50 \n     percent of their funds to provide services to low-income \n     areas.\n       Section 2423(e) would authorize the Secretary to reserve up \n     to 5 percent of the funds appropriated for section 2423 to \n     provide technical assistance to the PIRCs and to carry out \n     evaluations of program activities.\n       Section 2423(f) of the ESEA would set out three \n     definitions, taken from current law, for purposes of section \n     2423. The term ``parent education'' would be defined to \n     include parent support activities, the provision of resource \n     materials on child development, parent-child learning \n     activities and child rearing issues, private and group \n     educational guidance, individual and group learning \n     experiences for the parent and child, and other activities \n     that enable the parent to improve learning in the home.\n       The term ``Parents as Teachers program'' would be defined \n     as a voluntary childhood parent education program that: is \n     designed to provide all parents of children from birth \n     through age 5 with the information and support that such \n     parents need to give their child a solid foundation for \n     school success; is based on the Missouri Parents as Teachers \n     model, with the philosophy that parents are their child's \n     first and most influential teachers; provides regularly \n     scheduled personal visits with families by certified parent \n     educators; provides regularly scheduled developmental \n     screenings; and provides linkage with other resources within \n     the community to provide services that parents may want and \n     need, except that such services are beyond the scope of the \n     Parents As Teachers program.\n       The term ``Home Instruction for Preschool Youngsters \n     program'' would be defined as a voluntary early-learning \n     program for parents with one or more children between the \n     ages of 3 through 5 that provides support, training, and \n     appropriate educational materials necessary for parents to \n     implement a school-readiness, home instruction program for \n     their child. Such a program also includes: group meetings \n     with other parents participating in the program; individual \n     and group learning experiences with the parent and child; \n     provision of resource materials on child development and \n     parent-child learning activities; and other activities that \n     enable the parent to improve learning in the home.\n       Section 2423(g) would require each PIRC to submit an annual \n     report on its activities. The report would include at least: \n     the number and types of activities supported by the recipient \n     with program funds; activities supported by the recipient \n     that served areas with high numbers or concentrations of low-\n     income families; and the progress made by the PIRC in \n     achieving the goals included in its application.\n       Section 2423(h) would prohibit any individual from being \n     required to participate in any parent education program or \n     developmental screening supported by program funds. In \n     addition, PIRCs would be prohibited from infringing on the \n     right of a parent to direct the education of their children. \n     Finally, the requirements of section 444(c) of the General \n     Education Provisions Act, relating to procedures protecting \n     the rights of privacy of students and their families in \n     connection with surveys or data-gathering activities, would \n     apply to PIRCs. All of these protections would be continued \n     from current law.\n       Section 2423(i) would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 \n     to carry out the PIRC program.\n       Section 2424, Eisenhower Regional Mathematics and Science \n     Education Consortia. Section 2424 of the ESEA would authorize \n     the establishment and operation of the Eisenhower Regional \n     Mathematics and Science Education Consortia. The Eisenhower \n     Consortia are currently authorized under Part C of Title XIII \n     of the ESEA. In addition to updating current law to eliminate \n     outdated or unnecessary provisions and making structural \n     changes, section 2424 would eliminate some of the current \n     authorized uses of funds for the Eisenhower Consortia in \n     order to focus the uses of funds more closely on the \n     program's core purposes. Section 2424 would also authorize \n     the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal \n     years 2001 through 2005 to carry out the Eisenhower \n     Consortia.\n       Subpart 3--Technology-based technical assistance \n           information dissemination\n       Section 2431, Web-based and other information \n     dissemination. Section 2431 of the ESEA would authorize the \n     Secretary to carry out, through grants, contracts, or \n     cooperative agreements, a national system, through the \n     Worldwide Web and other advanced telecommunications \n     technologies, that supports interactive information sharing \n     and dissemination about ways to improve educational practices \n     throughout the Nation. In designing and implementing this \n     proposed information dissemination system, the Secretary \n     would be required to create opportunities for the continuing \n     input of students, teachers, administrators, and other \n     individuals who participate in, or may be affected by, the \n     Nation's educational system.\n       The proposed new information dissemination would include \n     information on: (1) stimulating instructional materials that \n     are aligned with challenging content standards; and (2) \n     successful and innovative practices in instruction, \n     professional development, challenging academic content and \n     student performance standards, assessments, effective school \n     management, and such other areas as the Secretary determines \n     are appropriate.\n       Under section 2431(a)(3)(A), the Secretary could require \n     the technical assistance providers funded under proposed Part \n     D of Title II of the ESEA (as amended by Title III of the \n     bill), or the educational laboratories and clearinghouses of \n     the Educational Resources Information Center supported under \n     the Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and \n     Improvement Act, to: (1) provide information (including \n     information on practices employed in the regions or States \n     served by the providers) for use in the proposed information \n     dissemination system; (2) coordinate their activities in \n     order to ensure a unified system of technical assistance; or \n     (3) otherwise participate in the proposed information \n     dissemination system. Under section 2431(a)(3)(B), the \n     Secretary would be required to ensure that these \n     dissemination activities are integrated with, and do not \n     duplicate, the dissemination activities of the Office of \n     Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), and that the \n     public has access, through this system, to the latest \n     research, statistics, and other information supported by, or \n     available from, OERI.\n       Section 2431(b) would authorize the Secretary to carry out \n     additional activities, using advanced telecommunications \n     technologies where appropriate, to assist LEAs,\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\n     SEAs, tribes, and other ESEA recipients in meeting the \n     requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of \n     1993. This assistance could include information on measuring \n     and benchmarking program performance and student outcomes.\n       Section 2432 would authorize the appropriate of such sums \n     as may be necessary for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to \n     carry out Subpart 3.\n       Subpart 4--National evaluation activities\n       Section 2441, national evaluation activities. Section 2441 \n     of the ESEA would require the Secretary to conduct, directly \n     or through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements, such \n     activities as the Secretary determines necessary to: (1) \n     determine what constitutes effective technical assistance; \n     (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the technical assistance \n     and dissemination programs authorized by, or assisted under, \n     Part E of Title II of the ESEA, and the educational \n     laboratories, and clearinghouses of the Educational Resources \n     Information Center, supported under the Educational Research, \n     Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act, \n     (notwithstanding any other provision of such Act); and (3) \n     increase the effectiveness of those programs.\n\n\n                   title iii-technology for education\n\n       Section 301. Short Title. Section 301 of the bill would \n     amend section 3101 of the ESEA to change the short title for \n     Title III of the ESEA to the ``Technology For Education \n     Act.''\n       Section 302. Findings. Section 302 of the bill would update \n     the findings in section 3111 of the ESEA to reflect progress \n     that has been made in achieving the four national technology \n     goals and identify those areas in which progress still needs \n     to be made.\n       Section 303. Statement of Purpose. Section 303 of the bill \n     would amend section 3112 of the ESEA to better align the \n     purposes of Title III of the ESEA to the national technology \n     goals and the Department's goals for the use of educational \n     technology to improve teaching and learning. The purposes for \n     this title are to: (1) help provide all classrooms with \n     access to educational technology through support for the \n     acquisition of advanced multimedia computers, Internet \n     connections, and other technologies; (2) help ensure access \n     to, and effective use of, educational technology in all \n     classrooms through the provision of sustained and intensive, \n     high-quality professional development that improves teachers' \n     capability to integrate educational technology effectively \n     into their classrooms by actively engaging students and \n     teachers in the use of technology; (3) help improve the \n     capability of teachers to design and construct new learning \n     experiences using technology, and actively engage students in \n     that design and construction; (4) support efforts by SEAs and \n     LEAs to create learning environments designed to prepare \n     students to achieve to challenging State academic content and \n     performance standards through the use of research-based \n     teaching practices and advanced technologies, (5) support \n     technical assistance to State educational agencies, local \n     educational agencies, and communities to to help them use \n     technology-based resources and information systems to support \n     school reform and meet the needs of students and teachers; \n     (6) support the development of applications that make use of \n     such technologies as advanced telecommunications, hand-held \n     devices, web-based learning resources, distance learning \n     networks, and modeling and simulation software; (7) support \n     Federal partnerships with business and industry to realize \n     more rapidly the potential of digital communications to \n     expand the scope of, and opportunities for, learning; (8) \n     support evaluation and research on the effective use of \n     technology in preparing all students to achieve to \n     challenging State academic content and performance standards, \n     and the impact of technology and performance standards, and \n     the impact of technology on teaching and learning; (9) \n     provide national leadership to stimulate and coordinate \n     public and private efforts, at the national, State and local \n     levels, that support the development and integration of \n     advanced technologies and applications to improve school \n     planning and classroom instruction; (10) support the \n     development, or redesign, of teacher preparation programs to \n     enable prospective teachers to integrate the use of \n     technology in teaching and learning; (11) increase the \n     capacity of State and local educational agencies to improve \n     student achievement, particularly that of students in high-\n     poverty, low-performing schools; (12) promote the formation \n     of partnerships and consortia to stimulate the development \n     of; and new uses for, technology in teaching and learning; \n     (13) support the creation or expansion of community \n     technology centers that will provide disadvantaged residents \n     of economically distressed urban and rural communities with \n     access to information technology and related training; and \n     (14) help to ensure that technology is accessible to, and \n     usable by, all students, particularly students with \n     disabilities or limited English proficiency.\n       Section 304. Prohibition Against Supplanting. Section 304 \n     of the bill would repeal section 3113 of the ESEA, which \n     currently contains the definitions applicable to Title III of \n     the ESEA. Definitions would instead be placed in the part of \n     the title to which they apply. In its place, section 304 of \n     the bill would add a new section 3113 to the ESEA that would \n     require a recipient of funds awarded under this title to use \n     that award only to supplement the amount of funds or \n     resources that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, \n     be made available from non-Federal sources for the purposes \n     of the programs authorized under Title III of the ESEA, and \n     not to supplant those non-Federal funds or resources.\n     Part A--Federal leadership and national activities\n       Section 311. Structure of Part. Section 311 of the bill \n     would make technical changes to Title III of the ESEA to \n     eliminate the current structure of Part A of Title III of the \n     ESEA and add a new heading for Part A, Federal Leadership and \n     National Activities. This section also would repeal the \n     current Product Development program, which has never received \n     funding.\n       Section 312. National Long-Range Technology Plan. Section \n     312 of the bill would amend section 3121 of the ESEA, which \n     currently requires the Secretary to publish a national long-\n     range technology plan within one year of the enactment of the \n     Improving America's School Act of 1994. Instead, section \n     312(1) of the bill would amend section 3121(a) of the ESEA to \n     require the Secretary to update the national long-range \n     technology plan within one year of the enactment of the bill \n     and to broadly disseminate the updated plan.\n       Section 312(2) of the bill would amend section 3121(c) of \n     the ESEA, which establishes the requirements for the national \n     long-range technology plan, by adding the requirements that \n     the plan describe how the Secretary will: promote the full \n     integration of technology into learning, including the \n     creation of new instructional opportunities through access to \n     challenging courses and information that would otherwise not \n     have been available, and independent learning opportunities \n     for students through technology; encourage the creation of \n     opportunities for teachers to develop, through the use of \n     technology, their own networks and resources for sustained \n     and intensive, high-quality professional development; and \n     encourage the commercial development of effective, high-\n     quality, cost-competitive educational technology and \n     software.\n       Section 313. Federal Leadership. Section 313 of the bill \n     would amend section 3122 of the ESEA, which authorizes a \n     program of Federal leadership in promoting the use of \n     technology in education. Section 313(1) of the bill would \n     amend 3122(a) of the ESEA by eliminating a reference to the \n     United States National Commission on Libraries and \n     Information Systems, and replacing it with the White House \n     Office of Science and Technology Policy, on the list of \n     agencies with which the Secretary consults under this \n     program.\n       Section 313(2) of the bill would amend section 3122(b)(1) \n     of the ESEA by removing the reference to the Goals 2000: \n     Educate America Act, which would be repealed by another \n     section of this bill. The National Education Goals would be \n     renamed America's Education Goals and added to the ESEA by \n     section 2 of the bill.\n       Section 313(3) of the bill would amend current 3122(c) of \n     the ESEA by eliminating the authority for the Secretary to \n     undertake activities designed to facilitate maximum \n     interoperability of educational technologies. Instead, the \n     Secretary would be authorized to develop a national \n     repository of information on the effective uses of \n     educational technology, including its use of sustained and \n     intensive, high-quality professional development, and the \n     dissemination of that information nationwide.\n       Section 314. Repeals; Redesignations; Authorization of \n     Appropriations. Section 314 of the bill would repeal sections \n     3114 (Authorization of Appropriations), 3115 (Limitation on \n     Costs), and 3123 (Study, Evaluation, and Report of Funding \n     Alternatives) of the ESEA. As amended by the bill, an \n     authorization of appropriations section would be included in \n     the part of Title III of the ESEA to which it applies. These \n     changes would also eliminate the current statutory provision \n     that requires that funds be used for a discretionary grant \n     program when appropriations for current Part A of Title III \n     of the ESEA are less than $75 million, and for a State \n     formula grant program when the appropriation exceeds that \n     amount. This provision must currently be overridden in \n     appropriation language each year in order to operate both the \n     Technology Literacy Challenge Fund and the Technology \n     Innovation Challenge Grants program.\n       Section 314(b) of the bill would redesignate several \n     sections of the ESEA, and would add new sections 3101 and \n     3104 of the ESEA. Proposed new section 3101 of the ESEA \n     (``National Evaluation of Education Technology'') would \n     require the Secretary to develop and carry out a strategy for \n     an ongoing evaluation of existing and anticipated future uses \n     of educational technology. This national evaluation strategy \n     would be designed to better inform the Federal role in \n     supporting the use of educational technology, in stimulating \n     reform and innovation in teaching and learning with \n     technology, and in advancing the development of more advanced \n     and new types and applications of such technology. As part \n     of this evaluation strategy, the Secretary would be \n     authorized to: conduct long-term controlled studies on the \n     effectiveness of the uses of educational technology; \n     convene panels of experts to identify uses of educational \n     technology that hold the greatest promise for improving \n     teaching and learning, assist the Secretary with the \n     review and assessment of the progress and effectiveness of \n     projects that are funded under this title, and identify \n     barriers to the commercial development of effective, high-\n     quality, cost-competitive educational technology\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\n     and software; conduct evaluations and applied research \n     studies that examine how students learn using educational \n     technology, whether singly or in groups, and across age \n     groups, student populations (including students with \n     special needs, such as students with limited English \n     proficiency and students with disabilities) and settings, \n     and the characteristics of classrooms and other \n     educational settings that use educational technology \n     effectively; collaborate with other Federal agencies that \n     support research on, and evaluation of, the use of network \n     technology in educational settings; and carry out such \n     other activities as the Secretary determines appropriate. \n     The Secretary would be authorized to use up to 4 percent \n     of the funds appropriated to carry out Title III of the \n     ESEA for any fiscal year to carry out national evaluation \n     strategy in that year.\n       Proposed new section 3104 of the ESEA (``Authorization of \n     Appropriations'') would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out the national evaluation \n     strategy, national plan, and Federal Leadership activities \n     for fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n     PART B--Special projects\n       Section 321. Repeals; Redesignations; New Part. Section 321 \n     of the bill would make several structural and conforming \n     changes to Title III of the ESEA. Section 321(a) of the bill \n     would repeal Part B, the Star Schools Program, and Part E, \n     the Elementary Mathematics and Science Equipment Program. \n     Section 321(b) of the bill would redesignate current Part C \n     of Title III of the ESEA, Ready-To-Learn Television, as \n     Subpart 2 of Part B of Title III of the ESEA, and redesignate \n     current Part D of Title III of the ESEA, Telecommunications \n     Demonstration Project for Mathematics as Subpart 3 of Part B \n     of Title III of the ESEA.\n       Section 321(d) of the bill would add a new Subpart 1, Next-\n     Generation Technology Innovation Awards, to Part B of Title \n     III of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 3211 of the ESEA (``Purpose; Program \n     Authority'') would state, in subsection (a), that it is the \n     purpose of the program to: (1) expand the knowledge base \n     about the use of the next generation of advanced computers \n     and telecommunications in delivering new applications for \n     teaching and learning; (2) address questions of national \n     significance about the next generation of technology and its \n     use to improve teaching and learning; and (3) develop, for \n     wide-scale adoption by SEAs and LEAs, models of innovative \n     and effective applications in teaching and learning of \n     technology, such as high-quality video, voice recognition \n     devices, modeling and simulation software (particularly web-\n     based software and intelligent tutoring), hand-held devices, \n     and virtual reality and wireless technologies, that are \n     aligned with challenging State academic content and \n     performance standards. These purposes would focus the \n     projects funded under this proposed new subpart on developing \n     ``cutting edge'' applications of educational technology.\n       Proposed new section 3211(b) of the ESEA would authorize \n     the Secretary, through the Office of Educational Technology, \n     to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements on a \n     competitive basis to eligible applicants. Proposed new \n     section 3211(c) of the bill would state that  those awards \n     could be made for a period of not more than five years.\n       Proposed new section 3212 of the ESEA (``Eligibility'') \n     would specify the eligibility and application requirements \n     for the proposed new program. Under proposed new section \n     3212(a) of the ESEA, in order to be eligible to receive an \n     award an applicant would have to be a consortium that \n     includes: (1) at least one SEA or LEA; and (2) at least one \n     institution of higher education, for-profit business, museum, \n     library, other public or private entity with a particular \n     expertise that would assist in carrying out the purposes of \n     the proposed new subpart.\n       Under proposed new section 3212(b) of the ESEA, applicants \n     would be required to provide a description of the proposed \n     project and how it would carry out the purposes of the \n     program, and a detailed plan for the independent evaluation \n     of the program, which must include benchmarks to monitor \n     progress toward the specific project objectives.\n       Proposed new section 3212(c) of the ESEA would allow the \n     Secretary, when making awards, to set one or more priorities. \n     Priorities could be provided for: (1) applications from \n     consortia that consist of particular types of the members \n     described in proposed new section 3212(a) of the ESEA; (2) \n     projects that develop innovative models of effective use of \n     educational technology, including the development of distance \n     learning networks, software (including software deliverable \n     through the Internet), and online-learning resources; (3) \n     projects serving more than one State and involving large-\n     scale innovations in the use of technology in education; (4) \n     projects that develop innovative models that serve \n     traditionally underserved populations, including low-income \n     students, students with disabilities, and students with \n     limited English proficiency; (5) projects in which applicants \n     provide substantial financial and other resources to achieve \n     the goals of the project; and (6) projects that develop \n     innovative models for using electronic networks to provide \n     challenging courses, such as Advanced Placement courses.\n       Proposed new section 3213 of the ESEA (``Uses of Funds'') \n     would require award recipients to use their program funds to \n     develop new applications of educational technologies and \n     telecommunications to support school reform efforts, such as \n     wireless and web-based telecommunications, hand-held devices, \n     web-based learning resources, distributed learning \n     environments (including distance learning networks), and the \n     development of educational software and other applications. \n     In addition, recipients would also be required to use program \n     funds to carry out activities consistent with the purposes of \n     the proposed new subpart, such as: (1) developing innovative \n     models for improving teachers' ability to integrate \n     technology effectively into course curriculum, through \n     sustained and intensive, high-quality professional \n     development; (2) developing high-quality, standards-based, \n     digital content, including multimedia software, digital \n     video, and web-based resources; (3) using telecommunications, \n     and other technologies, to make programs accessible to \n     students with special needs (such as low-income students, \n     students with disabilities, students in remote areas, and \n     students with limited English proficiency) through such \n     activities as using technology to support mentoring; (4) \n     providing classroom and extracurricular opportunities for \n     female students to explore the different uses of technology; \n     (5) promoting school-family partnerships, which may include \n     services for adults and families, particularly parent \n     education programs that provide parents with training, \n     information, and support on how to help their children \n     achieve to high academic standards; (6) acquiring \n     connectivity linkages, resources, distance learning networks, \n     and services, including hardware and software, as needed to \n     accomplish the goals of the project; and (7) collaborating \n     with other Department of Education and Federal information \n     technology research and development programs.\n       Proposed new section 3214 of the ESEA (``Evaluation'') \n     would authorize the Secretary to: (1) develop tools and \n     provide resources for recipients of funds under the proposed \n     new subpart to evaluate their activities; (2) provide \n     technical assistance to assist recipients in evaluating their \n     projects; (3) conduct independent evaluations of the \n     activities assisted under the proposed new subpart; and (4) \n     disseminate findings and methodologies from evaluations \n     assisted under the proposed new subpart, or other information \n     obtained from such projects that would promote the design and \n     implementation of effective models for evaluating the impact \n     of educational technology on teaching and learning. This \n     evaluation authority would enable the Department to provide \n     projects with tools for evaluation and disseminate the \n     findings from the individual project evaluations.\n       Proposed new section 3215 of the ESEA (``Authorization of \n     Appropriations'') would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out this part of fiscal \n     years 2001 through 2005.\n       Section 322. Ready To Learn Digital Television. Section 322 \n     of the bill would amend the subpart heading for Subpart 2 of \n     Part B of Title III of the ESEA (as redesignated by section \n     321(b) of the bill) to reflect advances in technology by \n     replacing the reference to ``television'' with a reference to \n     ``digital television.''\n       In addition, section 322 of the bill would amend the \n     provisions of this subpart to reflect the redesignations made \n     by section 321(c) of the bill, and to authorize the \n     appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this subpart for fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n       Section 323. Telecommunications Program for Professional \n     Development in the Core Content Areas. Section 323(a) of the \n     bill would amend the heading for Subpart 3 of Part B of Title \n     III (as redesignated by section 321(b) of the bill) from the \n     current ``Telecommunications Demonstration Project for \n     Mathematics'' to ``Telecommunications Program for \n     Professional Development in the Core Content Areas.''\n       Section 323(b) of the bill would amend section 3231 of the \n     ESEA (as redesignated by section 321(c) of the bill), which \n     currently states the purpose of this part as carrying out a \n     national telecommunications-based demonstration project to \n     improve the teaching of mathematics and to assist elementary \n     and secondary school teachers in preparing all students for \n     achieving State content standards. As amended by section \n     323(b) of the bill, this program would no longer be only a \n     demonstration project, and its purposes would be expanded to \n     assist elementary and secondary school teachers in preparing \n     all students to achieve to challenging State academic content \n     and performance standards through a national \n     telecommunications-based program to improve teaching in all \n     core content areas, not just mathematics.\n       Section 323(c) of the bill would amend the application \n     requirements in section 3232 of the ESEA (as redesignated by \n     section 321(c) of the bill) to eliminate references to the \n     program as a demonstration project, update the references to \n     technology, expand the types of entities with which \n     recipients would be required to coordinate their efforts, and \n     make conforming changes.\n       Section 323(d) of the bill would amend section 3233 of the \n     ESEA (as redesignated by section 321(c) of the bill) to \n     authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary \n     to carry out this subpart for fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n       Section 324. Community Technology Centers. Section 324 of \n     the bill would add a new Subpart 4, Community Technology \n     Centers, to Part B of Title III of the ESEA.\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\n       Proposed new section 3241 of the ESEA (``Purpose; Program \n     Authority'') would state, in subsection (a), that the purpose \n     of this proposed new subpart is to assist eligible applicants \n     to create or expand community technology centers that will \n     provide disadvantaged residents of economically distressed \n     urban and rural communities with access to information \n     technology and related training and provide technical \n     assistance and support to community technology centers.\n       Proposed new section 3241(b) of the ESEA would authorize \n     the Secretary, through the Office of Educational Technology, \n     to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements on a \n     competitive basis to eligible applicants to carry out the \n     purposes of the proposed new subpart. The Secretary could \n     make these awards for a period of not more than three years.\n       Proposed new section 3242 of the ESEA (``Eligibility and \n     Application Requirements'') would set out the eligibility and \n     application requirements for the proposed new subpart. Under \n     proposed new section 3242(a) of the ESEA, to be eligible an \n     applicant must: (1) have the capacity to expand significantly \n     access to computers and related services for disadvantaged \n     residents of economically distressed urban and rural \n     communities (who would otherwise be denied such access); and \n     (2) be an entity such as a foundation, museum, library, for-\n     profit business, public or private nonprofit \n     organizations, community-based organization, an \n     institution of higher education, an SEA, and LEA, or a \n     consortium of these entities.\n       Under the application requirements in proposed new section \n     3242(b) of the ESEA, an applicant would be required to submit \n     an application to the Secretary at such time, and containing \n     such information, as the Secretary may require, and that \n     application must include: (1) a description of the proposed \n     project, including a description of the magnitude of the need \n     for the services and how the project would expand access to \n     information technology and related services to disadvantaged \n     residents of an economically distressed urban or rural \n     community; (2) a demonstration of the commitment, including \n     the financial commitment, of entities such as institutions, \n     organizations, business and other groups in the community \n     that will provide support for the creation, expansion, and \n     continuation of the proposed project, and the extent to which \n     the proposed project establishes linkages with other \n     appropriate agencies, efforts, and organizations providing \n     services to disadvantaged residents of an economically \n     distressed urban or rural community; (3) a description of how \n     the proposed project would be sustained once the Federal \n     funds awarded under this subpart end; and (4) a plan for the \n     evaluation of the program, including benchmarks to monitor \n     progress toward specific project objectives.\n       Under proposed new section 3242(c) of the ESEA, the Federal \n     share of the cost of any project funded under the proposed \n     new subpart could not exceed 50 percent, and the non-Federal \n     share of such project may be in cash or in kind, fairly \n     evaluated, including services.\n       Proposed new section 3243 of the ESEA (``Uses of Funds'') \n     would describe the required and permissible uses of funds \n     awarded under the proposed new subpart. Under proposed new \n     section 3243(a) of the ESEA, a recipient would be required to \n     use these funds for creating or expanding community \n     technology centers that expand access to information \n     technology and related training for disadvantaged residents \n     of distressed urban or rural communities, and evaluating the \n     effectiveness of the project.\n       Under proposed new section 3243(b) of the ESEA, a recipient \n     could use funds awarded under the proposed new subpart for \n     activities that it described in its application that carry \n     out the purposes of this subpart such as: (1) supporting a \n     center coordinator, and staff, to supervise instruction and \n     build community partnerships; (2) acquiring equipment, \n     networking capabilities, and infrastructure to carry out the \n     project; and (3) developing and providing services and \n     activities for community residents that provide access to \n     computers, information technology, and the use of such \n     technology in support of pre-school preparation, academic \n     achievement, lifelong learning, and workforce development job \n     preparation activities.\n       Proposed new section 3244 of the Act (``Authorization of \n     Appropriations'') would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out the proposed new \n     subpart for each of the fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n     Part C--Preparing tomorrow's teachers to use technology\n       Section 331. New Part. Section 331 of the bill would amend \n     Title III of the ESEA by adding a new Part C, Preparing \n     Tomorrow's Teachers To Use Technology.\n       Proposed new section 3301 of the ESEA (``Purpose; Program \n     Authority'') would state, in subsection (a), that the purpose \n     of the proposed new part is to assist consortia of public and \n     private entities in carrying out programs that prepare \n     prospective teachers to use advanced technology to foster \n     learning environments conducive to preparing all students to \n     achieve to challenging State and local content and student \n     performance standards.\n       Proposed new section 3301(b) of the ESEA would authorize \n     the Secretary, through the Office of Educational Technology, \n     to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements on a \n     competitive basis to eligible applicants in order to assist \n     them in developing or redesigning teacher preparation \n     programs to enable prospective teachers to use technology \n     effectively in their classrooms. The Secretary could make \n     these awards for a period of not more than five years.\n       Proposed new section 3302 of the ESEA (``Eligibility'') \n     would detail the eligibility, application, and matching \n     requirements for the proposed new part. To be eligible under \n     proposed new section 3302(a), an applicant must be a \n     consortium that includes at least one institution of higher \n     education that offers a baccalaureate degree and prepares \n     teachers for their initial entry into teaching, and at least \n     one SEA or LEA. In addition, each consortium must include at \n     least one of the following entities: an institution of higher \n     education (other than the institution described above); a \n     school or department of education at an institution of higher \n     education; a school or college of arts and sciences at an \n     institution of higher education; a private elementary or \n     secondary school; or a professional association, foundation, \n     museum, library, for-profit business, public or private \n     nonprofit organization, community-based organization, or \n     other entity with the capacity to contribute to the \n     technology-related reform of teacher preparation programs.\n       The application requirements in proposed new section \n     3302(b) of the ESEA would require an applicant to submit an \n     application to the Secretary at such time, and containing \n     such information, as the Secretary may require, and that \n     application would be required to include: a description of \n     the proposed project, including how the project would ensure \n     that individuals participating in the project would be \n     prepared to use technology to create learning environments \n     conducive to preparing all students to achieve to challenging \n     State and local content and student performance standards; a \n     demonstration of the commitment, including the financial \n     commitment, of each of the members of the consortium to the \n     proposed project; a demonstration of the active support of \n     the leadership of each member of the consortium for the \n     proposed project; a description of how each member of the \n     consortium would be included in project activities; a \n     description of how the proposed project would be sustained \n     once the Federal funds awarded under this part end; and a \n     plan for the evaluation of the program, which shall include \n     benchmarks to monitor progress toward specific project \n     objectives.\n       Proposed new section 3302(c)(1) of the ESEA would limit the \n     Federal share of any project funded under this part to no \n     more than 50 percent of the cost of the project. The non-\n     Federal share may be in cash or in kind, except as required \n     under proposed new section 3302(c)(2) of the ESEA, which \n     would limit, to not more than 10 percent of the funds awarded \n     for a project under this part, the amount that may be used to \n     acquire equipment, networking capabilities or infrastructure, \n     and would require that the non-Federal share of the cost of \n     any such acquisition be in cash.\n       Proposed new section 3303 of the ESEA (``Uses of Funds'') \n     would establish the required and permissible uses of funds \n     awarded under the proposed new part. Under proposed new \n     section 3303(a) of the ESEA, recipients would be required to: \n     create programs that enable prospective teachers to use \n     advanced technology to create learning environments conducive \n     to preparing all students to achieve to challenging State and \n     local content and student performance standards; and evaluate \n     the effectiveness of the project.\n       Under proposed new section 3303(b), recipients would be \n     permitted to use funds for activities such as: developing and \n     implementing high-quality teacher preparation programs that \n     enable educators to learn the full range of resources that \n     can be accessed through the use of technology, integrate a \n     variety of technologies into the classroom in order to \n     expand students' knowledge, evaluate educational \n     technologies and their potential for use in instruction, \n     and help students develop their own digital learning \n     environments; developing alternative teacher development \n     paths that provide elementary and secondary schools with \n     well-prepared, technology-proficient educators; developing \n     performance-based standards and aligned assessments to \n     measure the capacity of prospective teachers to use \n     technology effectively in their classrooms; providing \n     technical assistance to other teacher preparation \n     programs; developing and disseminating resources and \n     information in order to assist institutions of higher \n     education to prepare teachers to use technology \n     effectively in their classrooms; and acquiring equipment, \n     networking capabilities, and infrastructure to carry out \n     the project.\n       Proposed new section 3304 of the ESEA (``Authorization of \n     Appropriations'') would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out the proposed new part \n     for each of the fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n     Part D--Regional, State, and local educational technology \n         resources\n       Section 341. Repeal; New Part. Section 341 of the bill \n     would add a new Part D, Regional, State, and Local \n     Educational Technology Resources, to Title III of the ESEA \n     that would consist of two subparts: Subpart 1, the Technology \n     Literacy Challenge Fund (TLCF), and Subpart 2, Regional \n     Technology in Education Consortia (RTECs).\n       Proposed new section 3411 of the ESEA (``Purpose'') would \n     state that it is the purpose of the TLCF to increase the \n     capacity of\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\n     SEAs and LEAs to improve student achievement, particularly \n     that of students in high-poverty, low-performing schools, by \n     supporting State and local efforts to: (1) make effective use \n     of new technologies and technology applications, networks, \n     and electronic resources; (2) utilize research-based teaching \n     practices that are linked to advanced technologies; and (3) \n     promote sustained and intensive, high-quality professional \n     development that increases teacher capacity to create \n     improved learning environments through the integration of \n     educational technology into instruction. These purposes would \n     focus program efforts on activities that have been proven to \n     improve teaching and learning.\n       Section 342. Allotment and Reallotment. Section 342 of the \n     bill would amend section 3131(a)(2) of the ESEA, which \n     pertains to the allotment and reallotment of TLCF funds. \n     First, for purposes of section 3131 of the ESEA, ``State \n     educational agency'' would be defined to include the Bureau \n     of Indian Affairs (BIA). This change is necessary because the \n     current definition is in section 3113 of the ESEA, which is \n     proposed for repeal in section 3004 of the bill.\n       Next, section 342 of the bill would amend section \n     3131(a)(2) of the ESEA by modifying the minimum TLCF State \n     grant amount in two ways. First, the minimum amount would be \n     the lesser of one-half of one percent of the appropriations \n     for TLCF for a fiscal year, or $2,250,000. Second, the new \n     minimum amount would apply in the aggregate to the amount \n     received by the Outlying Areas. Currently, this aggregate \n     minimum amount for the Outlying Areas is accomplished through \n     appropriations language each year.\n       Section 343. Technology Literacy Challenge Fund. Section \n     343 of the bill would amend current 3132(a)(2) of the ESEA to \n     require an SEA to award not less than 95 percent of its \n     allocation to eligible local applicants (from which up to 2 \n     percent of its total allocation could be used for planning \n     subgrants to LEAs that need assistance in developing local \n     technology plans). An SEA could use the remainder of its \n     allocation for administrative costs and technical assistance. \n     This change is necessary because section 314 of the bill \n     would repeal current 3115 of the ESEA, which limited the \n     amount of any grant that could be used for administrative \n     expenses.\n       Section 343 of the bill would also require an SEA to \n     provide a priority for eligible local applicants that are \n     partnerships. (``Eligible local applicant'' is defined in \n     proposed new section 3417 of the ESEA, as added by section \n     348 of the bill.)\n       Section 343(3) of the bill would amend 3132(b)(2) of the \n     ESEA, which currently requires SEAs to provide technical \n     assistance in developing applications for program funds to \n     LEAs with high concentrations of poor children and a \n     demonstrated need for such assistance. In addition to this \n     requirement, the amended section 3132(b)(2) of the ESEA would \n     also require that an SEA provide an eligible local applicant \n     with assistance in forming partnerships to apply for program \n     funds and developing performance indicators.\n       Section 344. State Application. Section 344 of the bill \n     would completely revise the application requirements for the \n     State formula grant program in section 3133 of the ESEA. As \n     revised, section 3133 of the ESEA would require an SEA to: \n     (1) provide a new or updated State technology plan that is \n     aligned with the State plan or policies for comprehensive \n     standards-based education reform; (2) describe how I will \n     meet the national technology goals; (3) describe its long-\n     term strategies for financing educational technology, \n     including how it would use other Federal and non-Federal \n     funds, including E-Rate funds; (4) describe and explain its \n     criteria for identifying an LEA as high-poverty and having a \n     substantial need for technology; (5) describe its goals for \n     using educational technology to improve student achievement; \n     (6) establish performance indicators for each of its goals \n     described in the plan, baseline performance data for the \n     indicators, a timeline for achieving the goals, and interim \n     measures of success toward achieving the goals; (7) describe \n     how it would ensure that grants awarded under this subpart \n     are of sufficient size, scope, and quality to meet the \n     purposes of this subpart effectively; (8) describe how it \n     would provide technical assistance to eligible local \n     applicants and its capacity for providing that assistance; \n     (9) how it would ensure that educational technology is \n     accessible to, and usable by, all students, including \n     students with special needs, such as students who have \n     disabilities or limited English proficiency; and (10) how it \n     would evaluate its activities under the plan. The application \n     requirements would better align the information required from \n     States with the purposes for the program.\n       Section 345. Local Uses of Funds. Section 345 of the bill \n     would amend section 3134 of the ESEA, which describes the \n     local uses of funds under the TLCF. These local uses of funds \n     would be: adapting or expanding existing and new applications \n     of technology; providing sustained and intensive, high-\n     quality professional development in the integration of \n     advanced technologies into curriculum; enabling teachers to \n     use the Internet to communicate with other teachers and to \n     retrieve web-based learning resources; using technology to \n     collect, manage, and analyze data for school improvement; \n     acquiring advanced technologies with classroom applications; \n     acquiring wiring and access to advanced telecommunications; \n     using web-based learning resources, including those that \n     provide access to challenging courses such as Advanced \n     Placement courses; and assisting schools to use technology to \n     promote parent and family involvement, and support \n     communications between family and school.\n       Section 346. Local Applications. Section 346 of the bill \n     would amend section 3135 of the ESEA to make an ``eligible \n     local applicant,'' rather than an LEA, the entity eligible to \n     apply for TLCF subgrants. This change is aligned with the \n     proposed change to target program funds to LEAs with large \n     numbers or percentages of poor children and a demonstrated \n     need for technology, or a consortium that includes such an \n     LEA. Eligible local applicants that are partnerships would \n     also be required to describe the membership of the \n     partnership, their respective roles, and their respective \n     contributions to improving the capacity of the LEA.\n       In addition to making several updating and conforming \n     changes, section 346 of the bill would also amend section \n     3135 of the ESEA regarding what must be included in the \n     subgrant application. An applicant would be required to \n     describe how the applicant would use its funds to improve \n     student achievement by making effective use of new \n     technologies, networks, and electronic learning resources, \n     using research-based teaching practices that are linked to \n     advanced technologies, and promoting sustained and intensive, \n     high-quality professional development. This requirement would \n     focus local efforts on activities that have demonstrated the \n     greatest potential for improving teaching and learning.\n       In addition, an applicant would also be required to \n     describe: its goals for educational technology, as well as \n     timelines, benchmarks, and indicators of success for \n     achieving the goals; its plan for ensuring that all teachers \n     are prepared to use technology to create improved classroom \n     learning environments; the administrative and technical \n     support it would provide to schools; its plan for financing \n     its local technology plan; how it would use technology to \n     promote communication between teachers; how it would use \n     technology to meet the needs of students with special needs, \n     such as students with disabilities or limited English \n     proficiency; how it will involve parents, public libraries, \n     and business and community leaders in the development of the \n     local technology plan; and if the applicant is a partnership, \n     the members of the partnership and their respective roles and \n     contributions.\n       Finally, an applicant would be required to provide an \n     assurance that, before using any funds received under this \n     subpart for acquiring wiring or advanced telecommunications, \n     it would use all the resources available to it through the E-\n     Rate. This would ensure that districts were using their E-\n     Rate funds, which have more limited uses than TLCF funds, for \n     wiring and telecommunications fees before using TLCF funds \n     for those purposes.\n       Section 347. Repeals; Conforming Changes; Redesignations. \n     Section 347 of the bill would repeal current sections 3136 \n     and 3137 of the ESEA. Section 3136 of the ESEA currently \n     authorizes the National Challenge Grants for Technology in \n     Education, and its purposes would be accomplished under the \n     Next-Generation Technology Innovation Awards program proposed \n     as the new Subpart 1 of Part C of Title III of the ESEA. \n     Section 3137 of the ESEA contains now outdated evaluation \n     requirements. Section 347 of the bill would also make several \n     conforming changes to, and redesignations of, provisions in \n     Title III of the ESEA.\n       Section 348. Definitions; Authorization of Appropriations. \n     Section 348 of the bill would add two new sections to Title \n     III of the ESEA. Proposed new section 3417 of the ESEA \n     (``Definitions'') would define ``eligible local applicant'' \n     and ``low-performing school.'' The definitions would be \n     included to better target funds on high-poverty schools with \n     the greatest need for educational technology.\n       An ``eligible local applicant'' would be defined as: (1) an \n     LEA with high numbers or percentages of children from \n     households living in poverty, that includes one or more low-\n     performing schools, and has a substantial need for \n     educational technology; or (2) a partnership that includes at \n     least one LEA that meets those requirements and at least one \n     LEA that can demonstrate that teachers in schools served by \n     that agency are using technology effectively in their \n     classrooms; institution of higher education; for-profit \n     organization that develops, designs, manufactures, or \n     produces technology products or services, or has substantial \n     expertise in the application of technology; or public or \n     private non-profit organization with demonstrated experience \n     in the application of educational technology.\n       A ``low-performing school'' would be defined as a school \n     identified for school improvement under section 1116(c) of \n     the ESEA, or in which a substantial majority of students fail \n     to meet State performance standards.\n       Proposed new section 3418 of the ESEA (``Authorization of \n     Appropriations'') would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out this subpart for fiscal \n     years 2001 through 2005.\n       Section 349. Regional Technology in Education Consortia. \n     Section 349(a) of the bill would add a new subpart heading \n     and designation, Subpart 2, Regional Technology In Education \n     Consortia (RTECs), to Part B of Title III of the ESEA. This \n     proposed new subpart is based on current section 3141 of\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\n     the ESEA, as amended by this section of the bill.\n       Section 349(b) of the bill would amend section 3141 of the \n     bill in several ways. First, section 349(b)(1) of the bill \n     would amend section 3141(a) of the ESEA to authorize the \n     Secretary to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements, \n     in addition to the Secretary's current authority to award \n     grants, to carry out the purposes of the proposed new \n     subpart. In addition, the priority for various regional \n     entities would be eliminated, although the Secretary would \n     still be required to ensure, to the extent possible, that \n     each geographic region of the United States is served by a \n     project funded under this program.\n       Section 349(b)(1)(C) of the bill would add a new section \n     3141(a)(2)(B) of the ESEA that would require the RTECs to \n     meet the generous provisions relating to technical assistance \n     providers contained in proposed new section 2421 of the ESEA. \n     Section 349(b) of the bill would also make several conforming \n     changes and update the references in section 3141 of the \n     ESEA, including updating provisions to reflect recent \n     advances in technology.\n       Section 349(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the bill would amend section \n     3141(b)(2)(A) of the ESEA, which currently requires RTECs, to \n     the extent possible, to develop and implement technology-\n     specific, ongoing professional development. Section \n     349(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the bill would revise that requirement to \n     require the consortia to develop and implement sustained and \n     intensive, high-quality professional development that \n     prepares educators to be effective developers, users, and \n     evaluators of educational technology. As amended, this \n     section of the ESEA also would require that the professional \n     development is to be provided to teachers, administrators, \n     school librarians, and other education personnel.\n       Section 349(b)(2)(B)(iv) of the bill would amend section \n     3141(b)(2)(F) of the ESEA, which currently requires the RTECs \n     to assist colleges and universities to develop and implement \n     preservice training programs for students enrolled in teacher \n     education programs. As amended, this provision would require \n     the RTECs to coordinate their activities in this area with \n     other programs supported under Title III of the ESEA. This \n     coordination is particularly important with respect to the \n     Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers To Use Technology program \n     (proposed new part C of Title III of the ESEA, as added by \n     section 331 of the bill).\n       Section 349(b)(2)(B)(v)(I) of the bill would amend \n     3141(b)(2)(G) of the ESEA, which currently requires the RTECs \n     to work with local districts and schools to develop support \n     from parents and community members for educational technology \n     programs. The amendments made by section 349(b)(2)(B)(v) of \n     the bill would require the RTECs to work with districts and \n     schools to increase the involvement and support of parents \n     and community members for educational technology programs.\n       Section 349(b)(2)(C)(iv) of the bill would amend section \n     3141(b)(3) of the ESEA by eliminating the requirement that \n     the RTECs coordinate their activities with organizations and \n     institutions of higher education that represent the interests \n     of the region served as such interests pertain to the \n     application of technology in teaching, learning, and other \n     activities.\n       Section 349(b)(2)(C)(vi) of the bill would amend section \n     3141(b)(3) of the ESEA by adding a new requirement that each \n     RTEC maintain, or contribute to, a national repository of \n     information on the effective uses of educational technology, \n     including for professional development, and to disseminate \n     the information nationwide.\n       Section 349(b)(2)(D) would revise section 3141(b)(4) of the \n     ESEA, which requires the RTECs to coordinate their activities \n     with appropriate entities. As revised, section 3141(b)(4) of \n     the ESEA would require each consortium to: (1) collaborate, \n     and coordinate the services that it provides, with \n     appropriate regional and other entities assisted in whole or \n     in part by the Department; (2) coordinate activities and \n     establish partnerships with organizations and institutions of \n     higher education that represent the interests of the region \n     regarding the application of technology to teaching, \n     learning, instructional management, dissemination, the \n     collection and distribution of educational statistics, and \n     the transfer of student information; and (3) collaborate with \n     the Department and recipients of funding under other \n     technology programs of the Department, particularly the \n     Technology Literacy Challenge Fund and the Next-Generation \n     Technology Innovation Grant Program (as added by sections 343 \n     and 341(d) of the bill, respectively), to assist the \n     Department and those recipients as requested by the \n     Secretary.\n       Finally, section 349(c) of the bill would redesignate \n     section 3141 of the ESEA as section 3421 of the ESEA, \n     and section 349(d) of the bill would amend Title III of \n     the ESEA by inserting proposed new section 3422 of the \n     ESEA (``Authorization of Appropriations''), which would \n     authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be \n     necessary for this subpart for fiscal years 2001 through \n     2005.\n\n\n        TITLE IV--SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES ACT\n\n       Section 401. Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities. \n     Section 401 of the bill would amend and restate Title IV of \n     the ESEA, which authorizes assistance to States, LEAs, and \n     other public entities and nonprofit organizations for \n     programs to create and maintain drug-free, safe, and orderly \n     schools, as described below.\n       Proposed new section 4001 (``Short Title'') of the ESEA \n     would rename Title IV of the ESEA as the ``Safe and Drug-Free \n     Schools and Communities Act'' to update the short title of \n     ``Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994'' in \n     the current law.\n       Proposed new section 4002 (``Findings'') of the ESEA would \n     update the findings in section 4002 of the current law to \n     focus on the need for program quality and accountability.\n       Proposed new section 4003 (``Purpose'') of the ESEA would \n     revise the statement of purpose in section 4003 of the \n     current law to reflect the following overarching changes \n     proposed in Title IV of the bill: (1) a more focused program \n     emphasis on supporting activities for creating and \n     maintaining drug-free, safe, and orderly environments for \n     learning in and around schools, as compared to the more \n     current, general emphasis on supporting activities to prevent \n     youth from using drugs and engaging in violent behavior any \n     time, anywhere; (2) improved targeting of resources, through \n     the requirement that SEAs award funds competitively to LEAs \n     with a demonstrated need for funds and the highest quality \n     proposed programming, as compared to the current \n     noncompetitive awarding of funds to all LEAS in the State, \n     based on student enrollment; and (3) stronger coordination \n     between programs funded by the Governors and the SEAs, by \n     requiring that programs funded by the Governors directly \n     complement and support LEA programs, and by requiring \n     Governors and SEAs to reserve funds at the State level for \n     joint capacity-building and technical assistance, and \n     accountability services, to improve the effectiveness of, and \n     institutionalize, State and local Safe and Drug-Free Schools \n     and Communities (SDFSC) programs.\n       Proposed new section 4004 (``Authorization of \n     Appropriations'') of the ESEA would authorize \n     the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for \n     each of the fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to carry out \n     proposed new Title IV of the ESEA.\n     Part A--State grants for drug and violence prevention \n         programs\n       Proposed new section 4111 (``Reservations and Allotments'') \n     of the ESEA would describe the way in which funds would be \n     distributed under this title. Proposed new section 4111(a) \n     would retain the requirements in the current law for the \n     Secretary to reserve, from each fiscal year's appropriation \n     for SDFSC (Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities) State \n     grant funds, 1 percent for the Outlying Areas, 1 percent for \n     programs for Indian youth, and 0.2 percent for programs for \n     Native Hawaiians, and would increase the amount of SDFSC \n     State Grant funds the Secretary may reserve each fiscal year \n     for evaluation to $2 million (up from $1 million under the \n     current law) to support more intensive evaluations that are \n     needed to demonstrate program outcomes and effectiveness.\n       Proposed new section 4111(a)(2)(A)(i) of the ESEA would \n     prohibit the Outlying Areas from consolidating their SDFSC \n     funds with other Department of Education program funds, as \n     would otherwise be permitted under Insular Areas Consolidated \n     Grant Authority in Title V of P.L. 95-134. This language \n     would ensure that the ESEA and Governor of each Outlying Area \n     can coordinate their SDFSC programs as required elsewhere in \n     this part. Without this prohibition, a Governor or SEA may \n     choose to spend its SDFSC funds on other eligible program(s), \n     making it impossible for the Governor and SEA to meet these \n     SDFSC program coordination requirements. This section would, \n     however, permit the Governor of an Outlying Area to \n     consolidate its SDFSC funds with the Area's SDFSC SEA funds, \n     and allow the Outlying Area to administer both SDFSC funding \n     streams under the statutory requirements applicable to SDFSC \n     SEA programs. This provision would address the reduced \n     program flexibility and increased administrative burden the \n     Outlying Areas may experience from the prohibition in \n     proposed new section 4111(a)(2)(i) of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 4111(a)(2) would also: (1) explicitly \n     make applicable to the Outlying Areas the same SDFSC \n     requirements concerning authorized programs and activities, \n     applications for funding, and coordination between the \n     Governor and the SEA that are applicable to the States; (2) \n     explicitly make applicable to the Secretary of the Interior \n     the same SDFSC requirements concerning authorized programs \n     and activities for SDFSC programs for Indian youth that \n     are applicable to the States; and (3) authorize SDFSC \n     programs for Native Hawaiians (which are currently \n     authorized under section 4118 of the ESEA) and explicitly \n     make applicable to these programs the same SDFSC \n     requirements concerning authorized programs and activities \n     that are applicable to the States. This section would also \n     delete the language in section 4118 of the ESEA requiring \n     the Governor of the State of Hawaii to recognize \n     organizations eligible for funding under the SDFSC Native \n     Hawaiian set-side, and add language requiring that \n     programs funded under this set-aside by coordinated with \n     the Hawaii SEA.\n       Proposed new section 4111(b) of the ESEA would retain the \n     provisions in current law; (1) requiring the Secretary to \n     allocate State grant funds half on the basis of school-aged \n     population, and half on the basis of State shares of ESEA \n     Title I funding for the preceding year; (2) that no State \n     receive less than one-half of one percent of all State grant \n     funding; (3) permitting the Secretary\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\n     to redistribute to other States, on the basis of the formula \n     in section 4111(b)(1), any amount of State grant funds the \n     Secretary determines a State will be unable to use within two \n     year of the initial award; and (4) defining ``State'' and \n     ``local educational agency.''\n       Proposed new section 4112 (``State Applications'') of the \n     ESEA would set forth the State grant application procedure \n     for this title. Proposed new section 4112(a) of the ESEA \n     would change the current State grant application requirements \n     to require that the Governor and SEA apply jointly for funds, \n     to ensure increased coordination between the Governor and \n     SEA, consistent with the new program requirements in proposed \n     new sections 4113(b)(4) and 4115(b)(3) of the ESEA.\n       This jointly submitted application would contain: (1) a \n     description of how SDFSC State grant funds will be \n     coordinated with other Federal education and drug prevention \n     programs; (2) a list of the State's outcome-based performance \n     indicators for drug and violence prevention that are selected \n     from a core set of indicators to be developed by the \n     Secretary in consultation with State and local officials; and \n     (3) a description of the procedures the State will use to \n     inform its LEAs of the State's performance indicators under \n     this program and for assessing and publicly reporting \n     progress toward meeting those indicators (or revising them as \n     needed), and how the procedures the State will use to select \n     LEAs and other entities for SDFSC State grant funding will \n     support the attainment of the State's results-based \n     performance indicators. These changes would address the \n     program that, under current law, many States have weak goals \n     and objectives for their SDFSC programs that are entirely \n     process-oriented and do not tie strategically to the State's \n     needs in this area.\n       The proposed new State grant application would also contain \n     a description of the procedures the SEA will use for \n     reviewing applications and awarding funds to LEAs \n     competitively, based on need and quality as required by \n     proposed new section 4113(c)(2) of the ESEA, as well as a \n     description of the procedures the SEA will use for reviewing \n     applications and awarding funds to LEAs non-competitively, \n     based on need and quality as permitted by section 4113(c)(3) \n     of the ESEA. These changes constitute a significant departure \n     from current law, under which SEAs award funds to LEAs on the \n     basis of student enrollment and on State-determined \n     ``greatest need'' criteria.\n       Under proposed new section 4112(a) of the ESEA, the \n     Governor must include in its SDFSC State grant applications a \n     description of the procedures the Governor will use for \n     reviewing applications and awarding funds to eligible \n     applicants competitively, based on need and quality, as \n     required by section 4115(c) of the ESEA. These changes would \n     significantly strengthen the current law, which does not \n     specify any criteria for how Governors must award their funds \n     under this program.\n       States would also be required to include in their \n     applications a description of how the SEA and Governor will \n     use the funds reserved under proposed new sections 4113(b) \n     and 4115(b) of the ESEA for coordinated capacity-building, \n     technical assistance, and program accountability services and \n     activities at the State and local levels, including how they \n     will coordinate their activities with law enforcement, \n     health, mental health, and education programs and officials \n     at the State and local levels.\n       The proposed new State grant application would add a new \n     requirement for States to describe in their applications how \n     the SEA will provide technical assistance to LEAs not \n     receiving SDFSC State grant funds to improve their \n     programs, consistent with the requirement in proposed new \n     section 4113(b)(4)(B)(ii) that, to the extent practicable \n     SEAs and Governors use a portion of the funds they reserve \n     for State-level activities to provide capacity building \n     and technical assistance and accountability services to \n     all LEAs in the State, including those that do not receive \n     SDFSC State grant funds. Finally, this proposed new \n     section would retain the assurances in current law that: \n     (1) States develop their applications in consultation and \n     coordination with appropriate State officials and \n     representatives of parents, students, and community-based \n     organizations; and (2) States will cooperate with, and \n     assist the Secretary in conducting national impact \n     evaluations of programs required by proposed new section \n     4117(a).\n       Proposed new section 4112(b) of the ESEA would retain the \n     language in the current law under section 4112(d) requiring \n     the Secretary to use a peer review process in reviewing SDFSC \n     State grant applications.\n       Proposed new section (``State and Local Educational Agency \n     Programs'') of the ESEA would describe the SEA and LEA \n     programs to be carried our under this part. Proposed new \n     section 4113(a) of the ESEA would retain the requirement in \n     current law that 80 percent of the funds allocated to each \n     State under section 4111(b) of the ESEA be awarded to SEAs \n     for use by the SEAs and LEAs, with minor changes in language \n     conforming with the revised statement of purpose in proposed \n     new section 4003 of the ESEA that the funds be used to carry \n     out programs and activities that are designed to create and \n     maintain drug-free, safe, and orderly learning environments \n     for learning in and around schools.\n       Proposed new section 4113(b) of the ESEA would depart from \n     the current statute by establishing a new authority requiring \n     SEAs to reserve between 10 percent and 20 percent of their \n     allocations under proposed new section 4113(a) for State-\n     level activities. Under this new authority, SEAs may use the \n     reserved funds to plan, develop, and implement, jointly with \n     the Governor, capacity building and technical assistance and \n     accountability services to support the effective \n     implementation of local drug and violence prevention \n     activities throughout the State and promote program \n     accountability and improvement. Within this 20 percent cap, \n     but in addition to the 10 percent minimum for State-level \n     activities, SEAs may also use up to 5 percent of their \n     funding (i.e., up to 25 percent of the amount they reserve \n     for State-level activities) for program administration. This \n     increased allowance for SEA State administrative costs is \n     provided to accommodate the increased administrative \n     responsibilities of running a State grant competition under \n     proposed new section 4113(c) of the ESEA, and would provide \n     greater assistance to LEAs for program improvement than under \n     the current law.\n       Proposed new section 4113(b)(4)(A) of the ESEA would \n     require SEAs and Governors to jointly use the amount reserved \n     under sections 4113(b)(3) and 4114(b)(3) to plan, develop, \n     and implement capacity building and technical assistance and \n     accountability services designed to support the effective \n     implementation of local drug and violence prevention \n     activities throughout the State, as well as promote program \n     accountability and prevention.\n       Proposed new section 4113(b)(4)(B)(i) of the ESEA would add \n     new language to the statute clarifying that the SEA and \n     Governor may carry out the services and activities required \n     under proposed new section 4113(b)(4)(A) directly, or through \n     subgrants or contracts with public and private organizations, \n     as well as individuals.\n       Proposed new section 4113(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the ESEA would \n     add new language to the statute requiring that, to the extent \n     practicable, SEAs and Governors use funds under proposed new \n     section 4113(b)(4)(A) to provide capacity building and \n     technical assistance and accountability services and \n     activities to all LEAs in the State, not just those that \n     receive SDFSC State grants, in order to ensure that: (1) LEAs \n     receiving SDFSC funds receive adequate help to implement and \n     institutionalize high-quality programs; and (2) States can \n     provide at least some program assistance to LEAs that will no \n     longer receive SDFSC awards once funding is limited to 50 \n     percent of LEAs in each State under the targeting provisions \n     proposed in new section 4113(c)(2)(D) of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 4113(b)(4)(B)(iii) of the ESEA would \n     permit he SEA and Governor to provide emergency intervention \n     services to schools and communities following a traumatic \n     crisis, such as a shooting or major accident that has \n     disrupted the learning environment.\n       Proposed new section 4113(b)(4)(C) of the ESEA would add \n     definitions of ``capacity building'' and ``technical \n     assistance and accountability services'' to clarify the \n     meaning of these terms in the statute.\n       Proposed new section 4113(c)(1) of the ESEA would specify \n     that SEAs must use at least 80 percent of their funding for \n     local-level activities, as described in proposed new sections \n     4113(c)(2) and (3), rather than awarding at least 91 percent \n     of their funding to LEAs as is required under current law.\n       Proposed new section 4113(c)(2)(A) of the ESEA would \n     require SEAs to use at least 70 percent of their total SDFSC \n     State grant funding for competitive awards to LEAs that the \n     SEA determines have need for assistance, rather than the \n     current law approach of awarding at least 91 percent of their \n     funding to LEAs in the State by formula, based on enrollment \n     (70 percent) and ``greatest need'' (30 percent).\n       Proposed new section 4113(c)(2)(B) of the ESEA would make \n     minor wording changes to the nine ``need'' factors in the \n     current statute, and add three additional factors relating to \n     local fiscal capacity to fund drug and violence prevention \n     programs without Federal assistance; the incidence of drug \n     paraphernalia in schools; and the high rates of drug-related \n     emergencies or deaths.\n       Proposed new section 4113(c)(2)(C) of the ESEA would depart \n     from the current statute to require SEAs to base their \n     competition under proposed new section 4113(c)(2)(A) on the \n     quality of an LEA's proposed program and how closely it is \n     aligned with the following principles of effectiveness: (1) \n     the LEA's program is based on a thorough assessment of \n     objective data about the drug and violence problems in the \n     schools and communities to be served; (2) the LEA has \n     established a set of measurable goals and objectives aimed at \n     ensuring that all schools served by the LEA have a drug-free, \n     safe, and orderly learning environment, and has designed its \n     program to meet those goals and objectives; (3) the LEA has \n     designed and will implement its programs for youth based on \n     research or evaluation that provides evidence that the \n     program to be used will prevent or reduce drug use, violence, \n     delinquency, or disruptive behavior among youth; and (4) the \n     LEA will evaluate its program periodically to assess its \n     progress toward achieving its goals and objectives, and will \n     use evaluation results to refine, improve, and strengthen its \n     program, and refine its goals and objectives, as needed.\n       Proposed new section 4113(c)(2)(D) of the ESEA would \n     require SEAs to make competitive awards under proposed new \n     section 4113(c)(2)(A) to no more than 50 percent of the LEAs \n     in the State, unless the State demonstrates in its \n     application that the SEA can\n\n[[Page S6350]]\n\n     make subgrants to more than 50 percent of the LEAs in the \n     State and still comply with proposed new subparagraph (E) of \n     this section.\n       Proposed new section 4113(c)(2)(E) of the ESEA would \n     require SEAs to make their competitive awards to LEAs under \n     proposed new section 4113(c)(2) of sufficient size to support \n     high-quality, effective programs and activities that are \n     designed to create safe, disciplined, and drug-free learning \n     environments in schools and that are consistent with the \n     needs, goals, and objectives identified in the State's plan \n     under proposed new section 4112.\n       Proposed new section 4113(c)(3)(A) of the ESEA would depart \n     from the current statute to permit SEAs to use up to 10 \n     percent of their total SDFSC State grant funding for non-\n     competitive awards to LEAs with the greatest need for \n     assistance, as described in proposed new section \n     4113(c)(2)(B), that did not receive a competitive award under \n     section 4113(c)(2)(A). LEAs would be eligible to receive only \n     one subgrant under this paragraph.\n       Proposed new section 4113(c)(3)(B) of the ESEA would \n     require, for accountability purposes, that in order for an \n     SEA to make a non-competitive award to an LEA under proposed \n     new section 4113(c)(3)(A), the SEA must assist the LEA in \n     meeting the information requirements under proposed new \n     section 4116(a) of the ESEA pertaining to LEA needs \n     assessment, results-based performance measures, comprehensive \n     safe and drug-free schools plan, evaluation plan, and \n     assurances, and provide continuing technical assistance to \n     the LEA to build its capacity to develop and implement high-\n     quality, effective programs consistent with the principles of \n     effectiveness in proposed new section 4113(c)(2)(C)(ii) of \n     the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 4113(d) of the ESEA would provide that \n     LEA awards under section 4113(c) be for a project period not \n     to exceed three years, and require that, in order to receive \n     funds for the second or third year of a project, the LEA \n     demonstrate to the satisfaction of the SEA that the LEA's \n     project is making reasonable progress toward its performance \n     indicators under proposed new section 4116(a)(3)(C) of the \n     ESEA. This proposed new section would also make technical \n     changes to the local allocation formula in current law.\n       Proposed new section 4114 (``Local Drug and Violence \n     Prevention Programs'') of the ESEA would describe the local \n     drug and violence prevention services and activities that may \n     be carried out under this title. Proposed new section 4114(a) \n     of the ESEA would require that each LEA that receives SDFSC \n     funding use those funds to support research-based drug and \n     violence prevention services and activities that are \n     consistent with the principles of effectiveness in proposed \n     new section 4113(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 4114(b) (``Other Authorized \n     Activities'') of the ESEA would permit an LEA that receives \n     an SDFSC subgrant to use those funds for activities other \n     than research-based programming, so long as the LEA meets the \n     requirements in proposed new section 4114(a), and those \n     additional activities are carried out in a manner that is \n     consistent with the most recent relevant research and with \n     the purposes of this title. Proposed new section 4114(b)(1) \n     of the ESEA would also include an illustrative list of 13 \n     such activities.\n       Proposed new section 4114(b)(2) of the ESEA would retain \n     the 20 percent cap on SDFSC subgrant funds that LEAs may \n     spend for the acquisition or use of metal detectors and \n     security personnel, but would permit SEAs to waive this cap \n     for an LEA that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of its SEA, \n     in its application for funding under proposed new section \n     4116 of the ESEA, that it has a compelling need to do so.\n       Proposed new section 4115 (``Governor's Program'') of the \n     ESEA would establish the Governor's Program. Proposed new \n     section 4115(a) would retain the requirement in the current \n     law that 20 percent of the funds allocated to each State \n     under proposed new section 4111(b) be awarded to the \n     Governor, but require the Governor to use these funds to \n     support community efforts that directly complement the \n     efforts of LEAs to foster drug-free, safe, and orderly \n     learning environments for learning in and around schools.\n       Proposed new section 4115(b) of the ESEA would establish a \n     new authority requiring Governors to reserve between 10 \n     percent and 20 percent of their allocations under proposed \n     new section 4115(a) for State-level activities to plan, \n     develop, and implement, jointly with the SEA, capacity \n     building, technical assistance, and accountability services \n     to support the effective implementation of local drug and \n     violence prevention activities throughout the State and \n     promote program accountability and improvement, as described \n     in proposed new section 4113(b)(4) of the ESEA. Within this \n     20 percent cap, but in addition to the 10 percent minimum for \n     State-level activities, the Governors could use up to 5 \n     percent of their total funding (i.e., up to 25 percent of the \n     amount they reserve for State-level activities) for direct or \n     in direct administrative costs.\n       Proposed new section 4115(c) of the ESEA would specify that \n     a Governor must use at least 80 percent of SDFSC State grant \n     funding under proposed new section 4111(b) to make \n     competitive subgrants to community-based organizations, LEAs, \n     and other public entities and private non-profit \n     organizations to support community efforts that directly \n     complement the efforts of LEAs to foster drug-free, safe, and \n     orderly learning environments in and around schools. Proposed \n     new section 4115(c)(1)(B) of the ESEA would require that, to \n     be eligible for a subgrant, an applicant (other than a LEA \n     applying on its own behalf) must include in its application \n     its written agreement with one or more LEAs, or one or more \n     schools within an LEA, to provide services and activities in \n     support of these LEAs or schools, as well as an explanation \n     of how those services and activities will complement or \n     support the LEAs' or schools' efforts to provide a drug-free, \n     safe, and orderly school environment. Proposed new section \n     4115(c)(1)(C) of the ESEA would require a Governor to base \n     the competition for these subgrants on: (1) the quality of \n     the applicant's proposed program and how closely it is \n     aligned with the principles of effectiveness described in \n     section 4113(c)(2)(C)(ii); and (2) on objective criteria, \n     determined by the Governor, on the needs of the schools for \n     LEAs to be served.\n       Subgrants made by Governors under proposed new section \n     4115(c) of the ESEA may support community efforts on a \n     Statewide, regional, or local basis and may support the \n     efforts of LEAs and schools that do not receive subgrants. \n     Recipients of these subgrants would use these funds generally \n     to support research-based drug and violence prevention \n     services and activities that are consistent with the \n     principles of effectiveness, and may use subgrant funds for \n     activities other than research-based programming, provided \n     that these additional activities are carried out in a manner \n     that is consistent with the most recent relevant research and \n     with the purposes of this title. Proposed new section \n     4115(c)(2)(B) of the ESEA also includes an illustrative list \n     of 5 such activities.\n       Proposed new section 4116 (``Local Applications'') of the \n     ESEA would: (1) retain language in the current statute, with \n     minor technical changes, requiring applicants for subgrants \n     from the SEA to submit an application to the SEA at such \n     time, and include such other information, as the SEA may \n     require; and (2) add a corresponding requirement not in the \n     current statute, requiring applicants for subgrants from the \n     Governor to submit an application to the Governor at such \n     time, and includes such other information, as the Governor \n     may require.\n       Proposed new section 4116(a)(2)(A) of the ESEA would retain \n     the current law requirement that LEAs applying for SEA \n     subgrants under proposed new section 4113(c)(2), 4113(c)(3), \n     or 4115(c) of the ESEA develop their applications in \n     consultation with a local or regional advisory council that \n     includes, to the extent possible, representatives of local \n     government, business, parents, students, teachers, public \n     school personnel, mental health service providers, \n     appropriate State agencies, private schools, law enforcement, \n     community-based organizations, and other groups interested \n     in, and knowledgeable about, drug and violence prevention. \n     Proposed new section 4116(a)(2)(B) of the ESEA would add \n     similar consultation requirements for the development of \n     applications by entities other than LEAs seeking subgrants, \n     under the Governor's program authorized by proposed new \n     section 4115(c) of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 4116(a)(3) of the ESEA would: (1) make \n     technical changes to strengthen the current LEA application \n     requirements for the SEA formula grant program by increasing \n     the emphasis on the applicant's need for assistance and the \n     quality of its proposed programming; and (2) make these \n     strengthened requirements applicable to LEAs seeking \n     subgrants under the proposed new competitive subgrant \n     authority in proposed new section 4113(c)(2) of the ESEA, or \n     the non-competitive subgrant authority in proposed new \n     section 4113(c)(3) of the ESEA, as well as to LEAs that apply \n     to Governors under the subgrant authority in proposed new \n     section 4115(c) of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 4116(a)(4) of the ESEA would add a \n     requirement that each LEA (or consortium of LEAs, if applying \n     jointly) that applies to its SEA under the competitive \n     subgrant authority in proposed new section 4113(c)(2) of the \n     ESEA, or the non-competitive subgrant authority in proposed \n     new section 4113(c)(3) of the ESEA, include in its \n     application assurances that it: (1) has a policy, consistent \n     with State law, that requires the expulsion of students who \n     posses a firearm at school consistent with the Gun-Free \n     Schools Act; (2) has, or will have, a full- or part-time \n     program coordination whose primary responsibility is \n     planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating the \n     applicant's programs (unless the applicant demonstrates in \n     its application, to the satisfaction of the SEA, that such a \n     program coordinator is not needed); (3) will evaluate its \n     program every two years to assess its progress toward meeting \n     its goals and objectives, and will use the results of its \n     evaluation to improve its program and refine its goals and \n     objectives, as needed; and (4) has, or the schools to be \n     served have, a comprehensive Safe and Drug-Free Schools plan \n     that includes: (a) appropriate and effective discipline \n     policies that prohibit disorderly conduct, the possession of \n     firearms and other weapons, and the illegal use, possession, \n     distribution, and sale of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs \n     by students, and that mandates predetermined consequences, \n     sanctions, or interventions for specific offenses; (b) school \n     security procedures at school and while students are on the \n     way to and from school which may include the use of metal \n     detectors and the development and implementation of formal \n     agreements with law enforcement officials; (c) early \n     intervention and\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\n     prevention activities of demonstrated effectiveness designed \n     to create and maintain safe, disciplined, and drug-free \n     environments; (d) school readiness and family involvement \n     activities; (e) improvements to classroom management and \n     school environment, such as efforts to reduce class size \n     or improve classroom discipline; (f) procedures to \n     identify and intervene with troubled students, including \n     establishing linkages with, and referring students to, \n     juvenile justice, community mental heath, and other \n     service providers; (g) activities that connect students to \n     responsible adults in the community, including activities \n     such as after-school or mentoring programs; and (h) a \n     crisis management plan for responding to violent or \n     traumatic incidents on school grounds which provides for \n     addressing the needs of victims, and communicating with \n     parents, the media, law enforcement officials, and mental \n     health service providers.\n       Proposed new section 4116(a)(5) of the ESEA would add a \n     requirement that any eligible entity that applies to the \n     Governor for a subgrant under proposed new section 4115(c) \n     include in its application: (1) a description of how the \n     services and activities to be supported will be coordinated \n     with relevant SDFSC State grant programs that are supported \n     by SEAs, including how recipients will share resources, \n     services, and data; (2) a description of how the applicant \n     will coordinate its activities under this part with those \n     implemented under the Drug-Free Communities Act, if any; and \n     (3) an assurance that it will evaluate its program every two \n     years to assess its progress toward meeting its goals and \n     objectives, and will use the results of its evaluation to \n     improve its program and refine its goals and objectives as \n     needed (if the applicant is not an LEA), or the assurances \n     under proposed new section 4116(a)(4) of the ESEA (if the \n     applicant is an LEA.)\n       Proposed new section 4116(b) of the ESEA would modify the \n     current requirement that Governors use a peer review process \n     in reviewing local applications for SDFSC subgrants, by \n     giving Governors the flexibility to use other methods to \n     ensure that applications under proposed new section 4116 of \n     the ESEA are funded on the basis of need and quality, while \n     requiring SEA to use a peer review process.\n       Proposed new section 4117 (``National Evaluations and Data \n     Collections'') of the ESEA would authorize the Secretary to \n     provide for national evaluations on the quality and impact of \n     programs under this title, make minor technical changes to \n     current law to give the Secretary increased flexibility in \n     meeting the national evaluation and data collection \n     requirements in this section, and add a new requirement for \n     the Secretary and the Attorney General to publish an annual \n     report on school safety.\n       Proposed new section 4117(b) of the ESEA would make minor \n     technical changes to the current law to refocus the State \n     reports required by this section on the State's progress \n     toward attaining its performance indicators for achieving \n     drug-free, safe, and orderly learning environments in its \n     schools, consistent with the changes proposed throughout \n     proposed new Part A of Title IV of the ESEA. This section \n     would also add a new requirement for States to report, in \n     such form as the Secretary, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, may require, all \n     school-related suicides and homicides within the State, \n     whether at school or at a school sponsored function, or on \n     the way to or from school or a school-sponsored function, \n     within 30 days of the incident. This requirement will enable \n     the Federal Government to collect longitudinal data on this \n     statistic more cost-effectively, and will impose little \n     administrative burden on the States.\n       Proposed new section 4117(c)(1)(A) of the ESEA would make \n     minor technical changes to the current law to refocus the \n     local reports required by this section on the LEA's progress \n     toward attaining its performance indicators for achieving \n     drug-free, safe, and orderly learning environments in its \n     schools, consistent with the changes proposed for the \n     corresponding State reports under proposed new section \n     4117(a) of the ESEA, would add a new requirement that the LEA \n     include in this report a statement of any problems the LEA \n     has encountered in implementing its program that warrant the \n     provision of technical assistance by the SEA, to assist the \n     SEA in planning its technical assistance activities. These \n     changes would apply to LEAs that receive SDFSC subgrants \n     through their SEA under proposed new sections 4113(c)(2) or \n     4113(c)(3).\n       Proposed new section 4117(c)(1)(B) of the ESEA would add a \n     new requirement that SEAs review the annual LEA reports, and \n     terminate funding for the second or third year of an LEA's \n     program unless the SEA determines that the LEA is making \n     reasonable progress toward meeting its objectives.\n       Proposed new section 4117(c)(2) of the ESEA would add new \n     language to the ESEA requiring that Governors' award \n     recipients under proposed new section 4115(c) of the ESEA \n     submit an annual progress report to the Governor and to the \n     public containing the same type of information required for \n     LEA progress reports under proposed new section 4117(c)(1)(A) \n     of the ESEA. The Governor would be required to review the \n     annual progress reports, and to terminate funding for the \n     second or third year of a subgrantee's program unless the \n     Governor determines that the subgrantee is making reasonable \n     progress toward meeting its objectives.\n     PART B--National programs\n       Proposed new section 4211 (``National Activities'') of the \n     ESEA would authorize national programs. Proposed new section \n     4211(a) of the ESEA would, with only minor changes, authorize \n     the Secretary to use national programs funds for programs to \n     promote drug-free, safe, and orderly learning environments \n     for students at all educational levels, from preschool \n     through the postsecondary level and for programs that promote \n     lifelong physical activity. The Secretary would be authorized \n     to carry out the national programs authorized under proposed \n     new section 4211(a) directly, or through grants, contracts, \n     or cooperative agreements with public and private \n     organizations and individuals, or through agreements with \n     other Federal agencies, and to coordinate with other Federal \n     agencies as appropriate.\n       Proposed new section 4211(b)(2) of the ESEA would \n     streamline the list of authorized national programs \n     activities to the following examples: (1) one or more centers \n     to provide training and technical assistance for teachers, \n     school administrators and staff, and others on the \n     identification and implementation of effective strategies to \n     promote safe, orderly, and drug-free learning environments; \n     (2) programs to train teachers in innovative techniques and \n     strategies of effective drug and violence prevention; (3) \n     research and demonstration projects to test innovative \n     approaches to drug and violence prevention; (4) evaluations \n     of the effectiveness of programs funded under this title, and \n     of other programs designed to create safe, disciplined, and \n     drug-free environments; (5) direct services and technical \n     assistance to schools and schools systems, including those \n     afflicted with especially severe drug and violence problems; \n     (6) developing and disseminating drug and violence prevention \n     materials and information in print, audiovisual, or \n     electronic format, including information about effective \n     research-based programs, policies, practices, strategies, and \n     curriculum and other relevant materials to support drug and \n     violence prevention education; (7) recruiting, hiring, and \n     training program coordinators to assist school districts in \n     implementing high-quality, effective, research-based drug and \n     violence prevention programs; (8) the development and \n     provision of education and training programs, curricula, \n     instructional materials, and professional training for \n     preventing and reducing the incidence of crimes or conflicts \n     motivated by bullying, hate, prejudice, intolerance, or \n     sexual harassment and abuse; (9) programs for youth who \n     are out of the education mainstream, including school \n     dropouts, students who have been suspended or expelled \n     from their regular education program, and runaway or \n     homeless children and youth; (10) programs implemented in \n     conjunction with other Federal agencies that support LEAs \n     and communities in developing and implementing \n     comprehensive programs that create safe, disciplined, and \n     drug-free learning environments and promote healthy \n     childhood development; (11) services and activities that \n     reduce the need for suspension and expulsion in \n     maintaining classroom order and discipline; (12) services \n     and activities to prevent and reduce truancy; (13) \n     programs to provide counseling services to troubled youth, \n     including support for the recruitment and hiring of \n     counselors and the operation of telephone help lines; and \n     (14) other activities that meet emerging or unmet national \n     needs consistent with the purposes of this title.\n       Proposed new section 4211(c)(1) of the ESEA would authorize \n     the Secretary to carry out programs for students that promote \n     lifelong physical activity directly, or through grants, \n     contracts, or cooperative agreements with public and private \n     organizations and individuals, or through agreements with \n     other Federal agencies, and to coordinate with the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention, the President's Council \n     on Physical Fitness, and other Federal agencies as \n     appropriate. Such programs could include: conducting \n     demonstrations of school-based programs that promote lifelong \n     physical activity, with a particular emphasis on physical \n     education programs that are a part of a coordinated school \n     health programs; training, technical assistance, and other \n     activities to encourage States and LEAs to implement sound \n     school-based programs that promote lifelong physical \n     activity; and activities designed to build State capacity to \n     provide leadership and strengthen schools' capabilities to \n     provide school-based programs that promote lifelong physical \n     activity.\n       Proposed new section 4211(d) of the ESEA would retain the \n     requirement in the current statute that the Secretary use a \n     peer review process in reviewing applications for funds under \n     proposed new section 4211(a) of the ESEA.\n     Part C--School emergency response to violence\n       Proposed new section 4311 (``Project SERV'') of the ESEA \n     would authorize Project SERV, a program designed to provide \n     education-related services to LEAs in which the learning \n     environment has been disrupted due to a violent or traumatic \n     crisis, such as a shooting or major accident. The Secretary \n     would be authorized to carry out Project SERV directly, \n     through contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements with \n     public and private organizations, agencies, and individuals, \n     or through agreements with other Federal agencies.\n       Under proposed new section 4311(b) of the ESEA, Project \n     SERV would provide: (1) assistance to school personnel in \n     assessing a crisis situation, including assessing the \n     resources available to the LEA and community\n\n[[Page S6352]]\n\n     in response to the situation, and developing a response plan \n     to coordinate services provided at the Federal, State, and \n     local level; (2) mental health crisis counseling to students \n     and their families, teachers, and others in need of such \n     services; (3) increased school security; (4) training and \n     technical assistance for SEAs and LEAs, State and local \n     mental health agencies, State and local law enforcement \n     agencies, and communities to enhance their capacity to \n     develop and implement crisis intervention plans; (5) services \n     and activities designed to identify and disseminate the best \n     practices of school- and community-related plans for \n     responding to crises; and (6) other needed services and \n     activities that are consistent with the purposes of Project \n     SERV.\n       Proposed new section 4311(b) of the ESEA would require the \n     Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Attorney \n     General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the \n     Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to \n     establish criteria and application requirements as may be \n     needed to select which LEAs are assisted under Project SERV, \n     and permit the Secretary to establish reporting requirements \n     for uniform data and other information from all LEAs assisted \n     under Project SERV.\n       Proposed new section 4311(c) of the ESEA would require the \n     establishment of a Federal Coordinating Committee on school \n     crises comprised of the Secretary (who shall serve as chair \n     of the Committee), the Attorney General, the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, the Director of the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency, the Director of the Office of \n     National Drug Control Policy, and such other members as \n     the Secretary shall determine. This committee would be \n     charged with coordinating the Federal responses to crises \n     that occur in schools or directly affect the learning \n     environment in schools.\n     Part D--Related provisions\n       Proposed new section 4411 (``Gun-Free Schools Act'') of the \n     ESEA would authorize the Gun-Free Schools Act as proposed new \n     Part D of Title IV of the ESEA because of its close \n     relationship with the SDFSC program. The Gun-Free Schools Act \n     is currently authorized under Part F of Title XIV of the \n     ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 4411(b) of the ESEA would continue, \n     with minor technical changes, the current requirement that \n     each State receiving Federal funds under the ESEA have in \n     effect a State law requiring LEAs to expel from school, for a \n     period of not less than one year, a student who is determined \n     to have possessed a firearm at school under the jurisdiction \n     of the LEA in that State, and that such State law allow the \n     chief administering officer of that LEA to modify the \n     expulsion requirement for a student on a case-by-case basis. \n     It would also define the term `firearm' as that term is \n     defined in section 921 of title 18, United States Code (which \n     includes bombs).\n       Proposed new section 4411 of the ESEA would contain: (1) a \n     special rule that the provisions of this section be construed \n     in a manner consistent with the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act; (2) local reporting requirements requiring \n     each LEA requesting assistance from the SEA under the ESEA to \n     provide to the State in its application: (a) an assurance \n     that such LEA is in compliance with the State law required by \n     proposed new section 4411(b); (b) a description of the \n     circumstances surrounding any expulsions imposed under the \n     State law required by proposed new section 4411(b), including \n     the name of the school concerned, the number of students \n     expelled from such school (disaggregated by gender, race, \n     ethnicity, and educational level); and (c) the type of \n     weapons concerned; (3) the number of students referred to the \n     criminal justice or juvenile justice system as required in \n     section 4412(a)(1), and the instances in which the chief \n     administering officer of an LEA modified the expulsion \n     requirement described in section 4411(b)(1) on a case-by-case \n     basis; and (4) a requirement that each State report the \n     information described in proposed new section 4411(d) to the \n     Secretary on an annual basis.\n       Proposed new section 4412 (``Local Policies'') of the ESEA \n     would restate, with minor technical changes, the current \n     prohibition against ESEA funds being awarded to any LEA \n     unless it has a policy ensuring referral to the criminal \n     justice or juvenile delinquency system of any student who \n     possesses a firearm at a school served by such agency. It \n     would also add two new additional requirements that no \n     funds may be made available under the ESEA to any LEA \n     unless: (1) it has a policy ensuring that a student who \n     possesses a firearm at school is referred to a mental \n     health professional for assessment as to whether he or she \n     poses an imminent threat of harm to himself, herself, or \n     others and needs appropriate mental health services before \n     readmission to school; and (2) it has a policy that a \n     student who possesses a firearm at school who has been \n     determined by a mental health professional to pose an \n     imminent threat of harm to himself, herself, or others \n     receive, in addition to appropriate services under section \n     11206(9) of the ESEA, appropriate mental health services \n     before being permitted to return to school.\n       Proposed new section 4412(b) of the ESEA would restate the \n     current Gun-Free Schools Act requirement that proposed new \n     section 4412 be construed in a manner consistent with the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and proposed new \n     section 4413(c) of the ESEA would restate the current \n     definitions of the terms ``firearm'' and ``school.''\n       Proposed new section 4413 (``Materials'') of the ESEA would \n     restate the current requirement that drug prevention programs \n     supported under Title IV of the ESEA convey a clear and \n     consistent message that the illegal use of alcohol and other \n     drugs is wrong and harmful.\n       Proposed new section 4413(b) of the ESEA would continue, \n     with minor changes, the current law provision that the \n     Secretary shall not prescribe the use of particular curricula \n     for programs under Title IV of the ESEA, but may evaluate and \n     disseminate information about the effectiveness of such \n     curricula and programs.\n       Proposed new section 4414 (``Prohibited Uses of Funds'') of \n     the ESEA would restate the current prohibition against the \n     use of Title IV ESEA funds for: (1) construction (except for \n     minor remodeling needed to accomplish the purposes of this \n     part; and (2) medical services, drug treatment or \n     rehabilitation, except for pupil services or referral to \n     treatment for students who are victims of, or witnesses to, \n     crime or who use alcohol, tobacco, or drugs.\n       Proposed new section 4415 (``Drug-Free, Alcohol-Free, and \n     Tobacco-Free Schools'') of the ESEA would add a new \n     requirement that each SEA and LEA that receives Title IV, \n     ESEA funds have a policy that prohibits possession or use of \n     tobacco, and the illegal use of drugs or alcohol, in any \n     form, at any time, and by any person, in school buildings, on \n     school grounds, or at any school-sponsored event. Each LEA \n     requesting assistance under the ESEA must include in its \n     application for funding an assurance that it is in compliance \n     with this new requirement, and each SEA would be required to \n     report annually to the Secretary if any of its LEAs is not in \n     compliance with this new requirement.\n       Proposed new section 4416 (``Prohibition on Supplanting'') \n     of the ESEA would require that funds under this title be used \n     to increase the level of State, local, and other non-Federal \n     funds that would, in the absence of funds under this title, \n     be made available for programs and activities authorized \n     under this title, and in no case to supplant such State, \n     local, and other non-Federal funds.\n       Proposed new section 4417 (``Definitions of Terms'') of the \n     ESEA would restate the current law definitions for the terms \n     ``drug and violence prevention'' and ``hate crime,'' and \n     definitions for the terms ``drug treatment'' and ``drug \n     rehabilitation'' and ``medical services.''\n\n\n    Title V--promoting equity, excellence, and public school choice\n\n       Among other things, proposed new Title V of the Educational \n     Excellence for All Children Act of 1999 would: (1) improve \n     the Magnet Schools Assistance program by adding emphasis on \n     projects that consider the diversity of the student \n     populations and that have the capacity to continue after the \n     Federal grant has run out; (2) reauthorize the Women's \n     Educational Equity program, currently in Part B of Title V of \n     the ESEA, but move it to Part D of Title V of the ESEA; (3) \n     repeal the Assistance to Address School Dropout Problems \n     program, currently in Part C of Title V of the ESEA; (4) move \n     Charter Schools, from Part C of Title X of the ESEA, to Part \n     B of Title V of the ESEA; and (5) add a new initiative, \n     ``Options: Opportunities to Improve Our Nation's Schools'', \n     to be new Part C of that Title that would provide a flexible \n     authority to support SEAs and LEAs in experimenting with \n     different kinds of public elementary and secondary schools, \n     such as worksite and college-based schools.\n       Section 501. Renaming the Title. Section 501 of the bill \n     would change the name of Title V of the ESEA to ``Promoting \n     Equity, Excellence, and Public School Choice''.\n\n\n                        magnet school assistance\n\n       Section 502. Findings. Section 502 of the bill would amend \n     Part A (Magnet School Assistance) of Title V of the ESEA. \n     Section 502(a) of the bill would make editorial changes to, \n     and update, section 5101 of the ESEA, the findings for the \n     Magnet School Assistance Program.\n       Section 502(b) of the bill would amend section 5102(3) of \n     the ESEA (Statement of Purpose) to clarify that the purpose \n     of providing financial assistance to develop and design \n     innovative educational methods and practices is to promote \n     diversity and increase choices in public elementary and \n     secondary schools and educational programs.\n       Section 502(c) of the bill would amend section \n     5106(b)(1)(D) of the ESEA (Information and Assurances), a \n     part of the application requirements, to eliminate reference \n     to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and to make an \n     editorial change.\n       Section 502(d) of the bill would amend section 5107 of the \n     ESEA (Priority) to eliminate the current priorities for \n     greatest need and new, or significantly revised, projects. \n     These priorities are not well defined and have not helped to \n     determine which grant applications are most deserving. \n     Section 502(d) would also add a new priority for projects \n     that propose activities, which may include professional \n     development, that will build local capacity to operate the \n     magnet program once Federal assistance has ended.\n       Section 502(e) of the bill would amend section 5108(a) of \n     the ESEA (Uses of Funds) to: (1) revise paragraph (3) to \n     allow for the payment, or subsidization of the compensation, \n     of elementary and secondary school teachers who are certified \n     or licensed by the State, and instructional staff who have \n     expertise and professional skills necessary for the conduct \n     of programs in magnet schools or who\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\n     demonstrate knowledge, experience, or skills in the relevant \n     field of expertise; and (2) allow grantees to use funds for \n     activities, including professional development, that will \n     build the applicant's capacity to operate the magnet program \n     once Federal assistance has ended.\n       Section 502(f) of the bill would repeal section 5111 of the \n     ESEA (Innovative Programs). Activities are subsumed under the \n     new Public School Choice program.\n       Section 502(g) of the bill would redesignate current \n     section 5112 of the ESEA (Evaluation, Technical Assistance, \n     and Dissemination) as section 5111, and incorporate its \n     requirements into proposed new section (``Evaluation, \n     Technical Assistance, and Dissemination'') that would \n     authorize the Secretary to reserve not more than five percent \n     (rather than two percent) of appropriated funds in any fiscal \n     year to evaluate magnet schools programs, as well as provide \n     technical assistance to applicants and grantees and collect \n     and disseminate information on successful magnet school \n     programs. Section 502(g) of the bill would also require each \n     evaluation, in addition to current items, to address the \n     extent to which magnet school programs continue once grant \n     assistance under this part ends.\n       Section 502(h) of the bill would amend section 5113(a) of \n     the ESEA (Authorization) to authorize such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal year 2001 and for each of the four \n     succeeding fiscal years to be appropriated to carry out the \n     part. Section 501(h) of the bill would also redesignate \n     section 5113 as section 5112.\n\n\n                       women's educational equity\n\n       Section 503. Amendments to the Women's Educational Equity \n     Program. Section 503(a)(1)(A) of the bill would amend section \n     5201(a) of the ESEA (Short Title) to update and change the \n     short title from the ``Women's Educational Equity Act of \n     1994'' to the ``Women's Educational Equity Act.''\n       Section 503(a)(1)(B) of the bill would amend section \n     5201(b) of the ESEA (Findings) to make it clear, in paragraph \n     (3)(B), that classroom textbooks and other educational \n     materials continue not to reflect sufficiently the \n     experiences, achievements, or concerns of women and girls. \n     Little progress has been made in this area since 1994. \n     Section 5201(b) of the ESEA would also be amended by slightly \n     editing paragraph (3)(C) and adding a recent finding to that \n     paragraph that girls are dramatically underrepresented in \n     higher-level computer science courses.\n       Section 503(a)(2)(A) of the bill would amend section 5204 \n     of the ESEA (Applications) to change several internal section \n     references to conform section numbers to the part \n     redesignation and to clarify that the application \n     requirements in which these references appeal apply only to \n     implementation grants. Section 503(a)(2)(B) of the bill would \n     amend section 5204(b)(2) of the ESEA to change a reference to \n     ``the National Education Goals'' to ``America's Education \n     Goals.'' Section 503(a)(2)(C) of the bill would eliminate \n     section 5204(4) of the ESEA, which requires an application \n     description of how program funds would be used in a \n     consistent manner with the School-to-Work Opportunities Act \n     of 1994. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act sunsets in \n     2001, and this reference will be obsolete. Paragraphs (5) \n     through (7) in the section would be redesignated.\n       Section 503(a)(3) of the bill would conform a section \n     reference to a later redesignation.\n       Section 503(a)(4) of the bill would repeal section 5206 of \n     the ESEA (Report). The report required by this section will \n     be submitted soon, satisfying the requirement and making it \n     obsolete.\n       Section 503(a)(5) of the bill would amend section 5207 of \n     the ESEA (Administration) by eliminating subsection (a), \n     requiring the Secretary to conduct an evaluation of materials \n     and programs developed under the program and to submit a \n     report to Congress by January 1, 1998. Congress did not \n     provide funding for the mandated evaluation, and the report \n     was not done.\n       Section 503(a)(6) of the bill would amend section 5208 of \n     the ESEA to authorize appropriations of such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal year 2001 and for each of the four \n     succeeding fiscal years to carry out this part. Because the \n     appropriation for the Women's Educational Equity program has \n     been small in recent years, using two thirds of this \n     appropriation for local implementation grants (rather than \n     national research and development grants) has not been the \n     most effective and development grants) has not been the most \n     effective use of program resources.\n       Section 503(b) of the bill would redesignate Part B of \n     Title V of the ESEA as Part D of the Title and redesignate \n     sections 5201, 5202, 5203, 5204, 0505, 5207, and 5208 of the \n     ESEA as sections 5401, 5402, 5403, 5404, 5405, 5406, and \n     5407, respectively.\n\n\n             assistance to address school dropout problems\n\n       Section 504. Repeal of the Assistance to Address School \n     Dropout Problems Program. Section 504 of the bill would \n     repeal the ``Assistance to Address School Dropout Problems'' \n     program in Part C of Title V of the ESEA.\n\n\n                         public charter schools\n\n       Section 505. Redesignation of the Public Charter Schools \n     Program. Section 505 of the bill would redesignate the Public \n     Charter Schools Program, which is currently Part C of Title X \n     of the ESEA, as Part B of Title V of the ESEA. Section 505 \n     would also make necessary conforming changes to carry out the \n     redesignation.\n\n\n         OPTIONS: OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS\n\n       Section 506. Options: Opportunities to Improve Our Nation's \n     Schools. Section 506 of the bill would amend Title V of the \n     ESEA to add a proposed new Part C (``Options: Opportunities \n     to Improve Our Nation's Schools'') that would authorize a \n     flexible, competitive grant program to help SEAs and LEAs \n     provide innovative, high-quality public public school choice \n     programs.\n       Proposed new section 5301 of the ESEA would set forth the \n     findings of the proposed new part and state that its purpose \n     is to identify and support innovative approaches to high-\n     quality public school choice by providing financial \n     assistance for the demonstration, development, \n     implementation, and evaluation of, and dissemination of \n     information about, public school choice projects that \n     stimulate educational innovation for all public schools \n     and contribute to standards-based school reform efforts.\n       Proposed new section 5302(a) of the ESEA would authorize \n     the Secretary, from funds appropriated under section 5305(a) \n     and not reserved under section 5305(b), to make grants to \n     SEAs and LEAs to support programs that promote innovative \n     approaches to high-quality public school choice. Proposed new \n     section 5302(b) of the ESEA would prohibit grants under this \n     part from exceeding three years.\n       Proposed new section 5303(a) of the ESEA would authorize \n     funds under the part to be used to demonstrate, develop, \n     implement, evaluate, and disseminate information on \n     innovative approaches to broaden public school choice. \n     Examples of such approaches at the school, district, and \n     State levels would be: (1) inter-district approaches to \n     public school choice, including approaches that increase \n     equal access to high-quality educational programs and \n     diversity in schools; (2) public elementary and secondary \n     programs that involve partnerships with institutions of \n     higher education and that are located on the campuses of \n     those institutions; (3) programs that allow students in \n     public secondary schools to enroll in postsecondary courses \n     and to receive both secondary and postsecondary academic \n     credit; (4) worksite satellite schools, in which SEAs or LEAs \n     form partnerships with public or private employers, to create \n     public schools at parents' places of employment; and (5) \n     approaches to school desegregation that provide students and \n     parents choice through strategies other than magnet schools.\n       Proposed new section 5303(b) of the ESEA would require that \n     funds under this part: (1) supplement, and not supplant, non-\n     federal funds expended for existing programs; (2) not be used \n     for transportation; and (3) not be used to fund projects that \n     are specifically authorized under Part A or B of the title.\n       Proposed new section 5304(a) of the ESEA would require a \n     SEA or LEA desiring to receive a grant under this part to \n     submit an application to the Secretary, in such form and \n     containing such information, as the Secretary may require. \n     Each application would be required to include a description \n     of the program for which funds are sought and the goals for \n     such program, a description of how the program funded under \n     this part will be coordinated with, and will complement and \n     enhance, programs under other related Federal and non-federal \n     projects, and, if the program includes partners, the name of \n     each partner and a description of its responsibilities. Also, \n     each application would be required to include a description \n     of the policies and procedures the applicant will use to \n     ensure its accountability for results, including its goals \n     and performance indicators, and that the program is open and \n     accessible to, and will promote high-academic standards for, \n     all students. This will help ensure broad access to high-\n     quality schools, while allowing, for example, public-private \n     partnerships to create public worksite schools that allow \n     children of employees at the worksite to attend such a \n     school. The Secretary would be required to give a priority to \n     applications for projects that would serve high-poverty LEAs, \n     and would be authorized to give a priority to applications \n     demonstrating that the applicant will carry out its project \n     in partnership with one or more public and private agencies, \n     organizations, and institutions, including institutions of \n     higher education and public and private employers.\n       Proposed new section 5305(a) of the ESEA would authorize \n     such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2001 and for \n     each of the four succeeding fiscal years to carry out the \n     part. Proposed new section 5305(b) of the ESEA would, from \n     amounts appropriated for any fiscal year, authorize the \n     Secretary to reserve not more than five percent to carry out \n     evaluations, provide technical assistance, and disseminate \n     information. Proposed new section 5305(c) of the ESEA would \n     authorize the Secretary to use funds reserved under \n     subsection (b) to carry out one or more evaluations of \n     programs assisted under this part. Those evaluations would, \n     at a minimum, address: (1) how and the extent to which the \n     programs supported with funds under the part promote \n     educational equity and excellence; and (2) the extent to \n     which public schools of choice supported with funds under the \n     part are held accountable to the public, effective in \n     improving public education, and open and accessible to all \n     students.\n\n\n                     title vi--class-size reduction\n\n       Section 601, class-size [ESEA, Title VI]. section 601 of \n     the bill would replace Title VI of\n\n[[Page S6354]]\n\n     the ESEA with a multi-year extension of the 1-year \n     initiative, enacted in the Department's appropriations Act \n     for fiscal year 1999, to help States and LEAs improve \n     educational outcomes through reducing class sizes in the \n     early grades, as follows:\n       ESEA, Sec. 6001, findings. Section 6001 of the ESEA would \n     set out 8 findings in support of the new Title VI.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6002, purpose. Section 6002 of the ESEA would \n     provide that the purpose of Title VI is to help States and \n     LEAs recruit, train, and hire 100,000 additional teachers, in \n     order to: (1) reduce class sizes nationally, in grades 1 \n     through 3, to an average of 18 students per regular \n     classroom; and (2) improve teaching in the early grades so \n     that all students can learn to read independently and well by \n     the end of the third grade.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6003, authorization of appropriations. Section \n     6003 of the ESEA would authorize the appropriations of such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out Title VI for fiscal \n     years 2001 through 2005.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6004, allocations to States. Section 6004(a) of \n     the ESEA would direct the Secretary to reserve a total of not \n     more than 1 percent of each year's appropriation for Title VI \n     to make payments, on the basis of their respective needs, to \n     the several outlying areas and to the Secretary of the \n     Interior for activities in schools operated or supported by \n     the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).\n       After reserving funds for the outlying areas and the BIA, \n     section 6004(b) would direct the Secretary to allocate the \n     remaining amount among the States on the basis of their \n     respective shares under Part A of Title I of the ESEA or \n     under Title II of the ESEA, whichever was greater, for the \n     previous fiscal year. Because these allocations would exceed \n     the amount available, they would then be proportionately \n     reduced. If a State chooses not to participate in the \n     program, or fails to submit an approvable application, the \n     Secretary would reallocate that State's allocation to the \n     remaining States.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6005, applications. Section 6005(a) of the ESEA \n     would require the SEA of each State desiring to receive a \n     Title VI grant to submit an application to the Secretary.\n       Subsection (b) would require each application to include: \n     (1) the State's goals for using program funds to reduce \n     average class sizes in regular classrooms in grades 1 through \n     3; (2) a description of the SEA's plan for allocating program \n     funds within the State; (3) a description of how the State \n     will use other funds, including other Federal funds, to \n     reduce class sizes and improve teacher quality and reading \n     achievement within the State; and (4) an assurance that the \n     SEA will submit such reports and information as the Secretary \n     may reasonably require.\n       Subsection (c) would direct the Secretary to approve a \n     State's application if it meets the requirements of \n     subsections (a) and (b) and holds reasonable promise of \n     achieving the program's purposes.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6006, within-State allocations. Section 6006(a) \n     of the ESEA would permit participating States to reserve up \n     to one percent of each year's Title I allocation for the cost \n     of administering the program, and direct them to distribute \n     all remaining funds to LEAs. A State would distribute 80 \n     percent of its allocation on the basis of the relative number \n     of children from low-income families in LEAs, and the \n     remaining 20 percent on the basis of school-age children \n     enrolled in public and private nonprofit schools in LEAs.\n       Subsection (b) would provide for the reallocation of an \n     LEA's award to other LEAs if it chooses not to participate or \n     fails to submit an approvable application.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6007, local applications. Section 6007 of the \n     ESEA would require each LEA that wishes to receive Title VI \n     funds to submit an application to its SEA that describes its \n     program to reduce class size by hiring qualified teachers.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6008, uses of funds. Section 6008(a) of the ESEA \n     would permit each participating LEA to use up to 3 percent of \n     its subgrant for the costs of administering its Title VI \n     program.\n       Subsection (b) would permit each LEA to use up to a total \n     of 15 percent of each year's Title VI funds to: (1) assess \n     new teachers for their competency in content knowledge and \n     teaching skills; (2) assist new teachers to take any tests \n     required to meet State certification requirements; and (3) \n     provide professional development to teachers.\n       Subsection (c) would require each LEA to use the rest of \n     its Title IV funds to recruit, hire, and train certified \n     teachers for the purpose of reducing class size in grades 1 \n     through 3 to 18 children.\n       Subsection (d) would prohibit an LEA from using its Title \n     VI funds to increase the salary of, or to provide benefits \n     to, a teacher who it already employs (or has employed).\n       Subsection (e) would permit an LEA that has already reduced \n     class size in grades 1 through 3 to 18 or fewer children to \n     use its Title VI funds to make further class-size reductions \n     in grades 1 through 3, reduce class sizes in other grades, or \n     for activities, including professional development, to \n     improve teacher quality.\n       Subsection (f) would permit and LEA whose subgrant is too \n     small to pay the starting salary for a new teacher to use its \n     subgrant funds to form a consortium with one or more other \n     LEAs for the purpose of reducing class size; to help pay the \n     salary of a full-time or part-time teacher hired to reduce \n     class size; or, if the subgrant is less than $10,000, for \n     professional development.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6009, cost-sharing requirement. Section 6009(a) \n     of the ESEA would allow program funds to pay the full cost of \n     local programs under the Act in LEAs with child-poverty rates \n     greater than 50 percent. The maximum Federal share for LEAs \n     with child-poverty rates below 50 percent would be 65 \n     percent.\n       Subsection (b) would require an LEA to provide the non-\n     Federal shares of a project through cash expenditures from \n     non-Federal sources. However, an LEA operating one or more \n     schoolwide programs under section 1114 of the ESEA could use \n     funds under Part A of Title I of that Act to pay the non-\n     Federal share of activities under this program that benefit \n     those schoolwide programs, so long as the LEA meets the Title \n     I requirement to ensure that services provided with State and \n     local funds in Title I schools are at least comparable to \n     services provided with State and local funds in non-Title I \n     schools. This option would not, however, be available with \n     respect to schools operating schoolwide programs through a \n     waiver of the normal eligibility rules governing schoolwide \n     programs (current section 1114(a)(1)(B), which the bill would \n     re-enact as section 1114(a)(2)).\n       ESEA, Sec. 6010, nonsupplanting. Section 6010 of the ESEA \n     would require each participating LEA to use its Title VI \n     funds to increase the overall amount of its expenditures for \n     the combination of: (1) teachers in regular classrooms in \n     schools receiving assistance; (2) assessing new teachers and \n     assisting them to take tests required for State \n     certification; and (3) professional development for teachers.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6011, annual State reports. Section 6011 of the \n     ESEA would require each participating state to submit an \n     annual report to the Secretary on its activities under Title \n     VI.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6012, participation of private school teachers. \n     Section 6012 of the ESEA would require each LEA to provide \n     for the equitable participation of teachers from private \n     schools in professional development activities it carriers \n     out with program funds.\n       ESEA, Sec. 6013, definition. Section 6013 of the ESEA would \n     define ``State'', for the purpose of Title VI, as meaning \n     each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto \n     Rico. The outlaying areas, which would otherwise be treated \n     as States under the definition in current Sec. 14101(27) (to \n     be redesignated as Sec. 11101(27)), would be funded through \n     the special reservation in section 6004(a), rather than \n     through the formula allocations to States in section 6004(b).\n\n\n  title vii--bilingual education, language enhancement, and language \n                          acquisition programs\n\n       Title VII of the bill would revise Title VII (Bilingual \n     Education, Language Enhancement, and Language Acquisition \n     Programs) of the ESEA to enhance and make more effective the \n     accountability provisions for those receiving grants under \n     Subpart 1 of the title and improve the professional \n     development programs under Subpart 2 of Title VII by \n     eliminating overlap among the different authorized activities \n     and targeting activities on specific areas where assistance \n     is most needed. Other program improvements are also proposed.\n\n\n                          bilingual education\n\n       Section 701. Findings, Policy, and Purpose. Section 701 of \n     the bill would amend sections 7102(a) (Findings) and (b) \n     (Policy) of the ESEA to incorporate recent research findings \n     and to add the policy that limited English proficient \n     students be tested in English after three consecutive years \n     in United States' schools. This requirement is consistent \n     with the school accountability requirements associated with \n     limited English proficient students in section \n     1111(b)(2)(F)(v) of Title I of the ESEA. Section 701 of the \n     bill would also amend section 7102(c) (Purpose) of the ESEA \n     to add helping to ensure that limited English proficient \n     students master English as a stated purpose and to make minor \n     editorial changes.\n       Section 702. Authorization of Appropriations for Part A. \n     Section 702 of the bill would amend section 7103(a) of the \n     ESEA to authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out programs under Part A of the Title \n     from fiscal year 2001 through 2005.\n       Section 703. Program Development and Enhancement Grants. In \n     order to simplify and improve administration of instructional \n     services grants, section 703 of the bill would amend section \n     7113 of the ESEA (Enhancement Grants) to consolidate the \n     activities of the Program Development and Implementation \n     Grants program (currently in section 7112 of the ESEA and \n     repealed in section 730 of the bill) and the Enhancement \n     Grants program into a new three-year grant program, ``Program \n     Development and Enhancement Grants.''\n       Section 703(3) of the bill would require grants to be used \n     to: (1) develop and implement comprehensive, preschool, \n     elementary, or secondary education programs for children and \n     youth with limited English proficiency, that are aligned with \n     standards-based State and local school reform efforts and \n     coordinated with other relevant programs and services; (2) \n     provide high-quality professional development; and (3) \n     require annual assessment of student progress in learning \n     English. Section 703(3) of the bill would also amend current \n     language on allowable activities to emphasize effective \n     instructional practice and the use of technology in the \n     classroom.\n       Section 703(4) of the bill would authorize the Secretary to \n     give priority to applicants that enroll fewer than 10,000 \n     students and\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\n     that have limited or no experience in serving limited English \n     proficient students.\n       Section 704. Comprehensive School Grants. Section 704 of \n     the bill would amend section 7114 of the ESEA that authorizes \n     five-year Comprehensive School Grants for school-wide \n     instructional programs. Section 704(1) of the bill would \n     revise the purpose of the program. The purpose would be to \n     implement school-wide education programs, in coordination \n     with Title I of the ESEA, for children and youth with limited \n     English proficiency to assist such children and youth to \n     learn English and achieve to challenging State content and \n     performance standards, and to improve, reform, and upgrade \n     relevant programs and operations in schools with significant \n     concentrations of such students or that serve significant \n     numbers of such students.\n       Section 704(2) of the bill would amend section 7114(b)(2) \n     of the ESEA to replace the termination provisions with a \n     clearer system of accountability requiring the Secretary, \n     before making a continuation award for the fourth year of a \n     program under this section, to determine if the program is \n     making continuous and substantial progress in assisting \n     children and youth with limited English proficiency to learn \n     English and achieve to challenging State content and \n     performance standards. The Secretary would base such \n     determination on the indicators established and data and \n     information collected under the annual evaluations under \n     section 7118 (as redesignated) and such other data and \n     information as the Secretary may require. If the Secretary \n     determines that a recipient requesting a fourth-year \n     continuation award under this section is not making \n     continuous and substantial progress, the recipient would \n     be required to promptly develop and submit to the \n     Secretary a program improvement plan for its program. The \n     Secretary would be required to approve a program \n     improvement plan only if he or she determines that it held \n     reasonable promise of enabling students with limited \n     English proficiency participating in the program to learn \n     English and achieve to challenging State content and \n     performance standards. If the Secretary determines that \n     the recipient is not making substantial progress in \n     implementing the program improvement plan, the Secretary \n     would be required to deny a continuation award.\n       Section 704(3) of the bill would establish required \n     activities. The required activities would, among other \n     things, include the annual assessment of student progress in \n     learning English. Section 704(3) of the bill would also amend \n     current language on allowable activities to, among other \n     things, emphasize effective instructional practice and the \n     use of technology in the classroom.\n       Section 704(4) of the bill would limit the period during \n     which grant funds may be used for planning to 90 days and \n     limit the number of schools that may be included in the grant \n     to two. These changes would ensure more effective use of \n     Federal assistance.\n       Section 705. Systemwide Improvement Grants. Section 705 of \n     the bill would amend section 7115 (Systemwide Improvement \n     Grants) of the ESEA that authorizes five-year grants for \n     projects within an entire school district. Section 705(1) of \n     the bill would amend section 7115(a) of the ESEA to make \n     editorial and conforming changes to that subsection.\n       Section 705(2) of the bill would amend section 7115(b)(2) \n     of the ESEA to replace the termination provisions with a \n     clearer system of accountability requiring the Secretary, \n     before making a continuation award for the fourth year of a \n     program under this section, to determine if the program is \n     making continuous and substantial progress in assisting \n     children and youth with limited English proficiency to learn \n     English and achieve to challenging State content and \n     performance standards. The Secretary would base such \n     determination on the indicators established and data and \n     information collected under the annual evaluations under \n     section 7118 (as redesignated), and such other data and \n     information as the Secretary may require. If the Secretary \n     determines that a recipient requesting a fourth-year \n     continuation award under this section is not making \n     continuous and substantial progress, the recipient would be \n     required to promptly develop and submit to the Secretary a \n     program improvement plan for its program. The Secretary would \n     be required to approve a program improvement plan only if he \n     or she determines that it held reasonable promise of enabling \n     students with limited English proficiency participating in \n     the program to learn English and achieve to challenging State \n     content and performance standards. If the Secretary \n     determines that the recipient is not making substantial \n     progress in implementing the program improvement plan, the \n     Secretary would be required to deny a continuation award.\n       Section 705(3) of the bill would establish required \n     activities, including building school district capacity to \n     continue to operate similar instructional programs once \n     Federal funding is no longer available, aligning programs for \n     limited English proficient students with school, district, \n     and State reform efforts and coordinating with other relevant \n     programs (such as Title I), and annually assessing student \n     progress in learning English. The required activities would \n     help ensure that projects effectively promote educational \n     reform for limited English proficient students. Section \n     705(3) of the bill would also amend current language on \n     allowable activities to, among other things, emphasize \n     effective instructional practice, developing student \n     proficiency in two languages, and the use of technology in \n     the classroom.\n       Section 706. Applications for Awards under Subpart 1. \n     Section 706 of the bill would amend section 7116 of the ESEA \n     (Applications) to make changes designed to increase program \n     accountability.\n       Section 706(1) of the bill would amend section 7116(b) of \n     the ESEA (State Review and Comments) to clarify that SEAs \n     must not only review Subpart 1 applications, but also \n     transmit that review in writing to the Department.\n       Section 706(2) of the bill would amend section 7116(f) of \n     the ESEA (Required Documentation) to require documentation \n     that the leadership of each participating school had been \n     involved in the development and planning of the program in \n     the school.\n       Section 706(3) of the bill would amend section 7116(g) of \n     the ESEA (Contents) to reorganize paragraph (A) and to add to \n     the list of data to be included in the application, data on: \n     (1) current achievement data of the limited English \n     proficient students to be served by the program (and in \n     comparison to their English proficient peers) in reading or \n     language arts (in English and in the native language if \n     applicable) and in math; (2) reclassification rates for \n     limited English proficient students in the district; (3) the \n     previous schooling experiences of participating students; and \n     (4) the professional development needs of the instructional \n     personnel who will provide services for limited English \n     proficient students, including the need for certified \n     teachers; and (5) how the grant would supplement the basic \n     services provided to limited English proficient students. \n     Many school districts already collect such data and its \n     collection would help ensure that data submitted with the \n     application could be used to establish a baseline against \n     which instructional progress could be measured.\n       Section 706(3) of the bill would also make editorial \n     changes to section 7116(g)(1)(B) of the ESEA and require, in \n     section 7116(g)(1)(E) of the ESEA, an assurance that the \n     applicant will employ teachers in the proposed program who \n     individually, or in combination, are proficient in the native \n     language of the majority of students they teach, if \n     instruction in the program is also in the native language.\n       Section 706(4) of the bill would amend section 7116(i) of \n     the ESEA (Priorities and Special Rules) to add two new \n     priorities for applicants that experience a dramatic increase \n     in the number of limited English proficient students enrolled \n     and demonstrate that they have a proven record of success in \n     helping children and youth with limited English proficiency \n     learn English and achieve to high academic standards and make \n     editorial revisions.\n       Section 707. Evaluations under Subpart 1. Section 707(1) of \n     the bill would amend current section 7123(a) of the ESEA \n     (Evaluation) to require that grantees conduct an annual, \n     rather than biennial, evaluation. This change would enhance \n     the Department's ability to hold projects accountable for \n     teaching English to limited English proficient students and \n     to determine the extent to which these students are achieving \n     to State standards.\n       Section 707(2) of the bill would revise the list of \n     evaluation components, in section 7123(c) of the ESEA, to \n     require a recipient to: (1) use the data provided in the \n     application as baseline data against which to report academic \n     achievement and gains in English proficiency for students in \n     the program; (2) report on the validity and reliability of \n     all instruments used to measure student progress; and (3) \n     enable results to be disaggregated by such relevant factors \n     as a student's grade, gender, and language group and whether \n     the student has a disability. Evaluations would be required \n     to include: (1) data on the project's progress in achieving \n     its objectives; (2) data showing the extent to which all \n     students served by the program are achieving to the State's \n     student performance standards; (3) program implementation \n     indicators that address each of the program's objectives and \n     components, including the extent to which professional \n     development activities have resulted in improved classroom \n     practices and improved student achievement; (4) a description \n     of how the activities funded under the grant are coordinated \n     and integrated with the overall school program and other \n     Federal, State, or local programs serving limited English \n     proficient children and youth; and (5) such other information \n     as the Secretary may require. This revision is necessary to \n     ensure that grantees submit data needed to make a \n     determination on whether the project should be continued at \n     the end of the third year or at the end of the fourth year, \n     and also provide the Department with data needed to assess \n     grantee progress towards meeting goals established for the \n     Bilingual Education program under the Government Performance \n     and Results Act (GPRA).\n       Section 707(3) of the bill would add a new subsection (d) \n     (Performance Measures) that would require the Secretary to \n     establish performance indicators to determine if programs \n     under sections 7113 and 7114 (as redesignated) are making \n     continuous and substantial progress, and allow the Secretary \n     to establish such indicators to determine if programs under \n     section 7112 (as redesignated) are making continuous and \n     substantial progress, toward assisting children and youth \n     with limited English proficiency to learn English and achieve \n     to challenging State content and performance standards.\n       Section 708. Research. Section 708 of the bill would amend \n     current section 7231 of the ESEA (Research) to support the \n     use of the\n\n[[Page S6356]]\n\n     research authority to gather data needed to assess the \n     Department's progress in meeting goals established for the \n     Bilingual Education program under GPRA.\n       Section 708(1) of the bill would amend sections 7132 (a) \n     (Administration) and (b) (Requirements) of the ESEA to \n     eliminate the requirement that research be conducted through \n     the Office of Educational Research and Improvement in \n     collaboration with the Office of Bilingual Education and \n     Minority Languages Affairs and also to provide a list of \n     allowable research activities (including data collection \n     needed for compliance with GPRA and identifying technology-\n     based approaches that show effectiveness in helping limited \n     English proficient students reach challenging State \n     standards).\n       Section 708(3) of the bill would make conforming changes to \n     sections 7321 (c)(1) and (2) of the ESEA and eliminate the \n     authorization for grantees under Subparts 1 and 2 to submit \n     research applications at the same time as their applications \n     under Subparts 1 and 2. The current provision unnecessarily \n     complicates the conduct of these grant competitions. Section \n     708(4) of the bill would eliminate section 7132(e) (Data \n     Collection) since data collection is an activity authorized \n     in subsection (a).\n       Section 709. Academic Excellence Awards. Section 709 of the \n     bill would replace current section 7133 of the ESEA (Academic \n     Excellence) that authorizes grants, contracts, and \n     cooperative agreements to promote the adoption of promising \n     instructional and professional development programs, with a \n     State discretionary grant program. Under the new program, the \n     Secretary would be authorized to make grants to SEAs to \n     assist them in recognizing LEAs and other public and non-\n     profit entities whose programs have demonstrated significant \n     progress in assisting limited English proficient students to \n     learn English and to meet the same challenging State content \n     standards expected of all children and youth, within three \n     years. The expanded State role proposed in these amendments \n     is designed to encourage and reward exceptional programs and \n     help disseminate information on effective instructional \n     practices for serving limited English proficient students.\n       Section 710. State Grant Program. Section 710 of the bill \n     would amend subsection (c) (Uses of Funds) of section 7134 \n     (State Grant Program) of the ESEA to require State to use \n     funds under the section to: (1) assist LEAs with program \n     design, capacity building, assessment of student performance, \n     program evaluation, and development of data collection and \n     accountability systems for limited English proficient \n     students that are aligned with State reform efforts; and (2) \n     collect data on limited English proficient populations in the \n     State and the educational programs and services available to \n     such populations. This amendment is designed to improve the \n     quality of data collected by LEAs relating to services for \n     limited English proficient students.\n       Section 711. National Clearinghouse on the Education of \n     Children and Youth with Limited English Proficiency. Section \n     711 would amend section 7135 of the ESEA (National \n     Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education) to rename the \n     Clearinghouse the ``National Clearinghouse for the Education \n     of Children and Youth with Limited English Proficiency'', and \n     to eliminate ambiguous and burdensome requirements that the \n     Clearinghouse be administered as an adjunct to the \n     Educational Resources Information Center Clearinghouse \n     system, develop a data base management and monitoring system, \n     and develop, maintain, and disseminate a listing of bilingual \n     education professionals.\n       Section 712. Instructional Materials Development. Section \n     712 of the bill would amend section 7136 of the ESEA \n     (Instructional Materials) to expand the current authorization \n     for grants to develop, publish, and disseminate instructional \n     materials. The current authorization is limited to Native \n     American, Native Hawaiian, Native Pacific Islanders, and \n     other languages of outlying areas. The amendment would add \n     other low-incidence languages in the United States for which \n     instructional materials are not readily available. The kinds \n     of materials that may be developed would also be expanded to \n     include materials on State content standards and assessments \n     for dissemination to parents of limited English proficient \n     students. The proposed amendment recognizes that \n     instructional materials may be needed in languages other than \n     those listed in the current statute and that materials may be \n     needed to prepare parents to become more involved in the \n     education of their children.\n       Section 712 of the bill would also require the Secretary to \n     give priority to applications for developing instructional \n     materials in languages indigenous to the United States or to \n     the outlying territories and for developing and evaluating \n     instructional materials that reflect challenging State and \n     local content standards, in collaboration with activities \n     assisted under Subpart 1 and section 7124.\n       Section 713. Purpose of Subpart 3. Section 713 of the bill \n     would amend section 7141 (Purpose) of Subpart 3 (Professional \n     Development) of Part A of the title to eliminate a reference \n     to dissemination of information. This activity is not \n     directly related to professional development.\n       Section 714. Training for all Teachers Program. Section 714 \n     of the bill would amend section 7142 of the ESEA (Training \n     for all Teachers Program) to limit grants to ongoing \n     professional development. This change would provide greater \n     focus to the activity since the current statute covers both \n     inservice and preservice professional development. The \n     Secretary would be authorized to award grants to LEAs or to \n     one or more LEAs in consortium with one or more institutions \n     of higher education, SEAs, or nonprofit organizations. This \n     change would help ensure that the professional development \n     supported by the grant directly addresses the staffing needs \n     of one or more LEAs.\n       Section 7142 of the ESEA would be further amended to reduce \n     the grant period from 5 to 3 years, thus allowing the program \n     to assist a greater number of communities. Also, funded \n     professional development activities would be required to be \n     of high-quality and long-term in nature, thus no longer could \n     they be simply a few weekend seminars. The list of allowable \n     activities would be expanded to, among other things, include \n     induction programs, clarifying that grantees may use grants \n     to cover the costs of coaching by teachers experienced in \n     serving limited English proficient students for teachers who \n     are preparing to serve these students, and support for \n     teacher use of education technologies. The proposed \n     amendments reflect current research findings on effective \n     professional development practices.\n       Section 715. Bilingual Education Teachers and Personnel \n     Grants. Section 715 of the bill would amend section 7143 of \n     the ESEA (Bilingual Education Teachers and Personnel Grants) \n     to limit grants to institutions of higher education for \n     preservice professional development. This change would \n     provide greater focus to the activity since the current \n     statute covers both inservice and preservice professional \n     development.\n       Also, section 715(3) of the bill would add a new subsection \n     (d) to section requiring that funds be used to put in place a \n     course of study that prepares teachers to serve limited \n     English proficient students, integrate course content \n     relating to meeting the needs of limited English proficient \n     students into all programs for prospective teachers, assign \n     tenured faculty to train teachers to serve limited English \n     proficient students, incorporate State content and \n     performance standards into the institution's coursework, and \n     expand clinical experiences for participants. The new \n     subsection would also authorized grantees to use funds for \n     such activities as supporting partnerships with LEAs, \n     restructuring higher education course content, assisting \n     other institutions of higher education to improve the quality \n     of relevant professional development programs and expanding \n     recruitment efforts for students who will participate in \n     relevant professional development programs.\n       The proposed amendments recognize that all prospective \n     teachers should have a basic understanding of effective \n     methods for serving limited English proficient students. \n     Because of the rapid growth in this population, all teachers \n     can expect to have limited English proficient students in \n     their classrooms at some point in their teaching career. \n     These amendments also recognize the importance of creating a \n     closer link between schools of education that produce new \n     teachers and the schools that hire them.\n       Section 716. Bilingual Education Career Ladder Program. \n     Section 716 of the bill would amend section 7144 of the ESEA \n     (Bilingual Education Career Ladder Program) to authorize \n     grants to a consortia of one or more institutions of higher \n     education and one or more institutions of higher education \n     and one or more SEAs or LEAs to develop and implement \n     bilingual education career ladder programs. A bilingual \n     education career ladder program would be a program designed \n     to provide high-quality, pre-baccalaureate coursework and \n     teacher training to educational personnel who do not have a \n     baccalaureate degree and that would lead to timely receipt of \n     a baccalaureate degree and certification or licensure of \n     program participants as bilingual education teachers or \n     other educational personnel who serve limited English \n     proficient students. Recipients of grants would be \n     required to coordinate with programs under title II of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965, and other relevant programs, \n     for the recruitment and retention of bilingual students in \n     postsecondary programs to train them to become bilingual \n     educators, and make use of all existing sources of student \n     financial aid before using grant funds to pay tuition and \n     stipends for participating students.\n       Also, section 716(4) of the bill would amend section \n     7144(d) of the ESEA (Special Considerations) to eliminate the \n     current special considerations and require the Secretary, \n     instead, to give special consideration to applications that \n     provide training in English as a second language, including \n     developing proficiency in the instructional use of English \n     and, as appropriate, a second language in classroom contexts.\n       Section 717. Graduate Fellowships in Bilingual Education \n     Program. Section 717 of the bill would amend section 7145(a) \n     of the ESEA (Authorization) in the Graduate Fellowships in \n     Bilingual Education Program, to eliminate the authorization \n     for fellowships at the post-doctoral level and the \n     requirement that the Secretary make a specific number of \n     fellowship awards in any given year. Masters and doctoral \n     level fellows are more likely to provide a direct benefit to \n     classroom instruction than fellows at the post-doctoral \n     level.\n       Section 718. Applications for Awards under Subpart 3. \n     Section 718 of the bill would amend section 7146 of the ESEA \n     (Application) to clarify that the State educational agency \n     must review and submit written comments on all applications \n     for professional development grants, with the exception of \n     those for fellowships, to the Secretary.\n\n[[Page S6357]]\n\n       Section 719. Evaluations under Subpart 3. Section 719 of \n     the bill would amend section 7149 of the ESEA (Program \n     Evaluations) to require an annual evaluation and to clarify \n     evaluation requirements. The purpose of these proposed \n     amendments is to increase project accountability and ensure \n     that the Department receives data from grantees that is \n     required to address performance goals established under the \n     GPRA.\n       Section 720. Transition. Section 720 of the bill would \n     amend section 7161 of the ESEA (Transition) to provide that a \n     recipient of a grant under subpart 1 of Part A of this title \n     that is in its third or fourth year of the grant on the day \n     preceding the date of enactment of the Educational Excellence \n     for All Children Act of 1999 shall be eligible to receive \n     continuation funding under the terms and conditions of the \n     original grant.\n\n\n                 emergency immigrant education program\n\n       Section 721. Findings of the emergency Immigrant Education \n     Program. Section 721 of the bill would amend section 7301 \n     (Findings and Purpose) of Part C (Emergency Immigrant \n     Education Program) of Title VII of the ESEA to add an \n     additional finding to better justify the program.\n       Section 722. State Administrative Costs. Section 722 of the \n     bill would amend section 7302 of the ESEA (State \n     Administrative Costs) to authorize States to use up to 2 \n     percent of their grant for administrative costs if they \n     distribute funds to LEAs within the State on a competitive \n     basis. The current provision caps State administrative costs \n     at 1.5 percent, which is insufficient to cover the costs of \n     holding a State discretionary grant competition.\n       Section 723. Competitive State Grants to Local Educational \n     Agencies. Section 723 of the bill would amend section \n     7304(e)(1) of the ESEA to eliminate the $50 million \n     appropriations trigger on, and the 20 percent cap for, \n     allowing States each year to reserve funds from their program \n     allotments and award grants, on a competitive basis, to LEAs \n     with the State. This change reflects current budget policy \n     and practice of allowing State recipients the opportunity to \n     allow LEAs to compete for funds.\n       Section 724. Authorization of Appropriations for Part C. \n     Section 724 of the bill you amend section 7309 of the ESEA \n     (Authorizations of Appropriations) to authorize the \n     appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for each of \n     fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to carry out Part C of Title \n     VII.\n\n\n                           general provisions\n\n       Section 725. Definitions. Section 725 of the bill would \n     amend section 7501 (Definitions; Regulations) of Part E \n     (General provisions) of Title VII of the ESEA to add a \n     definition of ``reclassification rate,'' a term used in the \n     proposed amendments to the Applications and Evaluations \n     sections of Subpart 1 of Part A of Title VII of the ESEA. The \n     term would mean the annual percentage of limited English \n     proficient students who have met the State criteria for no \n     longer being considered limited English proficient. Also, the \n     current definition of ``Special Alternative Instructional \n     Program'', would be eliminated.\n       Section 726. Regulations, Parental Notification, and Use of \n     Paraprofessionals. Section 726 of the bill would amend \n     section 7502 (Regulations and Notification) of Part E to add \n     requirements for projects funded under subpart 1 of Part A of \n     the title relating to parental notification and the use of \n     instructional staff who are not certified in the field in \n     which they teach. Section 726(1) of the bill would amend the \n     section heading to read: ``REGULATIONS, PARENTAL \n     NOTIFICATION, AND USE OF PARAPROFESSIONALS''.\n       Section 726(2) of the bill would amend section 7502(b) \n     (Parental Notification) of the ESEA by making conforming \n     amendments in paragraphs (1)(A) and (C) of the subsection and \n     amending paragraph (2)(A) of the subsection to change the \n     paragraph heading to ``Option to Withdraw'' and to require a \n     recipient of funds under Subpart 1 of Part A to provide a \n     written notice to parents of children who will participate in \n     the programs under that subpart, in a form and language \n     understandable to the parents, that informs them that they \n     may withdraw their child from the program at any time.\n       Section 726(3) of the bill would add a new subsection (c) \n     to require that, on the date of enactment of the Educational \n     Excellence for All Children Act of 1999, all new staff hired \n     to provide academic instruction in programs supported under \n     Part A, Subpart 1, will be in accordance with the \n     requirements of section 1119(c) of the ESEA, relating to the \n     employment of paraprofessionals. These amendments are \n     designed to lead to an improvement of the professional skills \n     of instructional staff providing services to limited English \n     proficient students.\n\n\n           repeals, redesignations, and conforming amendments\n\n       Section 727. Terminology. Section 727 of the bill would \n     amend subparts 1 and 2 of Part A and section 7501(6) of the \n     ESEA to conform references to bilingual education and special \n     alternative instruction programs to instructional programs \n     for children and youth with limited English proficiency.\n       Section 728. Repeals. Section 730 of the bill would repeal \n     current sections 7112, 7117, 7119, 7120, 7121, 7147 and Part \n     B of Title VII of the ESEA.\n       Section 7112 would no longer be needed since the authorized \n     activity would be consolidated with the activity authorized \n     by Section 7113.\n       Section 7117 (Intensified Instruction), 7119 (Subgrants), \n     7120 (Priority on Funding), and 7121 (Coordination) of the \n     ESEA would be repealed since these sections repeat language \n     appearing elsewhere in the statute or cover situations that \n     are unlikely to occur.\n       Section 7147 (Program Requirements) of the ESEA would be \n     repealed because it requires that all professional \n     development grants assist educational personnel in meeting \n     State and local certification requirements. This requirement \n     is not relevant to all of the authorized professional \n     development activities.\n       Part B of Title VII of the ESEA would be moved to new Part \n     I of Title X of the ESEA.\n       Section 729. Redesignations and Conforming Amendments. \n     Section 731 of the bill would provide for the redesignation \n     of various sections of the ESEA and for conforming references \n     to those sections and to other sections of the ESEA that have \n     been changed.\n\n\n                         TITLE VIII--IMPACT AID\n\n       Title VIII of the bill would amend Title VIII of the ESEA, \n     which authorizes the Impact Aid program.\n       Section 801, purpose [ESEA, Sec. 8001]. Section 801 of the \n     bill would amend section 8001 of the ESEA to provide that the \n     purpose of the Impact Aid program is to provide assistance to \n     certain LEAs that are financially burdened as a result of \n     activities of the Federal Government carried out in their \n     jurisdictions, in order to help those LEAs provide \n     educational services to their children, including federally \n     connected children, so that they can meet challenging State \n     standards. This will provide a succinct statement of the \n     program's purpose, as is typical of other programs, in place \n     of the statement in the current statute, which is overly long \n     and which refers to certain categories of eligibility that \n     other provisions of the bill would repeal.\n       Section 802, payments relating to Federal acquisition of \n     real property [ESEA, Sec. 8002]. Section 802 of the bill \n     would amend section 8002 of the ESEA, which authorizes the \n     Secretary to partially compensate certain LEAs for revenue \n     lost due to the presence of non-taxable Federal property, \n     such as a military base or a national park, in their \n     jurisdictions. The amendments made by section 8002 would \n     better target funds on the LEAs most burdened by the presence \n     of Federal property, so that appropriations for section 8002, \n     which are not warranted under current law, may be justified \n     in the future.\n       Section 802(a)(1) of the bill would delete unneeded \n     language in section 8002(a) of the ESEA that refers to the \n     fiscal years for which payments under section 8002 are \n     authorized. That issue is fully covered by the authorization \n     of appropriations in section 8014 of the ESEA.\n       Section 802(a)(2) would delete an alternative eligibility \n     criterion (current section 8002(a)(1)(C)(ii)), which was \n     enacted to benefit a single LEA, and would add a requirement \n     that the Federal property claimed as the basis of eligibility \n     have a current aggregate assessed value (as determined under \n     section 8002(b)(3)) that is at least 10 percent of the total \n     assessed value of all real property in the LEA. (The current \n     statutory requirement that Federal property constituted 10 \n     percent of the total assessed value when the Federal \n     Government acquired it would be retained.) The new provision \n     will ensure that payments under section 8002 are made only to \n     LEAs in which the presence of Federal property continues to \n     have a significant effect on the local tax base.\n       Section 802(b) would repeal subsections (d) through (g) and \n     (i) through (k) of section 8002. Each of these provisions was \n     enacted for the benefit of a single LEA (or a limited number \n     of LEAs) and describes a situation in which the burden, if \n     any, from Federal property is not sufficient to warrant \n     compensation from Federal taxpayers. The presence of these \n     provisions reduces the amount of funds available to LEAs that \n     legitimately request funds under this authority.\n       Section 802(c) would replace the soon-to-be obsolete ``hold \n     harmless'' language in section 8002(h) of the ESEA with \n     language providing for a three-year phase-out of payments to \n     LEAs that received section 8002 payments for FY 1999, but \n     that would no longer be eligible because of the new \n     requirement, discussed above, that Federal property \n     constitute at least ten percent of the current assessed value \n     of all real property in the LEA. This phase-out will provide \n     a fair and reasonable period for these LEAs to adjust to the \n     loss of their eligibility, while making more funds available \n     to those LEAs whose local tax bases continue to be affected \n     by the presence of Federal property.\n       Section 802(d) would make minor conforming amendments to \n     section 8002(b)(1).\n       Section 803, payments for eligible federally connected \n     children [ESEA, Sec. 8003]. Section 803(a)(1) of the bill \n     would amend the list of categories of children who may be \n     counted for purposes of basic support payments under section \n     8003(a), by deleting the various categories of so-called \n     ``(b)'' children, whose attendance at LEA schools imposes a \n     much lower burden that does not warrant Federal compensation. \n     As amended, these payments would be made on behalf of \n     approximately 300,000 ``(a)'' students throughout the Nation, \n     i.e.: (1) children of Federal employees who both live and \n     work on Federal property; (2) children of military personnel \n     (and other members of the uniformed services) living on \n     Federal property; (3) children living on Indian lands; and \n     (4) children of foreign military officers living on Federal \n     property.\n       Section 803(a)(2) would conform the statement of weighted \n     student units in section\n\n[[Page S6358]]\n\n     8003(a)(2) to reflect the elimination of ``(b)'' students \n     from eligibility.\n       Section 803(a)(3) would delete section 8003(a) (3) and (4), \n     each of which relates to categories of children whose \n     eligibility would be ended under paragraph (1)\n       Section 803(b)(1)(B) would delete the requirement that an \n     LEA have at least 400 eligible students (or that those \n     students constitute at least three percent of its average \n     daily attendance) in order to receive a payment. Thus, any \n     LEA with ``(a)'' children would qualify for a basic support \n     payment.\n       Section 803(b)(1)(D) would amend section 8003(b)(1)(C) \n     (which would be redesignated as subparagraph (B)) to delete \n     two of the four options for determining an LEA's local \n     contribution rate (LCR), which is used to compute its maximum \n     payment, and to add a third method to the remaining two. \n     These changes would make payments more closely reflect the \n     actual local cost of educating students because each of the \n     three options, unlike the two options that would be deleted, \n     would include a measure of the amount or proportion of funds \n     that are provided at the local level.\n       Section 803(b)(1)(E) would add a new subparagraph (C) to \n     section 8003(b)(1) to provide that, generally, local \n     contribution rates would be determined using data from the \n     third preceding fiscal year. This is the most recent fiscal \n     year for which satisfactory data on average per-pupil \n     expenditures are usually available.\n       Section 803(b)(2)(B) would amend section 8003(b)(2)(B), \n     which describes how the Secretary computes each LEA's \n     ``learning opportunity threshold'' (LOT), a factor used in \n     determining actual payment amounts when sufficient funds are \n     not available, as is the norm, to pay the maximum statutory \n     amounts. Under current law, an LEA's LOT is a percentage, \n     which may not exceed 100, computed by adding the percentage \n     of its students who are federally connected and the \n     percentage that its maximum payment is of its total current \n     expenditures. Under the amendments, an LEA's LOT would be 50 \n     percent plus one-half of the percentage of its students who \n     are federally connected. The proposed LOT would consistently \n     favor LEAs with high concentrations of federally connected \n     students, which face a disproportionately high burden as a \n     result of Federal activities, unlike the current statute, \n     which allows an LEA to reach a LOT of 100 percent even though \n     the federally connected students constitute considerably less \n     than 100 percent of its total student body. The revised LOT \n     would also remove the current incentive for LEAs to reduce \n     their local tax effort in order to earn a higher LOT.\n       Section 803(b)(2)(B)(i) would delete section \n     8003(b)(2)(B)(ii), which would no longer be needed in light \n     of the changes to the LOT calculation described above. This \n     section would also delete section 8003(b)(2)(B)(iii), which \n     inappropriately benefits a single LEA by providing a \n     different method of calculating its LOT that is not available \n     to any other LEA.\n       Section 803(b)(2)(C) would amend section 8003(b)(2)(C) to \n     clarify that payments are proportionately increased from the \n     amounts determined under the LOT provisions (but not to \n     exceed the statutory maximums) when available funds are \n     sufficient to make payments above the LOT-based amounts.\n       Section 803(b)(3) would delete section 8003(b)(3), which \n     provides an unwarranted benefit to a particular State in \n     which there is only one LEA by requiring the Secretary to \n     treat each of the administrative districts of that LEA as if \n     they were individual LEAs. As with other LEAs (many of which \n     have more students than the State in question and that also \n     have internal administrative districts), this LEA's \n     eligibility for a payment, and the amount of any payment, \n     should be determined with regard to the entire LEA, not its \n     administrative units.\n       Section 803(c) would make a technical amendment to section \n     8003(c) of the ESEA, which generally requires the use of data \n     from the immediately preceding fiscal year in making \n     determinations under section 8003, to reflect the addition of \n     section 8003(b)(1)(C), which provides for the use of data \n     from the third preceding fiscal year in determining LEA local \n     contribution rates.\n       Section 803(d) would amend section 8003(d) of the ESEA, \n     which authorizes additional payments to LEAs on behalf of \n     children with disabilities, to conform to the deletion of \n     ``(b)'' children from eligibility for basic support payments, \n     and to reflect the fact that some of these children may be \n     eligible for early intervention services, rather than a free \n     appropriate public education, under the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act.\n       Section 803(e) would delete the ``hold-harmless'' \n     provisions relating to basic support payments in section \n     8003(e) of the ESEA. By guaranteeing that certain LEAs \n     continue to receive a high percentage of the amounts they \n     received in prior years, without regard to current \n     circumstances, these provisions inappropriately divert a \n     substantial amount of funds from LEAs that have a greater \n     need, based on the statutory criteria.\n       Section 803(f) of the bill would amend section 8003(f) of \n     the ESEA, which authorizes additional payments to LEAs that \n     are heavily impacted by the presence of federally connected \n     children in their schools. In general, the amendments to this \n     provision are designed to ensure that eligibility for these \n     additional payments is restricted to those relatively few \n     LEAs for whom it is warranted, and that the amounts of \n     those payments accurately reflect the financial burden \n     caused by a large Federal presence in those LEAs.\n       Under section 8003(f)(2), an LEA would have to meet each of \n     three criteria to qualify for a payment. First, federally \n     connected children (i.e., ``(a)'' children) would have to \n     constitute at least 40 percent of the LEA's enrollment and \n     the LEA would have to have a tax rate for general-fund \n     purposes that is at least 100 percent of the average tax rate \n     of comparable LEAs in the State. Any LEA whose boundaries are \n     the same as those of a military installation would also \n     qualify. Second, the LEA would have to be exercising due \n     diligence to obtain financial assistance from the State and \n     from other sources. Third, the State would have to make State \n     aid available to the LEA on at least as favorable a basis as \n     it does to other LEAs.\n       Section 8003(f)(3) would replace the highly complicated \n     provisions of current law relating to the computation of \n     payment amounts for heavily impacted LEAs, including its \n     multiple formulas, with a single formula that, for each \n     eligible LEA, would factor in per-pupil expenditures, the \n     number of its federally connected children, the amount \n     available to it from other sources for current expenditures, \n     and the amount of basic support payments it receives under \n     section 8003(b) and the amount of supplemental payments for \n     children with disabilities it receives under section 8003(d).\n       Section 8003(f)(4) would direct the Secretary, in \n     determining eligibility and payment amounts for heavily \n     impact LEAs, to use data from the second preceding fiscal \n     year, if those data are provided by the affected LEA (or the \n     SEA) within 60 days of being requested by the Secretary to do \n     so. If any of those data are not provided by that time, the \n     Secretary would use data from the most recent fiscal year for \n     which satisfactory data are available. This should provide \n     ample time for LEAs (and States, as may be necessary for \n     certain data) to provide that information so that the \n     Secretary can make payments to LEAs, for whom these funds \n     constitute a substantial portion of their budgets, on a \n     timely basis.\n       Section 803(g) of the bill would delete section 8003(g) of \n     the ESEA, which authorizes additional payments to LEAs with \n     high concentrations of children with severe disabilities. \n     (These payments are separate from the payments for children \n     with disabilities under section 8003(d), which the bill would \n     continue to authorize.) This complicated authority has never \n     been funded.\n       Section 803(h) would amend section 8003(h) of the ESEA to \n     prohibit an LEA from receiving a payment under section 8003 \n     on behalf of federally connected children if Federal funds \n     (other than Impact Aid funds) provide a substantial portion \n     of their educational program. This provision, which would \n     codify the Department's regulations (see 34 CFR \n     222.30(2)(ii)), recognizes that the responsibility for the \n     costs of a child's basic education rests with an LEA and \n     that, if the Federal Government is already paying a \n     substantial portion of those costs through some other \n     program, it should provide additional funds on behalf of that \n     child through the Impact Aid program.\n       Section 803(i) of the bill would delete the requirement, in \n     section 8003(i) of the ESEA, that LEAs maintain their fiscal \n     efforts for education from year to year as a condition of \n     receiving a payment under either section 8002 or section \n     8003. While appropriate in other Federal education programs \n     that are meant to provide funds for supplemental services, or \n     to benefit children with particular needs, a maintenance-of-\n     effort requirement is not appropriate for the Impact Aid \n     program, which is intended to help LEAs meet the local costs \n     of providing a free public education to federally connected \n     children.\n       Section 804, policies and procedures relating to children \n     residing on Indian lands [ESEA, Sec. 8004]. Section 804(1) of \n     the bill would change the heading of section 8004 of the ESEA \n     to ``Indian Community Participation'', to reflect amendments \n     the bill would make to this section.\n       Section 804(2) would retain the current requirements of \n     section 8004(a) of the ESEA under which an LEA that claim \n     children residing on Indian lands in its application for \n     Impact Aid funds must ensure that the parents of Indian \n     children and Indian tribes are afforded an opportunity to \n     present their views and make recommendations on the unique \n     educational needs of those children and how those children \n     may realize the benefits of the LEA's educational programs \n     and activities. Section 804(2) would also add language \n     providing that an LEA that receives an Indian Education \n     Program grant under Subpart 1 of Part A of Title IX shall \n     meet the requirements described in the previous sentence \n     through activities planned and carried out by the Indian \n     parent committee established under the Indian Education \n     program, and could choose to form such a committee for that \n     purpose if it is not participating in the Title IX program. \n     An LEA could meet its obligations under section 8004(a) by \n     complying with the parental involvement provisions of Title \n     I and must comply with those provisions for Indian \n     children who it serves under Title I. Finally, an LEA \n     could use any of its section 8003 funds (except for the \n     supplemental funds provided on behalf of children with \n     disabilities) for activities designed to increase tribal \n     and parental involvement in the education of Indian \n     children.\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\n       Section 804(3) would streamline the language in section \n     8004(b), relating to LEA retention of records to demonstrate \n     its compliance with section 8004(a), without changing the \n     substance of that provision.\n       Section 804(4) would delete subsection (c) of section 8004, \n     which automatically waives the substantive requirement of \n     subsection (a) and the record-keeping requirement of \n     subsection (b) with respect to the children of any Indian \n     tribe that provides the LEA a written statement that it is \n     satisfied with the educational services the LEA is providing \n     those children. The proposed amendments relating to community \n     involvement are sufficiently important that all affected LEAs \n     should comply with them and keep records to document their \n     compliance. Removing this waiver provision would also be \n     consistent with the prohibition on waiving any statutory or \n     regulatory requirements relating to parental participation \n     and involvement that applies to the Secretary's general \n     authority to issue waivers across the entire range of ESEA \n     programs. See Sec. 14401(c)(6) of the ESEA.\n       Section 805, applications for payments under sections 8002 \n     and 8003 [ESEA, Sec. 8005]. Section 805 of the bill would \n     amend section 8005 of the ESEA, relating to applications for \n     payments under sections 8002 and 8003, by: (1) conforming a \n     reference to the amended section 8004 in subsection (b)(2); \n     (2) deleting a reference in subsection (d)(2) to section \n     8003(e), to reflect the proposed repeal of that ``hold-\n     harmless'' provision; and (3) deleting subsection (d)(4), \n     which provides an unwarranted benefit to a single State.\n       Section 806, payments for sudden and substantial increases \n     in attendance of military dependents [ESEA, Sec. 8006]. \n     Section 806 of the bill would repeal section 8006 of the \n     ESEA, which authorizes payments to LEAs with sudden and \n     substantial increases in attendance of military dependents. \n     This authority has never been used and is not needed.\n       Section 807, construction [ESEA, Sec. 8007]. Section 807 of \n     the bill would amend, in its entirety, section 8007 of the \n     ESEA, which authorizes grants to certain categories of LEAs \n     to support the construction or renovation of schools. As \n     amended, section 8007(a) would authorize assistance only to \n     an LEA that receives a basic support payment under section \n     8003 and in which children residing on Indian lands make up \n     at least half of the average daily attendance (one of the \n     current eligible categories). This limitation on eligibility \n     would target limited construction funds on LEAs with \n     substantial school-construction needs and severely limited \n     ability to meet those needs.\n       Subsection (b) of section 8007 would require an interested \n     LEA to submit an application to the Secretary, including an \n     assessment of its school-construction needs.\n       Subsection (c) would provide that available funds would be \n     allocated to qualifying LEAs in proportion to their \n     respective numbers of children residing on Indian lands.\n       Subsection (d) would set the maximum Federal portion of the \n     cost of an assisted project at 50 percent, and give an LEA \n     three years after its proposal is approved to demonstrate \n     that it can provide its share of the project's cost.\n       Subsection (e) would clarify that an LEA could use a grant \n     under this section for the minimum initial equipment \n     necessary for the operation of the new or renovated school, \n     as well as for construction.\n       Section 808, facilities [ESEA, Sec. 8008]. Section 808 \n     would make a conforming amendment to section 8008 of the \n     ESEA, relating to certain school buildings that are owned by \n     the Department but used by LEAs to serve dependents of \n     military personnel, to reflect the revised authorization of \n     appropriations in section 8014.\n       Section 809, State consideration of payments in providing \n     State aid [ESEA, Sec. 8009]. Section 809 of the bill would \n     amend section 8009 of the ESEA, which generally prohibits a \n     State from taking an LEA's Impact Aid payments into account \n     in determining the LEA's eligibility for State aid (or the \n     amount of that aid) unless the Secretary certifies that the \n     State has in effect a school-finance-equalization plan that \n     meets certain criteria.\n       Section 809(2) would add, to section 8009(b)(1)'s statement \n     of preconditions for State consideration of Impact Aid \n     payments, a requirement that the average per-pupil \n     expenditure (APPE) in the State be at least 80 percent of the \n     APPE in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. This will \n     help ensure that LEAs in States with comparatively low \n     expenditures for education receive adequate funds before the \n     State reduces State aid on account of Impact Aid payments.\n       Section 809 would also make technical and conforming \n     amendments to section 8009.\n       Section 810, Federal administration [ESEA, Sec. 8010]. \n     Section 810 of the bill would repeal subsection (c) of \n     section 8010 of the ESEA. Subsection (c)(1) sets out a \n     special rule that does not apply after fiscal year 1995. \n     Subsections (c)(2) and (3) provide an unwarranted special \n     benefit to a single LEA.\n       Section 811, administrative hearings and judicial review \n     [ESEA, Sec. 8011]. Section 811 of the bill makes a technical \n     amendment to section 8011(a) to streamline that provision.\n       Section 812, Forgiveness of overpayments [ESEA, Sec. 8012]. \n     Section 812 of the bill makes a technical amendment to \n     section 8012 to streamline that provision.\n       Section 813, definitions (ESEA, Sec. 8013]. Section 813(1) \n     of the bill would conform the definition of ``current \n     expenditures'' in section 8013(4) of the ESEA to conform to \n     the proposed repeal of current Title VI and to a \n     corresponding amendment to a similar definition of the term \n     in current section 1410(11).\n       Section 813(2) would amend the definition of ``Federal \n     property''(an important basis of eligibility for Impact Aid \n     payments) in section 8013(5) to delete references to certain \n     property that would not normally be regraded as Federal \n     property; these references were enacted for the special \n     benefit of a small number of LEAs. This property does not \n     merit payment under the Impact Aid program.\n       Section 813(3) through (7) would make technical and \n     conforming amendments to other definitions in section 8013, \n     and delete the definitions of ``low-rent housing'' and \n     ``revenue derived from local sources'', which are \n     respectively, no longer needed and an unwarranted special-\n     interest provision.\n       Section 814, authorization of appropriations [ESEA, \n     Sec. 8014]. Section 814 of the bill would amend section 8014 \n     of the ESEA to authorize the appropriation of funds to carry \n     out the various Impact Aid authorities through fiscal year \n     2005. New subsection (b) of section 8014 would provide that \n     funds appropriated for school construction under section 8007 \n     and for facilities maintenance under section 8008 would be \n     available to the Secretary until expended. However, if \n     appropriations acts, which normally contain provisions \n     governing the applicability of the funds they appropriate, \n     provide a different rule than the one in proposed section \n     8014(b), the appropriations acts would govern.\n\n\n     TITLE IX--INDIAN, NATIVE HAWAIIAN, AND ALASKA NATIVE EDUCATION\n\n     Part A--Indian Education\n       Part A of Title IX of the bill would make various \n     amendments to Part A of Title IX of the ESEA, which \n     authorizes a program of formula grants to LEAs, as well as \n     certain demonstration programs and related activities, to \n     increase educational achievement of American Indian and \n     Alaska Native students.\n       Section 901, findings and purpose [ESEA, Sec. 9101 and \n     9102]. Section 901 of the bill would amend the statements of \n     findings and purpose in sections 9101 and 9102 of the ESEA by \n     changing references to the ``special educational and \n     culturally related academic needs'' of American Indian and \n     Alaska Native students to refer instead to their ``unique \n     educational and culturally related academic needs.''\n       Section 902, grants to local educational agencies [ESEA, \n     Sec. 9112]. Section 902 of the bill would amend section 9112 \n     of the ESEA, which authorizes formula grants to certain LEAs \n     educating Indian children. Current section 9112(b) provides \n     that when an eligible LEA does not establish the Indian \n     parent committee required by the statute, an Indian tribe \n     that represents at least half of the LEA's Indian students \n     may apply for the LEA's grant and is to be treated by the \n     Secretary as if it were an LEA. The amendment would codify \n     the Department's interpretation that, in that situation, the \n     tribe is not subject to the statutory requirements relating \n     to the parent committee, maintenance of effort, or submission \n     of its grant application to the State educational agency for \n     review. These requirements would be inappropriate to apply to \n     an Indian tribe, as they are, under section 9113(d), for \n     schools operated or supported by the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     (BIA).\n       Section 903, amount of grants [ESEA, Sec. 9113]. Section \n     903(1) of the bill would make a technical amendment to \n     section 9113(b)(2) of the ESEA, which allows consortia of \n     eligible LEAs to apply for grants.\n       Section 903(2) would revise section 9113(d), relating to \n     grants to schools operated or supported by the BIA, to \n     clarify that those schools must submit an application to the \n     Secretary and that they are generally to be treated as LEAs \n     for the purpose of the formula grant program, except that \n     they are not subject to the statutory requirements relating \n     to parent committees, maintenance of effort, or submission of \n     grant applications to the SEA for review. These requirements \n     would be inappropriate to apply to these schools, as they \n     would be for Indian tribes that receive grants (in place \n     of an eligible LEA) under section 9112(b).\n       Section 904, applications [ESEA, Sec. 9114]. Section 904(1) \n     of the bill would amend section 9114(b)(2)(A) of the ESEA, \n     relating to the consistency of an LEA's comprehensive program \n     to meet the needs of its Indian children with certain other \n     plans, to remove a reference to the Goals 2000: Educate \n     America Act (which would be consolidated into the new Title \n     II of the ESEA) and to require that the LEA's plan be \n     consistent with State and local plans under other provisions \n     of the ESEA, not just plans under Title I.\n       Section 904(2) would amend section 9114(c) of the ESEA to \n     require that the local assessment of the educational needs of \n     its Indian students be comprehensive. This should help ensure \n     that these assessments provide useful guidance to LEAs and \n     parent committees in planning and carrying out projects.\n       Section 904(3)(A) would amend ambiguous language in section \n     9114(c)(4)(B) of the ESEA to clarify that a majority of each \n     participating LEA's parent committee must be parents of \n     Indian children.\n       Section 904(3)(B) would modify the standard for an LEA's \n     use of funds under this program to support a schoolwide \n     program under Title I of the ESEA, as is permitted by section \n     9115(c). Under the amendment, the parent committee would have \n     to determine that using program funds in that manner would \n     enhance, rather than simply not diminish, the availability of \n     culturally related activities for American Indian and Alaskan \n     Native students.\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\n       Section 905, authorized services and activities [ESEA, \n     Sec. 9115]. Section 905(1) of the bill would make a \n     conforming amendment to section 9115(b)(5) of the ESEA to \n     reflect the renaming of the Perkins Act by P.L. 105-332.\n       Section 905(4) would add four activities to the examples of \n     authorized activities in section 9115(b). These additions \n     would encourage LEAs to address the needs of American Indian \n     and Alaskan Native students in the areas of curriculum \n     development, creating and implementing standards, improving \n     student achievement, and gifted and talented education.\n       Section 906, student eligibility forms [ESEA, Sec. 9116]. \n     Section 906(1) of the bill would make technical amendments to \n     section 9116(f) of the ESEA.\n       Section 906(2) would amend section 9116(g) to permit tribal \n     schools operating under grants or contracts from the BIA to \n     use either their child counts that are certified by the BIA \n     for purposes of receiving funds from the Bureau or to use a \n     count of children for whom the school has eligibility forms \n     (commonly referred to as ``506 forms'') that meet the \n     requirements of section 9116. This choice would allow these \n     schools to avoid the burden of two separate child counts.\n       Section 906(3) of the bill would add a new subsection (h) \n     to section 9116 of the ESEA to allow each LEA to select \n     either a particular date or period (up to 31 days) to count \n     the number of children it will claim for purposes of \n     receiving a grant.\n       Section 907, payments [ESEA, Sec. 9117]. Section 907 of the \n     bill would delete obsolete language from section 9117 of the \n     ESEA, relating to payment of grants to LEAs.\n       Section 908, State educational agency review [ESEA, \n     Sec. 9118]. Section 908 of the bill would rewrite section \n     9118 of the ESEA, relating to the submission of applications \n     to the Secretary and the review of those applications by \n     SEAs, in its entirety. As revised, section 9118 would not \n     contain current subsection (a), which requires LEAs to submit \n     applications to the Secretary, since that duplicates the \n     requirement in section 9114(a) of the ESEA, where it \n     logically belongs. The revised section would also improve the \n     clarity of the requirement that an LEA submit its application \n     to the SEA for its possible review.\n       Section 909, improvement of educational opportunities for \n     Indian children [ESEA, Sec. 9121]. Section 909 of the bill \n     would amend section 9121 of the ESEA, which authorizes \n     support for a variety of projects, selected on a competitive \n     basis, to develop, test, and demonstrate the effectiveness of \n     services and programs to improve educational opportunities \n     for Indian children. In particular, the bill would amend \n     section 9121(d)(2), relating to project applications, to: (1) \n     clarify that certain application requirements do not apply in \n     the case of applicants for dissemination grants under \n     subsection (d)(1)(D); and (2) require applications for \n     planning, pilot, and demonstration projects to include \n     information demonstrating that the program is either a \n     research-based program or that it is a research-based program \n     that has been modified to be culturally appropriate for the \n     students who will be served, as well as a description of how \n     the applicant will incorporate the proposed services into the \n     ongoing school program once the grant period is over.\n       Section 910, professional development [ESEA, Sec. 9122]. \n     Section 910 of the bill would amend section 9122 of the ESEA, \n     which authorizes training of Indian individuals in profession \n     in which they can serve Indian peoples. Section 910(1) of the \n     bill would repeal section; 9122(e)(2) of the Act, which \n     affords a performance to projects that train Indian \n     individuals. This provision, which was carried over from a \n     related program authorized before the 1994 amendments, has no \n     practical effect, since the only projects that have been \n     eligible since 1994 are those that train Indians.\n       Section 910(2) would amend section 9122(h)(1), which \n     requires individuals who receive training under section 9122 \n     to perform related work that benefits Indian people or repay \n     the assistance they received, so that it would continue to \n     apply to preservice training, but would not apply to in-\n     service training. Individuals receiving in-service training \n     are already serving Indian people, and that training is \n     relatively inexpensive to the taxpayers, is generally of \n     short duration, and frequently does not involve an \n     established per-person cost of participating, such as the \n     substantial tuition and fees that are charged by colleges for \n     preservice degree courses and programs.\n       Section 910(3) of the bill would add to section 9122 a new \n     authority for grants to consortia to provide in-service \n     training to teachers in LEAs with substantial numbers of \n     Indian children in their schools, so that these teachers can \n     better meet the needs of Indian children in their classrooms. \n     An eligible consortium would consist of a tribal college and \n     an institution of higher education that awards a degree in \n     education, or either or both of those entities along with one \n     or more tribal schools, tribal educational agencies, or LEAs \n     serving Indian children. This new authority will help ensure \n     that classroom teachers are aware of, and responsive to, the \n     unique needs of the Indian children they teach.\n       Section 911, repeal of authorities [ESEA, Sec. Sec. 9123, \n     9124, 9125, and 9131]. Section 911 of the bill would repeal \n     various sections of Part A of Title IX of the ESEA that have \n     not been recently funded and for which the Administration is \n     not requesting funds for fiscal year 2000. The goals of these \n     provisions (fellowships for Indian students, gifted and \n     talented education, tribal administrative planning and \n     development, and adult education) are more effectively \n     addressed through other programs. Because Subpart 3 of Part A \n     would be repealed, section 911 would also redesignate the \n     remaining subparts.\n       Section 912, Federal administration [ESEA, Sec. Sec. 9152 \n     and 9153]. Section 912 of the bill would make technical \n     amendments to sections 9152 and 9153 of the ESEA, to reflect \n     the proposed repeal of Subpart 3 and the redesignation of the \n     remaining subparts.\n       Section 913, authorization of appropriations [ESEA, \n     Sec. 9162]. Section 913 of the bill would amend section 9162 \n     of the ESEA to authorize appropriations for the Indian \n     education program under Part A of Title IX of the ESEA \n     through fiscal year 2005.\n     Part B--Native Hawaiian Education Act\n       Sec. 921, Native Hawaiian Education. Section 901 of the \n     bill would amend Part B of title IX of the ESEA in order to \n     replace a series of categorical programs serving Native \n     Hawaiian children and adults with a single, more flexible \n     authority to accomplish those purposes. In addition to \n     technical and conforming changes, section 901 of the bill \n     would repeal sections 9204 through 9210 of the ESEA. In place \n     of the repealed sections, section 901 of the bill would \n     insert a new section 9204 of the ESEA that would permit all \n     of the types of activities currently carried out under the \n     program to continue. However, it would give the Department \n     more flexibility in operating the program in a manner that \n     meets the educational needs of Native Hawaiian children and \n     adults.\n       Proposed new section 9204 (``Program Authorized'') of the \n     ESEA would authorize the new Native Hawaiian Education \n     program. Proposed new section 9204(a) would authorize the \n     Secretary to award grants or enter into contracts with, \n     Native Hawaiian educational organizations, Native Hawaiian \n     community-based organizations, public and private non-profit \n     organizations, agencies, or institutions that have experience \n     in developing Native Hawaiian programs of instruction in the \n     Native Hawaiian language, and consortia of these \n     organizations, agencies, or institutions to carry out Native \n     Hawaiian Education programs.\n       Permissible Native Hawaiian Education programs under Part B \n     of Title IX of the ESEA would include: (1) the operation of \n     one or more councils to coordinate the provisions of \n     education and related services and programs available to \n     Native Hawaiians; (2) the operation of family-based education \n     centers; (3) activities to enable Native Hawaiians to enter \n     and complete programs of postsecondary education; (4) \n     activities that address the special needs of gifted and \n     talented Native Hawaiian students; (5) activities to meet the \n     special needs of Native Hawaiian students with disabilities; \n     (6) the development of academic and vocational curricula to \n     address the needs of Native Hawaiian children and adults, \n     including curriculum materials in the Hawaiian language and \n     mathematics and science curricula that incorporate Native \n     Hawaiian tradition and culture; (7) the operation of \n     community-based learning centers that address the needs of \n     Native Hawaiian families and communities through the \n     coordination of public and private programs and services; and \n     (8) other activities, consistent with the purposes of this \n     part, to meet the educational needs of Native Hawaiian \n     children and adults.\n       Proposed new section 9204(b) of the ESEA would authorize \n     the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for each \n     of the fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to carry out Part B of \n     Title IX of the ESEA.\n     Part C--Alaska Native Education\n       Sec. 931, Alaska Native Education. Section 902 of the bill \n     would amend Part C of title IX of the ESEA in order to \n     replace a series of categorical programs serving Alaska \n     Natives with a single, more flexible authorization to \n     accomplish those purposes. In addition to technical and \n     conforming changes, section 902 of the bill would repeal \n     sections 9304 through 9306 of the ESEA. In place of the \n     repealed sections, section 902 of the bill would insert a new \n     section 9304 of the ESEA that would permit all of the types \n     of activities currently carried out under the program to \n     continue. However, it would give the Department more \n     flexibility in operating the program in a manner that meets \n     the educational needs of Alaska Native children and adults.\n       Proposed new section 9304 (``Program Authorized'') of the \n     ESEA would authorize the new Alaska Native Education program. \n     Proposed new section 9304(a) would authorize the Secretary to \n     make grants to, or enter into contracts with, Alaska Native \n     organizations, educational entities with experience in \n     developing or operating Alaska Native programs or programs of \n     instruction conducted in Alaska Native languages, and to \n     consortia of these organizations and entities to carry out \n     programs that meet the purposes of this part.\n       The activities that would be carried out under this section \n     include: (1) the development and implementation of plans, \n     methods, and strategies to improve the education of Alaska \n     Natives; (2) development of curricula and educational \n     programs to address the educational needs of Alaska Native \n     students; (3) professional development activities for \n     educators; (4) the development and operation of home \n     instruction programs for Alaska Native preschool children; \n     (5) the development and operation of student enrichment \n     programs in science and mathematics; (6) research and data-\n     collection activities to determine the educational status and \n     needs of\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\n     Alaska Native children and adults; and (7) other activities, \n     consistent with the purposes of this part, to meet the \n     educational needs of Alaska Native children and adults.\n       Proposed new section 9304(b) of the ESEA would authorize \n     the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for each \n     of the fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to carry out Part C of \n     Title IX of the ESEA.\n\n\n               title x--programs of national significance\n\n       Section 1001. Fund for the Improvement of Education. \n     Section 1001 of the bill would amend Part A of Title X of the \n     ESEA, which authorizes funds to support nationally \n     significant programs and projects to improve the quality of \n     elementary and secondary education, to assist students to \n     meet challenging State content standards and challenging \n     State performance standards, and to contribute to the \n     achievement of America's Education Goals.\n       Section 1001(1)(A) of the bill would amend section 10101(a) \n     of the ESEA to emphasize that the Fund for the Improvement of \n     Education (FIE) is a program focused on improving elementary \n     and secondary education.\n       Section 1001(1)(B) of the bill would amend section 10101(b) \n     of the ESEA to strengthen the program by focusing the \n     authorized use of funds more narrowly. Authorized activities \n     would include: (1) development, evaluation, and other \n     activities designed to improve the quality of elementary and \n     secondary education; (2) the development, implementation, and \n     evaluation of programs designed to foster student community \n     service, encourage responsible citizenship; and improve \n     academic learning; (3) the identification and recognition of \n     exemplary schools and programs, such as Blue Ribbon Schools; \n     (4) activities to study and implement strategies for creating \n     smaller learning communities; (5) programs under section \n     10102 and section 10103; (6) activities to promote family \n     involvement in education; and (7) other programs that meet \n     the purposes of this section.\n       Section 1001(1)(C) of the bill would amend section 10101(c) \n     of the ESEA to require an applicant for an award to establish \n     clear goals and objectives for its project and describe the \n     activities it will carry out in order to meet these goals and \n     objectives. It would also require recipients of funds to \n     report to the Secretary such information as may be required, \n     including evidence of its progress towards meeting the goals \n     and objectives of its project, in order to determine the \n     project's effectiveness. This change would emphasize the \n     Department's desire to ensure that the effectiveness of all \n     funded projects can be fully assessed. This language is also \n     aligned with the performance indicators in the FIE plan under \n     GPRA.\n       This section of the bill would also allow the Secretary to \n     require recipients of awards under this part to provide \n     matching funds from sources other than Federal funds, and to \n     limit competitions to particular types of entities, such as \n     State or local educational agencies.\n       Section 1001(1)(D) of the bill would amend section 10101(d) \n     of the ESEA to authorize such sums as may be necessary to \n     carry out this part through fiscal year 2005.\n       Section 1001(1)(E) of the bill would redesignate section \n     10101(d) of the ESEA as section 10101(e) and add a new \n     requirement that each recipient of a grant under this section \n     to submit a comprehensive evaluation on the effectiveness of \n     its program in achieving its goals and objectives, including \n     the impact of the program on students, teachers, \n     administrators, and parents, to the Secretary, by the mid-\n     point of the program, and no later than one year after \n     completion of the program.\n       Section 1001(2) of the bill would repeal section 10102 of \n     the ESEA.\n       Section 1001(3) of the bill would make substantial changes \n     to section 10103 of the ESEA, relating to Character \n     Education. It would provide for more funding flexibility by \n     removing the limit of 10 character education grants per year \n     and maximum award of $1 million to SEAs, and instead \n     authorize the Secretary to make up to 5-year grants to SEAs, \n     LEAs, or consortia of educational agencies for the design and \n     implementation of character education programs. These \n     programs would be required to be linked to the applicant's \n     overall reform efforts, performance standards, and activities \n     to improve school climate. Allowing LEAs and consortia of \n     educational agencies to apply would increase flexibility to \n     fund innovative programs in school districts where the State \n     is not interested in making an application.\n       Section 1001(3) of the bill would also streamline the \n     application requirements under current law. The application \n     would include: (1) a description of any partnership and other \n     collaborative effort between the applicant and other \n     educational agencies; (2) a description of the program's \n     goals and objectives; (3) a description of activities to be \n     carried out by the applicant; (4) a description of how the \n     programs will be linked to broader educational reforms being \n     instituted by the applicant and applicable State and local \n     standards for student performance; (5) a description of how \n     the applicant will evaluate its progress in meeting its goals \n     and objectives; and (6) such other information as the \n     Secretary may require.\n       Finally, section 1001(3) of the bill would require the \n     Secretary to make awards that serve different areas of the \n     Nation, including urban, suburban, and rural areas.\n       Section 1001(4) of the bill would redesignate section 10103 \n     of the ESEA, as amended by section 1001(3), as section 10102, \n     and add a proposed new section 10103 of the ESEA. \n     Specifically, proposed new section 10103 (``State and Local \n     Character Education Program'') of the ESEA would authorize a \n     new program, under which the Secretary could make awards to \n     SEAs, LEAs, institutions of higher education (IHEs), tribal \n     organizations, and other public or private agencies to carry \n     out research, development, dissemination, technical \n     assistance, and evaluation activities that support character \n     education programs under new section 10102 of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 10103(b) of the ESEA would authorize \n     funds under this section to be used to: (1) conduct research \n     and development activities; (2) provide technical assistance \n     to the agencies receiving awards under the program, \n     particularly on matters of program evaluation; (3) conduct a \n     national evaluation of the character education program; and \n     (4) compile and disseminate information on model character \n     education programs, character education materials and \n     curricula, research findings in the area of character \n     education, and any other information that would be useful to \n     character education program participants, and to other \n     educators and administrators, nationwide.\n       Section 1001(5) of the bill would repeal sections 10104, \n     10105, 10106, and 10107 of the ESEA.\n       Section 1002. Gifted and Talented Children. Section 1002 of \n     the bill would reauthorize and make minor improvements to \n     Part B of Title X of the ESEA, which provides financial \n     assistance to State and local educational agencies, \n     institutions of higher education, and other public and \n     private agencies to build a nationwide capability in \n     elementary and secondary schools to meet the special \n     educational needs of gifted and talented students.\n       Section 1002(1) would make a technical change to the \n     program's short title.\n       Section 1002(2) of the bill would amend section 10204(c) of \n     the ESEA to require the National Center for Research and \n     Development in the Education of Gifted and Talented Children \n     to focus the dissemination of the results of its activities \n     to schools with high percentages of economically \n     disadvantaged students. This modification would help to \n     overcome the Center's current lack of targeting on low-income \n     schools and school districts.\n       Section 1002(3) of the bill would amend section 10206(b) of \n     the ESEA to require the Secretary to use a peer-review \n     process in reviewing applications under this part, and ensure \n     that the information on the activities and results of \n     programs and projects funded under this part is disseminated \n     to appropriate State and local agencies and other appropriate \n     organizations.\n       Section 1002(4) of the bill would amend section 10207 of \n     the ESEA to authorize such sums as may be necessary to carry \n     out the Gifted and Talented Children program through fiscal \n     year 2005.\n       Section 1003. International Education Exchange. Section \n     1003 of the bill would: (1) move the International Education \n     Exchange program from Title VI of the Goals 2000: Educate \n     America Act (P.L. 103-227) to Part C of Title X of the ESEA; \n     (2) authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this program through fiscal year 2005; \n     and (3) add the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, and \n     any other emerging democracy in a developing country to the \n     definition of ``eligible country.''\n       Section 1004. Arts in Education. Section 1004 of the bill \n     would reauthorize and streamline Part D of Title X of the \n     ESEA, which provides financial assistance to support \n     education reform by strengthening arts education as in \n     integral part of the elementary and secondary school \n     curriculum.\n       Section 1004(1) of the bill would strike out the heading \n     and designation of Subpart 1 of Part D of Title X of the \n     ESEA.\n       Section 1004(2)(A) of the bill would amend section 10401(d) \n     of the ESEA by adding a new authorized activity, model arts \n     and cultural programs in the arts for at-risk children and \n     youth, particularly programs that use arts and culture to \n     promote students' academic progress, to the list of \n     authorized activities of the Arts in Education program.\n       Section 1004(2)(B) of the bill would amend section 10401(f) \n     of the ESEA to authorize the appropriation of such sums as \n     may be necessary to carry out this part through fiscal year \n     2005.\n       Section 1004(3) of the bill would repeal Subpart 2 of Part \n     D of Title X of the ESEA. This subpart has never been funded, \n     and the addition of the authorized activity in section \n     10401(d) of the ESEA, noted above, would provide a more \n     flexible authorization for projects serving at-risk children \n     and youth.\n       Section 1005. Inexpensive Book Distribution Program. \n     Section 1005 of the bill would reauthorize without change \n     Part E of Title X of the ESEA through fiscal year 2005. This \n     program supports Reading is Fundamental, under which \n     inexpensive books are distributed to students to motivate \n     them to read.\n       Section 1006. Civic Education. Section 1006 of the bill \n     would reauthorize and streamline Part F of Title X of the \n     ESEA, which authorizes a program to educate students about \n     the history and principles of the Constitution of the United \n     States, including the Bill of Rights, and to foster civic \n     competence and responsibility.\n       Section 1006 of the bill would repeal the unfunded \n     instruction in Civics, Government, and the Law program under \n     section 10602 of the ESEA, authorize the appropriation of \n     such sums as may be necessary to carry out this part through \n     fiscal year 2005, and make conforming changes.\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\n       Section 1007. Allen J. Ellender Program. Section 1007 of \n     the bill would repeal Part G of Title X of the ESEA.\n       Section 1008. 21st Century Community Learning Centers. \n     Section 1008 of the bill would reauthorize and improve Part I \n     of Title X of the ESEA, which authorizes grants to rural and \n     inner-city public schools to plan, implement, or expand \n     projects that benefit the educational, health, social \n     service, cultural, and recreational needs of a rural or \n     inner-city community.\n       Section 1008(1) of the bill would amend section 10902 of \n     the ESEA to update the findings.\n       Section 1008(2)(A) of the bill would amend section 10903(a) \n     of the ESEA by adding language to current law to clarify that \n     the Secretary may award grants to LEAs and community based \n     organizations (CBOs) (with up to 10% of the funds \n     appropriated to carry out this part for any fiscal year) on \n     behalf of public elementary or secondary schools in inner-\n     cities, rural areas, and small cities. In both cases, awards \n     would be limited to schools or CBOs that serve communities \n     with a substantial need for expanded learning opportunities \n     due to: their high proportion of low-achieving students; lack \n     of resources to establish or expand community learning \n     centers; or other needs consistent with the purposes of this \n     part.\n       Section 1008(2)(B) of the bill would retain the current \n     requirement in section 10903(b) for equitable distribution \n     among the States and urban and rural areas of the United \n     States, but would delete the provision requiring equitable \n     distribution among urban and rural areas of a State.\n       Section 1008(2)(C) of the bill would amend section 10903(c) \n     of the ESEA to change the duration of grants awarded under \n     this part from 3-years to 5-years.\n       Section 1008(3)(A) of the bill would amend section 10904 of \n     the ESEA to change the eligible applicant for a grant under \n     this part from a school to an LEA (which would apply on \n     behalf of one or more schools) or a community-based \n     organization. This provision of the bill would also add a new \n     requirement that the applicant provide information that it \n     will provide at least 50 percent of the cost of the project \n     from other sources, which may include other Federal funds and \n     may be provided in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated. The \n     applicant would also be required to provide an assurance that \n     in each year of the project, it will expend, from non-Federal \n     sources, at least as much for the services under this part as \n     it expended for the preceding year and information \n     demonstrating how the applicant will continue the project \n     after completion of the grant.\n       Paragraph (3)(B) of section 1008 of the bill would amend \n     section 10904(b) of ESEA to require the Secretary to give \n     priority, in all competitions, to applications that offer a \n     broad selection of services that address the needs of the \n     community, and applications that offer significant expanded \n     learning opportunities for children and youth in the \n     community. This provision of the bill would also add a new \n     requirement to section 10904 of the ESEA that an application \n     submitted by a CBO must obtain evidence that affected LEAs \n     concur with the project.\n       Section 1008(4) of the bill would amend section 10905 of \n     the ESEA to require that applicants provide expanded learning \n     opportunities and eliminate the requirement that applicants \n     include at least four of the activities listed in this \n     section. Instead, applicants must provide educational \n     activities and may provide a range of other services to the \n     community.\n       Section 1008(5) of the bill would amend section 10906 of \n     the ESEA to clarify the definition of ``community learning \n     center'' as an entity that provides expanded learning \n     opportunities, and may also provide services that address \n     health, social service, cultural, and recreational needs of \n     the community. It would also add a special rule to require a \n     community learning center operated by a local educational \n     agency (but not a CBO) to be located within a public \n     elementary or secondary school building.\n       Section 1008 (6) of the bill would amend section 10907 of \n     the ESEA to authorize the appropriation of such sums as may \n     be necessary to carry out this part through fiscal year 2005.\n       Section 1008(7) of the bill would add a proposed new \n     section 10908 (``Continuation Awards'') to the ESEA \n     that would allow the Secretary to use funds appropriated \n     under this part to make continuation awards for projects \n     that were funded with fiscal year 1999 and 2000 funds, \n     under the terms and conditions that applied to the \n     original awards. This provision would have the effect of \n     allowing the Department to provide continuous funding for \n     the last year of 3-year grants made in fiscal year 1998 \n     under the provisions of current law.\n       Section 1008(8) of the bill would redesignate Part I of \n     Title X of the ESEA as Part G of that title and make \n     conforming changes.\n       Section 1009. Urban and Rural Education Assistance. Section \n     1009 of the bill would repeal Part J of Title X of the ESEA.\n       Section 1010. High School Reform. Section 1010 of the bill \n     would add a new Part H, High School Reform, to Title X of the \n     ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 10801 (``Purposes'') of the ESEA would \n     state the congressional findings that support this new \n     program. Subsection (b) would provide that the purposes of \n     Part H are to: (1) support the planning and implementation of \n     educational reforms in high schools, particularly in urban \n     and rural high schools that educate concentrations of \n     students from low-income families; (2) support the further \n     development of educational reforms, designed specifically for \n     high schools, that help students meet challenging State \n     standards, and that increase connections between students and \n     adults and provide safe learning environments; (3) create \n     positive incentives for serious change in high schools, by \n     offering rewards to participating schools that achieve \n     significant improvements in student achievement; (4) increase \n     the national knowledge base on effective high school reforms \n     by identifying the most effective approaches and \n     disseminating information on those approaches so that they \n     can be adopted nationally; and (5) support the implementation \n     of reforms in at least 5,000 American high schools by the \n     year 2007.\n       Proposed new section 10802 (``Grants to Local Education \n     Agencies'') of the ESEA would authorize the Secretary to make \n     competitive grants to LEAs to carry out the program's \n     purposes in their high schools. Subsection (b) would \n     establish a maximum grant period of three years for each \n     grant. Subsection (c) would provide that a particular high \n     school could not be assisted by more than one grant. An LEA \n     could thus serve one or more of its high schools with one \n     grant and one or more different high schools with a \n     subsequent grant.\n       Proposed new section 10803 (``Applications'') of the ESEA \n     would require an LEA that desires a grant to submit an \n     application and describe the information that must be \n     included.\n       Proposed new section 10804 (``Selection of Grantees'') of \n     the ESEA would establish the procedures and criteria the \n     Secretary would use in selecting grantees.\n       Proposed new section 10805 (``Principles and Components of \n     Educational Reforms'') of the ESEA would describe the \n     outcomes that participating high schools are expected to \n     achieve, and would identify the components of the educational \n     reforms that would have to be carried out in those schools in \n     order to attain those outcomes.\n       Proposed new section 10806 (``Private Schools'') of the \n     ESEA would provide for the equitable participation of \n     personnel from private schools in any professional \n     development carried out with Part H funds. A grantee that \n     uses Part H funds to develop curricular materials would also \n     be required to make information about those materials \n     available to private schools at their request.\n       Proposed new section 10807 (``Additional Activities'') of \n     the ESEA would direct the Secretary to reserve funds from \n     each year's appropriation for Part H to carry out certain \n     activities relating to the program's purpose, including \n     testing the effect of offering financial rewards to teachers \n     and administrators in high schools if their students \n     demonstrate significant gains in educational outcomes.\n       Proposed new section 10808 (``Definition'') of the ESEA \n     would define the term ``high school'' as used in part H.\n       Finally, proposed new section 10809 (``Authorization of \n     Appropriations'') of the ESEA would authorize the \n     appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal \n     years 2001 through 2005 to carry out Part H.\n       Section 1011. Elementary School Foreign Language Assistance \n     Program. Section 1011 of the bill would revise and move the \n     ``Foreign Language Assistance Program'', currently in Part B \n     of Title VII of the ESEA, to Title X of the ESEA, as new Part \n     I. Proposed new Part I would seek to expand, improve the \n     quality of, and enhance foreign language programs at the \n     elementary school level by supporting State efforts to \n     encourage and support such programs, local implementation of \n     innovative programs that meet local needs, and identification \n     and dissemination of information on best practices in \n     elementary school foreign language education.\n       Proposed new section 10901 of the ESEA (``Findings; \n     Purpose'') would set forth the findings and purpose of the \n     part.\n       Proposed new section 10902 of the ESEA (``Elementary School \n     Foreign Language Assistance Program'') would authorize the \n     Elementary School Foreign Language Assistance Program. \n     Proposed new section 10902(a) of the ESEA would authorized \n     the Secretary, from funds appropriated under subsection (g) \n     for any fiscal year, to make grants to SEAs and to LEAs for \n     the Federal share of the cost of the activities set forth in \n     subsection (b). Each grant under paragraph (1) would be \n     awarded for a period of three years.\n       Under proposed new section 10902(a)(3), an SEA could \n     receive a grant under the section if it: (1) has established, \n     or is establishing, State standards for foreign language \n     instruction; or (2) requires the public elementary schools of \n     the State to provide foreign language instruction.\n       Under proposed new section 10902(a)(4), an LEA could \n     receive a grant under the section if the program in its \n     application: (1) shows promise of being continued beyond the \n     grant period; (2) would demonstrate approaches that can be \n     disseminated to, and duplicated by, other LEAs; (3) would \n     include performance measurements and assessment systems that \n     measure students' proficiency in a foreign language; and (4) \n     would use curriculum that is aligned with State standards, if \n     the State has such standards.\n       Proposed new section 10902(b)(1) would require that grants \n     to SEAs under this section be used to support programs that \n     promote the implementation of high-quality foreign language \n     programs in the elementary schools of the State, which may \n     include: (1) developing foreign language standards and \n     assessments that are aligned with those standards; (2) \n     supporting the efforts to institutions of higher education \n     within the State\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\n     to develop programs to prepare the elementary school foreign \n     language teachers needed in schools within the State and to \n     recruit candidates to prepare for, and assume, such teaching \n     positions; (3) developing new certification requirements for \n     elementary school foreign language teachers, including \n     requirements that allow for alternative routes to \n     certification; (4) providing technical assistance to LEAs in \n     the State in developing, implementing, or improving \n     elementary school foreign language programs, including \n     assistance to ensure effective coordination with, and \n     transition for students between, elementary, middle, and \n     secondary schools; (5) disseminating information on promising \n     or effective practices in elementary school foreign language \n     instruction, and supporting educator networks that help \n     improve that instruction; (6) stimulating the development and \n     dissemination of information on instructional programs that \n     use educational technologies and technology applications \n     (including such technologies and applications as multimedia \n     software, web-based resources, digital television, and \n     virtual reality and wireless technologies) to deliver \n     instruction or professional development, or to assess \n     students' foreign language proficiency; and (7) collecting \n     data on and evaluating the elementary school foreign language \n     programs in the State and the activities carried out with the \n     grant.\n       Proposed new section 10902(b)(2) would require that grants \n     to LEAs under this section be used for activities to develop \n     and implement high-quality, standards-based elementary school \n     foreign language programs, which may include: (1) curriculum \n     development and implementation; (2) professional development \n     for teachers and other staff; (3) partnerships with \n     institutions of higher education to provide for the \n     preparation of the teachers needed to implement programs \n     under this section; (4) efforts to coordinate elementary \n     school foreign language instruction with secondary-level \n     foreign language instruction, and to provide students with a \n     smooth transition from elementary to secondary programs; (5) \n     implementation of instructional approaches that make use of \n     advanced educational technologies; and (6) collection of data \n     on, and evaluation of, the activities carried out under the \n     grant, including assessment, at regular intervals, of \n     participating students' proficiency in the foreign \n     language studied. Proposed new section 10902(b)(3) would \n     allow efforts under the fourth LEA activity described \n     above to include support for the expansion of secondary \n     school instruction, so long as that instruction is part of \n     an articulated elementary-through-secondary school foreign \n     language program that is designed to result in student \n     fluency in a foreign language.\n       Proposed new section 10902(c)(1) would require any SEA or \n     LEA desiring to receive an grant under this section to submit \n     an application to the Secretary at such time, in such form, \n     and containing such information and assurances, as the \n     Secretary may require. Each application would be required to \n     include a description of: (1) the goals that the applicant \n     will attempt to accomplish through the project; (2) the \n     activities to be carried out through the project; and (3) how \n     the applicant will determine the extent to which the project \n     meets its goals.\n       Proposed new section 10902(d) would authorize the \n     secretary, in awarding grants under this section, to \n     establish one or more priorities consistent with the purpose \n     of this part, including priorities of projects carried out by \n     LEAs that include immersion programs in which instruction is \n     in the foreign language for a major portion of the day or \n     that promote the sequential study of a foreign language for \n     students, beginning in elementary schools.\n       Proposed new section 10902(e) would require an SEA or LEA \n     that receives a grant under this section to submit to the \n     Secretary an annual report that provides information on the \n     project's progress in reaching its goals. An LEA that \n     receives a grant under this section would be required to \n     include in its report information on students' gains in \n     comprehending, speaking, reading and writing a foreign \n     language, and compare such educational outcomes to the \n     State's foreign language standards, if such State standards \n     exist.\n       Proposed new section 10902(f) would require that the \n     Federal share of a program under this section for each fiscal \n     year be not more than 50 percent. The Secretary would be \n     authorized to waive the requirement of cost sharing for any \n     LEA that the Secretary determines does not have adequate \n     resources to pay the non-Federal share of the cost of the \n     activities assisted under this section.\n       Proposed new section 10902(g)(1) would authorize \n     appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal \n     year 2001 and for each of the four succeeding fiscal years \n     for the purpose of carrying out this section. Proposed new \n     section 10902(g)(2) would, for any fiscal year, authorize the \n     Secretary to reserve up to five percent of the amount \n     appropriated to: (1) conduct independent evaluations of the \n     activities assisted under this section; (2) provide technical \n     assistance to recipients of awards under this section; and \n     (3) disseminate findings and methodologies from evaluations \n     required by, or funded under, this section and other \n     information obtained from such programs.\n       Section 1012. National Writing Project. Section 1012 of the \n     bill would reauthorize and improve Part K of Title X of the \n     ESEA, which authorizes a grant to the National Writing \n     Project for the improvement of the quality of student writing \n     and learning, and the teaching of writing as a learning \n     process.\n       Section 1012 of the bill would: (1) amend section 10991 of \n     the ESEA to update the findings; (2) amend section 10992 of \n     the ESEA to authorize the Secretary to conduct an independent \n     evaluation of the National Writing Project program; (3) \n     authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary \n     to carry out his program through fiscal year 2005; and (4) \n     make conforming changes.\n\n\n     Title XI--General Provisions, Definitions, and Accountability\n\n       Title XI of the bill would amend Title XIV of the ESEA \n     containing general provisions relating to that Act.\n       Section 1101. Definitions. Section 1101 of the bill would \n     amend various provisions of Part A of Title XIV of the ESEA \n     to: (1) amend the definition of the term ``covered program;'' \n     (2) add a new definition for the term ``family literacy \n     services;'' and (3) make a number of cross-reference changes \n     from provisions and parts in Title XIV of the ESEA to \n     provisions and parts in Title XI of the ESEA to reflect the \n     redesignation of Title XIV as Title XI by section 1109 of the \n     bill. As amended, covered programs would be: Part A of Title \n     I; Part C of Title I; Part A of Title II; Subpart 1 of Part D \n     of Title III; Part A of Title IV (other than section 4115), \n     the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration Program, and \n     Title VI of the ESEA. The term ``family literacy services'' \n     would mean services provided to eligible participants on a \n     voluntary basis that are of sufficient intensity, both in \n     hours and duration, to make sustainable changes in a family, \n     and that integrate interactive literacy activities between \n     parents and their children, training for parents on how to be \n     the primary teachers for their children and full partners in \n     the education of their children, parent literacy training \n     leading to self-sufficiency, and an age-appropriate education \n     to prepare children for success in school and life \n     experiences.\n       Section 1102. Administrative Funds. Section 1102 of the \n     bill would amend various provisions of Part B of Title XIV of \n     the ESEA to: (1) revise the list of programs that are subject \n     to the authority to consolidate State administrative funds; \n     (2) expand the list of additional uses for consolidated \n     administrative funds; (3) clarify that local consolidated \n     administrative funds may be used at the school district and \n     school level; and (4) clarify the circumstances under which \n     an LEA may transfer a portion of its funds under one covered \n     program to another covered program.\n       Paragraph (1)(A) of section 1102 of the bill would revise \n     the list of programs in section 14201(a)(2) of the ESEA whose \n     administrative funds may be consolidated to include programs \n     under Title I, Part A of Title II, Subpart 1 of Part D of \n     Title III, and Part A of Title IV (other than section 4115) \n     of the ESEA, the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration \n     Program, Title VI of the ESEA (Class Size Reduction), the \n     Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of \n     1998, and such other programs as the Secretary may designate.\n       Paragraph (1)(B) of section 1102 of the bill would amend \n     section 14201(b)(2) of the ESEA to revise the list of \n     additional uses for the consolidated administrative funds to \n     include: (1) State level activities designed to carry out \n     Title XI (the redesignated general provisions title) \n     including Part B (accountability); (2) coordination of \n     included programs with other Federal and non-Federal \n     programs; (3) the establishment and operation of peer-review \n     mechanisms under the ESEA; (4) collaborative activities with \n     other State educational agencies to improve administration \n     under the Act; (5) the dissemination of information regarding \n     model programs and practices; (6) technical assistance under \n     the included programs; (7) training personnel engaged in \n     audit and other monitoring activities; and (8) implementation \n     of the Cooperative Audit Resolution and Oversight Initiative. \n     (Items (1), (4), (7), and (8) provide new authority.)\n       Paragraph (1)(C) of section 1102 of the bill would \n     eliminate an outdated cross-reference to the Goals 2000: \n     Educate America Act.\n       In addition to making conforming changes, section 1102(2) \n     of the bill would make a clarifying change to section 14203 \n     of the ESEA (Consolidation of Funds for Local Administration) \n     to make clear that an LEA may use local consolidated funds at \n     the school district and school levels for uses comparable to \n     those described above for consolidated State administrative \n     funds.\n       Paragraph (3) of section 1102 of the bill would repeal \n     section 14204 of the ESEA (Administrative Funds Studies). \n     Paragraph (4) of section 1102 of the bill would make \n     conforming amendments.\n       Paragraph (5) of section 1102 of the bill would make \n     conforming amendments, and would also amend section 14206(a) \n     of the ESEA to authorize an LEA that determines for any \n     fiscal year that funds under one covered program (other than \n     Part A of Title I) would be more effective in helping all \n     its students achieve the State's challenging standards if \n     used under another covered program, to use such funds (not \n     to exceed five percent of the LEA's total allotment under \n     that program) to carry out programs or activities under \n     the other covered program. The LEA would be required to \n     obtain the approval of its SEA for this use.\n       Section 1103. Coordination of Programs. Section 1103 of the \n     bill would amend provisions of Part C of Title XIV of the \n     ESEA relating to consolidated State plans and consolidated \n     local plans and add a new section on consolidated State \n     reporting.\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\n       Section 1103(1) of the bill would make an editorial change \n     to the heading for the Part. Section 1103(2) of the bill \n     would substantially revise section 14302 of the ESEA \n     (Optional Consolidated State Plans), which provides authority \n     for an SEA to submit a consolidated State plan instead of \n     separate State plans for the programs covered by that \n     section.\n       Proposed new section 14302(a)(1) of the ESEA would direct \n     the Secretary to establish procedures and criteria under \n     which a State educational agency may submit a consolidated \n     State plan meeting the requirements of proposed new section \n     14302. An SEA would be authorized to submit a consolidated \n     State plan for any or all of the covered programs in which \n     the State participates and the additional programs described \n     in proposed new section 14302(a)(2) of the ESEA. These \n     additional programs include: (1) the Even Start program under \n     Part of Title I; (2) the Neglected or Delinquent program \n     under Part D of Title I; (3) programs under Title Part A of \n     Title II of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \n     Education Act of 1998; and (4) such other programs as the \n     Secretary may designate.\n       Proposed new section 14302(a)(3) of the ESEA would provide \n     for the State development and submission of a consolidated \n     State plan. Under proposed new section 14302(a)(3)(A), an SEA \n     desiring to receive a grant under two or more programs to \n     which the section applies would be authorized to submit a \n     consolidated State plan. Under proposed new section \n     14302(a)(3)(B) of the ESEA, that agency would not be required \n     to submit a separate State plan for the programs included in \n     the consolidated State plan. Proposed new section \n     14302(a)(3)(C) of the ESEA would provide that the SEA must \n     comply with all legal requirements applicable to the programs \n     included in the consolidated State plan as if it had \n     submitted separate State plans.\n       Proposed new section 14302(a)(4) would specify that an SEA \n     desiring to receive funds under a program subject to section \n     14302 of the ESEA for fiscal year 2001 and the succeeding \n     four fiscal years must submit a new consolidated State plan \n     meeting the requirements of that section.\n       Proposed new section 14302(b) of the ESEA would provide for \n     the content of a consolidated State plan. Proposed section \n     14302(b)(1) would direct the Secretary to collaborate with \n     SEAs and other named parties in establishing criteria and \n     procedures. Through this collaborative process, the Secretary \n     would establish for each program the descriptions and \n     information that must be included in the plan. Proposed new \n     section 14302(b)(1) of the ESEA would further direct the \n     Secretary to ensure that a consolidated State plan contains, \n     for each program included in the plan, the descriptions and \n     information needed to ensure proper and effective \n     administration of that program in accordance with its \n     purposes. This provision is designed to strengthen the \n     consolidated plan as an instrument of effective \n     administration of each program included.\n       Proposed new section 14302(b)(2) of the ESEA would require \n     an SEA to describe in its plan how funds under the included \n     programs will be integrated to best serve the needs of the \n     students and teachers intended to benefit and how such funds \n     will be coordinated with other covered programs not included \n     in the plan and related programs.\n       Proposed new section 14302(c) of the ESEA would require an \n     SEA to include in its consolidated State plan any information \n     required by the Secretary under proposed new section 11912 of \n     the ESEA regarding performance indicators, benchmarks and \n     targets and any other indicators or measures that the State \n     determines are appropriate for evaluating its performance.\n       Proposed new section 14302(d) would require an SEA to \n     include in its consolidated State plan a description of the \n     strategies it will use under proposed new sections 11503(a) \n     (4) and (5) (relating to State monitoring and data \n     integrity).\n       Proposed new section 14302(e) of the ESEA would establish \n     procedures for peer review and Secretarial approval. The \n     Secretary would be required to establish a peer review \n     process to assist in the review of consolidated State plans \n     and provide recommendations for revision. To the extent \n     practicable, the Secretary would be directed by proposed new \n     section 14302(e)(1) to appoint individuals who: (1) are \n     knowledgeable about the programs and target populations; (2) \n     are representative of SEAs, LEAs, and teachers and parents of \n     students served under the programs, and (3) have expertise on \n     educational standards, assessment, and accountability.\n       Proposed new section 14302(e)(2) of the ESEA would direct \n     the Secretary to approve a plan if it meets the requirements \n     of the section and would authorize the Secretary to accompany \n     such approval with one or more conditions. Under proposed new \n     section 14302(e)(3) of the ESEA, if the Secretary determines \n     that the plan does not meet those requirements, the Secretary \n     would be required to notify the State of that determination \n     and the reasons for it. Proposed new section 14302(e)(4) of \n     the ESEA would require the Secretary, before disapproving a \n     plan, to offer the State an opportunity to revise the plan, \n     provide technical assistance, and provide a hearing.\n       Proposed new section 14302(f) of the ESEA would provide for \n     revision and amendment of a consolidated State plan.\n       Section 1103(3) of the bill would amend section 14303(a) of \n     the ESEA to provide for uniform State assurances regarding \n     monitoring and data integrity. Paragraph (3)(B) of section \n     1103 of the bill would insert a new paragraph (4) in section \n     14303(a) of the ESEA, requiring the State to assure that it \n     will monitor performance by LEAs to ensure compliance with \n     the requirements of the ESEA and, in so doing, will: (1) \n     maintain proper documentation of monitoring activities; (2) \n     provide technical assistance when appropriate and undertake \n     enforcement activities when needed; and (3) systematically \n     analyze the results of audits and other monitoring activities \n     to identify trends in funding and develop strategies to \n     correct problems.\n       Paragraph (3)(B) of section 1103 of the bill would further \n     amend section 14303(a) of the ESEA by adding a new paragraph \n     (5) requiring the State to assure that the data the State \n     uses to measure its performance (and that of its LEAs) under \n     the ESEA are complete, reliable, an accurate, or, if not, the \n     State will take such steps as are necessary to make those \n     data complete, reliable and accurate.\n       Section 1103(4) of the bill would repeal section 14304 of \n     the ESEA (Additional Coordination). Section 1103(5) of the \n     bill would amend section 14305 of the ESEA (``Consolidated \n     Local Plans''). Proposed new sections 14305(a) through (d) of \n     the ESEA would clarify and modify current law. Under proposed \n     section 14305(a), and LEA receiving funds under more than one \n     covered program may submit plans to the SEA under such \n     programs on a consolidated basis. Proposed new section \n     14305(b) of the ESEA would authorize an SEA that has an \n     approved consolidated State plan to require its LEAs that \n     receive funds under more than one program included in the \n     consolidated State plan to submit consolidated local plans \n     for such programs.\n       Proposed new section 14305(c) of the ESEA would require an \n     SEA to collaborate with LEAs in the State in establishing \n     criteria and procedures for the submission of the \n     consolidated local plans. For each program under the ESEA \n     that may be included in a local consolidated plan, proposed \n     new section 14305(d) of the ESEA would authorize the \n     Secretary to designate the descriptions and information that \n     must be included in a local consolidated plan to ensure that \n     each program is administered in a proper and effective manner \n     in accordance with its purposes.\n       Section 1103(6) of the bill would make conforming \n     amendments to section 14306 of the ESEA (General Assurances), \n     and section 1103(7) of the bill would repeal section 14307 of \n     the ESEA (Relationship of State and Local Plans to Plans \n     under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act).\n       Section 1103(8) of the bill would amend Part C of Title XIV \n     of the ESEA by adding a new section 14307 (``Consolidated \n     Reporting'') authorizing the Secretary to establish \n     procedures and criteria under which an SEA must submit a \n     consolidated State annual performance report. Proposed new \n     section 14307 of the ESEA would require that the report \n     include information about programs included in the report, \n     including the State's performance under those programs, \n     and other matters, as the Secretary determines. Submission \n     of a consolidated performance report would take the place \n     of individual performance reports for the programs subject \n     to its.\n       Section 1104. Waivers. Section 1104 of the bill would amend \n     section 14401 of the ESEA (Waivers).\n       Section 1104(1) of the bill would amend section 14401(a) of \n     the ESEA to add the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \n     Education Act of 1998 and Subtitle B of Title VII of the \n     Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act as programs to \n     which section 14401 applies. Section 1104(2) of the bill \n     would amend section 14401(b)(1) of the ESEA to require that \n     an SEA, LEA, or Indian tribe that desires a waiver submit an \n     application to the Secretary containing such information as \n     the Secretary may reasonably require. Each such application \n     would be required to: (1) indicate each Federal program \n     affected and the statutory or regulatory requirements \n     requested to be waived; (2) describe the purpose and expected \n     results of the waiver; (3) describe, for each school year, \n     specific, measurable goals for the SEA and for each LEA, \n     Indian tribe, or school that would be affected; and (4) \n     explain why the waiver would assist in reaching these goals. \n     Section 1104(3) of the bill would make conforming amendments \n     to section 14401(c) of the ESEA, relating to restrictions on \n     the waiver authority, and would add health and safety to the \n     list of requirements that may not be waived. Section 1104(4) \n     of the bill would make conforming changes to section \n     14401(e)(4) of the ESEA, relating to reports to Congress.\n       Section 1105. Uniform provisions. Section 1105 of the bill \n     would amend various provisions of Part E of Title XIV of the \n     ESEA relating to uniform provisions concerning maintenance of \n     effort and participation by private school children and \n     teachers.\n       Section 1105(1) of the bill would amend section 14501(a) of \n     the ESEA, relating to maintenance of effort, to make that \n     section inapplicable to Part C of Title I of that Act.\n       Section 1105(2) of the bill would also amend section \n     14503(a)(1) of the ESEA, relating to the provision of \n     equitable services to students in private schools, by adding \n     language to clarify that those services should address the \n     needs of those students.\n       Section 1105(2) of the bill would amend section 14503(b) to \n     make it apply to programs under: Part C of Title I; Part E of \n     Title I; Subpart 2 of Part A of Title II; Title III, Part A \n     of Title IV-A (other than section 4115), and Part A of Title \n     VII of the ESEA.\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\n       Section 1105(2) of the bill would also amend section \n     14503(c)(1) of the ESEA, with respect to the issues to be \n     covered by consultation between designated public educational \n     agencies and appropriate private school officials. Section \n     1105(2) of the bill would add two issues to be covered by \n     such consultation: (1) to the extent applicable, the amount \n     of funds received by the agency that are attributable to \n     private school children; and (2) how and when the agency will \n     make decisions about the delivery of services to these \n     children.\n       Section 1105(2) of the bill would also amend section \n     14503(c)(2) of the ESEA to clarify the timing of such \n     consultation. Under proposed new section 14503(c)(2) of the \n     ESEA, such consultation would be required to include meetings \n     of agency and private school officials, to occur before the \n     LEA makes any decision that affects the opportunities of \n     eligible private school children or their teachers to \n     participate in programs under the ESEA, and to continue \n     throughout the implementation and assessment of activities \n     under section 14503 of the ESEA.\n       Paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 1105 of the bill would \n     amend sections 14504 and 14506 of the ESEA to make conforming \n     amendments to cross-references. Paragraph (5) of section 1105 \n     of the bill would repeal sections 14513 and 14514 of the \n     ESEA.\n       Section 1106. Gun Possession. Section 1106 of the bill \n     would repeal Part F of Title XIV of the ESEA, the ``Gun-Free \n     Schools Act''. These provisions, in modified form, would be \n     included in proposed new title IV of the ESEA.\n       Section 1107. Evaluation and Indicators. Section 1107 of \n     the bill would amend Part G of Title XIV to revise section \n     14701 of the ESEA (Evaluation) and to add a new section 14702 \n     of the ESEA (``Performance Measures''), authorizing the \n     Secretary to establish performance indicators for each \n     program under the ESEA and Title VII-B of the Stewart B. \n     McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.\n       Section 1107(1) of the bill would amend the heading of Part \n     G to read: ``EVALUATION AND INDICATORS.'' Section 1107(s) of \n     the bill would add to section 14701(a)(1) of the ESEA new \n     subparagraphs that would authorize the Secretary, with the \n     funds reserved under the section, to: (1) conduct evaluations \n     to carry out the purposes of the Government and Performance \n     Results Act of 1993, and (2) work in partnership with the \n     States to develop information relating to program performance \n     that can be used to help achieve continuous improvement at \n     the State, school district, and school level. Proposed new \n     section 14701(b) of the ESEA would direct the Secretary to \n     use reserved funds to conduct independent studies of programs \n     under the ESEA and the effectiveness of those programs in \n     achieving their purposes, to determine whether the programs \n     are achieving the standards set forth in the subsection. \n     Proposed new section 14701(c) of the ESEA would direct the \n     Secretary to establish an independent panel to review these \n     studies, to advise the Secretary on their progress, and to \n     comment, if it so chooses, on the final report under proposed \n     new section 14701(d).\n       Proposed new section 14701(d) would direct the Secretary to \n     submit an interim report on the evaluations within three \n     years of enactment of the Educational Excellence for All \n     Children Act of 1999 and a final report with four years to \n     the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of \n     Representatives and to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor and Pensions of the Senate. Proposed new section \n     14701(e) of the ESEA would authorize the Secretary to provide \n     technical assistance to recipients under the ESEA to \n     strengthen the collection and assessment of information \n     relating to program performance and quality assurance at \n     State and local levels. This proposed new subsection would \n     require that the technical assistance be designed to promote \n     the development, use and reporting of data on valid, \n     reliable, timely, and consistent performance indicators, \n     within and across programs, with the goal of helping \n     recipients make continuous program improvement.\n       Section 1107(3) would add proposed new section 14702 \n     (``Performance Measures'') to the ESEA. Proposed new section \n     14702(a) of the ESEA would authorize the Secretary to \n     establish performance indicators, benchmarks, and targets for \n     each program under the Act and Subtitle B of Title VII-B of \n     the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, to assist in measuring \n     program performance. It would further require that the \n     indicators, benchmarks, and targets be consistent with the \n     Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, strategic \n     plans adopted by the Secretary under that Act, and section \n     11501 of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 14702(b) of the ESEA would direct the \n     Secretary to collaborate with SEAs, LEAs and other recipients \n     under the ESEA in establishing performance indicators, \n     benchmarks, and targets. Proposed new section 14702(c) of the \n     ESEA would authorize the Secretary to require an applicant \n     for funds under the ESEA or the McKinney Act to (1) include \n     in its plan or application information relating to how it \n     will use the indicators, benchmarks and targets to improve \n     its program performance and (2) report data relating to such \n     performance indicators, benchmarks and targets to the \n     Secretary.\n       Section 1108. Coordinated Services. Section 1108 of the \n     bill would transfer Title XI of the ESEA, relating to \n     coordinated services, to Part I of Title XI and would make \n     conforming and other amendments to Title XI of current law.\n       Section 1108(b)(1) of the bill would revise section 11903 \n     of the new Part I, as redesignated, (current section 11004 of \n     the ESEA, relating to project development and \n     implementation). Proposed new section 11903(a) would require \n     each eligible entity desiring to use funds under section \n     11405(b) of the ESEA (for coordinated services) to submit an \n     application to the appropriate SEA. Proposed new section \n     11903(b) of the ESEA would require an eligible entity that \n     wishes to conduct a coordinated services project to maintain \n     on file: (1) the results of its assessment of economic, \n     social, and health barriers to educational achievement \n     experienced by children and families in the community and of \n     the services available to meet those needs; (2) a description \n     of the entities operating coordinated services projects; (3) \n     a description of its coordinated services project and other \n     information related to the project; and (4) an annual \n     budget that indicates the sources and amounts of funds \n     under the Act that will be used for the project, \n     consistent with section 11405(b) and the purposes for \n     which the funds will be used.\n       Proposed new section 11903(b) of the ESEA would also \n     require such an eligible entity to evaluate annually the \n     success of the project; train teachers and appropriate \n     personnel; and ensure that the coordinated services project \n     addresses the health and welfare needs of migratory families. \n     Proposed new section 11903(c) of the ESEA would provide that \n     an SEA need not require eligible entities to submit an \n     application under subsection (a) in order to permit them to \n     carry out coordinated services projects under section 11903 \n     of the ESEA.\n       Section 1108(b)(2) of the bill would make conforming \n     amendments to section 11904 of the ESEA, as redesignated. \n     Section 1108(b)(3) of the bill would amend section 11905 of \n     the ESEA, as redesignated (current section 11004 of the \n     ESEA), to make clear that the authority under that section is \n     placed in the SEA, rather than the Secretary, and to make \n     other conforming changes.\n       Section 1109. Redesignations. Section 1109 of the bill \n     would redesignate Title XIV of the ESEA as Title XI of the \n     ESEA and would make conforming amendments to its parts and \n     sections.\n       Sec. 1110. (ED-Flex Partnerships). Section 1110 of the bill \n     would make minor revisions to the recently enacted Education \n     Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-25) and \n     redesignate it as Part G of Title XI of the revised ESEA.\n       Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) of section 1110(a) would \n     make minor changes to the short title, findings, and \n     definitions of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of \n     1999 to reflect its incorporation into the ESEA.\n       Paragraph (5) of section 1110(a) would, in addition to \n     making minor editorial revisions, make State eligibility for \n     ED-Flex status turn, in part, on whether the State has an \n     approved accountability plan under proposed new section 11208 \n     of the ESEA and is making satisfactory progress, as \n     determined by the Secretary, in implementing its policies \n     under proposed new sections 11204 (Student Progress and \n     Promotion Policy) and 11205 (Ensuring Teacher Quality) of the \n     ESEA. (A State would also have to be in compliance with \n     various Title I accountability requirements and waive State \n     statutory and regulatory requirements.) Paragraph (5) of \n     section 1110(a) of the bill would also revise the conditions \n     under which the Secretary may grant an extension of ED-Flex \n     authority, beyond five years, to provide, in part, that the \n     Secretary may grant such an extension only if he or she \n     determines that the State has made significant statewide \n     gains in student achievement and is closing the achievement \n     gap between low- and high-performing students.\n       In addition, paragraph (5) of section 1110(a) of the bill \n     would revise the list of Federal education programs that are \n     subject to ED-Flex authority to reflect the amendments that \n     would be made to the ESEA by the bill and to include Subtitle \n     B of Title VII of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance \n     Act. Paragraph (5) would also clarify that, while States may \n     grant waivers with respect to the minimum percentage of \n     children from low-income families needed to permit a \n     schoolwide program under section 1114 of the ESEA, in doing \n     so they may not go below 40 percent. Finally, paragraph (5) \n     would add a transition provision that makes clear that \n     waivers granted under applicable ED-Flex authority prior to \n     the effective date of proposed new Part G of Title XI of the \n     ESEA would remain in effect in accordance with the terms and \n     conditions that applied when those waivers were granted, and \n     that waivers granted on or after the effective date of Part G \n     would be subject to the provisions of Part G.\n       Paragaphs (6) and (7) of section 1110(a) of the bill would \n     make editorial revisions and repeal, as no longer needed, \n     certain amendatory provisions to other Acts (but without un-\n     doing the substantive changes to those other Acts made by \n     those amendatory provisions). Finally, section 1110(b) of the \n     bill would make appropriate redesignations and add a part \n     heading.\n       Section 1111. Accountability. Section 1111 of the bill \n     would amend Title XI of the Act by adding a new Part B, \n     Improving Education Through Accountability.\n       Proposed new section 11201 (``Short Title'') of the ESEA \n     would establish the short title of this part as the \n     ``Education Accountability Act of 1999.''\n       Proposed new section 11202 (``Purpose'') of the ESEA would \n     set out the statement of\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\n     purpose for the new part. Under proposed new section 11202, \n     the purpose of the part would be to improve academic \n     achievement for all children, assist in meeting America's \n     Education Goals under section 2 of the ESEA, promote the \n     incorporation of challenging State academic content and \n     student performance standards into classroom practice, \n     enhance accountability of State and local officials for \n     student progress, and improve the effectiveness of programs \n     under the ESEA and the educational opportunities of the \n     students that they serve.\n       Proposed new section 11203 (``Turning Around Failing \n     Schools'') of the ESEA would require a State that receives \n     assistance under the ESEA to develop and implement a \n     statewide system for holding its LEAs and schools accountable \n     for student performance, including a procedure for \n     identifying LEAs and schools in need of improvement; \n     intervening in those agencies and schools to improve teaching \n     and learning; and implementing corrective actions, if those \n     interventions are not effective.\n       Proposed new section 11204 (``Student Progress and \n     Promotion Policy'') of the ESEA would require any State that \n     receives assistance under the ESEA to have in effect, at the \n     time its submits its accountability plan, a State policy that \n     is designed to ensure that students progress through school \n     on a timely basis, having mastered the challenging material \n     needed for them to reach high standards of performance and is \n     designed to end the practices of social promotion and \n     retention. Proposed new subsection (a)(2) would also define \n     the terms ``social promotion'' and ``retention.''\n       Proposed new section 11204(b) would outline specific \n     requirements for the State's policy under subsection (a). \n     Under proposed new section 11204(b), a State policy must: (1) \n     require its LEAs to implement continuing, intensive and \n     comprehensive educational interventions as may be necessary \n     to ensure that all students can meet the challenging academic \n     performance standards required under section 1111(b)(A) of \n     the ESEA, and require all students to meet those challenging \n     standards before being promoted at three key transition \n     points (one of which must be graduation from secondary \n     school), as determined by the State, consistent with section \n     1111(b)(2)(D); (2) require the SEA to determine, through the \n     collection of appropriate data, whether LEAs and schools are \n     ending the practices of social promotion and retention; (3) \n     require its LEAs to provide to all students educational \n     opportunities in classrooms with qualified teachers who use \n     proven instructional practices that are aligned to the \n     State's challenging standards and who are supported by high-\n     quality professional development; and (4) require its LEAs to \n     use effective, research-based prevention and early prevention \n     strategies to identify and support students who need \n     additional help to meet those promotion standards.\n       Proposed new subsection (b) would also require the State \n     policy to provide, with respect to students who have not \n     demonstrated mastery of challenging State academic standards \n     on a timely basis, for continuing, intensive, and age-\n     appropriate interventions, including, but not limited to, \n     extended instruction and learning time, such as after-school \n     and summer programs that are designed to help students master \n     such material; for other specific interventions, with \n     appropriate instructional strategies, to enable students with \n     limited English proficiency and students with disabilities to \n     master such material; for the identification of the knowledge \n     and skills in particular subject areas that students have not \n     mastered, in order to facilitate remediation in those areas; \n     for the development, by schools, of plans to provide \n     individualized attention to students who have not mastered \n     such material; for full communication between the school and \n     parents, including a description and analysis of the \n     students' performance, how it will be improved, and how \n     parents will be involved in the process; and, in cases in \n     which significant numbers of students have failed to master \n     such material, for a State review of whether corrective \n     action with respect to the school or LEA is needed.\n       Finally, proposed new subsection (b) of section 11204 of \n     the ESEA would require the State policy to require its LEAs \n     to disseminate widely their policies under this subsection in \n     language and in a format that is concise and that parents can \n     understand and ensure that any assessments used by a State, \n     LEA, or school for the purpose of implementing a policy under \n     this subsection are aligned with the State's challenging \n     academic content and student performance standards and \n     provide coherent information about student progress \n     towards attainment of such standards; include multiple \n     measures, including teacher evaluations, no one of which \n     may be assigned determinative weight in making adverse \n     decisions about individual students; offer multiple \n     opportunities for students to demonstrate that they meet \n     the standards; are valid and reliable for the purposes for \n     which they are used, and fairly and accurately measure \n     what students have been taught; provide reasonable \n     adaptations and accommodations for students with \n     disabilities and students with limited English \n     proficiency; provide that students with limited English \n     proficiency are assessed, to the greatest extent \n     practicable, in the language and form most likely to yield \n     accurate and reliable information about what those \n     students know and can do; and provide that Spanish-\n     speaking students with limited English proficiency are \n     assessed using tests written in Spanish, if Spanish-\n     language assessments are more likely than English-language \n     tests to yield accurate and reliable information on what \n     those students know and can do.\n       Proposed new section 11204(c) of the ESEA would establish \n     what a State must include in its accountability plan under \n     proposed new section 11208 of the ESEA with respect to its \n     promotion policy. A State would be required to include in its \n     accountability plan a detailed description of its policy \n     under proposed new subsection (b). Additionally, a State \n     would be required to include in its plan the strategies and \n     steps (including timelines and performance indicators) it \n     will take to ensure that its policy is fully implemented no \n     later than four years from the date of the approval of its \n     plan. Finally, a State would also be required to address in \n     its plan the steps that it will take to ensure that the \n     policy will be disseminated to all LEAs and schools in the \n     State and to the general public.\n       Proposed new section 11205 (``Ensuring Teacher Quality'') \n     of the ESEA would establish provisions to ensure teacher \n     quality. Specifically, proposed new section 11205(a) would \n     provide that a State that receives funds under the ESEA must \n     have in effect, at the time it submits its accountability \n     plan, a policy designated to ensure that there are qualified \n     teachers in every classroom in the State, and that meets the \n     requirements of proposed new sections 11205(b) and (c).\n       Proposed new section 11205(b) of the ESEA would establish \n     requirements for the contents of the State's policy on \n     teacher quality. Under proposed new section 11205(b), a \n     policy to ensure teacher quality must include the strategies \n     that the State will carry out to ensure that, within four \n     years from the date of approval of its accountability plan, \n     certain goals are met. Proposed new section 11205(b)(1) would \n     require that a State include strategies to ensure that not \n     less than 95% of the teachers in public schools in the State \n     are either certified, have a baccalaureate degree and are \n     enrolled in a program, such as an alternative certification \n     program, leading to full certification in their field within \n     three years, or have full certification in another State and \n     are establishing certification where they are teaching. \n     Proposed new section 11205(b)(2) would require the State to \n     include strategies to ensure that not less than 95% of the \n     teachers in public secondary schools in the State have \n     academic training or demonstrated competence in the subject \n     area in which they teach. A State would also have to include \n     strategies to ensure that there is no disproportionate \n     concentration in particular school districts of teachers who \n     are not described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of proposed new \n     section 11205(b). Additionally, a State would be required to \n     include in its teacher quality policy strategies to ensure \n     that its certification process for new teachers includes an \n     assessment of content knowledge and teaching skills aligned \n     with State standards.\n       Proposed new section 11205(c) of the ESEA would require a \n     State to include in its accountability plan the performance \n     indicators by which it would annually measure progress in two \n     areas. Under proposed new section 11205(c)(1)(A), a State \n     would be required to include the benchmarks by which it will \n     measure its progress in decreasing the percentage of teachers \n     in the State teaching without full licenses or credentials. \n     Proposed new section 11205(c)(1)(B) would require a State to \n     include the benchmarks by which it will measure its progress \n     in increasing the percentage of secondary school classes in \n     core academic subject areas taught by teachers who either \n     have a postsecondary-level academic major or minor in the \n     subject area they teach or a related field, or otherwise \n     demonstrate a high level of competence through rigorous tests \n     in their academic subject.\n       Finally, proposed new section 11205(c)(2) of the ESEA would \n     require a State to assure in its accountability plan that in \n     carrying out its teacher quality policy, it would not \n     decrease the rigor or quality of its teacher certification \n     standards.\n       Subsection (a) of proposed new section 11206 (``Sound \n     Discipline Policy'') of the ESEA would require a State that \n     receives assistance under the ESEA; to have in effect, at the \n     time it submits its accountability plan, a policy that would \n     require its LEAs and schools to have in place and implement \n     sound and equitable discipline policies, to ensure a safe, \n     and orderly, and drug-free learning environment in every \n     school. A State would also be required under section 11206(c) \n     to include in its accountability plan an assurance that it \n     has in effect a policy that meets the requirements of this \n     section.\n       Under proposed new section 11206(b) of the ESEA, the \n     required disciplinary policy would require LEAs and schools \n     to implement disciplinary policies that focus on prevention \n     and are coordinated with prevention strategies and programs \n     under Title IV of the ESEA. Additionally, LEA and school \n     policies would have to: apply to all students; be enforced \n     consistently and equitably; be clear and understandable; be \n     developed with the participation of school staff, students, \n     and parents; be broadly disseminated; ensure that due process \n     is provided; be consistent with applicable Federal, State and \n     local laws; ensure that teachers are adequately trained to \n     manage their classrooms effectively; and, in case of students \n     suspended or expelled from school, provide for appropriate \n     supervision, counseling, and educational\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\n     services that will help those students continue to meet the \n     State's challenging standards.\n       Subsection (a) of proposed new section 11207 (``Education \n     Report Cards'') of the ESEA would require a State that \n     receives assistance under the ESEA, to have in effect, at the \n     time it submits its accountability plan, a policy that \n     requires the development and dissemination of annual report \n     cards regarding the status of education and educational \n     progress in the State and in its LEAs and schools. Under \n     proposed new section 11207(a), report cards would have to be \n     concise and disseminated in a format and manner that parents \n     could understand, and focus on educational results.\n       Proposed new section 11207(b) of the ESEA would establish \n     the information that, at a minimum, the State must include in \n     its annual State-level report card. Under proposed new \n     section 11207(b)(1), a State would be required to include \n     information regarding student performance on statewide \n     assessments, set forth on an aggregated basis, in both \n     reading (or language arts) and mathematics, as well as any \n     other subject area for which the State requires assessments. \n     A State would also be required under proposed new section \n     11207(b)(1) to include in its report card information \n     regarding attendance and graduation rates in the State's \n     public schools, as well as the average class size in each of \n     the State's school districts. A State would also be required \n     to include information with respect to school safety, \n     including the incidence of school violence and drug and \n     alcohol abuse and the number of instances in which a student \n     has possessed a firearm at school, subject to the Gun-Free \n     Schools Act. Finally, a State would be required under \n     proposed new section 11207(b)(1) to include in its report \n     card information regarding the professional qualifications of \n     teachers in the State, including the number of teachers \n     teaching with emergency credentials and the number of \n     teachers teaching outside their field of expertise.\n       Proposed new section 11207(b)(2) of the ESEA would require \n     that student achievement data in the State's report card \n     contain statistically sound, disaggregated results with \n     respect to the following categories: gender; racial and \n     ethnic group; migrant status; students with disabilities, as \n     compared to students who are not disabled; economically \n     disadvantaged students, as compared to students who are not \n     economically disadvantaged; and students with limited English \n     proficiency, as compared to students who are proficient in \n     English. Under proposed new section 11207(b)(2), a State \n     could also include in its report card any other information \n     it determines appropriate to reflect school quality and \n     student achievement. This could include information on: \n     longitudinal achievement scores from the National Assessment \n     of Educational Progress or State assessments; parent \n     involvement, as determined by such measures as the extent of \n     parental participation in school parental involvement \n     activities; participation in extended learning time programs, \n     such as after-school and summer programs; and the performance \n     of students in meeting physical education goals.\n       Under proposed new section 11207(c) of the ESEA, a State \n     would be required to ensure that each LEA and each school in \n     the State includes in its annual report, at a minimum, the \n     information required by proposed new sections 11207(b) (1) \n     and (2). Additionally, a State would be required under \n     proposed new section 11207(c) to ensure that LEAs include in \n     their annual report cards the number of their low-performing \n     schools, such as schools identified as in need of improvement \n     under section 1116(c)(1) of the ESEA, and information that \n     shows how students in their schools performed on statewide \n     assessments compared to students in the rest of the State \n     (including such comparisons over time, if the information is \n     available), and schools include in their annual report cards \n     whether they have been identified as a low-performing school \n     and information that shows how their students performed on \n     statewide assessments compared to students in the rest of the \n     LEA and the State (including such comparisons over time, if \n     the information is available). LEAs and schools could also \n     include in their annual report cards the information \n     described in proposed new section 11207(b)(3) and other \n     appropriate information.\n       Proposed new section 11207(d) of the ESEA would establish \n     requirements for the dissemination and accessibility of \n     report cards. Under proposed new section 11207(d), State-\n     level report cards would be required to be posted on the \n     Internet, disseminated to all schools and LEAs in the State, \n     and made broadly available to the public. LEA report cards \n     would have to be disseminated to all their schools and to all \n     parents of students attending these schools, and made broadly \n     available to the public. School report cards would have to be \n     disseminated to all parents of students attending that school \n     and made broadly available to the public.\n       Under proposed new section 11207(e) of the ESEA, a State \n     would be required to include in its accountability plan an \n     assurance that it has in effect an education report card \n     policy that meets the requirements of proposed new section \n     11207.\n       Proposed new section 11208 (``Education Accountability \n     Plans'') of the ESEA would establish the requirements for a \n     State's education accountability plan. In general, each State \n     that received assistance under ESEA, on or after July 1, \n     2000, would be required to have on file with the Secretary, \n     an approved accountability plan that meets the requirements \n     of this section.\n       Proposed new section 11208(b) would establish the specific \n     contents of a State accountability plan. A State would be \n     required to include a description of the State's system under \n     proposed new section 11203; a description of the steps the \n     State will take to ensure that all LEAs have the capacity \n     needed to ensure compliance with this part; the assurances \n     required by proposed new sections 11204(c), 11205(c), \n     11206(6), and 11207(e); information indicating that the \n     Governor and the SEA concur with the plan; and any other \n     information that the Secretary may reasonably require to \n     ensure the proper and effective administration of this part.\n       Proposed new section 11208(c) of the ESEA would require a \n     State to report annually to the Secretary, in such form and \n     containing such information as the Secretary may require, on \n     its progress in carrying out the requirements of this Part, \n     and would be required to include this report in the \n     consolidated State performance report required under proposed \n     new section 11506 of the ESEA. Additionally, in reporting on \n     its progress in implementing its student progress and social \n     promotion policy under proposed new section 11204 of the \n     ESEA, a State would be required to assess the effect of its \n     policy, and its implementation, on improving academic \n     achievement for all children, and otherwise carrying out the \n     purpose specified in proposed new section 11202 of the ESEA.\n       Proposed new section 11208(d) of the ESEA would require a \n     State that submits a consolidated State plan under section \n     11502 to include in that plan its accountability plan under \n     this section. If a State does not submit a consolidated State \n     plan, a State must submit a separate accountability plan.\n       Under proposed new section 11208(e) of the ESEA, the \n     Secretary would approve an accountability plan under this \n     section if the Secretary determined that it substantially \n     complied with the requirements of this part. Additionally, \n     the Secretary would have the authority to accompany the \n     approval of a plan with conditions consistent with the \n     purpose of this part. In reviewing accountability plans under \n     this part, proposed new section 110208(e) of the ESEA would \n     require that the Secretary use the peer review procedures \n     under section 11502(e) of the ESEA. Finally, under \n     proposed new section 11208(e) of the ESEA, if a State does \n     not submit a consolidated State plan under section 11502 \n     of the ESEA, the Secretary would, in considering that \n     State's separate accountability plan under this section, \n     use procedures comparable to those in section 11502(e).\n       Proposed new section 11209 (``Authority of Secretary to \n     Ensure Accountability'') of the ESEA would establish the \n     Secretary's authority to ensure accountability. If the \n     Secretary determines that a State has failed substantially to \n     carry out a requirement of this part or its approved \n     accountability plan, or that its performance has failed \n     substantially to meet a performance indicator in its \n     accountability plan, proposed new section 11209(a) of the \n     ESEA would authorize the Secretary to take one or more of the \n     following steps to ensure prompt compliance: (1) providing, \n     or arranging for, technical assistance to the State \n     educational agency; (2) requiring a corrective action plan; \n     (3) suspending or terminating authority to grant waivers \n     under applicable ED-Flex authority; (4) suspending or \n     terminating eligibility to participate in competitive \n     programs under the ESEA; (5) withholding, in whole or in \n     part, State administrative funds under the ESEA; (6) \n     withholding, in whole or in part, program funds under the \n     ESEA; (7) imposing one or more conditions upon the \n     Secretary's approval of a State plan or application under the \n     ESEA; (8) taking other actions under Part D of the General \n     Education Priorities Act; and (9) taking other appropriate \n     steps, including referral to the Department of Justice for \n     enforcement.\n       Proposed new section 11209(b) of the ESEA would require the \n     Secretary to take one or more additional steps under proposed \n     new section 11209(a) of the ESEA to bring the State into \n     compliance if he determines that previous steps under that \n     provision have failed to correct the State's non-compliance.\n       Proposed new section 11210 (``Recognition and Rewards'') of \n     the ESEA would require the Secretary to recognize and reward \n     States that the Secretary determines have demonstrated \n     significant, statewide achievement gains in core subjects, as \n     measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress \n     for three consecutive years, are closing the achievement gap \n     between low- and high-performing students, and have in place \n     strategies for continuous improvement in reducing the \n     practices of social promotion and retention. Such recognition \n     and rewards would take into account all the circumstances, \n     including the size of the State's gains in statewide \n     achievement.\n       Proposed new section 11210(b) of the ESEA would require the \n     Secretary to establish, through regulation, a system for \n     recognizing and rewarding States described under proposed new \n     section 11210(a) of the ESEA. Rewards could include \n     conferring a priority in competitive programs under the ESEA, \n     increased flexibility in administering programs under the \n     ESEA (consistent with maintaining accountability), and \n     supplementary grants or administrative funds to carry out the \n     purposes of the ESEA. Proposed new section 11210(c) of the \n     ESEA would authorize, for fiscal year 2001 and each of the\n\n[[Page S6368]]\n\n     four succeeding fiscal years, the appropriation of whatever \n     sums are necessary to provide such supplementary funds.\n       Proposed new section 11211 (``Best Practices Model'') of \n     the ESEA would require the Secretary, in implementing this \n     part, to disseminate information regarding best practices, \n     models, and other forms of technical assistance, after \n     consulting with State and LEAs and other agencies, \n     institutions, and organizations with experience or \n     information relevant to the purposes of this part.\n       Finally, proposed new section 11212 (``Construction'') of \n     the ESEA would provide that nothing in this Part may be \n     construed as affecting home schooling, or the application of \n     the civil rights laws or the Individuals with Disabilities.\n       Section 1112. America's Education Goals Panel. Section 1112 \n     of the bill would move the authority for the National \n     Education Goals Panel from Title II of the Goals 2000: \n     Educate America Act to a new Part C of Title XI of the ESEA, \n     and rename the panel the ``America's Education Goals Panel.'' \n     This conforms to the renaming of the National Education Goals \n     as ``America's Education Goals'' and their placement in \n     proposed new section 2 of the ESEA, as added by section 2(b) \n     of the bill.\n       The statutory authority for the Goals Panel would be \n     largely unchanged from current law, apart from some minor \n     stylistic changes, updates, clarifications, and the \n     elimination of current provisions relating to voluntary \n     National content standards, voluntary National student \n     performance standards and the work of the Panel's Resource \n     and Technical Planning Groups on School Readiness.\n       The current authority for the National Education Goals \n     Panel, Title II of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, would \n     be repealed by section 1201 of the bill.\n       Section 1113. Repeal. Section 1112 of the bill would repeal \n     Title XII of the ESEA.\n\n\n              title xii--amendments to other laws; repeals\n\n     Part A--Amendments to other laws\n       Section 1201. Amendments to the Stewart B. McKinney \n     Homeless Assistance Act. Section 1201 of the bill would set \n     forth amendments to the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11421 et seq.; hereinafter referred \n     to in this section as the ``Act''). Among other things, these \n     amendments would improve the McKinney program by: (1) helping \n     ensure that students are not segregated based on their status \n     as homeless; (2) enhancing coordination at the State and \n     local levels; (3) facilitating parental involvement; (4) \n     clarifying that subgrants to LEAs are to be awarded \n     competitively on the basis of the quality of the program and \n     the need for the assistance; and (5) enhancing data \n     collection and dissemination at the national level. The \n     program would also be reauthorized for five years.\n       Section 1201(a) of the bill would amend section 721(3) of \n     the Act (Statement of Policy), by changing the current \n     statement to make it clear that homelessness alone is not \n     sufficient reason to separate students from the mainstream \n     school environment. This language, which is reflected in \n     amendments that follow make a strong statement against \n     segregating homeless children on the basis of their \n     homelessness. This responds to some local actions being taken \n     around the country to create separate, generally inferior, \n     schools for homeless children. Homeless advocacy groups and \n     State coordinators have strongly encouraged this action.\n       Section 1201(b) of the bill would amend section 722 of the \n     Act (Grants for State and Local Activities for the Education \n     of Homeless Children and Youth). Section 1201(b)(1) of the \n     bill would amend sections 722(c)(2) and (3) of the Act, \n     reserving funds for the territories and defining the term \n     ``State,'' to remove Palau from those provisions. Palau does \n     not participate in the program since its Compact of Free \n     Association was ratified. Section 1201(b)(2) of the bill \n     would amend section 722(e) of the Act (State and Local \n     Grants), to add a new paragraph (3) that would prohibit a \n     State receiving funds under this subtitle from segregating a \n     homeless child or youth, either in a separate school or in a \n     separate program within a school, based on that child or \n     youth's status as homeless, except as is necessary for short \n     periods of time because of health and safety emergencies or \n     to provide temporary, special supplementary services to meet \n     the unique needs of homeless children and youth.\n       Section 1201(b)(3) of the bill would amend section 722(f) \n     of the Act (Functions of the State Coordinator). Section \n     1201(b)(3)(A) of the bill would amend section 722(f)(1) of \n     the Act to eliminate the requirement that the coordinator \n     estimate the number of homeless children and youth in the \n     State and the number of homeless children and youth served by \n     the program. Section 1201(b)(3)(B) of the bill would amend \n     section 722(f)(4) of the Act to eliminate the requirement \n     that the Coordinator report on certain specific information \n     and replace it with a more general requirement that the \n     Coordinator collect and transmit to the Secretary such \n     information as the Secretary deems necessary to assess the \n     educational needs of homeless children and youth within the \n     State. Section 1201(b)(3)(C) of the bill would amend section \n     722(f)(6) of the Act to make editorial changes and require \n     the Coordinator to collaborate, as well as to coordinate, \n     with certain currently listed entities, as well as with LEA \n     liaisons and community organizations and groups representing \n     homeless children and youth and their families.\n       Section 1201(b)(4) of the bill would amend section 722(g) \n     of the Act (State Plan). Paragraph (4)(A) of the bill would \n     amend section 722(g)(1)(H) of the Act to require States to \n     provide assurances in their plans that SEAs and LEAs adopt \n     policies and practices to ensure that homeless children and \n     youth are not segregated or stigmatized and that LEAs in \n     which homeless children and youth reside or attend school \n     will: (1) post public notice of the educational rights of \n     such children and youth in places where such children and \n     youth receive services under this Act; and (2) designate an \n     appropriate staff person, who may also be a coordinator for \n     other Federal programs, as a liaison for homeless children \n     and youth. Section 1201(b)(4)(B) of the bill would amend \n     section 722(g)(3)(B) of the Act to require LEAs, in \n     determining the best interest of the homeless child or youth, \n     to the extent feasible, to keep a homeless child or youth in \n     his or her school of origin, except when doing so is contrary \n     to the wishes of his or her parent or guardian, and to \n     provide a written explanation to the homeless child's or \n     youth's parent or guardian when the child or youth is sent to \n     a school other than the school of origin or a school \n     requested by the parent or guardian.\n       Section 1201(b)(4)(C) of the bill would amend section \n     722(g)(6) of the Act to consolidate the coordination \n     requirements currently in paragraphs (6) and (9) and require \n     that the mandated coordination be designed to: (1) ensure \n     that homeless children and youth have access to available \n     education and related support services, and (2) raise the \n     awareness of school personnel and service providers of the \n     effects of short-term stays in a shelter and other challenges \n     associated with homeless children and youth. Section \n     1201(b)(4)(D) of the bill would amend section 722(g)(7) of \n     the Act to require each LEA liaison, designated pursuant to \n     section 722(g)(1)(H)(ii)(II) of the Act, to ensure that: (1) \n     homeless children and youth enroll, and have a full and equal \n     opportunity to succeed, in schools of that agency; (2) \n     homeless families, children, and youth receive educational \n     services for which such families, children, and youth are \n     eligible; and (3) the parents or guardians of homeless \n     children and youth are informed of the education and related \n     opportunities available to their children and are provided \n     with meaningful opportunities to participate in the education \n     of their children. Section 722(g)(7) of the Act would be \n     further amended by adding a new subparagraph (C) requiring \n     LEA liaisons, as a part of their duties, to coordinate and \n     collaborate with State coordinators and community and school \n     personnel responsible for the provision of education and \n     related services to homeless children and youth. Section \n     1201(b)(4)(E) of the bill would eliminate section 722(g)(9) \n     of the Act, which would be combined with section 722(g)(6) of \n     the Act.\n       Section 1201(c) of the bill would amend section 723 of the \n     Act (Local Educational Agency Grants for the Education of \n     Homeless Children and Youth). Section 1201(c)(1) of the bill \n     would amend section 723(a) of the Act to: (1) make certain \n     editorial changes; (2) clarify that where services under the \n     section are provided on school grounds, schools may use funds \n     under this Act to provide the same services to other children \n     and youth who are determined by the LEA to be at risk of \n     failing in, or dropping out of, schools; and (3) prohibit \n     schools from providing services, including those to at-risk \n     children and youth, in settings within a school that \n     segregate homeless children and youth from other children and \n     youth, except as is necessary for short periods of time \n     because of health and safety emergencies or to provide \n     temporary, special supplementary services to meet the unique \n     needs of homeless children and youth.\n       Section 1201(c)(2) of the bill would amend section 723(b) \n     of the Act to require local applications for State subgrants \n     to contain an assessment of the educational and related needs \n     of homeless children and youth in their district (which may \n     be undertaken as a part of needs assessments for other \n     disadvantaged groups). Section 1201(c)(3) of the bill would \n     amend section 723(c)(1) of the Act to clarify that State \n     subgrants are to be awarded competitively on the basis of the \n     need of such agencies for assistance under this subtitle and \n     the quality of the application submitted. Section 1201(c)(3) \n     of the bill would also add a new paragraph (3) to section \n     723(c) of the Act, requiring a SEA, in determining the \n     quality of a local application for a subgrant, to consider: \n     (1) the applicant's needs assessment and the likelihood that \n     the program presented in the application will meet those \n     needs; (2) the types, intensity, and coordination of the \n     services to be provided under the program; (3) the \n     involvement of parents or guardians; (4) the extent to which \n     homeless children and youth will be integrated within the \n     regular education program; (5) the quality of the applicant's \n     evaluation plan for the program; (6) the extent to which \n     services provided under this subtitle will be coordinated \n     with other available services; and (7) such other measures as \n     the SEA deems indicative of a high-quality program.\n       Section 1201(d) of the bill would amend section 724 of the \n     Act (Secretarial Responsibilities). Section 1201(d) of the \n     bill would replace current subsection (f) (Reports), with a \n     new subsection (f) (``Information''), and a new subsection \n     (g) (``Report''). Proposed new section 724(f) of the Act \n     would require the Secretary, from funds appropriated under \n     section 726 of the Act, and either directly or through \n     grants, contracts, or cooperative\n\n[[Page S6369]]\n\n     agreements, to periodically collect and disseminate data and \n     information on the number and location of homeless children \n     and youth, the education and related services such children \n     and youth receive, the extent to which such needs are being \n     met, and such other data and information as the Secretary \n     deems necessary and relevant to carry out this subtitle. The \n     Secretary would also be required to coordinate such \n     collection and dissemination with the other agencies and \n     entities that receive assistance and administer programs \n     under this subtitle. Proposed new section 724(g) of the \n     Act would require the Secretary, not later than four years \n     after the date of the enactment of the bill, to prepare \n     and submit to the President and appropriate committees of \n     the House of Representatives and the Senate a report on \n     the status of education of homeless youth and children.\n       Section 1201(e) of the bill would amend section 726 of the \n     Act to authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of the fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to \n     carry out the subtitle.\n       Section 1202. Amendments to Other Laws. Section 1202 of the \n     bill would make conforming amendments to other statutes that \n     reflect the changes to the ESEA that are proposed in this \n     bill.\n       Section 1202(a) of the bill would eliminate an outdated \n     cross-reference in section 116(a)(5) of the Carl D. Perkins \n     Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (20 U.S.C. \n     2326(a)(5)).\n       Section 1202(b) of the bill would update a cross-reference \n     in section 317(b)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1059d(b)(10)).\n       Section 1202(3) of the bill would amend the Pro-Children \n     Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 6081 et seq.) to eliminate references \n     to kindergarten, elementary, and secondary education services \n     from the prohibition against smoking contained in that Act. \n     Proposed new Title IV of the ESEA, as amended by Title IV of \n     the bill, contains a comparable prohibition against smoking \n     in facilities used for education services, and the education \n     references in the Pro-Children Act are no longer necessary.\n     Part B--Repeals\n       Section 1211. Repeals. Section 1211 of the bill would \n     repeal Title XIII of the ESEA, several parts and titles of \n     the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (P.L. 103-227), and Title \n     III of the Education for Economic Security Act (20 U.S.C. \n     3901 et seq.). These provisions have either accomplished \n     their purpose, authorize activities that are more \n     appropriately carried out with State and local resources, or \n     have been incorporated into the ESEA as amended by the bill.\n       Title XIII, Support and Assistance Programs to Improve \n     Education, of the ESEA would be repealed. Proposed new Part D \n     of Title II of the ESEA contains the new ESEA technical \n     assistance and information dissemination programs.\n       In the Goals 2000 statute, Title I, National Education \n     Goals; Title II, National Education Reform Leadership, \n     Standards, and Assessments, Title III, State and Local \n     Education Systemic Improvement; Title IV, Parental \n     Assistance; Title VII, Safe Schools; and Title VIII, \n     Minority-focused Civics Education, would be repealed. Part B, \n     Gun-free Schools, of Title X of the Goals 2000 statute would \n     also be repealed.\n       Next, the Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, \n     and Improvement Act of 1994 (Title IX of P.L. 103-227) would \n     be amended by repealing Part F, Star Schools; Part G, Office \n     of Comprehensive School Health Education; Part H, Field \n     Readers; and Part I, Amendments to the Carl D. Perkins \n     Vocational and Applied Technology Act.\n       Title III, Partnerships in Education for Mathematics, \n     Science, and Engineering, of the Education for Economic \n     Security Act would also be repealed by section 1211 of the \n     bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1181. A bill to appropriate funds to carry out the commodity \nsupplemental food program and the emergency food assistance program \nfiscal year 2000 to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                  commodity supplemental food program\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a bill to increase \nfunding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for Fiscal Year \n2000. I look forward to working with Appropriate Committee members on \nthis and other important matters through the appropriations process.\n  The Commodity Supplemental Food Program does exactly what its name \nsuggests--it provides supplemental foods to states who distribute them \nto low-income postpartum, pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, \nchildren up to age six, as well as senior citizens.\n  People participating in CSFP receive healthy packages of food \nincluding items such as infant formula juice, rice, pasta, and canned \nfruits and vegetables.\n  The Commodity Supplemental Food Program currently operates in twenty \nstates and last year, more than 370,000 people participated in it every \nmonth. There still remains a great need to expand this program, as \nthere is a waiting list of states--including my state of Vermont--who \nwant to participate, but are not able to because of lack of funding. \nThe bill I am introducing would fix this problem, by increasing the \nfunding so that more women, children and seniors in need could \nparticipate. I look forward to working with the Vermont Congressional \ndelegation on this matter.\n  The Commodity Supplemental Food Program has proven itself to be \nvitally important to senior citizens, as 243,000 of the 370,000 people \nwho participate every month are seniors. There continues to be a great \nneed for our seniors in Vermont, and in the rest of the nation.\n  This has been true for sometime, and still is the case. I \nsuccessfully fought efforts a few years ago to terminate the Meals on \nWheels Program. Ending that program would have been a disaster for our \nseniors.\n  According to an evaluation of the Elderly Nutrition Program of the \nOlder Americans Act, approximately 67% to 88% of the participants are \nat moderate to high nutritional risk. It is further estimated that 40% \nof older adults have inappropriate intakes of three or more nutrients \nin their diets. And the results of nutritional programs on the health \nof seniors are amazing--for instance, it was estimated in a report that \nfor every $1 spent on Senior Nutrition Programs, more than $3 is saved \nin hospital costs.\n  This Congress, I have taken a number of steps to address the \nnutritional problems facing our seniors, and have met with some \nsuccess. In response to a budget request that I submitted last year, \nthe Administration increased their funding request for the Elderly \nNutrition Program by $10 million to $150 million for Fiscal year 2000. \nI will continue to work to see that the full $150 million is included \nin the final budget.\n  This past April I also cosponsored the Medicare Medical Nutrition \nTherapy Act, which provides for Medicare coverage of medical nutrition \ntherapy services of registered dietitians and nutrition professionals. \nMedicare coverage of medical nutrition therapy would save money by \nreducing hospital admissions, shortening hospital stays, and decreasing \ncomplications.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this measure \ninto law through the normal appropriations process for fiscal year \n2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1182. A bill to authorize the use of flat grave markers to extend \nthe useful life of the Santa Fe National Cemetery, New Mexico, and to \nallow more veterans the honor and choice of being buried in the \ncemetery; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                 santa fe national cemetery legislation\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and honor that \nI rise today to introduce a bill to extend the useful life of the Santa \nFe National Cemetery in New Mexico.\n  The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces \nhave made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of freedom and \nliberty that make this Nation unique throughout civilization. The \nservice of veterans has been vital to the history of the Nation, and \nthe sacrifices made by veterans and their families should not be \nforgotten.\n  These veterans at the very least deserve every opportunity to be \nburied at a National Cemetery of their choosing. However, unless \nCongressional action is taken the Santa Fe National Cemetery will run \nout of space to provide casketed burials for our veterans at the \nconclusion of 2000.\n  I believe all New Mexicans can be proud of the Santa Fe National \nCemetery that has grown from 39/100 of an acre to its current 77 acres. \nThe cemetery first opened in 1868 and within several years was \ndesignated a National Cemetery in April of 1875.\n  Men and women who have fought in all of nation's wars hold an honored \nspot within the hallowed ground of the cemetery. Today the Santa Fe \nNational Cemetery contains almost 27,000 graves that are mostly marked \nby upright headstones.\n  However, as I have already stated, unless Congress acts the Santa Fe \nNational Cemetery will be forced to close. The Bill I am introducing \ntoday allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for the use \nof flat grave markers that will extend the useful life of the cemetery \nuntil 2008.\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\n  While I wish the practice of utilizing headstones could continue \nindefinitely if a veteran chose, my wishes are outweighed by my desire \nto extend the useful life of the cemetery. I would note that my desire \nis shared by the New Mexico Chapter of the American Legion, the \nAlbuquerque Chapter of the Retired Officers' Association, and the New \nMexico Chapter of the VFW who have all endorsed the use of flat grave \nmarkers.\n  Finally, this is not without precedent because exceptions to the law \nhave been granted on six prior occasions with the most recent action \noccurring in 1994 when Congress authorized the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to provide for flat grave markers at the Willamette National \nCemetery in Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Bill and \nfour letters of support for the use of flat grave markers be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO USE FLAT GRAVE MARKERS AT SANTA FE \n                   NATIONAL CEMETERY, NEW MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The men and women who have served in the Armed Forces \n     have made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of \n     freedom and liberty that make this Nation unique in all \n     civilization.\n       (2) The service of veterans has been vital to the history \n     of the Nation, and the sacrifices made by veterans and their \n     families should not be forgotten.\n       (3) These veterans at the very least deserve every \n     opportunity to be buried in a National Cemetery of their \n     choosing.\n       (4) The Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico opened in \n     1868 and was designated a National Cemetery in April 1875.\n       (5) The Santa Fe National Cemetery now has 77 acres with \n     almost 27,000 graves most of which are are marked by upright \n     headstones.\n       (6) The Santa Fe National Cemetery will run out of space to \n     provide for casketed burials at the end of 2000 unless \n     Congress acts to allow the use of flat grave markers to \n     extend the useful life of the cemetery until 2008.\n       (b) Authority.--Notwithstanding section 2404(c)(2) of title \n     38, United States Code, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may \n     provide for flat grave markers at the Santa Fe National \n     Cemetery, New Mexico.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                                     Department of New Mexico,\n\n                                  Albuquerque, NM, March 31, 1997.\n     Mr. Gil Gallo,\n     Director, Santa Fe National Cemetery,\n     Santa Fe, NM.\n       Dear Mr. Gallo: The American Legion has discussed your \n     proposal on having a section of flat cemetery markers at the \n     National Cemetery, which would decrease the size of the \n     individual plots; therefore making more room for our \n     veterans, at the National Cemetery.\n       We are in complete agreement and in support of this \n     venture. If we can be of assistance in any way, please \n     advise.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harry C.

Please be advised that I took \n     the liberty to circulate the information to VFW Post \n     Commanders located in Northern New Mexico. The following is \n     our consensus.\n       Although we would want to continue with the upright marble \n     headstones which are provided with the 5x10 grave site, we \n     found it more important to extend the life of the National \n     Cemetery therefore we support your efforts to utilize the \n     granite markers and the recommended 4x8 grave sites. We are \n     also in agreement with your recommendations for a columbarium \n     for the burial of our cremated Comrades.\n       Please thank your staff for the outstanding work and \n     service which they provide our departed Comrades and \n     Veterans. Let me also thank you for providing us with the \n     specific information needed to come to our decision.\n       As State Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the \n     United States of America Department of New Mexico I pledge \n     our full support of your recommendation and would ask that \n     you forward this letter of support to your Washington Office.\n       May God Bless America and our men and women who served and \n     serve in our military armed forces.\n           Yours in comradeship,\n                                                  Robert O.

D'Arco,\n     Director, New Mexico Veterans\n     Services Commission\n     Santa Fe, NM.\n       Dear Mr. D'Arco. I know that you are completing your study \n     on the issue of veterans cemeteries in New Mexico. Following \n     is information on the Santa Fe National Cemetery.\n       There is approximately a three-year inventory of casketed \n     sites readily available for immediate use in the recently \n     developed sections of the cemetery, sections 10, 11, and 12. \n     If no other casketed sites are developed, then we would \n     exhaust this inventory in 2001.\n       Based on our understanding that future flat marker \n     gravesite sections on the east side of the cemetery are \n     acceptable to veterans and the neighboring community, an \n     additional seven-year inventory of sites can be developed in \n     that portion of the cemetery. This would extend the useful \n     life of the cemetery for casketed burials to the year 2008. \n     While this is just a general estimate, and exact details will \n     not be available until a more formal design is completed, we \n     anticipate developing and using these sites. Accordingly, the \n     2008 date is the date to use in your study for casketed \n     gravesite closure of the Santa Fe National Cemetery.\n       It is important to note that we anticipate being able to \n     provide for inground cremation service well beyond the year \n     2030. Consideration will also be given toward columbarium \n     development.\n       Incidentally, we are estimating Fort Bayard National \n     Cemetery's closure date as 2027, but we are optimistic that \n     potential exists beyond that date. I hope this information is \n     useful to you. If you have any questions, please contact me \n     or Roger R. Rapp on my staff at 202-273-5225.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Jerry W. Bowen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 1183. A bill to direct the Secretary of Energy to convey to the \ncity of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, the former site of the NIPER facility \nof the Department of Energy; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                           niper legislation\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill transfer ownership of land owned by the Department of Energy (DOE) \nand known as the National Institute of Petroleum Energy Research \n(NIPER) to the City of Bartlesville for business and educational \npurposes.\n  The NIPER facility was originally established in 1918 as the \nPetroleum Experiment Station by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Its purpose \nwas to provide research targeted to oil and gas field problems. In \n1936, as World War II approached, additions to the Work Project \nAdministration building were erected. Its research was expanded to help \nthe war effort. During the 1973-1974 energy crisis, the center was \nrenamed the Bartlesville Energy Research Center. When the Center \nprivatized in 1983, it was renamed the National Institute for Petroleum \nand Energy Research (NIPER). NIPER closed its operations on December \n22, 1998.\n  According to the Surplus Property Act of 1949, excess federal \nproperty is screened for use by the following: Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Health and Human Services, and local and state \norganizations including non-profit organizations. At the conclusion of \nthe screening process, a negotiated sale is conducted. If the property \nis still undeclared it goes to auction.\n  Unfortunately this process can take many years, thus preventing the \ncity of Bartlesville from realizing any near-term economic boost from \nNIPER's redevelopment. Consequently, this legislation is needed to \nensure that the NIPER facilities are redeveloped as quickly as possible \nin order to provide a prompt economic boost to the community. This \nlegislation also will ensure that the NIPER facilities do not \ndeteriorate while the property is being\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\nprocessed through the lengthy steps of the Surplus Property Act and \ntherefore make re-use impossible.\n  The City of Bartlesville intends to provide an educational facility \nand a place for business and industry that would facilitate job \ncreation through technology and investment. The NIPER facility will \nalso provide housing for administrative services for community \ndevelopment organization such as United Way, Women and Children in \nCrisis, and various homeless programs. This project enjoys the strong \nsupport of the Mayor of Bartlesville and other locally elected \nofficials.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1184. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to dispose \nof land for recreation or other public purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             national forest system community purposes act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important \nlegislation, cosponsored by Senator Kyl, that would allow the Forest \nService to convey parcels of land to States and local governments, on \nthe condition that it be used for a specific recreational or local \npublic purpose. The National Forest System Community Purposes Act is \npatterned after an existing law that set in place one of the most \nsuccessful local community assistance programs under the Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM).\n  That law, the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, was enacted in \n1926. Under its authority, the BLM has been able to work cooperatively \nwith States and communities to provide land needed for recreational \nareas and other public projects to benefit local communities in areas \nwhere Federal land dominates the landscape. With skyrocketing demands \non the Forest Service and local communities to provide accommodations \nand other services for an ever-increasing number of Americans who take \nadvantage of all the opportunities available in the national forests, I \nbelieve the time has come to provide this ability to the Forest \nService.\n  In the 1996 Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act, there were \nno fewer than 31 boundary adjustments, land conveyances, and exchanges \nauthorized, many of which dealt with national forests. Had this \nlegislation been enacted at that time, I cannot say for sure how many \nof these provisions would have been unnecessary, but I expect the \nnumber would have been reduced by at least one-third.\n  During the 105th Congress, I sponsored three bills that directed the \nSecretary of Agriculture to convey small tracts Forest Service land to \ncommunities in New Mexico. All three bills were subsequently passed in \nthe Senate unanimously, but two of these bills were not enacted last \nyear, and the Senate has once again seen fit to pass them in the 106th \nCongress. We now await action in the House. I know that other Senators \nare faced with a similar situation of having to shepherd bills through \nthe legislative process simply to give the Forest Service the authority \nto cooperate with local communities on projects to meet local needs.\n  Over one-third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal \ngovernment, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and \neducational purposes can be difficult. Communities adjacent to and \nsurrounded by National Forest System land have limited opportunities to \nacquire land for certain recreational and other local public purposes. \nIn many cases, these recreational and other local needs are not within \nthe mission of the Forest Service, but would not be inconsistent with \nforest plans developed for the adjacent national forest. To compound \nthe problem, small communities are often unable to acquire land due to \nits extremely high market value resulting from the predominance of \nFederal land in the local area.\n  The subject of one of the bills I just alluded to provides an \nexcellent example of the problem. That bill provided for a one-acre \nconveyance to the Village of Jemez Springs, New Mexico. The land is to \nbe used for a desperately needed fire substation, which will obviously \nbenefit public safety for the local community. Since over 70 percent of \nthe emergency calls in this particular community are for assistance on \nthe Santa Fe National Forest, however, the Forest Service would also \nbenefit greatly from this new station.\n  In fairness, the Forest Service was very willing to sell this land to \nthe village, but they were constrained by current law to charge the \nappraised fair market value. Herein lies the biggest problem for small \ncommunities like Jemez Springs. In this case, the appraised value of an \nacre of land along the highway, obviously necessary for this kind of a \nfacility, was estimated to be around $50,000. Combined with the cost of \nbuilding the station itself, this additional cost put the project out \nof reach of the community's 400 residents.\n  Through this example, it is clear to see that both the national \nforests and adjacent communities could mutually benefit from a process \nsimilar to that under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. This \nprogram has worked so well for the BLM over the years, I see no reason \nfor the Forest Service not to have the same kind of authority.\n  The National Forest System Community Purposes Act would give the \nSecretary of Agriculture the authority to convey or lease parcels of \nForest Service land to States, counties, or other incorporated \ncommunities at a cost that could be less than fair market value. In \norder to obtain the land, the State or community would develop a plan \nof use that would be subject to Forest Service approval.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I think the time has come for this \nlegislation. In fact, during a recent discussion I had with Forest \nService Chief Dombeck, he was somewhat surprised to learn that the \nagency did not already have this authority. I would urge the Senate to \nprovide this needed assistance to local communities around the country.\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Lott, Mr. Bond, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. \n        Coverdell, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Burns, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Mack, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Craig, Mr. Hutchinson,  and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1185. A bill to provide small business certain protections from \nlitigation excesses and to limit the product liability of non-\nmanufacturer product sellers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            the small business liability reform act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Liability Reform Act of 1999, legislation that will provide \ntargeted relief to small businesses nationwide.\n  Small businesses in Michigan and across this nation are faced with a \ndaily threat of burdensome litigation, a circumstance which has created \na desperate need for relief from unwarranted and costly lawsuits. While \nother sectors of our society and our economy also need relief from \nlitigation excesses, small businesses by their very nature are \nparticularly vulnerable to lawsuit abuse, and find it particularly \ndifficult to bear the high cost of defending themselves against \nunjustified and unfair litigation.\n  Small businesses represent the engine of our growing economy and \nprovide countless benefits to communities across America. The Research \nInstitute for Small and Emerging Business, for example, has estimated \nthat there are over 20 million small businesses in America, and that \nthese small businesses generate 50 percent of our country's private \nsector output.\n  My small business constituents relate story after story describing \nthe constraints, limitations and fear posed by the very real threat of \nabusive and unwarranted litigation. The real world impact translates \ninto high-cost liability insurance, which wastes resources that could \ninstead be used to expand small businesses, to provide more jobs, or to \noffer more benefits to employees. According to a recent Gallup survey, \none out of every five small businesses decides not to hire more \nemployees, expand its business, introduce a new product, or improve an \nexisting product because of the fear of lawsuits--not entrepeneurial \nrisk, not lack of capital resources, but lawsuits.\n  In the same vein, innocent product sellers--often small businesses \nlike your neighborhood corner grocery\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\nstore--have also described the high legal costs they incur when they \nare needlessly drawn into product liability lawsuits. The unfairness in \nthese cases is astonishing--the business may not even produce a \nproduct, but is still sued for product defects. The reason? It is no \nsecret that courts differ in how favorably they look upon product \nliability suits--some are receptive, others outright hostile. So even \nthough a local store neither designs nor manufactures the product, it \nis routinely dragged into court because the plaintiff's attorney \ndesires to pull manufacturers into a favorable forum. That's called \n``forum shopping'' on the part of the plaintiff, and the practice \ncauses needless financial damage to America's small businesses. And \nwhile the non-culpable product seller is rarely found liable for \ndamages, it must still bear the enormous cost of defending itself \nagainst these unwarranted suits. Rental and leasing companies are in a \nsimilarly vulnerable position, as they are commonly held liable for the \nwrongful conduct of their customers even though the companies \nthemselves are found to have committed no wrong.\n  The 105th Congress passed the Volunteer Protection Act, which \nprovides specific protections from abusive litigation to volunteers. \nThe Senate passed that legislation by an overwhelming margin of 99-1, \nand the President signed it, making it Public Law 105-19. That \nlegislation provides a model for further targeted reforms for sectors \nof our economy that are particularly hard hit and in need of immediate \nrelief. I believe it is high time for small business liability reform, \ntime to take this small step, time to shield those not at fault from \nneedless expense and unwarranted distress.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment and provide a little \nbackground on our effort, as I believe it will highlight the desperate \nneed for reform. Small businesses shoulder an often unbearable load \nfrom unwarranted and unjustified lawsuits. Data from San Diego's \nSuperior Court published by the Washington Legal Foundation reveals \nthat punitive damages are requested in 41 percent of suits against \nsmall businesses. It is simply unfathomable that such a large \nproportion of our small businesses could be engaging in the sort of \negregious misconduct that would warrant a claim of punitive damages. \nSimilarly, the National Federal of Independent Business reports that 34 \npercent of Texas small business owners are sued or threatened with \ncourt action seeking punitive damages; again, the outrageously high \nrate of prayer for punitive damages simply cannot have anything to do \nwith actual wrongdoing by the defendant.\n  The specifics of the cases are no better. In a case reported by the \nAmerican Consulting Engineers Council, a drunk driver had an accident \nafter speeding and bypassing detour signs. Eight hours after the crash, \nthe driver still had a blood alcohol level of .09. Nonetheless, the \ndriver sued the engineering firm that designed the road, the \ncontractor, the subcontractor, and the state highway department. Five \nyears later, and after expending exorbitant amounts on legal fees, the \ndefendants settled the case for $35,000. The engineering firm, a small \n15 person firm, was swamped with over $200,000 in legal costs--an \nintolerable amount for a small business to have to pay in defending an \nunwarranted lawsuit.\n  There are more examples. An Ann Landers column from October, 1995, \nreported a case in which a minister and his wife sued a guide-dog \nschool for $160,000 after a blind man who was learning to use a seeing-\neye dog stepped on the minister's wife's toes in a shopping mall. The \nguide-dog school, Southeastern Guide Dogs, Inc., which provided the \ninstructor supervising the man, was the only school of its kind in the \nsoutheast. It trains seeing-eye dogs at no cost to the visually \nimpaired. The couple filed their lawsuit 13 months after the so-called \naccident, in which witnesses reported that the woman did not move out \nof the blind man's way because she wanted to see if the dog would walk \naround her.\n  The experience of a small business in Michigan, the Michigan Furnace \nCompany, is likewise alarming. The President of that company has \nreported that every lawsuit in the history of her company has been a \nnuisance lawsuit. She indicates that if the money the company spends on \nliability insurance and legal fees were distributed among employees, it \nwould amount to a $10,000 annual raise. That's real money, and that's a \nreal cost coming right out of the pocket of Michigan workers.\n  These costs are stifling our small businesses and the careers of \npeople in their employ. The straightforward provisions of Title I of \nthe Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act will provide small \nbusinesses with relief by discouraging abusive litigation. This section \ncontains two principal reforms.\n  First, the bill limits punitive damages that may be awarded against a \nsmall business. In most civil lawsuits against small businesses, \npunitive damages would be available against the small business only if \nthe claimant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the harm was \ncaused by the small business through at least a conscious, fragrant \nindifference to the rights and safety of the claimant. Punitive damages \nwould also be limited in amount to the lesser of $250,000 or two times \nthe compensatory damages awarded for the harm. That formulation is \nexactly the same as that in the small business protection provision \nthat was included in the Product Liability Conference Report passed in \nthe 104th Congress.\n  Second, joint and several liability reforms for small businesses are \nincluded under the exact same formulation used in the Volunteer \nProtection Act passed in the 105th Congress and in the Protection \nLiability Conference Report passed in the 104th Congress. Joint and \nseveral liability would be limited such that a small business would be \nliable for noneconomic damages only in proportion to the small \nbusiness's responsibility for causing the harm. If a small business is \nresponsible for 100 percent of an accident, then it will be liable for \n100 percent of noneconomic damages. But if it is only 70 percent, 25 \npercent, 10 percent or any other percent responsible, then the small \nbusiness will be liable only for a like percentage of noneconomic \ndamages.\n  Small businesses would still be jointly and severally liable for \neconomic damages, and any other defendants in the action that were not \nsmall businesses could be held jointly and severally liable for all \ndamages. But the intent of this provision is to provide some protection \nto small businesses, so that they will not be sought out as ``deep \npocket'' defendants by trail lawyers who would otherwise try to get \nsmall businesses on the hook for harms that they have not caused. The \nfact is that many small businesses simply do not have deep pockets, and \nthey frequently need all of their resources just to stay in business, \ntake care of their employees, and make ends meet.\n  Other provisions in this title specify the situations in which its \nreforms apply. The title defines small business as any business having \nfewer than 25 employees, the same definition included in the Product \nLiability Conference Report. Like the Volunteer Protection Act, this \ntitle covers all civil lawsuits except those involving certain types of \negregious misconduct. The limitations on liability would not apply to \nany misconduct that constitutes a crime of violence, act of \ninternational terrorism, hate crime, sexual offense, civil rights law \nviolation, or natural resource damages, or damages that occurred while \nthe defendant was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or any \ndrug. Any finally, like the Volunteer Protection Act, this title \nincludes a State opt-out. A State would be able to opt out of \nthese provisions provided that the State enacts a law indicating its \nelection to do so and containing no other provisions. I do not expect \nthat any State will opt-out of these provisions, but I feel it is \nimportant to include one out of respect for principles of federalism.\n\n  Title II of the Act addresses liability reform for non-culpable \nproduct sellers, commonly small businesses, who have long sought help \nin gaining a degree of protection from unwarranted lawsuits. Product \nsellers, like your corner grocery store, provide a crucial service to \nall of us by offering a convenient source for a wide assortment of \ngoods. Unfortunately, current law subjects them to harassment and \nunnecessary litigation; in about twenty-nine states, product sellers \nare drawn into the overwhelming majority of product liability cases \neven though they play\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\nno part in the designing and manufacturing process, and are not to \nblame in any way for the harm. It is pointless to haul a product seller \ninto the litigation when everyone in the system knows that the seller \nis not at fault. Dragging in the neighborhood convenience store helps \nno one, not the claimant, not the product seller, and certainly not the \nconsumer. All it does is increase the cost to product sellers of doing \nbusiness in our neighborhoods, because these businesses are \nunnecessarily forced to bear the cost of court expenses in their \ndefense.\n  Again, the real-world background presents a compelling case. In one \ninstance, a product seller was dragged into a product liability suit \neven though the product it sold was shipped directly from the \nmanufacturer to the plaintiff. In the end, the manufacturer--not the \nproduct seller--had to pay compensation to the plaintiff. \nUnfortunately, this was after the product seller has been forced to \nspend $25,000 in court expenses $25,000 that could have been used to \nexpand the business or to provide higher salaries.\n  Title II would allow a plaintiff to sue a product seller only when \nthe product seller is responsible for the harm or when the plaintiff \ncannot collect from the manufacturer. This limitation would cover all \nproduct liability actions brought in any Federal or State Court. \nHowever, we have specifically ensured that the provision does not apply \nto actions brought for certain commercial losses, and actions brought \nunder a theory of dram-shop or third party liability arising out of the \nsale of alcoholic products to intoxicated persons or minors.\n  Additionally, rental or leasing companies are often unfairly \nsubjected to lawsuits based on vicarious liability, which holds these \ncompanies responsible for acts committed by an individual rentee or \nlessee. In several states, these companies are subject to liability for \nthe negligent tortious acts of their customers even if the rental \ncompany is not negligent and the product is not deffective. This type \nof fault-ignorant liability is detrimental to the economy because it \nincreases non-culpable companies' costs, costs which are ultimately \npassed along to the rental customers.\n  Settlements and judgements from vicarious liability claims against \nauto rental companies cost the industry approximately $100 million \nannually. In Michigan, for example, a renter lost control of a car and \ndrove off the highway. The care flipped over several times, killing a \npassenger who was not wearing a seat belt. The car rental company, \nwhich was not at fault, nevertheless settled for $1.226 million out of \nfear of being held vicariously liable for the passenger's death.\n  In another case, four British sailors rented a car from Alamo to \ndrive from Fort Lauderdale to Naples. The driver fell asleep at the \nwheel, and his car left the road and ended up in a canal. The driver \nand two passengers were killed, while the fourth passenger was \nseriously injured. Although the Court found Alamo not to have acted \nnegligently, Alamo was ordered by a jury to pay the plaintiffs $7.7 \nmillion solely due to Alamo's ownership of the vehicle.\n  Often even when the injured party and the driver are both at fault, \nit is the innocent rental company that has to bear the resulting \nexpenses. For example, an individual in a rented auto struck a \npedestrian at an intersection in a suburban commercial area on Long \nIsland. The pedestrian, who was intoxicated, was jay-walking on her way \nfrom one bar to another. The driver was also intoxicated. The \npedestrian unfortunately sustained a traumatic brain injury and was \nleft in a permanent vegetative state. Although the auto rental company \nwas clearly not at fault in this case, the result is predictable: the \nrental company was forced to settle for $8.5 million out of fear of a \nmuch larger jury award.\n  We believe that subjecting product renters and lessors to vicarious \nliability is not only unfair, but also increases the cost to all \nconsumers. Title II resolves this problem by providing that product \nrenters and lessors shall not be liable for the wrongful acts of \nanother solely by reason of product ownership--product renters and \nlessors would only be responsible for their own acts.\n  I am pleased to have Senators Lieberman, Hatch, McCain, McConnell, \nLott, Bond, Ashcroft, Coverdell. Nickles, Brownback, Gorton, Grassley, \nSessions, Burns, Inhofe, Helms, Allard, Hagel, Mack, Bunning, Jeffords, \nDeWine, Craig, Hutchison, and Enzi as original cosponsors of the \nlegislation and very much appreciate their support for our small \nbusinesses and for meaningful litigation reform. The list of business \norganizations supporting this bill is also impressive, and includes the \nfollowing: National Federation of Independent Business, the National \nRestaurant Association, The National Association of Wholesalers, The \nNational Retail Federation, The American Auto Leasing Association, The \nAmerican Consulting Engineers Council, The Small Business Legislative \nCouncil, National Small Business United, The National Association of \nConvenience Stores. The American Car Rental Association, The \nInternational Mass Retail Association, the Associated Builders and \nContractors, and the National Equipment Leasing Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States civil justice system is inefficient, \n     unpredictable, unfair, costly, and impedes competitiveness in \n     the marketplace for goods, services, business, and employees;\n       (2) the defects in the civil justice system have a direct \n     and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by decreasing \n     the availability of goods and services in commerce;\n       (3) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and \n     fairness to the legal system;\n       (4) the spiralling costs of litigation and the magnitude \n     and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and \n     noneconomic damage awards have continued unabated for at \n     least the past 30 years;\n       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n     that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the \n     award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate \n     interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence \n     of unlawful conduct;\n       (6) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly \n     excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some \n     circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the \n     doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that \n     party did not cause;\n       (7) as a result of joint and several liability, entities \n     including small businesses are often brought into litigation \n     despite the fact that their conduct may have little or \n     nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to \n     the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust \n     costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and \n     disproportionate damage awards;\n       (8) the costs imposed by the civil justice system on small \n     businesses are particularly acute, since small businesses \n     often lack the resources to bear those costs and to challenge \n     unwarranted lawsuits;\n       (9) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n     costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing \n     insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their \n     activities;\n       (10) liability reform for small businesses will promote the \n     free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate \n     commerce, and decrease litigiousness; and\n       (11) legislation to address these concerns is an \n     appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses \n     3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\n     article I of the Constitution of the United States, and the \n     14 amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 102.

LIMITATION ON SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC \n                   LOSS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in section 105, in \n     any civil action against a small business, the liability of \n     each defendant that is a small business, or the agent of a \n     small business, for noneconomic loss shall be determined in \n     accordance with subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--In any civil action described in \n     subsection (a)--\n       (A) each defendant described in that subsection shall be \n     liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to \n     that defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant (determined in accordance \n     with paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect \n     to which the defendant is liable; and\n       (B) the court shall render a separate judgment against each \n     defendant described in that subsection in an amount \n     determined under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     determine the percentage of responsibility of each person \n     responsible for the harm to the claimant, regardless of \n     whether or not the person is a party to the action.\n\n     SEC. 105. EXCEPTIONS TO LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.\n\n       The limitations on liability under sections 103 and 104 do \n     not apply to any misconduct of a defendant--\n       (1) that constitutes--\n       (A) a crime of violence;\n       (B) an act of international terrorism; or\n       (C) a hate crime;\n       (2) that results in liability for damages relating to the \n     injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of, \n     natural resources described in--\n       (A) section 1002(b)(2)(A) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 \n     (33 U.S.C. 2702(b)(2)(A)); or\n       (B) section 107(a)(4)(C) of the Comprehensive Environmental \n     Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. \n     9607(a)(4)(C));\n       (3) that involves--\n       (A) a sexual offense, as defined by applicable State law; \n     or\n       (B) a violation of a Federal or State civil rights law; or\n       (4) if the defendant was under the influence (as determined \n     under applicable State law) of intoxicating alcohol or a drug \n     at the time of the misconduct, and the fact that the \n     defendant was under the influence was the cause of any harm \n     alleged by the plaintiff in the subject action.\n\n     SEC. 106. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--Subject to subsection (b), this title \n     preempts the laws of any State to the extent that State laws \n     are inconsistent with this title, except that this title \n     shall not preempt any State law that provides additional \n     protections from liability for small businesses.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This \n     title does not apply to any action in a State court against a \n     small business in which all parties are citizens of the \n     State, if the State enacts a statute--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this title \n     does not apply as of a date certain to such actions in the \n     State; and\n       (3) containing no other provision.\n\n     SEC. 107.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) although damage awards in product liability actions may \n     encourage the production of safer products, they may also \n     have a direct effect on interstate commerce and consumers of \n     the United States by increasing the cost of, and decreasing \n     the availability of products;\n       (2) some of the rules of law governing product liability \n     actions are inconsistent within and among the States, \n     resulting in differences in State laws that may be \n     inequitable with respect to plaintiffs and defendants and may \n     impose burdens on interstate commerce;\n       (3) product liability awards may jeopardize the financial \n     well-being of individuals and industries, particularly the \n     small businesses of the United States;\n       (4) because the product lability laws of a State may have \n     adverse effects on consumers and businesses in many other \n     States, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to enact \n     national, uniform product liability laws that preempt State \n     laws; and\n       (5) under clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United \n     States Constitution, it is the constitutional role of the \n     Federal Government to remove barriers to interstate commerce.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act, based on the \n     powers of the United States under clause 3 of section 8 of \n     article I of the United States Constitution, are to promote \n     the free flow of goods and services and lessen the burdens on \n     interstate commerce, by--\n       (1) establishing certain uniform legal principles of \n     product liability that provide a fair balance among the \n     interests of all parties in the chain of production, \n     distribution, and use of products; and\n       (2) reducing the unacceptable costs and delays in product \n     liability actions caused by excessive litigation that harms \n     both plaintiffs and defendants.\n\n     SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Alcohol product.--The term ``alcohol product'' includes \n     any product that contains not less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of \n     alcohol by volume and is intended for human consumption.\n       (2) Claimant.--The term ``claimant'' means any person who \n     brings an action covered by this title and any person on \n     whose behalf such an action is brought.

LIABILITY RULES APPLICABLE TO PRODUCT SELLERS, \n                   RENTERS, AND LESSORS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--\n       (1) In general.--In any product liability action covered \n     under this Act, a product seller other than a manufacturer \n     shall be liable to a claimant only if the claimant \n     establishes that--\n       (A)(i) the product that allegedly caused the harm that is \n     the subject of the complaint was sold, rented, or leased by \n     the product seller;\n       (ii) the product seller failed to exercise reasonable care \n     with respect to the product; and\n       (iii) the failure to exercise reasonable care was a \n     proximate cause of the harm to the claimant;\n       (B)(i) the product seller made an express warranty \n     applicable to the product that allegedly caused the harm that \n     is the subject of the complaint, independent of any express \n     warranty made by a manufacturer as to the same product;\n       (ii) the product failed to conform to the warranty; and\n       (iii) the failure of the product to conform to the warranty \n     caused the harm to the claimant; or\n       (C)(i) the product seller engaged in intentional \n     wrongdoing, as determined under applicable State law; and\n       (ii) the intentional wrongdoing caused the harm that is the \n     subject of the complaint.\n       (2) Reasonable opportunity for inspection.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (1)(A)(ii), a product seller shall not be \n     considered to have failed to exercise reasonable care with \n     respect to a product based upon an alleged failure to inspect \n     the product, if--\n       (A) the failure occurred because there was no reasonable \n     opportunity to inspect the product; or\n       (B) the inspection, in the exercise of reasonable care, \n     would not have revealed the aspect of the product that \n     allegedly caused the claimant's harm.\n       (b) Special Rule.--\n       (1) In general.--A product seller shall be deemed to be \n     liable as a manufacturer of a product for harm caused by the \n     product, if--\n       (A) the manufacturer is not subject to service of process \n     under the laws of any State in which the action may be \n     brought; or\n       (B) the court determines that the claimant is or would be \n     unable to enforce a judgment against the manufacturer.\n       (2) Statute of limitations.--For purposes of this \n     subsection only, the statute of limitations applicable to \n     claims asserting liability of a product seller as a \n     manufacturer shall be tolled from the date of the filing of a \n     complaint against the manufacturer to the date that judgment \n     is entered against the manufacturer.\n       (c) Rented or Leased Products.--\n       (1) Definition.--For purposes of paragraph (2), and for \n     determining the applicability of\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\n     this title to any person subject to that paragraph, the term \n     ``product liability action'' means a civil action brought on \n     any theory for harm caused by a product or product use.\n       (2) Liability.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     any person engaged in the business of renting or leasing a \n     product (other than a person excluded from the definition of \n     product seller under section 202(13)(B)) shall be subject to \n     liability in a product liability action under subsection (a), \n     but any person engaged in the business of renting or leasing \n     a product shall not be liable to a claimant for the tortious \n     act of another solely by reason of ownership of that product.\n\n     SEC. 205.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall apply with respect to any action commenced \n     on or after the date of enactment of this Act without regard \n     to whether the harm that is the subject of the action or the \n     conduct that caused the harm occurred before that date of \n     enactment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  The Small Business Liability Reform Act of 1999--Section-By-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n       A bill to offer small businesses and product sellers \n     certain protections from litigation excesses.\n\n\n            Title I: Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection\n\n     Section 101: Findings\n       This section sets out congressional findings concerning the \n     litigation excesses facing small businesses, and the need for \n     litigation reforms to provide certain protections to small \n     businesses from abusive litigation.\n     Section 102: Definitions\n       Various terms used in this title are defined in this \n     section. Significantly, for purposes of the legislation, a \n     small business is defined as any business or organization \n     with fewer than 25 full time employees.\n     Section 103: Limitation on punitive damages for small \n         businesses\n       This section provides that punitive damages may, to the \n     extent permitted by applicable State law, be awarded against \n     a defendant that is a small business only if the claimant \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that conduct \n     carried out by that defendant with a conscious, flagrant \n     indifference to the rights or safety of others was the \n     proximate cause of the harm that is the subject of the \n     action.\n       This section also limits the amount of punitive damages \n     that may be awarded against a small business. In any civil \n     action against a small business, punitive damages may not \n     exceed the lesser of two times the amount awarded to the \n     claimant for economic and noneconomic losses, or $250,000.\n     Section 104: Limitation on several liability for noneconomic \n         loss for small business\n       This section provides that, in any civil action against a \n     small business, for each defendant that is a small business, \n     the liability of that defendant for noneconomic loss will be \n     in proportion to that defendant's responsibility for causing \n     the harm. Those defendants would continue, however, to be \n     held jointly and severally liable for economic loss. In \n     addition, any other defendants in the action that are not \n     small businesses would continue to be held jointly and \n     severally liable for both economic and noneconomic loss.\n     Section 105: Exceptions to limitations on liability\n       The limitations on liability included in this title would \n     not apply to any misconduct that constitutes a crime of \n     violence, act of international terrorism, hate crime, sexual \n     offense, civil rights law violation, or natural resource \n     damages, or which occurred while the defendant was under the \n     influence of intoxicating alcohol or any drug.\n     Section 106: Preemption and election of State \n         nonapplicability\n       This title preempts State laws to the extent that any such \n     laws are inconsistent with it, but it does not preempt any \n     State law that provides additional protections from liability \n     to small businesses. The title also includes an opt-out \n     provision for the States. A State may opt out of the \n     provisions of the title for any action in State court against \n     a small business in which all parties are citizens of the \n     State. In order to opt out, the State would have to enact a \n     statute citing the authority in this section, declaring the \n     election of the State to opt, and containing no other \n     provisions.\n     Section 107: Effective date\n       This title would take effect 90 days after the date of \n     enactment, and would apply to claims filed on or after the \n     effective date.\n\n\n                Title II: Product Seller Fair Treatment\n\n     Section 201: Findings\n       This section sets out congressional findings concerning the \n     effect of damage awards in product liability actions on \n     interstate commerce, the present inequities resulting from \n     inconsistent product liability laws within and among the \n     States, and the need for national, uniform federal product \n     liability laws.\n     Section 202: Definitions\n       Various terms and phrases used in this title are defined.\n     Section 203: Applicability; preemption\n       This title applies to any product liability action brought \n     in any Federal or State court. Civil actions for commercial \n     loss; negligent entrustment; negligence per se concerning \n     firearms and ammunition; and civil actions for dram shop \n     liability are excluded from the applicability of this title.\n       This section further establishes that the preemption of \n     state law by this title is congruent with coverage, and the \n     limit of the preemptive scope of this title is detailed.\n     Section 204: Liability rules applicable to product sellers, \n         renters and lessors\n       Product sellers other than the manufacturer (wholesaler-\n     distributors and retailers, for example) may be held liable \n     only if they are directly at fault for a harm; if the harm \n     was caused by the failure of the product to conform to the \n     product seller's own, independent express warranty; or if \n     harm was the result of the product seller's intentional \n     wrongdoing.\n       Product sellers shall ``stand in the shoes'' of a culpable \n     manufacturer when the manufacturer is ``judgement-proof.'' \n     The statute of limitations in such cases is tolled.\n       Finally, product renters and lessors shall not be liable \n     for the tortuous acts of another solely by reason of product \n     ownership.\n     Section 205: Federal cause of action precluded\n       This title does not create Federal district court \n     jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 1331 or 1337 of Title 28, \n     United States Code.\n     Section 206: Effective date\n       This title shall apply to any action commenced on or after \n     the date of enactment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            NAW Endorses Abraham-Lieberman Legal Reform Bill\n\n\n         Legislation Would Reduce Unnecessary Litigation; Costs\n\n       Washington, D.C.--The National Association of Wholesaler-\n     Distributors (NAW) today gave its ``enthusiastic and \n     wholehearted support'' to the Small Business Liability Reform \n     Act of 1999, which would significantly reduce the exposure of \n     wholesaler-distributors and retailers to unwarranted product \n     liability lawsuits and legal costs.\n       The legislation, introduced in the U.S. Senate today by \n     Senators Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), \n     would eliminate joint (``deep pockets'') liability for \n     ``noneconomic loss'' and limit punitive damage awards to \n     $250,000 for employers with fewer than 25 full-time employees \n     that become defendants in civil lawsuits. Neither of these \n     provisions would apply to lawsuits involving certain \n     egregious misconduct, and states would be able to opt-out by \n     statute.\n       In product liability lawsuits, the bill would limit the \n     liability of non-manufacturer product sellers such as \n     wholesaler-distributors, retailers, lessors and renters to \n     harms caused by their own negligence or intentional \n     wrongdoing, the product's breech of the seller's own express \n     warranty, and for the product manufacturer's responsibility \n     when the manufacturer is judgment-proof.\n       ``The product liability laws of a majority of states do not \n     make the distinction between the differing roles of \n     manufacturers and non-manufacturer product sellers. As a \n     result, blameless wholesaler-distributors are routinely \n     joined in product liability lawsuits simply because they are \n     in the product's chain of distribution,'' explained George \n     Keeley, NAW general counsel and senior partner in the firm of \n     Keeley, Kuenn & Reid. ``In the end, the staggering legal fees \n     which cost the seller dearly do not benefit the claimant in \n     any way. These costs will be significantly reduced if the \n     Abraham-Lieberman bill is enacted.''\n       ``For too long, wholesaler-distributors have been among the \n     victims of a product liability system that serves the \n     interests of trial lawyers very well, at everyone else's \n     expense,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, NAW's president. ``For \n     nearly two decades, NAW has vigorously advocated Federal \n     legislation to rein-in these abuses. Enactment of the Small \n     Business Liability Reform Act of 1999 is at the very top of \n     our agenda for the 106th Congress and I commend Senators \n     Abraham and Lieberman for their continuing, tireless \n     leadership of this important effort.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 NFIB Backs New Legal Reform Initiative\n\n       Washington, D.C.--The National Federation of Independent \n     Business (NFIB) will champion a new legal reform proposal \n     that aims to protect small-business owners from frivolous \n     lawsuits and the threat of being ``stuck with the whole tab'' \n     for damage awards arising from incidents in which they were \n     only ``bit players.''\n       The nation's leading small-business advocacy group, NFIB \n     hailed today's introduction of the Small Business Liability \n     Reform Act of 1999. Sponsored by U.S. Sens. Spencer Abraham \n     (Mich.) and Joseph Lieberman (Conn.), the proposal would \n     limit the amount of punitive damages that might be sought \n     from a small firm to two times the amount of compensatory \n     damages or $250,000, whichever is less.\n       The measure also would eliminate joint-and-several \n     liability for small firms, leaving them responsible for \n     paying only their ``proportionate'' share of non-economic \n     damages. Under the current doctrine of joint-and-several \n     liability, defendants found to be as little as 1 percent ``at \n     fault'' in a civil case may end up paying all assessed \n     damages, if no other defendants are able to pay.\n       ``This bill strikes a long-overdue blow on behalf of \n     fairness, common sense and true justice,'' said Dan Danner, \n     NFIB's vice president of federal public policy. ``Limiting \n     punitive damages and exposure to liability will\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\n     make small businesses a much less lucrative--and, thus, a \n     much less attractive--target for trial lawyers and others \n     tempted to file frivolous lawsuits to extort settlements.\n       ``Ending joint-and-several liability will improve justice \n     by making sure small-business owners pay their fair share of \n     damages--but not more,'' he continued. ``Under the current \n     doctrine, the effort to compensate one victim often creates \n     yet another victim--the marginally-involved business owner \n     who is left holding the bag for everyone else involved.''\n       The Abraham-Lieberman bill would limit liability in all \n     types of civil lawsuits for businesses with fewer than 25 \n     employees. NFIB's Danner estimated the liability limitations \n     would apply to ``a little more than 90 percent'' of all \n     employing businesses. ``Passage would bring relief to \n     literally millions of small-business owners and their \n     families,'' he said. ``It would certainly ease Main Street's \n     growing anxiety about being slapped with--and ruined by--a \n     Mickey Mouse lawsuit.''\n       ``When we asked our members in Alabama to identify the \n     biggest problem facing their businesses, the most frequent \n     answer, by far, was `cost of liability insurance/fear of \n     lawsuits','' Danner noted. ``Another problem, `street crime,' \n     drew only a third as many responses.\n       ``There's something dreadfully wrong with our justice \n     system when small-business owners are three times more \n     fearful of being mugged by trial lawyers than by common \n     street thugs.''\n       A nationwide survey of NFIB's 600,000 members found \n     virtually all (93 percent) favor capping punitive damages. \n     ``Small-business owners support any measures that will \n     restore fairness, balance and common sense to our civil \n     justice system,'' Danner said. ``We have pledged our full \n     support to Sens.

Mr. Gorin's remarks refer to the Small \n     Business Liability Reform Act of 1999, which Senator Abraham \n     and Senator Joseph Lieberman have introduced today. The \n     legislation proposes a $250,000 limit on punitive damages for \n     small business as well as provide protection from product-\n     related injuries for non-manufacturing product sellers.\n       Gorin continued, ``For far too long, small businesses have \n     been the losers in `litigation lottery.' As our civil justice \n     system has moved farther and farther away from common sense, \n     small businessses have had to absorb an increasing hidden \n     cost of doing business. That hidden cost is the result of \n     making decisions and undertaking actions, not on the basis of \n     what makes good business sense, but rather on the basis of \n     `will I be sued?' ''\n       Gorin concluded, ``The Small Business Legislative Council \n     strongly supports Senator Abraham's legislation. SBLC \n     believes the Small Business Liability Reform Act will restore \n     common sense to the civil justice system and allow small \n     businesses to make decisions on the basis of what's best for \n     the economy, not the trial lawyers.''\n       The SBLC is a permanent, independent coalition of nearly \n     eighty trade and professional associations that share a \n     common commitment to the future of small business.

The bill, which is \n     sponsored by Senators Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph \n     Lieberman (D-CT), would help protect small businesses from \n     frivolous litigation and exorbitant legal fees. Of particular \n     interest to the retail industry are the bill's provisions to \n     exclude small businesses from joint liability stemming from \n     products they sell.\n       ``Retailers often find themselves party to product \n     liability lawsuits where no direct liability exists,'' said \n     NRF Vice President and General Counsel, Mallory Duncan. \n     ``This bill would shift the responsibility for defective \n     products to where it rightly belongs--the manufacturer.''\n       The Small Business Liability Reform Act of 1999 would apply \n     to businesses with 25 or fewer employees. According to \n     Department of Commerce figures, more than 80 percent of the \n     nation's retailers employ fewer than 25 individuals.\n       A recent Gallup survey suggests that some business owners' \n     fear of litigation may impact critical operational decisions. \n     The resulting ``chilling effect'' on the growth potential of \n     small businesses underscores the need for reform, according \n     to NRF.\n       ``This bill would provide long-overdue and much needed \n     relief to millions of entrepreneurs whose businesses could \n     succeed or fail as the result of a single lawsuit,'' Duncan \n     said. ``Most small business owners lack the resources to both \n     defend themselves against legal action and remain solvent. \n     This bill would give them some piece of mind and the \n     confidence to manage their business without undue fear of \n     financial ruin.''\n       The National Retail Federation (NRF) is the world's largest \n     retail trade association with membership that comprises all \n     retail formats and channels of distribution including \n     department, specialty, discount, catalogue, Internet and \n     independent stores. NRF members represent an industry that \n     encompasses more than 1.4 million U.S. retail establishments, \n     employs more than 20 million people--about 1 in 5 American \n     workers--and registered 1998 sales of $2.7 trillion. NRF's \n     international members operate stores in more than 50 nations. \n     In its role as the retail industry's umbrella group, NRF also \n     represents 32 national and 50 state associations in the U.S. \n     as well as 36 international associations representing \n     retailers abroad.\n                                  ____\n\n\nNational Restaurant Association Backs Abraham/Lieberman Effort To Crack \n                       Down on Frivolous Lawsuits\n\n\n     Says small restaurants need protection from costly, excessive \n                               litigation\n\n       Washington, DC--Saying that just one costly lawsuit is \n     enough to put a restaurant out of business, the National \n     Restaurant Association today strongly endorsed a bill \n     sponsored by Sens. Spence Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph Lieberman \n     (D-CT) to protect small businesses from litigation abuse.\n       ``The tendency for people today to sue for outlandish \n     reasons is out of control,'' said Association Senior Vice \n     President of Government and Corporate Affairs Elaine Z. \n     Graham. ``In recent years, many restaurants unfortunately \n     have become targets for frivolous lawsuits. The reality is \n     that it only takes one such lawsuit to drive a restaurant out \n     of business. As a result, restaurants pay for high-priced \n     liability insurance in an effort to arm themselves against \n     the prospects of being sued.\n       ``Our legal system needs to be reformed. We strongly \n     support the Abraham/Lieberman bill and believe it will go a \n     long way toward protecting smaller restaurants and curbing \n     litigation abuse,'' she added.\n       The bill, the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act, \n     limits the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded \n     against a business with 25 or fewer employees. Currently, \n     many small businesses settle out of court and pay hefty \n     awards--even if the claim is unfounded--because they are \n     fearful of being hit with unlimited punitive damages. By \n     putting a cap on punitive damages, the Abraham/Lieberman bill \n     helps eliminate needless lawsuits and makes it easier for \n     small businesses to get fair settlements, avoiding excessive \n     legal fees.\n       The Association is urging members of Congress to support \n     the Abraham/Lieberman bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          NACS Supports Small Business Lawsuit Protection Act\n\n       Alexandria, Virginia--The National Association of \n     Convenience Stores (NACS) is pleased to endorse legislation \n     authored by Senators Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joe Lieberman \n     (D-CT) that would limit small businesses' exposure to damages \n     and liability in civil cases.\n       The ``Small Business Liability Reform Act of 1999'' is \n     broken into two sections: ``Small Business Lawsuit Abuse \n     Protection'' and ``Product Seller Fair Treatment.'' The Small \n     Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection section would limit small \n     business exposure to punitive damages and joint liability for \n     non-economic damages, in any civil action (with some \n     exceptions). The damages would be limited to a maximum of \n     $250,000. Under the bill, small businesses are defined as \n     having under 25 employees. The Product Seller Fair Treatment \n     section would hold non-manufacturing product sellers (local \n     wholesaler-distributors and neighborhood retailers) liable \n     for product-related injuries only when the seller is directly \n     responsible for the harm.\n       ``More than 70 percent of the over 77,000 stores operated \n     by NACS members are either one-store operations or part of a \n     chain of 10 or fewer stores. These small business owners \n     provide an essential service to their communities, contribute \n     significantly to local economies and employ hundreds of \n     thousands of people,'' said Lyle Beckwith, Director, \n     Government Relations at NACS. ``Because this bill protects \n     those small business people from rising liability insurance \n     costs and frivolous lawsuits, NACS will work proactively for \n     its passage, and encourage other senators to follow the \n     leadership of Senators Abraham and Lieberman.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n         ACEC Supports ``Small Business Liability Reform Act''\n\n       Washington, D.C.--The American Consulting Engineers Council \n     (ACEC) strongly supports the ``Small Business Liability \n     Reform Act of 1999'' which was introduced today by Senators \n     Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). The \n     legislation, which builds on proposals that have earned \n     strong bipartisan support in recent Congresses, will improve \n     out nation's civil justice system through a package of \n     carefully-targeted reforms--reforms that will deter \n     unwarranted, frivolous, and needlessly wasteful litigation \n     against employers, and particularly small businesses.\n       The threat of litigation and frivolous lawsuits continues \n     to be a primary concern for consulting engineering firms \n     according to ACEC's recent Professional Liability Survey \n     report. Fully 75% of survey respondents indicated that the \n     threat of litigation stifled the use of innovative techniques \n     or technologies while working on projects. Over one-third of \n     all claims filed against ACEC member firms resulted in no \n     payment of any kind to the plaintiff, a fact which indicates \n     that ``frivolous'' litigation remains a problem for the \n     industry.\n       The Small Business Liability Reform Act would limit the \n     exposure of small businesses to punitive damages and joint \n     liability for non-economic damages in any civil action, with \n     the exception of lawsuits involving certain types of \n     egregious conduct. If passed, the bill would limit punitive \n     damages to the lesser of two times the amount awarded to the \n     claimant for economic and noneconomic losses, or $250,000.\n       Howard M. Messner, ACEC's Executive Vice President, \n     applauded the Senators' decision to sponsor this legislation, \n     saying ``ACEC has long supported the types of reforms \n     incorporated in this legislation. Our member firms have \n     learned from direct experience that meritless lawsuits can \n     cripple a professional's practice, especially when that \n     professional is a small businessperson. For this reason, we \n     will certainly support legislative initiatives designed to \n     provide some much-needed relief from baseless lawsuits.''\n                                  ____\n\n\nIMRA Hails Bill Limiting Retailers' Exposure to Product Liability Suits\n\n\n        abraham-lieberman bill would guard innocent distributors\n\n       Arlington, VA--The International Mass Retail Association \n     (IMRA) applauds today's introduction of the bipartisan \n     ``Small Business Liability Reform Act of 1999'' by Senators \n     Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). The bill \n     would shield from product liability lawsuits retailers and \n     other distributors if they did not take part in the product's \n     design and manufacture. It would generally hold retailers and \n     other distributors responsible only for their own negligence, \n     not for the actions of manufacturers.\n       ``All too often, mass retailers are unfairly dragged into \n     product liability lawsuits when they have had no part in \n     designing or producing the item in question,'' said IMRA \n     President Robert J. Verdisco. ``Simply selling a product \n     should not automatically bring the retailer or distributor \n     into product liability lawsuits.''\n       The Abraham-Lieberman bill would allow a product seller to \n     be brought into Federal or state product liability lawsuits \n     only if the plaintiff can show harm due to a retailer's or \n     distributor's failure to exercise reasonable care with the \n     product, failure to live up to its own express warranty, or \n     deliberate wrongdoing. Retailers and distributors could also \n     be brought in when the product maker cannot be brought into \n     court or pay a judgment against it.\n       Verdisco called the Abraham-Lieberman measure ``long-\n     needed, common-sense reform to our nation's product liability \n     system.'' He noted that the same provisions have been part of \n     broader product liability reform bills for many years without \n     prompting major controversy.\n       ``Product safety is an important concern for the nation's \n     mass retailers,'' Verdisco noted, ``but groundless, costly \n     product liability cases against retailers who have no \n     involvement other than selling the product can jeopardize the \n     wide selection and low prices that consumers have come to \n     expect from mass retail stores.'' He added, ``The Abraham-\n     Lieberman bill would provide innocent retailers and \n     distributors with fair and reasonable safeguards, while still \n     allowing consumers to pursue claims they believe are \n     meritorious against those most responsible for the product.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n      ABC Applauds Introduction of Small Business Liability Reform\n\n       Washington, D.C.--May 28, 1999--ABC applauded the \n     introduction today of the Small Business Liability Reform Act \n     of 1999 by Sens. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and Joseph \n     Lieberman (D-Conn.).\n       ABC President David Bush said, ``ABC has long been \n     supportive of lawsuit reform as a\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\n     beneficial solution of the pressing problem of frivolous \n     lawsuits which raise the cost of doing business and clog the \n     nation's court systems.''\n       The legislation would limit punitive damages and joint \n     liability for non-economic damages against small businesses \n     in any civil lawsuit. Under current law, punitive damage \n     verdicts are commonplace as a result of vague substantive \n     standards and unrestrained plaintiff's lawyers. Awards in \n     non-economic cases compensate plaintiffs for ``pain and \n     suffering'' or ``emotional distress,'' and are not calculated \n     on tangible economic loss. Multi-million dollar punitive \n     damage awards are now routinely sought and frequently imposed \n     in almost every type of civil case.\n       ABC has long been supportive of lawsuit reforms. The \n     construction industry is particularly concerned about \n     frivolous cases brought before the National Labor Relations \n     Board as a result of ``salting'' abuses.\n       ``ABC commends Sens. Abraham and Lieberman for introducing \n     common-sense legislation that, if passed, will discourage \n     costly and frivolous lawsuits against small business \n     owners.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed \ncolleagues in the introduction of the Small Business Liability Reform \nAct of 1999.\n  Over the last 30 years, the American civil justice system has become \ninefficient, unpredictable and costly. Consequently, I have spent a \ngreat deal of my time in the United States Senate working to reform the \nlegal system. I was particularly pleased to help lead in the efforts to \npass the Volunteer Protection Act, which offers much-needed litigation \nprotection for our country's battalion of volunteers. America's \nlitigation crisis, however, goes well beyond our volunteers.\n  Lawsuits and the mere threat of lawsuits impede invention and \ninnovation, and the competitive position our nation has enjoyed in the \nworld marketplace. The litigation craze has several perverse effects. \nFor example, it discourages the production of more and better products, \nwhile encouraging the production of more and more attorneys. In the \n1950s, there was one lawyer for every 695 Americans. Today, in \ncontrast, there is one lawyer for every 290 people. In fact, we have \nmore lawyers per capita than any other western democracy.\n  Mr. President, don't get me wrong--there is nothing inherently wrong \nwith being a lawyer. I am proud to be a graduate of the University of \nKentucky College of Law. My point, however, is simple: government and \nsociety should promote a world where its more desirable to create goods \nand services than it is to create lawsuits.\n  The chilling effects of our country's litigation epidemic are felt \nthroughout our national economy--especially by our small businesses. We \nmust act to remove the litigation harness that constrains our nation's \nsmall businesses.\n  Small businesses are vital to our nation's economy. My state provides \na perfect example of the importance of small business. In Kentucky, \nmore than 85% of our businesses are small businesses.\n  The Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act is a narrowly-crafted \nbill which seeks to restore some rationality, certainty and civility to \nthe legal system.\n  First, Title I of this bill would offer limited relief to businesses \nor organizations that have fewer than 25 full-time employees. Title I \nseeks to provide some reasonable limits on punitive damages, which \ntypically serve as a windfall to plaintiffs. It also provides that a \nbusiness's responsibility for noneconomic losses would be in proportion \nto the business's responsibility for causing the harm.\n  The other Title in the bill includes liability reforms for innocent \nproduct sellers--which are very often small businesses. These \nbusinesses are often dragged into product liability cases even though \nthey did not produce, design or manufacture the product, and are not in \nany way to blame for the harm that the product is alleged to have \ncaused. Title II would help protect product sellers from being \nsubjected to frivolous lawsuits when they are not responsible for the \nalleged harm.\n  Now, let me explain what this bill does not do. It does not close the \ncourthouse door to plaintiffs who sue small businesses. For example, \nthis bill does not limit a plaintiff's ability to sue a small business \nfor an act of negligence, or any other act, for that manner. It also \ndoes not prevent a plaintiff from recovering from product sellers when \nthose sellers are responsible for harm.\n  Mr. President, this is a sensible, narrowly-tailored piece of \nlegislation that is greatly needed to free up the enterprising spirit \nof our small businesses.

and\n       (5) calls for the President of the United States to declare \n     that--\n       (A) it is the policy of the United States that United \n     Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947 is null and \n     void;\n       (B) all negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians \n     must be based on United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     242 and 338; and\n       (C) the United States regards any attempt by the \n     Palestinians, the United Nations, or any entity to resurrect \n     United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 as a basis for \n     negotiations, or for any international decision, as an \n     attempt to sabotage the prospects for a successful peace \n     agreement in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6382-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6382-S6383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 109--RELATING TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE NATIONAL \n                   ISLAMIC FRONT GOVERNMENT IN SUDAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 109\n\n       Whereas according to the United States Committee for \n     Refugees (USCR), approximately 1,900,000 people have died in \n     Sudan over the past decade due to war and war-related causes \n     and famine, and millions more people in Sudan have been \n     displaced from their homes and separated from their families, \n     making this the deadliest war in the last decade in terms of \n     mortality rates;\n       Whereas the war policy of the National Islamic Front \n     government in southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains has \n     brought untold suffering on innocent civilians and threatens \n     the very survival of a whole generation of southern Sudanese;\n       Whereas the people of the Nuba Mountains are at particular \n     risk from this policy because they have been the specific \n     target of a deliberate prohibition on international food aid, \n     which has helped induce a man-made famine, and have been \n     subject to the routine bombing of their civilian centers, \n     including religious facilities, schools, and hospitals;\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front government is \n     deliberately and systematically committing crimes against \n     humanity in southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains;\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front government has \n     systematically and repeatedly obstructed the peace efforts of \n     the Inter-governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) in \n     Sudan over the past several years;\n       Whereas the Declaration of Principles put forth by Inter-\n     governmental Authority for Development mediators provides the \n     most fruitful negotiating framework for resolving problems in \n     Sudan and bringing lasting peace to Sudan;\n       Whereas humanitarian conditions in southern Sudan, \n     especially in Bahr al-Ghazal, deteriorated in 1998 largely \n     because of the decision of the National Islamic Front \n     government to ban United Nations relief flights in those \n     areas from February through April 1998;\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front government continues to \n     deny access by United Nations relief flights to certain \n     locations in Sudan, including a blanket prohibition on \n     flights to the Nuba Mountains, resulting in deterioration of \n     humanitarian conditions;\n       Whereas approximately 2,600,000 Sudanese were at risk of \n     starvation in Sudan in late 1998, and the World Food Program \n     currently estimates that 4,000,000 people are in need of \n     emergency assistance in that area;\n       Whereas the relief effort in Sudan coordinated by the \n     United Nations, Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), failed to \n     respond in a timely fashion to the humanitarian crisis in \n     Sudan at the height of that crisis in 1998 and has allowed \n     the National Islamic Front government to manipulate and \n     obstruct relief efforts in Sudan;\n       Whereas relief efforts in Sudan are further complicated by \n     repeated airborne attacks by the National Islamic Front \n     government on feeding centers, clinics, and other civilian \n     targets in certain areas of Sudan;\n       Whereas such relief efforts are further complicated by the \n     looting and killing of innocent civilians by militias \n     sponsored by the National Islamic Front government;\n       Whereas these militias have carried out violent raids in \n     Aweil East and West, Twic, and Gogrial counties in the Bahr \n     al-Ghazal/Lakes Region, killing and displacing thousands of \n     civilians, which reflects a deliberate ethic cleansing policy \n     in these counties and in the Nuba Mountains;\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front government has \n     perpetrated a prolonged campaign of human rights abuses and \n     discrimination throughout Sudan;\n       Whereas the militias associated with the National Islamic \n     Front government have engaged in the enslavement of innocent \n     civilians, including children, women, and elderly;\n       Whereas slave raids are commonly undertaken by the militias \n     of the Popular Defense Force of the National Islamic Front as \n     part of a self-declared jihad, or holy war, against the \n     predominately Christian and traditional believers of southern \n     Sudan;\n       Whereas the Department of State in its report on Human \n     Rights Practices for 1997 affirmed with respect to Sudan that \n     ``reports and information from a variety of sources after \n     February 1994 indicate that the number of cases of slavery, \n     servitude, slave trade, and forced labor have increased \n     alarmingly'';\n       Whereas the Department of State in its report on Human \n     Rights Practices for 1998 states with respect to Sudan that \n     ``[c]redible reports persist of practices such as the sale \n     and purchase of children, some in alleged slave markets'';\n       Whereas the enslavement of people is considered a crime \n     against humanity under international law;\n       Whereas it is estimated that tens of thousands of Sudanese \n     have been enslaved by militias sponsored by the National \n     Islamic Front government;\n       Whereas the former United Nations Special Rapporteur for \n     Sudan, Gaspar Biro, and the present Special Rapporteur, \n     Leonardo Franco, have reported on a number of occasions the \n     routine practice of slavery in Sudan and the complicity of \n     the National Islamic Front government in that practice;\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front government abuses and \n     tortures political opponents and innocent civilians in \n     northern Sudan, and many people in northern Sudan have been \n     killed by that government over the years;\n       Whereas the vast majority of Muslims in Sudan do not \n     prescribe to policies of National Islamic Front extremists, \n     including the politicized practice of Islam, and moderate \n     Muslims in Sudan have been specifically targeted by the \n     National Islamic Front government;\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front government is considered \n     by much of the world community as a rogue state because of \n     its support for international terrorism and its campaign of \n     terrorism against its own people;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State's Patterns of \n     Global Terrorism Report, ``Sudan's support to terrorist \n     organizations has included paramilitary training, \n     indoctrination, money, travel documentation, safe passage, \n     and refuge in Sudan'';\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front government has been \n     implicated in the assassination attempt of Egyptian President \n     Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia in 1995 and the World Trade Center \n     bombing in New York City in 1993;\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front government has permitted \n     Sudan to be used by well known terrorist organizations as a \n     refuge and training center;\n       Whereas Osama bin-Laden, the Saudi-born financier of \n     extremist groups and mastermind of the bombings of the United \n     States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, \n     Tanzania, used Sudan as a base of operations for several \n     years and continues to maintain economic interests there;\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\n       Whereas on August 20, 1998, United States naval forces \n     struck a suspected chemical weapons facility in Khartoum, the \n     capital of Sudan, in retaliation for those bombings;\n       Whereas relations between the United States and Sudan \n     continue to deteriorate because of human rights violations, \n     the war policy of the National Islamic Front government in \n     southern Sudan, and that government's support for \n     international terrorism;\n       Whereas in 1993 the United States Government placed Sudan \n     on the list of seven states in the world that sponsor \n     terrorism and imposed comprehensive sanctions on the National \n     Islamic Front government in November 1997; and\n       Whereas the struggle by the people of Sudan, and opposition \n     forces to the National Islamic Front government, is a just \n     struggle for freedom and democracy against that government: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly condemns the National Islamic Front government \n     in Sudan for its support for terrorism and its continued \n     human rights violations;\n       (2) strongly deplores the slave raids in southern Sudan and \n     calls on the National Islamic Front government to end \n     immediately the practice of slavery in Sudan;\n       (3) calls on the United Nations Security Council--\n       (A) to condemn such slave raids and bring to justice those \n     responsible for the crimes against humanity which such slave \n     raids entail;\n       (B) to implement the existing air embargo, and impose an \n     arms embargo, on the National Islamic Front government;\n       (C) to swiftly implement reforms of Operation Lifeline \n     Sudan in order to enhance the independence of that operation \n     from the National Islamic Front government; and\n       (D) to determine whether or not the war policy of the \n     National Islamic Front government in southern Sudan and the \n     Nuba Mountains constitutes genocide; and\n       (E) to implement the recommendations of the United Nations \n     Special Rapporteur for Sudan, Leonardo Franco, who has called \n     for the posting of human rights monitors throughout Sudan; \n     and\n       (4) calls on the President to take leadership on policies--\n       (A) to increase support for relief organizations working \n     outside the umbrella of Operation Lifeline Sudan, including, \n     in particular, the dedication of programs to and an increase \n     in resources of organizations serving the Nuba Mountains;\n       (B) to instruct the Agency for International Development \n     (AID) and other appropriate agencies to--\n       (i) provide additional support to and coordinate activities \n     with nongovernmental organizations involved in relief work in \n     Sudan that work outside the umbrella of organizations \n     supported by Operation Lifeline Sudan, including the Nuba \n     Mountains; and\n       (ii) enhance the independence of Operation Lifeline Sudan \n     from the National Islamic Front government, including by \n     removing that government's power of automatic veto over its \n     operation;\n       (C) to double the funds that are made available through the \n     so-called STAR Program for the promotion of the rule of law \n     to advance democracy, civil administration, and the \n     judiciary, and the enhancement of infrastructure, in areas in \n     Sudan that are controlled by the opposition to the National \n     Islamic Front government;\n       (D) to instruct the Agency for International Development to \n     provide humanitarian assistance, including food, directly to \n     indigenous service groups in southern Sudan and the Nuba \n     Mountains;\n       (E) to intensify and expand United States diplomatic and \n     economic pressure on the National Islamic Front government in \n     conjunction with and urging other countries to impose \n     sanctions regimes on that government that are similar to \n     sanction regime imposed on that government by the United \n     States;\n       (F) to continue to enhance the peace process in Sudan \n     supported by the Inter-governmental Authority for \n     Development; and\n       (G) to report to Congress not later than three months after \n     the adoption of this resolution regarding the efforts or \n     plans of the President to promote the end of slavery in \n     Sudan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Res. 111\n\n       Whereas June 6, 1999, the first Sunday in the month, falls \n     between Mother's Day and Father's Day;\n       Whereas each child is unique, a blessing, and holds a \n     distinct place in the family unit;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should celebrate \n     children as the most valuable asset of the United States;\n       Whereas the children represent the future, hope, and \n     inspiration of the United States;\n       Whereas the children of the United States should be allowed \n     to feel that their ideas and dreams will be respected because \n     adults in the United States take time to listen;\n       Whereas many children of the United States face crises of \n     grave proportions, especially as they enter adolescent years;\n       Whereas it is important for parents to spend time listening \n     to their children on a daily basis;\n       Whereas modern societal and economic demands often pull the \n     family apart;\n       Whereas, whenever practicable, it is important for both \n     parents to be involved in their child's life;\n       Whereas encouragement should be given to families to set \n     aside a special time for all family members to engage \n     together in family activities;\n       Whereas adults in the United States should have an \n     opportunity to reminisce on their youth to recapture some of \n     the fresh insight, innocence, and dreams that they may have \n     lost through the years;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the \n     children of the United States will provide an opportunity to \n     emphasize to children the importance of developing an ability \n     to make the choices necessary to distance themselves from \n     impropriety and to contribute to their communities;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should emphasize to \n     children the importance of family life, education, and \n     spiritual qualities;\n       Whereas because children are the responsibility of all \n     people of the United States, everyone should celebrate \n     children, whose questions, laughter, and dreams are important \n     to the existence of the United States; and\n       Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the \n     children will emphasize to the people of the United States \n     the importance of the role of the child within the family and \n     society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\n       (1) designates June 6, 1999, as ``National Child's Day''; \n     and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6384-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 112--TO DESIGNATE JUNE 5, 1999, AS ``SAFE NIGHT USA''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 112\n\n       Whereas over 1,500,000 people, 220,000 of them juveniles, \n     were arrested last year for drug abuse;\n       Whereas over 1,000,000 juveniles were victims of violent \n     crimes last year;\n       Whereas local community prevention efforts are vital to \n     reducing these alarming trends;\n       Whereas Safe Night began with 4,000 juvenile participants \n     in Milwaukee during 1994 in response to a 300 percent \n     increase in violent death and injury in that city between \n     1983 and 1993;\n       Whereas Safe Night involved over 10,000 Wisconsin \n     participants and included over 100 individual Safe Nights \n     throughout Wisconsin in 1996;\n       Whereas Safe Night has been credited as a factor in \n     reducing the teenage homicide rate in Milwaukee by 60 percent \n     in just the first 3 years of the program;\n       Whereas Wisconsin Public Television, the Public \n     Broadcasting Service, Black Entertainment Television, the \n     National Latino Children's Institute, the National Civics \n     League, 100 Black Men of America, the Resolving Conflict \n     Creatively Center and Educators for Social Responsibility, \n     the Boys and Girls Club of America, the Community Anti-Drug \n     Coalitions of America, the National 4-H Youth Council, Public \n     Television Outreach, and the American Academy of Pediatrics \n     have joined with Safe Night USA to lead this major violence \n     prevention initiative;\n       Whereas community leaders, including parents, teachers, \n     doctors, religious officials, and business leaders, will \n     enter into partnership with youth to foster a drug-free and \n     violence-free environment on June 5, 1999;\n       Whereas this partnership combines stress and anger \n     management programs with dances, talent shows, sporting \n     events, and other recreational activities, operating on only \n     3 basic rules: no weapons, no alcohol, and no arguments;\n       Whereas Safe Night USA helps youth avoid the most common \n     factors that precede acts of violence, provides children with \n     the tools to resolve conflict and manage anger without \n     violence, encourages communities to work together to identify \n     key issues affecting teenagers, and creates local \n     partnerships with youth that will continue beyond the \n     expiration of the project; and\n       Whereas June 5, 1999, will witness over 10,000 local Safe \n     Night activities joined together in one nationwide effort to \n     combat youth violence and substance abuse: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates June 5, 1999 as ``Safe Night USA''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the day \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n     SEC. 2.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONTINUATION \n                   OF SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On December 21, 1988, 270 people, including 189 United \n     States citizens, were killed in a terrorist bombing on Pan Am \n     103 Flight over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n       (2) Britain and the United States indicted two Libyan \n     intelligence agents, Abd al-Baset Ali al-Megrahi and Al-Amin \n     Khalifah Fhimah, in 1991 and sought their extradition from \n     Libya to the United States or the United Kingdom to stand \n     trial for this heinous terrorist act.\n       (3) The United Nations Security Council called for the \n     extradition of the suspects in Security Council Resolution \n     731 and imposed sanctions on Libya in Security Council \n     Resolutions 748 and 883 because Libyan leader Colonel Muammar \n     Qadhafi refused to transfer the suspects to either the United \n     States or the United Kingdom to stand trial.\n       (4) The United Nations Security Council Resolutions 731, \n     748, and 883 demand that Libya cease all support for \n     terrorism, turn over the two suspects, cooperate with the \n     investigation and the trial, and address the issue of \n     appropriate compensation.\n       (5) The sanctions in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 748 and 883 include--\n       (A) a worldwide ban on Libya's national airline;\n       (B) a ban on flights into and out of Libya by other \n     nations' airlines; and\n       (C) a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, and \n     certain oil equipment to Libya, and a blocking of Libyan \n     Government funds in other countries.\n       (6) Colonel Muammar Qadhafi for many years refused to \n     extradite the suspects to either the United States or the \n     United Kingdom and had insisted that he would only transfer \n     the suspects to a third and neutral country to stand trial.\n       (7) On August 24, 1998, the United States and the United \n     Kingdom agreed to the proposal that Colonel Qadhafi transfer \n     the suspects to The Netherlands, where they would stand trial \n     under a Scottish court, under Scottish law, and with a panel \n     of Scottish judges.\n       (8) The United Nations Security Council endorsed the United \n     States-United Kingdom proposal on August 27, 1998 in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1192.\n       (9) The United States, consistent with United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions, called on Libya to ensure the \n     production of evidence, including the presence of witnesses \n     before the court, and to comply fully with all the \n     requirements of the United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions.\n       (10) After years of intensive diplomacy, Colonel Qadhafi \n     finally transferred the two Libyan suspects to The \n     Netherlands on April 5, 1999, and the United Nations Security \n     Council, in turn, suspended its sanctions against Libya that \n     same day.\n       (11) Libya has only fulfilled one of four conditions (the \n     transfer of the two suspects accused in the Lockerbie \n     bombing) set forth in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 731, 748, and 883 that would justify the lifting \n     of United Nations Security Council sanctions against Libya.\n       (12) Libya has not fulfilled the other three conditions \n     (cooperation with the Lockerbie investigation and trial; \n     renunciation of and ending support for terrorism; and payment \n     of appropriate compensation) necessary to lift the United \n     Nations Security Council sanctions.\n       (13) The United Nations Secretary General is expected to \n     issue a report to the Security Council on or before July 5, \n     1999, on the issue of Libya's compliance with the remaining \n     conditions.\n       (14) Any member of the United Nations Security Council has \n     the right to introduce a resolution to lift the sanctions \n     against Libya after the United Nations Secretary General's \n     report has been issued.\n       (15) The United States Government considers Libya a state \n     sponsor of terrorism and the State Department Report, \n     ``Patterns of Global Terrorism; 1998'', stated that Colonel \n     Qadhafi ``continued publicly and privately to\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\n     support Palestinian terrorist groups, including the PIJ and \n     the PFLP-GC''.\n       (16) United States Government sanctions (other than \n     sanctions on food or medicine) should be maintained on Libya, \n     and in accordance with U.S. law, the Secretary of State \n     should kept Libya on the list of countries the governments of \n     which have repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 in light of Libya's ongoing \n     support for terrorist groups.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should use all diplomatic means necessary, \n     including the use of the United States veto at the United \n     Nations Security Council, to prevent the Security Council \n     from lifting sanctions against Libya until Libya fulfills all \n     of the conditions set forth in United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 731, 748, and 883.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    FEINGOLD AMENDMENTS NOS. 443-444\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD proposed two amendments to the bill, S. 1059, supra;

In response, the Air Force has initiated a ``stop \n     loss'' program to block normal retirements and separations.\n       (11) The United States Navy has been reduced in size to 339 \n     ships, its lowest level since 1938, necessitating the \n     redeployment of the only overseas homeported aircraft carrier \n     from the Western Pacific to the Mediterranean to support \n     Operation Allied Force;\n       (12) In 1998 just 10 percent of eligible carrier naval \n     aviators--27 out of 261--accepted\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\n     continuation bonuses and remained in service;\n       (13) In 1998 48 percent of Air Force pilots eligible for \n     continuation opted to leave the service.\n       (14) The Army could fall 6,000 below Congressionally \n     authorized troop strength by the end of 1999.\n       (b) Sense of Congress:\n       (1) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) The readiness of U.S. military forces to execute the \n     National Security Strategy of the United States is being \n     eroded from a combination of declining defense budgets and \n     expanded missions;\n       (B) There may be missions to which the United States is \n     contributing Armed Forces from which the United States can \n     begin disengaging.\n       (c) Report Requirement.\n       (1) Not later than March 1, 2000, the President shall \n     submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and \n     the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives, and to the Committees on Appropriations in \n     both Houses, a report prioritizing the ongoing global \n     missions to which the United States is contributing troops. \n     The President shall include in the report a feasibility \n     analysis of how the United States can:\n       (1) shift resources from low priority missions in support \n     of higher priority missions;\n       (2) consolidate or reduce U.S. troop commitments worldwide;\n       (3) end low priority missions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  SMITH (AND WYDEN) AMENDMENT NO. 478\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for Mr. Smith of Oregon, for himself and Mr. Wyden) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1059, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 404, below line 22, add the following:\n\n            TITLE XIII--CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION ACTIVITIES\n\n     SEC. 1301. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Community-Army Cooperation \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Between 1945 and 1989, the national security interests \n     of the United States required the construction, and later, \n     the deployment and storage of weapons of mass destruction \n     throughout the geographical United States.\n       (2) The United States is a party to international \n     commitments and treaties which require the decommissioning or \n     destruction of certain of these weapons.\n       (3) The United States has ratified the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention which requires the destruction of the United \n     States chemical weapons stockpile by April 29, 2007.\n       (4) Section 1412 of the Department of Defense Authorization \n     Act, 1986 (50 U.S.C. 1521) provides that the Department of \n     the Army shall be the executive agent for the destruction of \n     the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (5) In 1988, the Department of the Army determined that on-\n     site incineration of chemical weapons at the eight chemical \n     weapons storage locations in the continental United States \n     would provide the safest and most efficient means for the \n     destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (6) The communities in the vicinity of such locations have \n     expressed concern over the safety of the process to be used \n     for the incineration of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (7) Sections 174 and 175 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484) \n     and section 8065 of the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208) require that the Department of \n     the Army explore methods other than incineration for the \n     destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (8) Compliance with the 2007 deadline for the destruction \n     of the United States chemical weapons stockpile in accordance \n     with the Chemical Weapons Convention will require an \n     accelerated decommissioning and transporting of United States \n     chemical weapons.\n       (9) The decommissioning or transporting of such weapons has \n     caused, or will cause, environmental, economic, and social \n     disruptions.\n       (10) It is appropriate for the United States to mitigate \n     such disruptions.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to provide \n     for the mitigation of the environmental, economic, and social \n     disruptions to communities and Indian tribes resulting from \n     the onsite decommissioning of chemical agents and munitions, \n     and related materials, at chemical demilitarization \n     facilities in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1303. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Secretary of the Army should streamline the \n     administrative structure of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of the Army, respectively, in order that the \n     officials within such departments with immediate \n     responsibility for the demilitarization of chemical agents \n     and munitions, and related materials, have authority--\n       (1) to meet the April 29, 2007, deadline for the \n     destruction of United States chemical weapon stockpile as \n     required by the Chemical Weapons Convention; and\n       (2) to employ sound management principles, including the \n     negotiation and implementation of contract incentives, to--\n       (A) accelerate the decommissioning of chemical agents and \n     munitions, and related materials; and\n       (B) enforce budget discipline on the chemical \n     demilitarization program of the United States while \n     mitigating the disruption to communities and Indian tribes \n     resulting from the onsite decommissioning of the chemical \n     weapons stockpile at chemical demilitarization facilities in \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1304. DECOMMISSIONING OF UNITED STATES CHEMICAL WEAPONS \n                   STOCKPILE.\n\n       (a) In General.--As executive agent for the chemical \n     demilitarization program of the United States, the Department \n     of the Army shall facilitate, expedite, and accelerate the \n     decommissioning of the United States chemical weapons \n     stockpile so as to complete the decommissioning of that \n     stockpile by April 29, 2007, as required by the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention.\n\n     SEC. 1305. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Upon the direction of the Secretary of the \n     Army, the Comptroller of the Army shall make economic \n     assistance payments to communities and Indian tribes directly \n     affected by the decommissioning of chemical agents and \n     munitions, and related materials, at chemical \n     demilitarization facilities in the United States.\n       (b) Source of Payments.--Amounts for payments under this \n     section shall be derived from appropriations available to the \n     Department of the Army for chemical demilitarization \n     activities.\n       (c) Total Amount of Payments.--(1) Subject to paragraph \n     (2), the aggregate amount of payments under this section with \n     respect to a chemical demilitarization facility during the \n     period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and \n     ending on April 29, 2007, may not be less than $50,000,000 or \n     more than $60,000,000.\n       (2) Payments under this section shall cease with respect to \n     a facility upon the transfer of the facility to a State-\n     chartered municipal corporation pursuant to an agreement \n     referred to in section 1412(c)(2)(B) of the Department of \n     Defense Authorization Act, 1986, as amended by section 1306 \n     of this Act.\n       (d) Date of Payment.--(1) Payments under this section with \n     respect to a chemical demilitarization facility shall be made \n     on March 1 and September 2 each year if the decommissioning \n     of chemical agents and munitions, and related materials, \n     occurs at the facility during the applicable payment period \n     with respect to such date.\n       (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``applicable \n     payment period'' means--\n       (A) in the case of a payment to be made on March 1 of a \n     year, the period beginning on July 1 and ending on December \n     31 of the preceding year; and\n       (B) in the case of a payment to be made on September 2 of a \n     year, the period beginning on January 1 and ending on June 30 \n     of the year.\n       (e) Allocation of Payment--(1) Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), each payment under this section with respect \n     to a chemical demilitarization facility shall be allocated \n     equally among the communities and Indian tribes that are \n     located within the positive action zone of the facility, as \n     determined by population.\n       (2) The amount of an allocation under this subsection to a \n     community or Indian tribe shall be reduced by the amount of \n     any tax or fee imposed or assessed by the community or Indian \n     tribe during the applicable payment period against the value \n     of the facility concerned or with respect to the storage or \n     decommissioning of chemical agents and munitions, or related \n     materials, at the facility.\n       (f) Computation of Payment.--(1) Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), the amount of each payment under this section \n     with respect to a chemical demilitarization facility shall be \n     the amount equal to $10,000 multiplied by the number of tons \n     of chemical agents and munitions, and related materials, \n     decommissioned at the facility during the applicable payment \n     period.\n       (2)(A) If at the conclusion of the decommissioning of \n     chemical agents and munitions, and related materials, at a \n     facility the aggregate amount of payments made with respect \n     to the facility is less than the minimum amount required by \n     subsection (c)(1), unless payments have ceased with respect \n     to the facility under subsection (c)(2), the amount of the \n     final payment under this section shall be the amount equal to \n     the difference between such aggregate amount and the minimum \n     amount required by subsection (c)(1).\n       (B) This paragraph shall not apply with respect to a \n     facility if the decommissioning of chemical agents and \n     munitions, and related materials, continues at the facility \n     after April 29, 2007.\n       (g) Interest on Untimely Payments.--(1) Any payment that is \n     made under this section for an applicable payment period \n     after the date specified for that period in subsection (d) \n     shall include, in addition to the payment amount otherwise \n     provided for under this section, interest at the rate of 1.5 \n     percent per month.\n       (2) Amounts for payments of interest under this paragraph \n     shall be derived from amounts available for the Department of \n     Defense, other than amounts available for chemical \n     demilitarization activities.\n       (h) Use of Payments.--A community or Indian tribe receiving \n     a payment under this section may utilize amounts of the \n     payment for such purposes as the community or Indian tribe, \n     as the case may be, considers appropriate in its sole \n     discretion.\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\n     SEC. 1306. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND USE OF FACILITIES.\n\n       Paragraph (2) of section 1412(c) of the Department of \n     Defense Authorization Act, 1986 (50 U.S.C. 1521(c)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2)(A) Facilities constructed to carry out this section \n     may not be used for any other purpose than the destruction of \n     the following:\n       ``(i) The United States stockpile of lethal chemical agents \n     and munitions that exist on November 8, 1985.\n       ``(ii) Any items designated by the Secretary of Defense \n     after that date to be lethal chemical agents and munitions, \n     or related materials.\n       ``(B) Facilities constructed to carry out this section \n     shall, when no longer needed for the purposes for which they \n     were constructed, be disposed of in accordance with \n     agreements between the office designated or established under \n     section 1304(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2000 and the chief executive officer of the State \n     in which the facilities are located.\n       ``(C) An agreement referred to in subparagraph (B) that \n     provides for the transfer of facilities from the United \n     States to a State-chartered municipal corporation shall \n     include provisions as follows:\n       ``(i) That any profits generated by the corporation from \n     the use of such facilities shall be used exclusively for the \n     benefit of communities and Indian tribes located within the \n     positive action zone of such facilities, as determined by \n     population.\n       ``(ii) That any profits referred to in clause (i) shall be \n     apportioned among the communities and Indian tribes concerned \n     on the basis of population, as determined by the most recent \n     decennial census.\n       ``(iii) That the transfer of such facilities shall include \n     any lands extending 50 feet in all directions from such \n     facilities.\n       ``(iv) That the transfer of such facilities include any \n     easements necessary for reasonable access to such facilities.\n       ``(D) An agreement referred to in subparagraph (B) may not \n     take effect if executed after December 31, 2000.''.\n\n     SEC. 1307.

We are particularly supportive of \n     enhanced provisions to encourage the donation of computers \n     and equipment to schools that serve underprivileged students, \n     allowing all American children the opportunity to prepare for \n     the New Economy on equal footing. Your legislation will allow \n     the potential of our nation's children to be fully realized \n     in the 21st century, while maintaining fiscal responsibility.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation and \n     for continuing your leadership on issues critical to the \n     success of America's New Economy.\n           Sincerely,\n         Wilfred Corrigan, CEO, LSI Logic, Corp.; Carl Feldbaum, \n           President, Biotechnology Industry Organization; Dr. \n           Dwight D.

Mr. President, I rise today to share a letter I \nreceived from my constituent, Ms. Shirley Roney of Bonnie, Illinois. \nMs. Roney shared with me a letter she wrote to President Clinton on \nbehalf of her grandmother, Vaneeta Allen. This ``Letter from a Nursing \nHome'' reminds us of some of the important issues many American \nfamilies face every day.\n  Long-term care is a serious concern for many elderly and disabled \nAmericans. Too many of our citizens face losing everything they have \nworked their whole lives for, just so they can pay for nursing home \ncare. Medicare was not designed to provide coverage for long-term care, \nand long-term care insurance is often unavailable due to preexisting \nmedical conditions, or it is out of financial reach for seniors. We \nmust continue to explore other options to assist those like Vaneeta \nAllen who must rely on nursing home care.\n  This letter does not have all of the answers, but we will never have \nthe answers if we lose sight of the struggles and simple dignity of \npeople like Mrs. Allen.\n  I ask the letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                   March 30, 1999.\n       Dear President Clinton: for the past four months my \n     grandmother has been in a nursing home. This has been a very \n     ``troubling time.'' I have spent the past four months \n     learning about the way we have failed to adequately provide \n     for those who built this country.\n       Actually this ``Letter from a Nursing Home'' came to me in \n     the middle of a sleepless night when I was struggling to \n     figure out some way to help my mom (grandmother) keep her \n     home. It would have broken her heart to lose her home.\n       It came to me that the least I could do was express her \n     feelings in words on paper. I was also her Power of Attorney. \n     I wrote the letter on the 14th and before I could mail it, \n     we, the family were called to her bedside. She died on March \n     18.\n       So I changed it from ``Letter from a Nursing Home'' to \n     ``Letter from Heaven'' and read it as a eulogy at her \n     funeral.\n       I appreciate the way you have always during your presidency \n     tried to guarantee the rights our fathers fought for to all \n     Americans.\n     Shirley Roney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Letter From A Nursing Home\n\n                                                   March 14, 1999.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: My name is Vaneeta Allen. I will be 93 \n     years of age on August 11, 1999, and for most of my adult \n     life, I have lived independently in a house I have owned.\n       My dad was a sharecropper. When I was a child, we never \n     owned our own home. It was my dream to own a home when I grew \n     up. I was the second of nine surviving children, the first \n     girl. I wanted to be a schoolteacher but had to quit school \n     at 13 to go to work to help support myself and my brothers \n     and sisters. The year was 1919.\n       When my children were little we lived through the Great \n     Depression and we celebrated when Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     raised the minimum wage so we could make as much as $1 a day \n     in the factory.\n       And finally, we bought for $5 an acre a little farm \n     southwest of Bonnie and moved ourselves and our two surviving \n     children into a 2-room house. We built on two bedrooms and a \n     bathroom and a kitchen. There, we, my husband and I, spent \n     our working years. The year was 1941.\n       And we sent our son and son-in-law off to war. There in \n     that home I stood with my ears to the radio listening to the \n     troop movements as our sons marched across Europe, afraid we \n     would lose our sons and maybe our country. Our sons saved our \n     country. And my son came home, but our son-in-law was nearly \n     killed in the Philippines and spent the rest of his short \n     life as a totally disabled veteran in and out of veterans' \n     hospitals. Our son was killed in a car crash on April 12, \n     1951, at 25 years of age.\n       Our family bought its citizenship with blood shed on two \n     foreign soils. But it was the price of liberty. We taught our \n     grandchildren, half of whom were fatherless and half of whom \n     were the children of a totally disabled father that the great \n     price they had paid was not in vain.\n       We taught them about the greatness of America and how all \n     men and women could live free.\n       In the early 60s, we were forced to sell our farm to the \n     government so they could build Rend Lake there. It was the \n     end of our farming years anyway and we needed to move away \n     from the farm. But our grandchildren cried because they \n     didn't want to leave that farm.\n       We built and moved into a home in Bonnie, a mile and a half \n     from our farm. And there we, my husband and I, lived together \n     until his death in 1981, and I lived until late October 1998, \n     when I was hospitalized after a fall and nearly died.\n       Now they tell me I cannot live independently. But I dream \n     every day of going home just one more time. Now, not by \n     choice, I am living in a nursing home. I have a nice room and \n     I am surrounded by others who are just like me. But those of \n     us who still are of sound mind want just to go home again.\n       When my husband and I retired, we thought we had adequate \n     savings. But inflation and high medical costs have taken all \n     of\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\n     my savings. Perhaps I lived too long, but still I want to \n     live.\n       Last year my total income from social security was $6,984, \n     but I managed to keep my home and pay my bills with that. The \n     only other income I had was less than $100 from renting some \n     land. This year my monthly income from social security per \n     month is $582. My checkbook total is now around $1500.\n       The cost of the nursing home is about $92 per day much of \n     which goes to medical costs, not for expensive paid help. If \n     anything, there needs to me more money for paid help.\n       I have been given two options to pay--either sell my home \n     and give up any hope of ever returning or get Public Aid \n     Assistance. In the hope of returning home, I applied for \n     Public Aid. Since my total income is $582 month, out of that \n     I must pay, to keep my home, electricity and gas $74, water \n     and sewer $25, trash pick up $15, house insurance ($367 per \n     year) or $32 per month. I also have paid and want to continue \n     to pay $103 per month for a medicare supplement.\n       That leaves $334 out of my social security to pay the \n     nursing home. And you know what is worse of all, I am made to \n     feel like a failure because I cannot pay out of pocket \n     $36,000 to $40,000 a year for a nursing home. And there are \n     thousands, maybe millions of me throughout this country.\n       Once we could borrow money on just our good names. Now our \n     homes have become the price of our aged care. Soon I fear \n     there will be a ``For Sale'' sign in my front yard and the \n     inexpensive treasures of my life will be divided or \n     discarded.\n       I take no comfort in that I am just one of many of this \n     nation's older citizens who once put a strap around our \n     waist, put our hands to the plow and took this great \n     agricultural nation from a horsepowered economy to the \n     richest most plentiful nation in the world who can put a man \n     on the moon at will.\n       Must we, the elderly, who helped build this country, have \n     to live to see ourselves stripped of our most prized \n     possessions, our homes, our dignity, our freedom and our \n     pride?\n       I know that you and Congress are about to embark on a \n     debate on Social Security and Medicare and other issues that \n     affect those of us who still survive though in our 90's. I \n     hope these debates will go beyond just economics and \n     statistics and look into the faces of those of us who make up \n     this population. We are more than statistics. We all have a \n     story to tell. Once we were all children. Most of us have \n     children and grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n       Once you wrote in a letter to my granddaughter Shirley \n     Roney ``I have worked throughout my life to empower people \n     who historically have been excluded from political, economic \n     and educational opportunities. I remain committed to \n     achieving that goal.''\n       In that particular letter you were speaking of racial \n     relations. I believe you when you say you have done these \n     things. I hope that in the remaining two years of your \n     presidency, you will be able to finish what you have started \n     in the areas of empowering all people who have been excluded \n     from the opportunities for which our sons fought to guarantee \n     to all Americans.\n           God Bless,\n     Vaneeta Allen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6435-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CELLULAR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SAFETY WEEK\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in recent years the advent of the \nwireless phone began an extraordinary advance in the cellular \ntelecommunications industry. As a result the cellular phone has become \nan accessory and a necessity in the modern technological world we \ncurrently live in. It has revolutionized communication, and has helped \nindividuals to constantly stay connected. Today, there are over an \nestimated 200 million wireless phone users around the world. The \nwireless telephone gives individuals the powerful ability to \ncommunicate--almost anywhere, anytime.\n  With the ability of having a cellular phone comes responsibility. As \nNational Wireless Safety Week comes to a conclusion, we must recognize \nthe dangers of having and using cellular telephones, especially when \ndriving. We must also recognize the benefits of having these phones in \nsituations where they are desperately needed. Today, there are over \n98,000 emergency calls made daily by people using wireless phones--\nsaving lives, preventing crimes and assisting in emergency situations. \nFurthermore, according to a recent government study, decreasing \nnotification time when accidents occurs saves lives--a wireless phone \nis a tool to reduce such a time.\n  The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) is the \ninternational organization of the wireless communications industry for \nwireless carriers and manufactures. It is also the coordinator of \nWireless Safety Week, and promotes using phones to summon assistance in \nemergency situations to save lives. It also promotes the concept that \nwhen driving a car, safety is one's first priority. The CTIA has six \nsimple rules to driving safely while using a wireless phone, including:\n  Safe driving is one's first responsibility. Always buckle up; keep \nyour hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.\n  Make sure that one's phone is positioned where is easy to see and \neasy to reach. Be familiar with the operation of one's phone so that \none is comfortable using it on the road.\n  Use the speed dialing feature to program-in frequently called \nnumbers. Then one is able to make a call by touching only one or two \nbuttons. Most phones will store up to 99 numbers.\n  When dialing manually without using the speed dialing feature first, \ndial only when stopped. If one cannot stop, or pull over, dial a few \ndigits, then survey traffic before completing the call.\n  Never take notes while driving. Pull off the road to a safe spot to \njot something down.\n  Be a wireless Samaritan. Dialing 9-1-1 is a free call for wireless \nsubscribers, use it to report crimes in progress or other potentially \nlife-threatening emergencies, accidents, or drunk driving.\n  In a recent national poll, it was found that over 60 percent of \nwireless phone users have called for help in cases of car trouble, \nmedical emergency, or to report a drunk driving crime. Close to 90 \npercent of wireless phone users polled said safety and security were \nthe best reasons for owning a wireless phone.\n  Mr. President. The bottom line is that individuals need to assume \nresponsibility while behind the wheel of a car. No telephone call is \nimportant enough to risk the safety of the driver, passengers, and \nothers on the road. Cellular phones can be a distraction while one is \ndriving a car. I urge drivers to use common sense when driving, and ask \nthat drivers continue to act as good Samaritans. I also want to \nrecognize the efforts of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry \nAssociation, and congratulate them for a successful Wireless Safety \nWeek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6435-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6435-S6437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB CLARKE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Bob \nClarke, who has served for nearly 15 years as President of Vermont \nTechnical College in Randolph. Under Bob's leadership, VTC has seen its \nannual budget quadruple, its annual donations have increased twelve-\nfold, and VTC's standing in the community has grown immensely.\n  Bob brought to VTC a new perspective for technical education. He has \nestablished unique relationships between VTC and the high-tech \ncommunity. Currently, Vermont Technical College is providing training \nto employees of companies such as IBM, BF Goodrich Aerospace, and Bell \nAtlantic. In addition, Bob has listened to the concerns of small \nbusinesses in the state. When Vermont faced a shortage of trained auto \nmechanics, he established a training program in automotive technology. \nHis willingness to listen to the needs of the business community has \nresulted in increased opportunities for VTC students and alumni alike, \nand VTC has created a qualified pool of applicants to meet the growing \nneeds of Vermont's high-tech industry.\n  Over the years, I have worked closely with Bob and VTC on issues \nincluding education, workforce retraining and business development. I \nhave been most impressed with Bob's innovation in addressing the \nevolving needs of the business community. His work is truly inspiring \nand the results have been felt across the state. Bob has truly raised \nthe bar for technical colleges around the country.\n  An article recently appeared in the Vermont Sunday Magazine which \ndetails Bob's accomplishments during his tenure as President of Vermont \nTechnical College. I ask that this article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From Vermont Sunday Magazine, May 23, 1999]\n\n                          Cutting-Edge Clarke\n\n                            (By Jack Crowl)\n\n       Bob Clarke doesn't exactly fit the central-casting image of \n     a New England college president. He doesn't have an Ivy \n     League degree; in fact he doesn't have a traditional academic \n     Ph. D. at all. Neither does he have a particularly \n     deferential air toward the life\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\n     of the mind, nor the aversion to cozy relationships with \n     businesses that many academic leaders fear might skew their \n     priorities and jeopardize their indpendence.\n       Instead, the president of Vermont Technical College is best \n     known for his impish grin, the twang in his speech--he's from \n     the Eastern Shore of Maryland--a love of fast cars, and a \n     passion for hard work and getting things done. Pass him on \n     the street unknowingly and you'd likely say, ``That guy must \n     be a salesman.''\n       Which he is. Largely by selling himself and his institution \n     to a bevy of businesses, Clarke has transformed that small \n     and sleepy two-year, engineering-technlogy school into a \n     statewide dynamo with substantial influence in the highest \n     circles of industry, education, and government.\n       In his nearly 15 years as head of VTC, Clarke has seen its \n     annual budget grow from about $5 million to more than $21 \n     million, plus more than $13 million in new or renovated \n     buildings and facilities. Additionally, the college has spent \n     more than $750,000 a year over the past decade on new \n     equipment and for several years has boasted of a totally \n     ``wired'' campus for the information age.\n       Gifts and grants that once amounted to a paltry $25,000 a \n     year now total $3 million annually. And the endowment fund, \n     which didn't even exist when Clarke arrived in 1984, now \n     amounts to about $3.6 million, VTC employs nearly 500 people \n     and offers two-year associate degrees in 18 different \n     technical areas, plus two recently added bachelor's degrees.\n       But Clarke's contributions to Vermont are more significant \n     than simply the upgrading of a single institution, important \n     as that may be. In the process of selling VTC, he's also been \n     selling the concept of higher education to more and more \n     people. He's played a big role in changing the tenor of \n     public discussion about the importance of higher education \n     and helped move the debate from the theoretical realm of \n     ideas to the practical world of jobs and profits.\n       At meetings large and small throughout the state, Clarke \n     continually chants his twin mantras about the importance of \n     techology in our modern society and the crucial role that \n     higher education plays in a healthy economy because of that, \n     ``We have to have higher education as the centerpiece of our \n     economic development plans or we're going to be in trouble \n     when the next recession hits,'' he says.\n       Clarke was a member of Vermont's Higher Education Financing \n     Commission, which last winter urged substantial increases in \n     state funds for colleges and students, and whose \n     recommendations have been taken seriously by the governor and \n     legislature. He brought Massachusetts economist Paul \n     Harrington, an adherent of using occupational-education \n     programs to help boost the economy, to the attention of the \n     panel. Harrington's ideas were important in its \n     deliberations.\n       Some traditional academic types are somewhat dismissive of \n     Clarke in private, calling him a ``showboat'' or an ``empire \n     builder.'' But he has big fans in business and government, \n     and he has converted some of his harshest critics over the \n     years. ``If a college president's job is to promote the \n     institution and raise money, then by God, he does the job \n     well,'' says Russ Mills, a longtime VTC faculty member and \n     former president of the state-college faculty union. ``He \n     does a good job of making the college indispensable to the \n     business community,'' he adds.\n       And Clarke's boss, Chancellor Charles Bunting of the state-\n     college system, calls the VTC president ``an outstanding \n     model of leadership.''\n       Robert G. Clarke was born in Lewes, Del. (best known in the \n     mid-Atlantic area as the terminus of a ferry line across \n     Delaware Bay from Cape May, N.J.), but his family soon moved \n     further south on the Eastern Shore to the tiny Maryland town \n     of Snow Hill. After high school, he spent two years at nearby \n     Salisbury State College, where he met his future wife.\n       He then joined the Air Force, where he spent seven years, \n     picking up along the way a bachelor's degree in occupational \n     education from Southern Illinois University and a master's \n     degree in the same field from Central Washington State \n     College.\n       In 1978, Clarke joined the faculty of Northampton Community \n     College in Bethlehem, Penn., where in six years, he rose to \n     Dean of Business, Engineering and Technology while also \n     earning a doctorate in Higher Education Administration and \n     Supervision at Lehigh University.\n       In 1984, VTC was in the doldrums. Its enrollment was \n     declining. No new buildings had been built in 12 years. It \n     had no endowment and few private gifts. The Vermont State \n     College trustees tapped the 33-year-old Clarke, giving him \n     the charge to rescue the college and lead it to new heights. \n     The rest, as they say, is history.\n       Last fall, the state Chamber of Commerce honored Clarke as \n     the 1998 Vermont Citizen of the Year and the accolades flew \n     fast and furiously. Vermont's entire congressional \n     delegation, state and college officials, and businesspeople \n     of all stripes joined in paeans to Clarke's hard work, \n     vision, and leadership. He was called, in no particular \n     order, ``A man who fixes things;''. ``A man in a hurry;'' and \n     ``Not just a man with a plan, but a man who gets things \n     done.''\n       Said Gov. Howard Dean, who presented the award: ``Bob \n     Clarke was talking about workplace investments and public-\n     private partnerships before anybody else knew what they \n     were.'' And, he added, ``What I know best about (him) is his \n     ubiquity. I've never been to any meeting about education and \n     jobs, in my 7\\1/2\\ years as governor, that he or someone who \n     works for him wasn't either at the meeting or was next on the \n     appointment list.''\n       In his acceptance speech, Clarke noted that it was \n     relatively rare for both an educator and a non-native-\n     Vermonter to receive the coveted award, and that he was awed \n     to be mentioned in the company of the other honorees--most of \n     them governors, statesmen, or captains of industry. He \n     unsurprisingly reviewed his college's accomplishments and \n     thanked his colleagues. But he ended on a different, bolder \n     note. ``Much still needs to be done,'' he said. ``Consider \n     that:\n       ``Vermont ranks 49th among the states in per capita support \n     of higher education.\n       ``Unlike most states, Vermont's two-year colleges receive \n     no local support.\n       ``Vermont has no post-secondary vocational education \n     system.\n       ``There is a tremendous state need for workforce education \n     and training.\n       ``There is a shortage of skilled Vermonters to fill high-\n     paying jobs.''\n       At the end of the banquet, the Chamber of Commerce's chair, \n     Millie Merrill, announced that the organization's board that \n     day had unanimously and strongly endorsed the concept of \n     additional funds for higher education. When Clarke arrived \n     the next morning at a meeting of the Higher Education \n     Financing Commission, the assembled college presidents and \n     state legislators gave him a standing ovation.\n       The chief feather in Clarke's off-campus cap is the IBM \n     Educational Consortium, under which VTC, is partnership with \n     the University of Vermont and the other state colleges, \n     manages all employee education and training for the state's \n     largest private employer. The consortium has 22 full-time \n     employees on-site at IBM. Gov. Dean lauds it as ``a model \n     program, not only for the state but for the whole country.''\n       Landing the IBM contract was a major coup for Clarke and \n     VTC. The big computer manufacturer has for many years taken \n     great pride in running its own training department, and it \n     took some serious horse-trading and a trial period before IBM \n     officials agreed to turn over all their training to the \n     consortium.\n       In many other places, a small two-year college would be \n     expected to be only a junior partner in such an arrangement, \n     not the organizer. But, says Clarke, with obvious pride: ``We \n     do education and training. We're good at it. Often businesses \n     are not. That's why I job out my campus food service and \n     bookstore operations to outside experts.''\n       That's not, of course, VTC's only business-training \n     contract. Clarke has developed a slew of them, and he's been \n     willing and able to make special arrangements for companies \n     with different needs whenever traditional training programs \n     seem unlikely to work. Two examples:\n       He's delivering a program that leads to a two-year degree \n     in engineering technology on the premises of BF Goodrich \n     Aerospace in Vergennes. In that partnership, Goodrich \n     executives are working with the VTC faculty to develop the \n     curriculum, and faculty members travel across the state to \n     teach the courses.\n       He's arranged for selected Bell Atlantic employees, who are \n     scattered all over the state, to come to the VTC campus in \n     central Vermont once a week to work toward a degree in \n     telecommunications technology. The telephone company \n     orchestrates the work schedules of student-employees to \n     accommodate the program.\n       Clarke likes to point out tat ``90 per cent of Vermont \n     companies have fewer than 20 employees. We need better \n     training not linked to specific programs.'' So in 1992, the \n     college took over the Vermont Small Business Development \n     Center, which had been housed at the University of Vermont. \n     Since then, it has served more than 7,000 clients, providing \n     small Vermont companies with counseling, training, help in \n     marketing and financial management, and assistance in finding \n     money for startups or expansion. As part of its outreach \n     program, the center maintains offices at five different sites \n     around the state.\n       The center helps put on trade shows and seminars and works \n     in conjunction with other colleges, state agencies, trade \n     associations, and the federal Small Business Administration \n     (which provides most of its operating funds).\n       It also maintains an environmental assistance program, \n     which conducts workshops and confidential environmental \n     assessments for businesses that Clarke maintains might be \n     reluctant to deal directly with government agencies, which \n     have the power to levy penalties for rules violations.\n       Vermont Interactive Television is another pioneering Clarke \n     innovation. Headquartered on the VTC campus in Randolph, it \n     coordinates 12 sites around the state, where businesses, \n     government officials, educators, and non-profit organizations \n     can conduct meetings, training, and hear and see what folks \n     at the other sites are saying and doing, all without the \n     costly statewide travel that can be onerous or even dangerous \n     during winter.\n       VIT has been in operation for more than 10 years. It has a \n     contract with the state for meetings and training, and it \n     collects user fees for non-state-government meetings. \n     Individual sites donate the use of their facilities. A 1996 \n     study reported that the state government was saving some 55 \n     percent on\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\n     meetings conducted over VIT instead of having employees \n     travel around the state to one central location. Many \n     committees of the state legislature conduct public hearings \n     via interactive television, so they can collect input from \n     citizens without forcing them to travel to Montpelier.\n       A more recent innovation is the Vermont Manufacturing \n     Extension Center, a joint venture among VTC, the state's \n     Department of Economic Development, and a couple of units of \n     the U.S. Department of Commerce. In three years, this center \n     has worked with more than 500 Vermont manufacturers in \n     projects involving a number of trade associations, colleges, \n     and other non-profit organizations.\n       The center has been in the forefront of efforts to raise \n     Vermonters' awareness about the potential problems of Y2K or \n     the Millennium Bug, which could cause most computers to \n     malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, because they may not be able to \n     recognize the date. VMEC is closely affiliated with the \n     state's Y2K Council and it's working with manufacturers to \n     identify and head off any computer problems that could occur.\n       Whenever his institution lacks the expertise to pull off a \n     full-fledged training program on its own, Clarke develops \n     partnerships with other post-secondary institutions. Too many \n     exist to name here, but VTC currently has 18 such joint \n     projects with the University of Vermont alone.\n       Meanwhile, back on the campus, Clarke encourages \n     innovation, but he runs a tight ship. Too tight for some \n     faculty members, who over the years have chafed at the \n     directions he wants to take the school, the speed with which \n     he likes to make changes, and his impatience with those who \n     disagree with him.\n       Early in his tenure, one teacher who was vocally less than \n     enthusiastic about Clarke's plans did not have his contract \n     renewed, despite the strong support of the rest of the \n     faculty, who felt he was an outstanding teacher. Incensed, \n     the faculty called for Clarke's resignation by a two-to-one \n     margin. Clarke refused to resign, and he was wholeheartedly \n     backed by the state-college trustees. That ended the faculty \n     rebellion, but left many teachers with a long-simmering \n     dislike and distrust of the president.\n       Some faculty leaders now argue that Clarke has changed \n     since that confrontation. They think he's a bit more fair-\n     minded and can now consider others' points of view, even when \n     he disagrees with them. ``He's developed a delicate touch in \n     personnel matters,'' says Russ Mills, the veteran faculty \n     member, who thinks that, if confronted with the same \n     situation again, Clarke would react differently today.\n       Nonetheless, there's no question that Clarke likes to be in \n     control of what's happening on his campus. Even today, he \n     boasts that he personally interviews all finalists for campus \n     jobs.\n       A quick review of several campus innovations by Clarke and \n     his academic colleagues offers some idea of the breadth of \n     his interests and concerns:\n       Several years ago, the college took over the state's \n     training programs for Licensed Practical Nurses. It continued \n     to offer the standard one-year program at four sites \n     throughout the state, but added a second year for students \n     interested in becoming Registered Nurses. And it offers \n     academic credit for its programs, so that nursing students \n     who wish to get bachelor's degrees can transfer to a four-\n     year institution.\n       In 1989, the Vermont Academy of Science and Technology was \n     founded. Under that program, gifted Vermont high-school \n     students can enroll at VTC and simultaneously complete their \n     final year of high school and their first year of college \n     work. VTC is accredited as a private high school for that \n     purpose. Students who complete that year's work can continue \n     there or transfer to another college.\n       The college plays host every summer to a Women-in-\n     Technology program. About 250 young women spend a week on \n     campus, where they engage in classes, seminars and workshops \n     with female scientists and engineers, as a way of providing \n     role models and encouraging more young women to consider \n     careers in science and technology.\n       The Vermont Automobile Dealers' Association, worried about \n     a critical shortage of auto technicians who can deal with the \n     technology of modern cars, built and equipped an automotive \n     technology center on the VTC campus, so that the college \n     could add a two-year degree program in automotive technology. \n     It now also provides scholarships for auto tech students.\n       Clarke seems to be willing to talk with just about any \n     interest group that could conceivably help his institution. \n     He once struck a deal with the state to buy a farm adjacent \n     to the campus where officials wanted to locate a veterans' \n     cemetery. He agreed to manage the cemetery--and VTC still \n     does--in order to get the remainder of the land for campus \n     expansion.\n       Not all such proposals come to fruition, however. Clarke \n     offered land to the Woodstock-based Vermont Institute of \n     Natural Science when it was looking for a new home last year \n     (it decided to move elsewhere) and he had serious \n     negotiations with Gifford Hospital in Randolph (where he once \n     served on the board) to establish a nursing home that didn't \n     work out, either. It was during that time, when negotiations \n     were also under way for an early-childhood education program, \n     that one faculty wag observed at a VTC meeting: ``Now we can \n     have it all--cradle to grave, without leaving campus.''\n       What's next on the agenda for Clarke? For starters, he says \n     he's committed to staying in Vermont. He admits that when he \n     first took the job, he viewed it as a stepping stone, but he \n     says the people here have been so welcoming and unlike the \n     flinty New Englander stereotype, that he and his wife Glenda \n     have fallen in love with the state and plan to stay. The \n     college provides housing on the campus for the president, so \n     the Clarkes built a ``weekend'' home in Addison, near Lake \n     Champlain.\n       On the college front, he's planning more relationships with \n     businesses. He's working to develop one with IDX, the \n     Burlington-based medical-software company, which recently \n     announced an expansion. He hopes to provide a six-month \n     program of technical training to liberal-arts graduates.\n       Clarke also wants to assist Vermont businesses to get into \n     what he calls ``e-commerce,'' selling their wares over the \n     Internet. ``We know the technology and we can help,'' he \n     says. ``Most businesses are barely scratching the surface.''\n       And he wants to encourage the state to come up with a \n     coordinated effort to deal with vocational-technical \n     education.\n       He applauds the efforts of the Higher Education Financing \n     Commission on which he sat, but feels the key to having its \n     recommendations work is a multi-year commitment by the state. \n     For example, he notes that the new Trust Fund just passed by \n     the Legislature is about $8 million to start and its use is \n     limited to the earnings from the amount.\n       ``It's an important first step,'' he says, ``but one that \n     will have marginal impact until it grows.'' For each of the \n     state colleges, the fund will produce about $20,000 a year \n     for scholarships as it now stands. He's disappointed, \n     however, that there are no ``workforce development'' funds. \n     Most states provide funds for training and re-training \n     workers, but in Vermont the cost must be borne entirely by \n     the companies.\n       Unless, of course, some clever entrepreneur somewhere--\n     someone like Bob Clarke--can find the money and the backing \n     to put a package together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6437-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING COLORADO STATE SENATOR TILMAN BISHOP\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the passing \nof an eminent teacher, scientist and academic administrator in my \nstate. On Tuesday, May 18, Jim Bethel, Dean Emeritus of the University \nof Washington's College of Forest Resources, died in a Seattle \nhospital.\n  Dean Bethel was one of the Nation's most prominent and influential \nforestry leaders and was recognized both nationally and \ninternationally. During his 17-year tenure as Dean from 1964 to 1981, \nhe was a principal architect of creative educational innovations and \nrelated research programs that have endured in one way or another to \nthis day. Furthermore, his extensive experience and leadership in \ninternational forestry affairs has contributed greatly to the College's \ninvolvement in international academic and research activities.\n  As an administrator, Dean Bethel set an undeniably high standard for \nhis successors, faculty and administrators to emulate. Dean Bethel was \nresponsible for initiating the College's pulp and paper program and the \nCenter for Quantitative Science. Under his leadership, the College was \nrepeatedly ranked among the top five forestry institutions in the U.S. \nIncidentally, while Dean, Bethel never gave up teaching two \nundergraduate courses, conducting personal research and advising \ngraduate students.\n  Bethel received a BS degree from the University of Washington and \nadvanced degrees at Duke University. In fact, he was one of the first \nindividuals to be granted a Doctor of Forestry. Bethel held faculty \nappointments at Pennsylvania State University and Virginia Polytechnic \nUniversity. During a 10-year stint at North Carolina State University, \nhe was Professor and the Director of the Wood Products Laboratory and \nacting Dean of the Graduate School. He worked at the National Science \nFoundation for three years prior to becoming the Associate Dean of the \nGraduate School at the University of Washington. He also served as \nProfessor and subsequently the Dean of the College of Forest Resources.\n  Several organizations recognized Bethel's scientific contribution: he \nwas elected fellow of the Society of American Foresters, the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science and the International \nAcademy of Wood Sciences. He served on various boards and was a \nconsultant to the National Academy of Sciences. Bethel also served on \nthe President's Council on Environmental Quality. He was one of the \nfounders of the Forest Products Research Society.\n  Bethel has significantly influenced the lives of many professional \nforesters. Perhaps his greatest and most enduring professional legacy \nare his graduate students who went on to responsible and successful \npositions, and the impressive list of professional journal articles and \nbooks.\n  Dean Bethel will be missed by those concerned about the scientific \nstewardship of forest resources in my State and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6438-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6438-S6439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PLIGHT OF THE KURDISH PEOPLE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for the plight of \nthe Kurdish people living in Northern Iraq and Eastern Turkey. They \nhave been victims of some of the most egregious human rights abuses in \nrecent years including brutal military attack, random murder, and \nforced exile from their homes. While American efforts in Northern Iraq \nhave greatly improved the plight of the Kurds, there is certainly much \nroom for improvement both there and in Turkey.\n  In 1988, the world was stunned by the horrific pictures of the bodies \nof innocent Kurds disfigured by the effects of a poison gas attack by \nSaddam Hussein. We may never know exactly how many people died in that \nparticular attack due to Saddam Hussein's efforts to cover up his \nculpability. The number of victims, however, is most likely in the \nthousands.\n  This was certainly not Iraq's first deplorable attack on the Kurds \nand, sadly, it was not destined to be the last. Yet, this attack \ncontinues to represent a stark milestone in the long list of deplorable \ndeeds Saddam Hussein has perpetrated against his own people.\n  In recent years, however, the United States has come to the aid of \nthe Kurds of Northern Iraq. At the conclusion of the Gulf War, the \nUnited States and our allies established ``no-fly'' zones over Northern \nand Southern Iraq. These zones, plus the damage the Iraqi military \nsustained during Operation Desert Storm, have mercifully curtailed \nSaddam Hussein's ability to attack the Kurds in Northern Iraq. Mr. \nPresident, the men and women of the United States Air Force who risk \nIraqi anti-aircraft fire over Iraq each day in order to enforce these \nno-fly zones deserve our support and commendation. Not only do their \nefforts protect nations throughout the region and around the world from \nSaddam Hussein's aggression, but their daily flights serve as sentries \nagainst human rights abuses.\n  Mr. President, the United States has taken other, more direct actions \nto help the Kurds of Northern Iraq. Following the Gulf War, the United \nStates Agency for International Development worked to provide important \nhumanitarian assistance to Iraqi Kurds. When Iraqi incursions into the \nregion once again threatened the lives of thousands of innocent \ncivilians, the United States worked to evacuate more than 6,500 people \nto the safety of Guam. Many were later granted asylum in the United \nStates.\n  Our relationship with the Kurdish people of Northern Iraq is not a \none-way street. More than 2,000 of the Kurds who the United States \nevacuated in 1996 were either employees of American relief agencies or \nfamily members of those employees. Others have provided invaluable \nintelligence information to the United States.\n  As I mentioned earlier, many Kurds also live in Eastern Turkey. A \nminority of Turkish Kurds have taken up arms against the democratically \nelected Turkish government in a bid for independence. Unfortunately, \nboth sides in this internal conflict are guilty of human rights abuses \nagainst innocent Kurdish civilians.\n  The Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has devolved into a terrorist \norganization targeting not only Turkish military and police forces but \ninnocent Kurdish civilians as well. While reliable estimates of the \nnumber of victims are extremely hard to come by, it is clear that \nthousands, probably tens of thousands, have died at the hands of the \nPKK.\n  As is often the case, neither side in the dispute holds a monopoly on \nhuman rights abuses. The PKK's actions unquestionably demand a response \nfrom the Turkish government. Rather than a measured and targeted \nresponse, however, Turkey has declared a state of emergency in a large \nportion of Eastern Turkey, directly affecting more than 4 million of \nits citizens.\n  Under the state of emergency, Turkey has severely rationed food, \nleading to great hardship amongst innocent civilians. In addition, \nTurkey has forced hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes, \nleaving more than 2,600 towns and villages mere ghost towns.\n  These actions are all aimed at suppressing the PKK's terrorism. Yet, \nthe government has actively targeted not only known terrorists but \nthose believed to agree with the PKK's goal of independence--although \nperhaps not their methods--as well. Even those who support neither the \nPKK's goals nor their means suffer at the hands of the Turkish military \nand police forces.\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\n Thus, Turkey's Kurdish population is under attack from both sides \nwithout any place to hide.\n  Turkey is both a democracy and an important ally of the United \nStates. In Kosovo and Bosnia, Turkey has stood firmly with other NATO \nmembers against human rights abuses. In recent weeks, Turkey has opened \nits borders to tens of thousands of innocent Kosovars desperate to \nescape Slobodan Milosevic's murderous rampage. Turkey, along with our \nother NATO allies, deserves a great deal of credit for its principled \nstand in the Balkans. In fact, Turkey has allowed the United States to \nenforce the no-fly zone over Northern Iraq from our air force base on \nTurkish soil.\n  Yet, it would be inappropriate for us to overlook Turkey's human \nrights abuses against its own people simply because of its commendable \nactions elsewhere. Mr. President, the intentional murder of innocent \nnon-combatants is an anathema to the United States regardless of where \nit occurs or who the perpetrator is. Thus, the PKK's efforts to \nintimidate others by random murder, certainly not indicative of all \nKurds, deserves our condemnation as does Turkey's abuse of its own \ninnocent citizens in the pursuit of terrorists.\n  Mr. President, we must never let our nation's commitment to the \nprotection of human rights lapse. As we sit here today, the human \nrights of an entire race of people in Turkey and Iraq are under \nassault. I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning these \nabuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6439-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO COGGESHALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n   Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Coggeshall \nElementary School of Newport, Rhode Island, which this year celebrates \nits 100th anniversary.\n  Coggeshall has seen much since it opened to students in 1899. It has \nseen the rise of the automobile, the invention of the airplane, and the \nemergence of the Internet. It has weathered the great hurricanes of \n1938 and 1954. It was around for 5 Boston Red Sox World Series wins and \nall the summers and autumns of bitter defeat since the last in 1918. \nCoggeshall has seen its graduates serve in two World Wars. It has seen \nits female students earn the right to vote.\n  Since Coggeshall opened its doors, the sound barrier and the four \nminute mile were broken, Charles Lindburg traversed the Atlantic, Neil \nArmstrong walked on the moon, and Rosa Parks ignited the Civil Rights \nmovement.\n  Mr. President, Coggeshall Elementary has not only experienced \nhistory, it has shaped it. Coggeshall and its teachers have had an \nimpact on generations of Newport's students. The school's influence is \ncertain to reach far into the future.\n  I want to take this opportunity to commend Coggeshall Elementary for \nits continuing legacy to Rhode Island--its students.\n  Recently, Jessica Perry, a fifth grade student at Coggeshall, penned \na history of the school. I ask unanimous consent that her paper be \nprinted in the Record, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Coggeshall Elementary on its 100th anniversary.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                History of Coggeshall Elementary School\n\n                      (By Jessica Perry, Grade 5)\n\n       Coggeshall Elementary School was built beginning 1898. It \n     opened to students in 1899. This year Coggeshall will be \n     celebrating its 100th anniversary.\n       When Coggeshall was first opened there was a boys and girls \n     entrance, boys had to go in one door and the girls had to go \n     in the other door. Boys and girls almost always rode their \n     bicycles so they had a bike room. Where the library is now is \n     where the boys bike room was located. Where the kitchen is \n     now was the girls bike room. There was no office. There were \n     only four classrooms each on the 1st and 2nd floor.\n       The school had been open for a short period of time in the \n     spring of 1899. June 24, 1899 was the formal dedication. The \n     keys were given to mayor Boyle and Superintendent of Schools \n     Baker. At the same time there was a graduation of Miss \n     Gilpan's class. The girls wore white dresses and the stage \n     was decorated with flowers. Lots of important people were \n     there. Children sang and read their essays they had written, \n     the newspaper said the school was the best constructed \n     building of its kind they had ever seen. They said it had \n     ``tinted walls, high ceilings and pleasant prospects.'' Mr. \n     Denniston and Mr. Belle donated the flag and flag pole.\n       From 1936-1971 there was a half-day kindergarten class as \n     well as grades one to six. In the fall of 1976 grade six was \n     moved to the Sullivan School. Now the sixth grade is located \n     at the Thompson Middle School. Coggeshall has always had a \n     kindergarten class until 1981. There was no kindergarten that \n     year. In 1982 the kindergarten came back. It left again in \n     1990 for one year. In 1996 an all day kindergarten was begun \n     at the school.\n       Throughout the years changes have been made to the school. \n     There are new chimneys, we added a fire escape, new school \n     sign, parking lot, new windows and shrubs. There are also \n     telephone poles, electric wires and cars that were not here \n     in 1899!\n       Since 1936 there have been 12 principals, the principal \n     that was here the longest is Mary Ryan. She stayed for 14 \n     years! The principal that stayed the shortest is Dr. Mary \n     Koring. She worked here for only one year. In the early years \n     the principals Charles Carter, Irvin Henshaw, and Leo \n     Connerton was the principal of Sheffield School and \n     Coggeshall School. After the 1950's the principal was only in \n     charge of Coggeshall School. Mr. Borgueta is the \n     Superintendent of Schools now and Mr. Frizelle is the \n     principal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6439-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6439-S6440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ``NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAmerica's small businesses--the backbone of our nation's vibrant \neconomy. As my colleagues may know, this week is recognized as \n``National Small Business Week.''\n  As a former small businessman, I believe small businesses have always \nbeen one of the leading providers of jobs throughout our communities. \nToday, there are over 24 million small businesses that serve as the \nprincipal source of new jobs, employing more than 52 percent of the \nprivate workforce.\n  In particular, I am very proud of the tremendous growth in women-\nowned businesses over the last several years. According to the National \nFoundation for Women Business Owners, there are more than 166,000 \nwomen-owned businesses in my home state of Minnesota, employing 349,800 \npeople and generating $42.3 billion in sales. Between 1987 and 1996 the \nnumber of women-owned businesses increased dramatically, by over 73 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, one of the unique aspects of Minnesota's small \nbusiness community is the large number of high-tech companies \nthroughout our state. I certainly envision an important role for small, \nhigh-technology businesses in meeting the nation's science and \ntechnology in the years ahead. Small businesses account for 28 percent \nof jobs in high-technology sectors and represent 96 percent of all \nexporters, underscoring the important role the small business community \nwill have toward developing a 21st century economy that is globally and \ntechnologically driven.\n  During ``National Small Business Week,'' I am proud to share with my \ncolleagues the special recognition recently granted by the Small \nBusiness Administration to two dedicated Minnesotans: Comfrey Mayor \nLinda Wallin and Ms. Supenn Harrison, a restaurateur in Minneapolis.\n  Mr. President, in 1997 several communities in Minnesota were \nthreatened by terrible tornadoes and floods. Almost immediately, Mayor \nWallin provided courageous leadership to protect the community of \nComfrey from this dangerous natural disaster. In addition to \nestablishing a command center to coordinate efforts to rebuild and \nprovide relief to residents, Mayor Wallin secured assistance from the \nSBA to rebuild a civic center, a new library, and an elementary school. \nThis year, the SBA has honored her with the ``Phoenix Award'' for those \nwho have displayed confidence, optimism, and love of community while \nsurmounting near disaster.\n  Ms. Supenn Harrison, a successful CEO of Sawatdee, a Thai restaurant \nin Minneapolis, represents the finest of Minnesota's small business \nowners. Ms. Harrison is Minnesota's 1999 honoree as one of the fifty \nfinalists to be considered for the National Small Business Person of \nthe Year. Ms. Harrison's investment in her company and employees \nthrough constant efforts to update equipment, implement new marketing \nstrategies, and encourage high employee morale underscores her \ncommitment to a strong economy.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the contributions of \nMinnesota's\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\nsmall business community during ``National Small Business Week.'' I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to promote an economic \nclimate where small businesses can succeed through federal regulatory \nrelief, tax reduction, a skilled workforce, and free trade \npolicies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6440-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       POLICE OFFICER PERRIN LOVE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe heroism of Officer Perrin Love, a private in the Charleston Police \nDepartment. Officer Love died a tragic death last Saturday morning, \nwhen he was accidentally shot by his partner while pursuing an armed \nsuspect.\n  Hard-working, dedicated, and courageous, Police Officer Perrin Love \nwas a credit to the Force and the City of Charleston. All who knew him \nliked and respected him, and though he was only a rookie, everyone on \nthe Charleston Police Force believed he had a bright future as a law \nenforcement officer. Officer Love graduated first in his class from the \nPolice Academy in Portland, Oregon, and had earned high marks for his \nperformance on the Charleston Force. He earned his first stripe earlier \nthan most new officers on the Charleston Force.\n  Public service and devotion to duty were the hallmarks of Perrin \nLove's life. Before becoming a police officer, he served with \ndistinction in the United States Navy. As the Charleston Post and \nCourier wrote in its memorial to Officer Love: ``Officer Perrin `Ricky' \nLove was doing exactly what he wanted when he died Friday. He was \nwearing a uniform, serving the public, and enforcing laws he believed \nin.''\n  Mr. President, men and women like Officer Love are a credit to their \nfamilies, to their uniforms, and to this nation. Law officers like \nPerrin Love always give me hope for our future. These brave souls \ncontinue to patrol our cities, enforce our laws, and protect our lives \nand property at great risk, asking nothing in return except the \nprivilege to wear their uniforms and the knowledge that they have the \nhard-won respect of their neighbors and their peers.\n  According to his fellow officers, Officer Love embodied all the \nqualities one wants in an officer of the law: he was brave and \ndedicated to serving his fellow citizens and the law, but he also loved \nhis community and worked hard to establish good relations with everyone \non his beat. His tragic death is a blow to his family, to his fellow \nofficers, and to the City of Charleston.\n  I join all the people of Charleston in mourning his passing and \nexpressing my most sincere condolences to his sister, Jennifer Love, \nand his parents, Joshua and Nancy Love. I hope the knowledge that the \nentire community laments the loss of such an honorable and admirable \nman as Officer Love will be of some small comfort to them in their time \nof grief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6440-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO TEN YEARS OF SERVING THE SOUTH'S FINEST BARBEQUE\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Mr. \nOscar Poole, affectionately known as ``Colonel'' in the north Georgia \ntown of Ellijay, who on June 4th will be celebrating his tenth year of \nbusiness as one of our great state's foremost authorities on barbecue. \nThroughout his ten years of service in this little town resting in the \nscenic foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, Colonel Poole has served \ncustomers both far and wide, from nearly every state in the Union, and \nmore than several countries.\n  The grassy embankment behind this now landmark establishment, pays \ntribute to the many thousands of customers that have passed through the \ntown of Ellijay to eat the Colonel's barbecue. The embankment, referred \nto as the ``Pig Hill of Fame,'' is covered by nearly 4,000 \npersonalized, painted, and pig shaped signs. Individuals, families, \ntour groups, friends, Sunday school classes, and celebrities have each \nhad pigs erected to memorialize their visit to one of the South's \ngreatest places for barbecue. In fact, I am fortunate enough to have a \nsign in my name on this famed hill. As many in the South know, politics \nand barbecue go hand in hand. Therefore, it comes as no surprise to \nlearn that governors, congressmen, Senators, statesmen, and even \nPresidential candidates have made the voyage to Colonel Poole's.\n  Colonel Poole's reputation supersedes our state's boundaries. On \nthree separate occasions he was the highlight of Capitol Hill. On his \nfirst trip to Washington, the Colonel arrived at the steps of the \nCapitol in his large yellow PigMobile and in his colorful and patriotic \nsuit to deliver his hickory smoked pork to the entire Georgia \ndelegation and their staffs. Much to the dismay of some in the \ndelegation, word about real Georgia barbecue got around Washington so \nfast that the Colonel's rations, enough for 450 people, quickly ran \nout. On another occasion, I had the opportunity to serve what may be \none of Georgia's finest kept secrets to several of my friends and \ncolleagues here in the Senate who meet for a weekly lunch.\n  While most know the Colonel as a barbecue maestro, he is a wearer of \nmany hats. His customers know he is also a pianist. Others know of him \nas a preacher. This man with a big heart is all of these things and \nmore.\n  Inside his tin covered, pine wood restaurant the Colonel plays \nclassical music, show tunes, and almost every customer request. Having \nlearned to play the piano at an early age, Mr. Poole has long since \nappreciated his gift as a musician. His ability to play was good enough \nto put himself through the Methodist seminary where he was ordained a \nminister.\n  His work in the Church, as a preacher and a missionary, took him to \nmany rural communities here in the South and to developing countries \nlike Brazil. It was this sort of compassion that enabled a north \nGeorgia gentleman named Wendell Cross to approach the Colonel for \ninstruction on how to read. Mr. Cross, a sixty year old man, had spent \nhis entire life not knowing how to read. That was until Mr. Poole took \nhim under his wing and worked with him on a daily basis for nearly \ntwelve months. Eventually Mr. Cross learned to read. The story of \ncompassion and friendship received nationwide media coverage and was \nshown on the popular ``Today Show.''\n  More importantly, two days before the tenth anniversary of his \nbusiness, Colonel Poole will be celebrating his 49th, I repeat, 49th \nyear of marriage to his lovely wife, Edna Poole. This is a milestone \nthat anyone would be extremely proud, and I am happy to report that the \nPoole's will have four sons--Michael, Greg, Keith, and Darvin--to help \nthem celebrate this milestone.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I would like to commend Colonel Oscar \nPoole on his tenth year of business and his 49th year of marriage. \nDuring this time when there are discussions of the direction of today's \nculture, Colonel Poole is an example of how leading one's life by a \ncore set of good, American values--faith, family, and country--will \nresult in a life of many successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6440-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6440-S6441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WELCOME TO EDRINA AND LISELA DUSHAJ\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to tell the story of the Dushaj family. Several years ago \nPranvera and Zenun Dushaj left their native Albania and were granted \npolitical asylum in the United States. They settled in the Bronx, New \nYork where they found a place to live and both found jobs. \nUnfortunately, at the time they left Albania they could not bring their \ntwo young daughters, Edrina and Lisela, with them. They had to stay \nbehind with their grandmother.\n  As soon as they were eligible, the Dushaj family applied for \npermission to bring their children to the United States. The family \ncame to my office last year seeking assistance in getting the I-730 \npetitions approved. Last fall, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService granted the petitions for both daughters.\n  All was set. The Dushaj children could now join their parents in this \ncountry. All they needed were immigrant visas, but therein lay the \nproblem. Because of recent fighting and the threat of terrorist \nactivity, consular services at our Embassy in Albania were all but shut \ndown, providing only emergency services to American citizens. The \nembassy was no longer able to process the needed visas.\n  I note that this was occurring this March just as the conflict with \nSerbia was coming to a head. The Dushaj children were stuck in Albania \nand their\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nparents were quite concerned. To make matters worse, they lived in \nBijram-Curri, a city in the Tropoja region which is less than half an \nhour from the Kosovo border.\n  Albanians were being instructed to contact the American Embassy in \nItaly or Greece to obtain visas. This presented a problem for the \nDushaj family. With the start of the NATO bombing campaign, it became \nnearly impossible to get from Albania to Italy, either by sea or air, \nand anti-American demonstrations outside our embassy in Athens made the \nDushaj family reluctant to send their four and six year old daughters \nto Greece.\n  Fortunately, Zenun Dushaj has a cousin in Turkey and my office was \nable to work with the Dushaj family to have our embassy in Ankara \naccept jurisdiction in this matter. In April, Edrina and Lisela left \nAlbania. Soon thereafter, they arrived at our embassy in Ankara where \nthey applied for immigrant visas. They filled out the proper forms, \nunderwent the necessary medical exams, provided the necessary \ndocumentation, and shortly thereafter their visa applications were \nprocessed.\n  I am very happy to report that on May 21, the Dushaj children landed \nin New York and were reunited with their parents. Pranvera and Zenun \ncould not be more thrilled as their family starts a new life together \nin America. I am also proud that like so many immigrants before them, \nthey will start that life in New York.\n  Many thanks are owed to Marisa Lino, our Ambassador in Albania, who I \nknow is working under very trying conditions, and especially to \nJacqueline Ratner, our Consul in Turkey. Ms. Ratner not only recognized \nthat this was a situation where she could make something good happened, \nshe followed up and sheparded the Dushaj children through the \napplication process. I have no doubt that it was her fine work that \nmade this happy outcome possible.\n  I also note the courage, ingenuity, and tenacity of the Dushaj \nparents and all their relatives in Albania and Turkey. They fought to \nbring these children to this country and no matter how desperate things \nlooked, they never gave up hope. Most of all Mr. President, I would \njust like to say to Edrina and Lisela, welcome to America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6441-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n1998 NATIONAL GUN POLICY SURVEY OF THE NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the National Opinion Research \nCenter at the University of Chicago recently released an informative \nsurvey which documents the attitudes of Americans on the regulation of \nfirearms. I think that my colleagues will find the results of this \nsurvey to be valuable, and I ask that an executive summary of the \nsurvey be printed in the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n1998 National Gun Policy Survey of the National Opinion Research Center \n                          Released May 6, 1999\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       Results from a national survey indicate strong public \n     support--including substantial majorities among gun owners--\n     for legislation to regulate firearms, make guns safer, and \n     reduce the accessibility of firearms to criminals and \n     children.\n       Key findings of the 1998 National Gun Policy Survey \n     include:\n        Three-fourths of gun owners support mandatory \n     registration of handguns, as does 85 percent of the general \n     public.\n        Government regulation of gun design to improve \n     safety gets support from 63 percent of gun owners and 75 \n     percent of the general public.\n        Two thirds of gun owners and 80 percent of the \n     general public favor mandatory background checks in private \n     handgun sales, such as gun shows.\n       The survey was conducted by the National Opinion Research \n     Center at the University of Chicago in collaboration with the \n     Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research with funding \n     from the Joyce Foundation. The third in a series of surveys \n     of American attitudes toward gun polices, it shows a \n     continuation of an upward trend in public support for more \n     control over firearms and more attention to making all \n     firearms safer.\n       Other key findings include:\n        Three quarters of those surveyed want Congress to \n     hold hearings to investigate the practices of the gun \n     industry, similar to the hearings held on the tobacco \n     industry.,\n        Sixty percent of Americans want licenses to carry \n     concealed weapons to be issued only to those with special \n     needs, e.g., private detectives. And 83 percent of the public \n     believes that public places, including stores, theaters and \n     restaurants, should be able to prohibit patrons from brining \n     guns on the premises.\n        Americans strongly support measures to keep guns \n     from lawbreakers. 90 percent favor preventing those convicted \n     of domestic violence from buying guns, 81 percent would stop \n     gun sales to those convicted of simple assault, and 68 \n     percent to those convicted of drunk driving.\n        People are willing to pay higher taxes for \n     measures to reduce gun thefts and root out illegal gun \n     dealers, and they express a willingness to pay higher prices \n     for guns that are designed for greater safety.\n        Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed opposed \n     importing guns from a country where those guns could not be \n     legally sold. A total of 55 percent are against all gun \n     imports.\n       Nearly nine out of ten Americans believe that all new \n     handguns sold should be childproof, that is, designed so that \n     a child's small hands cannot fire them.\n       Eighty percent of the people asked say owners should be \n     liable for injuries if a gun is not stored to prevent misuse \n     by children.\n       When asked if there should be a mandatory background check \n     and a five-day waiting period in order to purchase a gun, 82 \n     percent of the people owning a gun, as well as 85 percent of \n     the general public, agreed that position was a good idea.\n       Nearly one out of ten adults report having carried a \n     handgun away from home during the last months. About half of \n     those did not have a permit for doing so, and about half of \n     the handguns were loaded.\n       Just under half of adults who own a handgun obtained the \n     gun through a ``less regulated source,'' defined as \n     pawnshops, private sales, gifts and inheritances.\n       The data were collected in the fall of 1998, before the \n     recent school shootings in Colorado and Georgia, but \n     following similar highly publicized shootings in Arkansas, \n     Kentucky and Oregon. The telephone survey of 1,200 U.S. \n     adults has a margin of error of three percent. The final \n     report is entitled ``The 1998 National Gun Policy Survey of \n     the National Opinion Research Center: Research Findings.''\n       Affiliated with the University of Chicago, NORC has \n     conducted national surveys in the public interest for over 55 \n     years. As a pioneer in the field of survey research, NORC is \n     noted for the high quality of its survey designs, methods, \n     and data.\n       The Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, \n     established in 1995, is dedicated to preventing gun-related \n     deaths and injuries. Located in The Johns Hopkins School of \n     Public Health, the Center applies a science-based, public \n     health approach to gun violence. It provides accurate \n     information on firearm injuries and gun policy; develops, \n     analyzes, and evaluates strategies to prevent firearm \n     injuries; and conducts public health and legal research to \n     identify gun policy needs.\n       Based in Chicago with assets of $947 million, the Joyce \n     Foundation supports efforts to strengthen public policies in \n     ways that improve the quality of life in the Great Lakes \n     region. Since 1993, it has granted over $13 million to \n     support public health approaches to reduce gun violence.\n       Full results of the survey are posted on the NORC web site \n     at: http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6441-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6441-S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A LIFETIME OF TEACHING\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. \nJoseph A. Klingler as he retires after 36 years of service to the \nstudents and families of my hometown, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. He \nserved as a teacher, a principal, a mentor, and a leader in the \neducational field.\n  Throughout his thirty-one years, Dr. Klingler has shown unparalleled \nsupport and caring for his pupils. He provided each school he taught at \nwith a unique personality that demonstrates caring, respect, interest \nin others, and academic challenge. He always encouraged his students to \ntake an active role in school, whether academically, athletically, or \nthrough community activities. Because of his encouragement, staff \nmembers applied for mini-grants which contributed to the success of \nseveral middle school activities such as the Show Choir, FAYM, and the \nDrama Club. Dr. Klingler understands the importance of parents becoming \ninvolved in their children's school and has formed a close alliance \nwith the PTA.\n  Dr. Klingler shaped our definition of a middle school, with mission \nstatements, team concepts, and quality programs. He was active in local \nand national education associations. He chaired the FLOW area Regional \nEducation Council several times, and participated in the national \nprogram for evaluating elementary schools. He is a member of Phi Delta \nKappa, the National Professional Educational Fraternity, the American \nAssociation of School Administrators, the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, the New Jersey Principals and Supervisors \nAssociation, and the National Mathematics Teachers Association.\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\n  Dr. Klingler has served as a role model for community activities, \ncoaching baseball in the local recreation program, volunteering at the \nBergen Community Regional Blood Center, participating in the \nEnvironmental Commission Clean-Up Day, and chairing the Franklin Lakes \nJuvenile Committee. He encouraged his students to take an active role \nin their community.\n  As one of his former students I was directly influenced by his \nteaching and leadership. I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nDr. Klingler for his years of service to all his students in Franklin \nLakes. He will be dearly missed, but I am certain that the values he \ninstilled in his students will live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6442-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO ST. PHILOMENA SCHOOL: 1999 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BLUE \n                             RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievement of St. Philomena School of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, which \nwas recently honored as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon \nSchool.\n  It is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School. \nThrough an intensive selection process beginning at the state level and \ncontinuing through a federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, 266 of \nthe very best public and private schools in the nation were identified \nas deserving this special recognition. These schools are particularly \neffective in meeting local, state, and national goals. However, this \nhonor signifies not just who is best, but what works in educating \ntoday's children.\n  Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to \nreach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and \nthat we make their education come alive. That is what St. Philomena \nSchool is doing. St. Philomena is a kindergarten through eighth grade \nschool that emphasizes student achievement.\n  Since opening in 1953, much has changed for St. Philomena. For a \nbrief time, it offered a comprehensive education from elementary \nthrough high school. But since the late 1960s, St. Philomena has \nfocused exclusively on elementary education, and its students have \nbenefitted from this wise decision. While the school has grown in \nsize--adding four new buildings to its facilities, its administration \nand faculty have taken a personalized approach to each student's \neducation.\n  Mr. President, St. Philomena is dedicated to the highest standards. \nIt is a school committed to a process of continuous improvement not \nonly for students but for teachers as well. Indeed, St. Philomena's \nteachers hone their skills as educators by continuously pursuing \neducational opportunities of their own.\n  Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very \nbest we can do for students and the techniques that can be replicated \nin other schools to help all students succeed. I am proud to say that \nin Rhode Island we can look to a school like St. Philomena. Under the \nleadership of its principal, Sister Ann Marie Walsh, its capable \nfaculty, and its involved parents, St. Philomena School will continue \nto be a shining example for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6442-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJ. GEN. DAVID W. GAY\n\nMr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Major \nGeneral David W. Gay, the Adjutant General of the Connecticut National \nGuard. General Gay will retire on June 1st, so this is an appropriate \ntime to recognize his nearly 40 years of service to the National Guard \nand to recount his achievements during his seven years as head of \nConnecticut's Guard forces.\n  Members of General Gay's Air National Guard component--the 103rd Air \nControl Squadron--will soon travel from Orange, Connecticut to Italy in \nsupport of NATO operations in Kosovo. Like the nearly 5,000 National \nGuard members throughout the nation who have answered the call and are \nnow overseas supporting the NATO mission, those men and women from \nOrange were engaged in their normal day-to-day lives one week and found \nthemselves working in a massive, full-time military operation the next \nweek. Such a scenario is not uncommon in the National Guard. Whether it \nis a military operation, a natural disaster, or civil unrest, our \ncitizen soldiers in the Guard stand ready to put aside their private \nlives and report to their duty station, be it at home or abroad.\n  General Gay has dedicated his career to serving this country with a \nwillingness to be called upon at any time to defend this nation and our \nway of life. He began his military service as a Marine in 1953. In \n1960, he enlisted as a full-time member of the Connecticut National \nGuard, and, in 1962, he received his commission as a Second Lieutenant. \nHis steady rise through the ranks led to command assignments in the \nConnecticut National Guard's artillery and infantry branches. In 1992, \nGeneral Gay was appointed Adjutant General of the Connecticut National \nGuard, a position he has now held for seven years. During his career, \nthe General earned two of the most prestigious awards this nation gives \nto its military officers--the Legion of Merit and the National Guard \nBureau's Eagle Award.\n  Beyond his duties as Adjutant General, ranking member of the \nGovernor's Military Staff and commissioner of the State Military \nDepartment, General Gay has committed himself and his troops to taking \npositive action to improve the communities of Connecticut. Most \nnoteworthy are the host of youth programs that began under General \nGay's tenure. Many of them are a part of the Drug Demand Reduction \nProgram which brings National Guard personnel into the community to \nserve as role models for children, to encourage youth to excel in \nschool, and to convince kids to avoid drugs. The various and ingenious \noffshoots of the program, including Take Charge, Character Counts \nCoalition, Safeguard Retreat, Aviation Role Models for Youth, and Say \n``Nay'' To Drugs have swept the state. Last year alone, under General \nGay's able leadership, those programs touched nearly 20,000 children in \n88 towns across Connecticut.\n  Furthermore, General Gay serves as president of the Nutmeg State \nGames which feature Connecticut's finest young amateur athletes. Beyond \nhis own time, he has committed the resources of the Guard to support \nthe Games thereby enhancing the experience for athletes and spectators \nalike. Just as important, the General has promoted an excellent working \nrelationship between the Guard and Connecticut's employers through the \nESGR, or Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. When personnel may \nbe called upon in times of crisis to leave their jobs for months on \nend, strong bonds with affected employers are critical. The General has \nmade it a priority to strengthen those bonds. Additionally, to assist \nfederal and state agencies in training personnel, he initiated the \nCommunity Learning and Information Network which allows employees of \nsuch agencies to take advantage of the Guard's computer distance \nlearning tools. Over the years, the Network classes have enabled \nnumerous employees to acquire the desired training at minimal cost to \ngovernment agencies.\n  General Gay's commitment to the community has been recognized by \nseveral awards and accolades, a Leadership Award from Eastern \nConnecticut State University and a Character Counts Centers of \nInfluence Award top the list. I have deeply enjoyed working with the \nGeneral over the past several years and look forward to continuing our \nrelationship as he becomes the Chair of Connecticut's Y2K task force. I \nalso give my best wishes to his wife, Nancy, and their three children, \nDavid, Jennifer, and Stephen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6442-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6442-S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JAMES K. KALLSTROM\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words today \nabout a man who is one of America's finest civil servants and a man who \nI am proud to call a friend, Jim Kallstrom.\n  Jim Kallstrom had an illustrious career with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (``FBI''), one in which he played a major role in \nbuilding up the Bureau's counter-terrorism capabilities. Jim Kallstrom \nled the successful FBI investigations into the World Trade Center \nbombing and the intended bombing of the Lincoln Tunnel. Those \ninvestigations broke the back of one of the most violent terrorist \ngroups ever\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nto operate in this country. Their speedy conclusion also did much to \nreassure the American public in the wake of the World Trade Center \nbombing, and they sent a message to terrorists around the world that no \nperson or group can expect to get away with terrorist actions in the \nUnited States.\n  Assistant FBI Director for the New York Metropolitan Area, Jim \nKallstrom led the Bureau's largest field office. He supervised agents \nhandling many of the FBI's most sensitive criminal, counterintelligence \nand counterterrorist cases. He was, and is, a vigorous investigator--\ntruly a cop's cop--and an effective administrator.\n  One of Jim Kallstrom's best known accomplishments--and his most \ncontroversial role--was his direction of the investigation of the TWA \nFlight 800 explosion of July 17, 1996. My colleagues will remember that \n230 people died in that crash and that there was immediate and great \nsuspicion that this was the result of a terrorist or criminal act. \nThere was also a recurrent allegation that the U.S. armed forces had \naccidentally shot down the aircraft and were trying to cover up their \nrole. That allegation was utterly false, but it acquired a life of its \nown despite the facts. It was, in fact, one of the first cases of a \nrumor spread and perpetuated by the Internet.\n  In the initial days of this case--as the desperate search for any \nsurvivors turned into a continuing and heroic mission to retrieve and \nidentify the hundreds of bodies, and as a raft of local and federal \nagencies converged to handle a multitude of tasks--Jim Kallstrom \nstepped in and imposed order on the incipient chaos. Over the coming \nweeks and months, it was the determination and competence of Jim \nKallstrom that reassured the American people and gave us all confidence \nthat no stone would be left unturned in the search for any criminal \nevidence.\n  In recent weeks, one of my colleagues has raised the possibility that \nJim Kallstrom, in the course of pursuing his counterterrorist \ninvestigation to the fullest, may have delayed or tried to delay the \ntransmission to the National Transportation Safety Board of a report by \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (``BATF'') that concluded \nthat the TWA Flight 800 explosion appeared to be caused by a mechanical \nflaw in the center fuel tank.\n  Mr. Kallstrom denies that allegation. He insists that he forwarded \nthe BATF report to the National Transportation Safety Board within a \nfew days of receiving it. He admits that he was angry that BATF would \nissue its conclusions while the counterterrorist and criminal \ninvestigation was still ongoing.\n  I do not know whether Mr. Kallstrom delayed transmission of the BATF \nreport, although I note that two FBI officials testified that he did \nnot. What I do know is that Mr. Kallstrom was performing most admirably \nin a situation fraught with challenges.\n  Let me emphasize those challenges. Millions of Americans drew the \ninitial conclusion that this explosion was caused either by a bomb or \nby a missile. There was an urgent need not only to conduct a thorough \ninvestigation into that possibility, but also to demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that the United States Government was doing everything \nhumanly possible to bring any perpetrators to justice, while still \ndoing anything humanely possible to meet the needs of hundreds of \nbereaved families and showing proper respect for the dead.\n  This was no easy task, and no small one, either. Jim Kallstrom \nassumed those duties and brought the TWA Flight 800 investigation to a \nsuccessful conclusion. I say ``successful'' very purposely, for the \ninvestigation did not fail to uncover any terrorist or criminal act. \nRather, it eliminated those possibilities and gave the American people \nconfidence that the explosion was instead a tragic accident.\n  Some have expressed concern that the FBI might have unwittingly \ndelayed necessary action to correct safety flaws in U.S. commercial \naircraft. I understand this concern and I would agree that \nrecommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board have not \nbeen given sufficient attention by the Federal Aviation Administration. \nBut safety board officials apparently reached the same conclusion as \nBATF weeks earlier, and they reportedly do not believe that any delay \nin receiving the BATF report hindered their ability to persuade the FAA \nto take corrective action.\n  Some people feel that the FBI was too determined to find evidence of \na terrorist or criminal act. I don't doubt for a moment that some \ninvestigators found Jim Kallstrom rather intimidating in his \ndetermination to find any such evidence. The bad news is that Jim \nKallstrom is sometimes intimidating. The good news is also that Jim \nKallstrom is sometimes intimidating. He gets the job done. He also \nprojects confidence and determination. That is what was needed of the \nhead of the FBI's New York office, and that is what was needed by the \nhead of the TWA Flight 800 investigation.\n  I am sorry if some investigators felt that Jim Kallstrom stepped on \ntheir toes. But I am happy as can be that he was the man to whom our \nnation turned when a conspicuously thorough investigation was needed--\nso as to catch and convict the murderers if there were any, and \notherwise to give us complete confidence that the Flight 800 explosion \nwas truly an accident. Jim Kallstrom accomplished that feat, and we are \nall in his debt for his tremendous service to his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6443-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6443-S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SECTION 201 TRADE ACTION FILED BY THE DOMESTIC LAMB INDUSTRY\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, during the last 2 weeks, we have \nbeen hearing from our colleagues concerned about the lamb industry in \nthe United States and the Section 201 trade action filed by them. I \nwould like to join them in commenting on the situation and dispel some \nmyths and confusion surrounding the Section 201 trade action filed by a \ncoalition representing the domestic lamb industry.\n  The case now lies before the President, and I urge him to impose \nstrong, effective restrictions that will curb the devastating surge of \nimports that has swamped the domestic lamb market and now threatens to \ndrown an entire industry.\n  Some worry the nations of Australia and New Zealand may retaliate \nagainst the United States if we take action to protect our domestic \nindustries. They won't because they can't--not for at least three \nyears. That is because of the laws that govern the Section 201 case--\nlaws that, let me be clear about this, are and have been a part of \nevery single trade treaty this nation has signed since the Trade Act of \n1974. That means all signatories to GATT also signed onto the Section \n201 provisions.\n  Importers say they have not done anything unfair. The U.S. lamb \nindustry never said they had. Frankly, the Section 201 rules don't \npertain to unfair trading. It is never alleged, never argued, never \nconsidered. The only things that matter in a Section 201 case are \nwhether imports have risen drastically over the recent time period.\n  There is also the question of harm. A section 201 case is a lot \ntougher to prove than dumping, or subsidies, or yes, unfair trading. \nThe domestic industry is required to prove that imports are a \n``substantial cause'' of significant injury or threat of significant \ninjury.\n  You will hear arguments from importers about how their actions aren't \nto blame. About how their price undercutting, their deliberate decision \nto swamp the market with cheap, imported product, in the face of ample \nnotice of the harm being done, isn't to blame for the financial ruin \nnow snaking its way through the domestic lamb industry.\n  The International Trade Commission heard those arguments. They heard \nall about the Wool Act, about the coyotes, about grazing fees and \norganization. They heard it all, and those six Commissioners rejected \nthose arguments. They rejected them when the Commission unanimously \nruled that imports threaten the domestic lamb industry with irreparable \nharm. After that ruling, those arguments by importers are not a factor \nin this case.\n  You will also hear talk of cooperation. Of how the New Zealand and \nAustralian industries want to work with the domestic industry. Let me \nask you, why are we hearing about cooperation now? Where was the \nimporters' cooperation when fourth-generation ranches faced bankruptcy? \nWhen processors were losing accounts left and right to cheap imports? \nWhen the leaders of the domestic industry publicly announced their \nintention to file the Section 201 trade case?\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\n  Nowhere, is the answer. As the domestic industry reeled under the \nunrelenting wave of cheap, imported lamb, the importers have been busy \nbreaking records. Month after month in 1998, the imports flooded the \ndomestic market, shattering records. When it ended, a record-making \n70.2 million pounds of imported lamb had saturated the American market. \nBut the importers are not finished yet. Even as the ITC conducted \nhearings, the level of imports were rising--in the first three months \nof 1999 alone, imports are up nine percent over 1998 levels, and an \nastonishing 34 percent above 1997 levels. If this pace keeps up, the \nrecord-making import levels of 1998 will be shattered, as will domestic \nsheep industry.\n  I urge the President to curb this devastating surge of cheap imports. \nThe domestic industry won a fairly fought legal case governed by laws \nembedded in this nation's trade treaties. To do anything less than \nordering strong, effective trade restrictions would signal to \nindustries in the United States and abroad that our laws will not be \nenforced.\n  As I said before, the case now lies before the President. I urge him \nto act on the unanimous recommendation by the International Trade \nCommission for four full years of trade restrictions. This follows \nITC's unanimous conclusion that the domestic lamb industry is seriously \nthreatened by the deluge of imports that has swamped the U.S. \nmarketplace and now absorbs one-third of all American lamb consumption.\n  The six Commissioners were unanimous in their recommendation for \ntrade restriction, but offered three options on how it should be \napplied. The ITC's options range from a straight quota to a straight \ntariff to a tariff-rate quota.\n  The importers have already identified the one ITC recommendation \nwhich would do nothing to stop their already disastrous effect on the \nmarketplace. A report of an interview with Australian Trade Minister \nTim Fischer identified the ITC's tariff-rate quota as likely to have \n``minimal effect on present Australian exports.''\n  Minimal effect. Esteemed colleagues, we did not create the 201 \nprovision in our trade laws to have ``minimal effect.'' We did not \ncreate a provision that is tougher to prove that dumping, than unfair \ntrading. We created the 201 provision as a just way for a domestic \nindustry that has been injured or threatened by imports to turn to its \ngovernment for help.\n  The ITC offered three recommendations. The U.S. lamb industry has \nstudied those recommendations and found the ``common ground'' among \nthem.\n  The industry needs strong, effective relief. Here is what they are \nasking for:\n  A two-tier, four year tariff rate quota program with tariffs both \nbelow and above a set level of imports. In year one, tariffs would be \n22 percent on lamb meat imports up to 52 million pounds, with a 42 \npercent tariff on imported lamb beyond the 52 million pound mark.\n  Year two calls for a 20 percent tariff up to 56 million pounds, and a \n37.5 percent tariff above the 56 million.\n  Year three involves a 15 percent tariff up to 61 million pounds and a \n30 percent tariff above the 61 million pounds.\n  Year four, the final year, calls for a 10 percent below-quota tariff \nup to 70 million pounds and an above quota tariff 20 percent above the \n70 million pounds.\n  I join my colleagues in urging the President to order this request \ninto action. It provides desperately needed, strong, effective relief \nto both curb this unprecedented, record-breaking, surge of imports and \nthe devastating price undercutting that accompanies it.\n  This case is important for this nation's agriculture community. It's \nbeing watched throughout our rural towns, farms and ranches. If the \nPresident does not implement an effective remedy for the lamb industry, \nwhich has followed our laws and proved its case, an unmistakable signal \nwould be sent to agriculture and rural interests throughout the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6444-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             YOUNG MARINES\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the tragedy \nat Columbine High School, and in the midst of our debate on Juvenile \nJustice issues, I am proud to offer tribute to the youth group known as \nthe Young Marines. The Young Marines is the official youth program of \nthe Marine Corps League and the focal point for the Marine Corps Youth \ndrug demand reduction effort. Its mission is to promote the mental, \nmoral, and physical development of young Americans. All of its \nactivities emphasize the importance of honesty, courage, respect, \nloyalty, dependability, and a sense of devotion to God, community, and \nfamily.\n  After World War II, members of the Marine Corps League discussed the \npossibility of establishing a Marine Corps League Youth program as a \ncivic project for detachments and to create interest in the League. For \nhistorical purposes, the birth of the Young Marines was in Waterbury, \nConnecticut in 1958. The official charter was issued on 17 October 1965 \nand thereafter the program spread thought the country.\n  In this age where the youth of America has been labeled as troubled \nor misguided, their detractor's fail to notice that there are groups \nand organizations which do take the time to participate in the lives of \nour youth, to guide them in a world that is full of distractions, and \nof glorified violence. It makes me very proud to be able to identify an \norganization whose goals are to promote the mental, moral, and physical \ndevelopment of its members, to instill in its members the ideals of \nhonesty, fairness, courage, to stimulate an interest in, and respect \nfor, academic achievement and the history and traditions of the United \nStates of America. The Young Marines work to promote physical fitness \nthrough the conduct of physical activities, including participation in \nathletic events and close order drill. Any maybe what is most \nimportant, the Young Marines stress a drug-free lifestyle through a \ncontinual drug prevention education program.\n  Much has been said about the troubles of today's youth, and recent \nevents have illustrated what can happen when teens consider themselves \noutsiders or without purpose or guidance. I think it's time that we \ngive the recognition and respect to the groups and the youth who do \nparticipate in these groups, that which they deserve. I believe that \nthe guidance that groups such as the Young Marines provide is more \neffective than any legislation can possibly be. And maybe we can start \nproducing real role models that teens can relate to, instead of \noffering them the glorification of violence and drug use which is so \nprevalent in the movies and on television. I welcome the opportunity to \nextend my support to the young people of New Mexico who are \nparticipants in this vital program. I firmly believe the experience as \nYoung Marines will greatly contribute to their future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6444-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO AUSTIN T.

I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read a \nthird time and passed as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill appear in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 435), as amended, was considered read a third time and \npassed.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Senate today passed the Miscellaneous \nTrade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999. This bill, which my friend \nSenator Moynihan cosponsored, is similar to legislation that the \nCommittee on Finance had reported out last year.\n  This legislation consists of over 150 provisions temporarily \nsuspending or reducing the applicable tariffs on a wide variety of \nproducts, including chemicals used to make anti-HIV, anti-AIDS and \nanticancer drugs, pigments, paints, herbicides and insecticides, \ncertain machinery used in the production of textiles, and rocket \nengines.\n  In each instance, there was either no domestic production of the \nproduct in question or the domestic producers supported the measure. By \nsuspending or reducing the duties, we can enable American firms that \nuse these products to produce goods in a more cost efficient manner, \nthereby helping create jobs for American workers and reducing costs for \nconsumers.\n  The bill also contains a number of technical corrections and other \nminor modifications to the trade laws that enjoy broad support. One \nsuch measure would help facilitate Customs Service clearance of \nathletes that participate in world athletic events, such as the \nupcoming Women's World Cup. Another measure corrects certain outdated \nreferences in the trade laws.\n  For each of the provisions included in this bill, the House and \nSenate solicited comments from the public and from the administration \nto ensure that there was no controversy or opposition. Only those \nmeasures that were noncontroversial were included in the bill.\n  I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Moynihan, for helping \nmove this legislation. I am delighted that we were able to pass these \ncommonsense measures that will provide real benefits for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr. President, my great thanks to the Chairman of the \nFinance Committee for his efforts in bringing this legislation, the \nMiscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999, to a \nsuccessful conclusion. The technical work on this bill began 15 months \nago, culminating in the Finance Committee's approval of the package \nlast September. For reasons unrelated to the substance of the bill, the \nSenate was unable to complete work on the measure last year.\n  The Chairman made this the first order of business for the Finance \nCommittee in the 106th Congress, and, accordingly, the Committee \nordered this package of temporary duty suspensions and Customs \nprovisions reported on January 21, 1999. Of particular importance to \nNew Yorkers, the bill will authorize the United States Customs Service \nto station inspectors in a number of Canadian airports, to ``preclear'' \npassengers in advance of their arrival in New York, thus helping to \nreduce congestion at JFK International Airport. Passengers cleared in \nCanada can be routed through LaGuardia, where no further Customs \nformalities will be required. Passengers on flights routed through JFK \nwill face shorter Customs processing times since many of the flights \nthat would otherwise be routed through JFK will instead be directed to \nLaGuardia. Arriving in New York should become just a little easier.\n  The bill also suspends the duties on the personal effects of athletes \nparticipating in the Women's World Cup soccer games, their coaches and \ntheir families. The games will begin June 19, 1999. In addition, H.R. \n435 reduces the tariffs that New York companies must pay on certain \nimported components not produced in the United States, such as high-\npurity glass and a number of synthetic organic chemicals used to \nmanufacture rubber products, produce aircraft coatings, and inhibit \ncorrosion on rail cars.\n  The Senate has now given its unanimous consent and the measure will \nreturn to the House for final approval. It is my hope that the House \nwill take up the matter as soon as it returns from the Memorial Day \nrecess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6445-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6445-S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. Res. \n103, a resolution concerning the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen \nSquare Massacre on June 4, 1999. This bipartisan resolution expresses \nsympathy for the families of those killed in the Tiananmen protests, \nand calls on the government of China to live up to international \nstandards by releasing prisoners of conscience, ending harassment of \nChinese citizens, and ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights.\n  Mr. President, we must never forget. For the past ten years, the \nTiananmen Square massacre has been a dark cloud hanging over China. \nHundreds of democracy activists still languish in prison for their \ninvolvement in the demonstrations of 1989. We must not forget because \nto this very day, the U.S. is dealing with a regime that will not \nrelease these prisoners of conscience.\n  The Beijing protests began in April 1989 as a call for the government \nto explain itself--to explain its 1987 dismissal of Hu Yaobang, an \nofficial who had been sympathetic to students demanding political \nreform in 1986. The demonstrators, students and workers, asked that the \ngovernment take action against corruption. Their demands eventually \ncame to include freedom of the press, more money for education, and \ndemocratic reforms. Students of Beijing University and 40 other \nuniversities, as well as Beijing residents, protested in and around \nTiananmen Square. They held hunger strikes and defied martial law. They \nwere met with brutal repression.\n  Mr. President, we must never forget that heroic young man who stood \nin the path of a column of PLA tanks.\n  We must never forget the brave men like Wang Dan who spent years in \nprison for daring to exercise his inalienable right to self-expression.\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\n  We must never forget those students who were so inspired by our own \nexperiment in self-government that they erected a 37 foot model of our \nstatue of liberty.\n  We must never forget those who still languish in prison in China \ntoday for their democratic aspirations, for their religious \nconvictions, for their desire to be free.\n  We must never forget men like Wang Wenjiang and Wang Zechen, members \nof the Chinese Democracy Party, detained for circulating a petition \ncalling for a reassessment of the Tiananmen verdict. We must not forget \nprodemocracy activist, Yang Tao, who was arrested for planning a \ncommemoration to mark the 10th anniversary of Tiananmen Square. We must \nnot forget Jiang Qisheng, taken from his home in Beijing on May 18th \nfor urging Chinese to light candles in commemoration of those killed in \nTiananmen Square.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, over 50 dissidents have been \ndetained in the days leading up to the 10th anniversary of the \nTiananmen Square massacre, and at least fourteen are still being held.\n  The Chinese government knows what is has done and it is afraid--\nafraid of its own people. Otherwise, these series of arrests would not \noccur.\n  This resolution asks the Chinese government to face reality, to \nlisten to its people, to release prisoners of conscience.\n  On June 3, 1989, police officers attacked students with tear gas, \nrubber bullets, and electric truncheons. People's Liberation Army (PLA) \nofficers armed with AK-47s opened fire on the innocent people who would \ndare stand in their way. They sent convoys of tanks to Tiananmen Square \nto absolutely crush the demonstrators. Their armored vehicles rammed \nthe Goddess of Democracy, a 37 foot plaster likeness of the Statue of \nLiberty, knocking it down, flattening it beneath their steel treads. \nThey killed a symbol of democracy and massacred their own people. On \nJune 4, the PLA and security forces killed 1,500 and wounded 10,000. By \nJune 7, the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,600 people aspiring to \ndemocracy dead. In the end, the Chinese government killed and wounded \nthousands of demonstrators. They imprisoned thousands more for their \nparticipation.\n  The simple fact is that the Chinese government is a totalitarian \nregime. President Clinton would do well to recognize this simple fact \nand recognize the failures of his engagement policy, rather than simply \ndecrying any criticism as isolationism. If the hundreds of prisoners of \nconscience still languishing in prison today is not telling enough of \nthe character of this regime, then perhaps the Chinese reaction to the \nembassy bombing is.\n  NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was a tragic \naccident. And the Chinese people had a reason to be upset. But there \nwas no accident in the Chinese government's control of the media and \nmanipulation of Chinese citizens to stir up anti-American sentiment. \nThe Chinese government blocked reports of President Clinton's repeated \napologies for the bombing. They bused students out from universities to \norchestrated protests, pelting rocks at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, \nholding Ambassador Sasser and his staff hostage in the embassy, burning \nthe American consulate in Chengdu.\n\n  It was no accident that after several days, the Chinese government \nmade sure that the protests came to an end when they were no longer \nuseful for the government's purposes.\n  Ethan Gutmann, a television producer living in Beijing, witnessed the \nprotests.\n  ``After a while, when the chanting lost its steam, the megaphone \nleader would strike up a short sing-along of the national anthem. This \nwas the signal to leave, to shuffle along and give the next university \nits chance to demonstrate. The cycle continued, fresh waves of \nstudents, monotony. Several British journalists discussed the \nnumbers.'' They felt it was low, about 3,000; in a kind of Chinese \nscarf trick, the same student groups kept reappearing after an hour or \nso. The students, when isolated and interviewed, were naively \nforthcoming; the university authorities had told them to come, told \nthem to make banners, arranged the buses. The whole demonstration was \ncanned . . .''\n  It was no accident that the Chinese government played the victim, \ntrying to squeeze the Administration for concessions, trying to get the \nU.S. to exclude Taiwan from any defense umbrella in Asia.\n  It was no accident that the Chinese government called off its human \nrights dialogue and nonproliferation talks.\n  Mr. President, the moral high ground that the Chinese regime \nattempted to seize from the accidental bombing has no equivalency to \nits own treatment of its citizens, to the massacre of the students in \nBeijing ten years ago.\n\n  We must never forget the nature of the regime in China. The leaders \nmay be different, but the treatment of Chinese citizens is the same.\n  Even this week, pro-democracy activist, Yang Tao, was arrested for \nplanning a commemoration to mark the 10th anniversary of Tiananmen \nSquare.\n  This week it was reported that police took Jiang Qisheng (chee sheng) \nfrom his home in Beijing on May 18 for urging Chinese to light candles \nin commemoration of those killed in Tiananmen Square.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join with me in supporting this \nbipartisan resolution--to recognize this regime for what it truly is \nand to never forget the tragedy that occurred ten years ago on June 3 \nand June 4, 1989.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas again \nfor his leadership on this critical issue.\n  S. Res. 103 marks the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square \nmassacre, when a still unknown number of Chinese--some say hundreds, \nothers, thousands--died at the hands of the People's Liberation Army.\n  Despite the significance of this tragedy, China's leaders remain \nunwilling to re-examine the events of June 4, 1989. Indeed, they would \nlike nothing more than to have Tiananmen fade from the world's memory.\n  But today, the memory of Tiananmen remains vivid in our minds. In \nparticular, we remember one man who defined the spirit of the day as he \nstood, with only freedom at his side, and faced down an army tank. We \nsaw him then, and as we think of Tiananmen Square today, we see him \nstill.\n  The memory of Tiananmen refuses to fade because the human rights \nsituation in China remains abysmal. According to Amnesty International \nmore than 200 individuals may remain in Beijing prisons for their role \nin the 1989 demonstrations. And hundreds, if not thousands, of \nindividuals continue to be detained or imprisoned for their political \nor religious beliefs.\n  We face many issues with China--the recent embassy bombing, accession \nto the WTO, charges of espionage--but we can not let these issues \nsilence our voices on the subject of human rights.\n  China's human rights practices continue to be abhorrent, and we \nshould not allow recent events to diminish our continued vigilance on \nsuch practices.\n  It is noteworthy that the recent demonstrations in China against the \nUnited States are perhaps the largest since the Tiananmen Square \nprotests exactly 10 years ago. It is ironic that public protest is OK \nwhen it serves the government's interest, and not OK when it threatens \nthe government's hold on power.\n  In fact, since the end of the bombing-related anti-U.S. \ndemonstrations, China has resumed its crackdown on dissidents who could \nattempt to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square \nmassacre.\n  The failure to adopt a resolution condemning China's human rights \npractices at last month's UN Commission on Human Rights makes it all \nthe more urgent that we continue to demand improvements in China's \npolicies.\n  We cannot betray the sacrifices made by those who lost their lives in \nTiananmen Square by tacitly condoning through our silence the abuses \nthat continue to this day.\n  This resolution reminds the leaders in Beijing that we will not \nforget what was done 10 years ago and will not look the other way when \nthey again deny the Chinese people their rights.\n  Until we see genuine progress on human rights, the memory of \nTiananmen Square will continue to haunt us.\n  We must not forget. And we must never let the rulers in Beijing \nforget.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in support of \nS.\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nRes. 103, a resolution concerning the tenth anniversary of the \nTiananmen Square massacre which occurred on June 4, 1989. This \nbipartisan resolution expresses sympathy for the families of those \nkilled in the peaceful protests, calls on the Government of China to \nlive up to international standards by releasing prisoners of \nconscience, ending the harassment of Chinese citizens, and calls upon \nthe Chinese Government to ratify the International Covenant on Civil \nand Political Rights.\n  We must never forget the heroic young man who stood in the path of a \ncolumn of PLA tanks 10 years ago. We must never forget the brave men \nlike Wang Dan, who spent years in prison for daring to exercise his \ninalienable rights to self-expression. We must never forget those \nstudents who were so inspired by our own experiment in self-government \nand freedom and democracy that they erected a 37-foot model of our \nStatue of Liberty. We must never forget those who still languish in \nprison in China today, simply because they have democratic aspirations, \nbecause they have religious convictions, because they have a desire to \nbe free.\n  We must never forget men like Wang Wenjiang and Wang Zechen, members \nof the Chinese Democracy Party, who were detained for circulating a \npetition calling for a reassessment of the Tiananmen verdict. We must \nnever forget pro democracy activist Yang Tao arrested for planning a \ncommemoration tomorrow of the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square \nmassacre. We must not forget Jiang Qisheng, who was taken from his home \nin Beijing on May 18 for urging the Chinese to light candles in \ncommemoration of those killed in the massacre ten years ago. For asking \nfor a peaceful memorial, the lighting of candles, he has been arrested.\n\n  According to the Wall Street Journal today, over 50 dissidents have \nbeen detained in recent days leading up to the tenth anniversary of the \nTiananmen Square massacre, and at least 14 are currently being held. \nThe Chinese government knows what it has done. It is afraid of its own \npeople. Otherwise, these series of arrests would not have occurred. \nThis resolution asks the Chinese government to face reality, listen to \nits people, and to release prisoners of conscience.\n  Mr. President, I am just afraid that in the midst of all of our talk \nof the espionage of the Chinese government--which well we should pay \nattention to--with all of the talk of the unfortunate, tragic bombing \nof the Chinese embassy, with all of the talk about accession of China \nto the WTO and a permanent normal trading status for China, we will \nforget that there are tens of thousands today who are oppressed, and \nhundreds remain in prison, and there are multitudes who desire freedom \nand want a better political system for their country, who want \ndemocracy, and I am afraid they will be forgotten in all of the milieu \nconcerning our relationship with China.\n  So this resolution calls upon us to remember. And I will--if no one \nelse does--offer this resolution year after year. It is a special \nanniversary. It is the tenth anniversary of the tragedy that occurred.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the resolution, as amended, be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and finally, that any additional statements appear at this point \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 103), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n       Whereas the United States was founded on the democratic \n     principle that all men and women are created equal and \n     entitled to the exercise of their basic human rights;\n       Whereas freedom of expression and assembly are fundamental \n     human rights that belong to all people and are recognized as \n     such under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;\n       Whereas the death of the former General Secretary of the \n     Communist Party of the People's Republic of China, Hu \n     Yaobang, on April 15, 1989, gave rise to peaceful protests \n     throughout China calling for the establishment of a dialogue \n     with government and party leaders on democratic reforms, \n     including freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and the \n     elimination of corruption by government officials;\n       Whereas after that date thousands of prodemocracy \n     demonstrators continued to protest peacefully in and around \n     Tiananmen Square in Beijing until June 3 and 4, 1989, when \n     Chinese authorities ordered the People's Liberation Army and \n     other security forces to use lethal force to disperse \n     demonstrators in Beijing, especially around Tiananmen Square;\n       Whereas nonofficial sources, a Chinese Red Cross report \n     from June 7, 1989, and the State Department Country Reports \n     on Human Rights Practices for 1989, gave various estimates of \n     the numbers of people killed and wounded in 1989 by the \n     People's Liberation Army soldiers and other security forces, \n     but agreed that hundreds, if not thousands, were killed and \n     thousands more were wounded;\n       Whereas 20,000 people nationwide suspected of taking part \n     in the democracy movement were arrested and sentenced without \n     trial to prison or reeducation through labor, and many were \n     reported tortured;\n       Whereas human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, \n     Human Rights in China, and Amnesty International have \n     documented that hundreds of those arrested remain in prison;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to suppress dissent by imprisoning prodemocracy \n     activists, journalists, labor union leaders, \n     religious believers, and other individuals in China and \n     Tibet who seek to express their political or religious \n     views in a peaceful manner; and\n       Whereas June 4, 1999, is the tenth anniversary of the date \n     of the Tiananmen Square massacre: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses sympathy to the families of those killed as a \n     result of their participation in the democracy protests of \n     1989 in the People's Republic of China, as well as to the \n     families of those who have been killed and to those who have \n     suffered for their efforts to keep that struggle alive during \n     the past decade;\n       (2) commends all citizens of the People's Republic of China \n     who are peacefully advocating for democracy and human rights; \n     and\n       (3) condemns the ongoing and egregious human rights abuses \n     by the Government of the People's Republic of China and calls \n     on that Government to--\n       (A) release all prisoners of conscience, including those \n     still in prison as a result of their participation in the \n     peaceful prodemocracy protests of May and June 1989, provide \n     just compensation to the families of those killed in those \n     protests, and allow those exiled on account of their \n     activities in 1989 to return and live in freedom in the \n     People's Republic of China;\n       (B) put an immediate end to harassment, detention, and \n     imprisonment of Chinese citizens exercising their legitimate \n     rights to the freedom of expression, freedom of association, \n     and freedom of religion; and\n       (C) demonstrate its willingness to respect the rights of \n     all Chinese citizens by proceeding quickly to ratify and \n     implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights which it signed on October 5, 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6447-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMENDING THE OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED AND EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL \n                       APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 110) designating June 5, 1999, as \n     ``National Race for the Cure Day''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this resolution, submitted by Senator \nFeinstein and I, commemorates the Tenth Anniversary of the National \nRace for the Cure. We are pleased to be joined by over 40 other \nSenators, including Majority Leader Lott and Minority Leader Daschle.\n  Mr. President, on June 5, 1999, the National Race for the Cure will \ntake place in Washington, D.C. This will be the Tenth Anniversary of \nthis Race--that has drawn national attention and thousands of \nvolunteers and runners.\n  All are united by one goal--to eradicate breast cancer from our \nlives.\n  The Resolution we are introducing today will designate June 5th as \nNational Race for the Cure Day.\n  This Race has very special meaning for me. The Race for the Cure was \nstarted by the Susan G. Komen Foundation which is located in my \nhometown, Dallas, Texas.\n  The Susan G. Komen Foundation was founded in 1982 by Nancy Brinker. \nThe Foundation honors her sister, Susan Komen, who tragically died of \nbreast cancer at the young age of 36. Nancy promised herself that she \nwould fulfill Suzy's plea to help others confronted with this disease.\n  The mission of the Foundation is to eradicate breast cancer as a \nlife-threatening disease by advancing research, education, screening \nand treatment.\n  Nancy Brinker's pledge to her sister has grown to be a major factor \nin fighting breast cancer. The Foundation has 35,000 volunteers and 106 \noffices across the United States.\n  The Komen Foundation's Grant Program is regarded as one of the most \ninnovative in funding breast cancer research today. The Komen \nFoundation has financed 325 grants at 72 institutions in 25 states.\n  The Foundation's most public event, however, has become the Race for \nthe Cure. The Race for the Cure has become the largest series of Five \nKilometer Runs in the world.\n  The Race series stated as one event in Texas with 800 participants. \nBut, this year, there will be 98 races across the United States with \nover 700,000 people participating.\n  The Komen Foundation and the Race for the Cure have raised over $136 \nmillion for breast cancer research.\n  On June 5th, the National Race for the Cure will celebrate its tenth \nanniversary. It is the largest of the Races across the U.S. In fact, \nthere are more than 50,000 entrants already signed up for this race.\n  This resolution commemorates the Tenth Anniversary and it designates \nJune 5th as National Race for the Cure Day.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fitting that the Senate recognize this \nunique day.\n  Breast cancer is the leading cause of death of women between the ages \nof 35 and 54. A woman in the United States will be diagnosed with \nbreast cancer every three minutes, and every 12 minutes a woman will \ndie of breast cancer.\n  The Race for the Cure is one day, when Americans of all walks of \nlife, can come together united in a great cause to wipe out this \nterrible disease.\n  Mr. President. I would urge the Senate to adopt this resolution. Is \nalso want to thank the numerous other Senators that were part of this \neffort. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor with \nSenators Kay Bailey Hutchison, Pete Domenici and Connie Mack a \nresolution commending the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and \nthe Komen National Race for the Cure for their commitment to \neradicating breast cancer. June 5 will be the Komen National Race for \nthe Cure Day and this resolution urges the President to issue a \nproclamation calling upon the American people to observe the day with \nappropriate activities.\n  Washington, D.C., will host the Race and there will be 98 races \nacross the country will over 700,000 people participating.\n  There are 2.6 million women in this country living with breast cancer \nand more than 178,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Over \n43,000 will die.\n  Diagnostic tools for breast cancer are very limited. Treatments for \nbreast cancer are at best imperfect. We don't know how to prevent it. \nWe don't know how to cure it. We need to redouble our effort to stop \nbreast cancer now.\n  Congress is taking some steps. During the FY 2000 appropriations \nprocess, I hope we can increase researching funding for all cancers. We \nmust pass legislation, such as S. 784 which I have sponsored, to \nrequire Medicare coverage of routine costs of clinical research trials \nand S. 6, to require private insurance coverage of the routine costs of \nclinical research trials. We should enact legislation assuring access \nto specialists and coverage of second opinions. We should pass Medicaid \ncoverage for women who are screened by CDC's breast and cervical cancer \nprogram but have no way to pay for treatment when they learn they have \ncancer.\n  I call on my colleagues to join us in supporting the 10th anniversary \nRace by supporting this resolution and sending it to the President. As \nnew understandings of cancer emerge almost weekly, we must do all we \ncan to support increased research and access to services to end this \nscourge.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 110) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The Resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 110\n\n       Whereas breast cancer is the leading cause of death for \n     women between the ages of 35 and 54;\n       Whereas every 3 minutes a woman will be diagnosed with \n     breast cancer and every 12 minutes a woman will die of breast \n     cancer;\n       Whereas the Komen National Race for the Cure is celebrating \n     its 10th Anniversary during 1999;\n       Whereas the Komen National Race for the Cure Series, an \n     event of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, is the \n     largest series of 5 kilometer races in the world;\n       Whereas there will be 98 Komen National Race for the Cure \n     events throughout the United States during 1999; and\n       Whereas the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and the \n     Komen National Race for the Cure Series has raised an \n     estimated $136,000,000 to further the mission of eradicating \n     breast cancer as a life-threatening disease by advancing \n     research, education, screening, and treatment: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 111, \nintroduced earlier today by Senator Graham and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 111) designating June 6, 1999, as \n     ``National Child's Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this resolution designates the first \nSunday of June as National Child's Day.\n  Our children are our future. Over 5 million children, however, go \nhungry at some point each month. There has been a 60 percent increase \nin the number of children needing foster care in the last ten years. \nMany children today face crises of grave proportions, especially as \nthey enter their adolescent years.\n  The designation of National Child's Day helps us to focus on our \nchildren's needs and recognize their accomplishments. It encourages \nfamilies to spend more quality time together and highlights the special \nimportance of the child in the family unit.\n  In these crucial times, it is important that we show our support for \nthe youth of America. It is our hope that this simple resolution will \nfoster family togetherness and ensure that our\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\nchildren receive the attention they need and deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in designating the first Sunday in \nJune as National Child's Day.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be placed in the Record at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 112, \nintroduced earlier today by Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 112) to designate June 5, 1999, as \n     ``Safe Night USA.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ndesignating June 5, 1999, as ``Safe Night USA.'' Safe Night USA is an \nexciting program that is helping reduce youth violence, as well as drug \nand alcohol abuse, in my home state of Wisconsin and around the nation.\n  Safe Night is a low cost, high-profile way to focus national \nattention on the importance of providing young people with safe \nalternative activities and tools for conflict resolution, anger \nmanagement and mediation. I am proud to report Mr. President that Safe \nNight first began in 1994 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and in 1999 all fifty \nstates, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands will participate in this \nexciting program.\n  Mr. President, Olusegun Sijuwade, a Milwaukee Health Department \neducator and former police officer, developed Safe Night in response to \nmore than 300% increase in violent death and injury in Milwaukee \nbetween 1983 and 1993. The Safe Night program in Wisconsin began with \n4,000 youth in Milwaukee and by 1996 involved more than 10,000 \nparticipants in over 100 sites spread across the state. And now, on \nJune 5, 1999, a million kids are expected to participate in Safe Night \nprograms in 1,200 sites across the country.\n  Mr. President, as you know, last week Congress debated and voted on \nthe Juvenile Justice bill. The resolution I am introducing today is \nindeed timely and an appropriate response to the juvenile crime \nstatistics we were reminded of last week. These include the over \n220,000 juveniles arrested last year for drug abuse and the over \n1,000,000 juvenile victims of a violent crime. I believe community-\nbased violence prevention models, like Safe Night USA, are extremely \nimportant to stem the rise in juvenile crime. By educating youth, \ncommunity leaders and parents, Safe Night promotes secure environments \nfor kids and families while reducing the alienation that so often leads \nto violent crime and substance abuse.\n  Very simply, Mr. President, Safe Night brings community partners \ntogether to provide a place for youth to have fun during high-risk \nevening hours, with three ground rules; no guns, no drugs and no \nfighting allowed. A typical Safe Night consists of a party, planned by \nkids and adults in the community, including police officials, church \nleaders, doctors, teachers, parents, and other volunteers. Held at a \nschool, a church, or a community center, a Safe Night event could have \na dance with a disc jockey, an athletic event, or a large dinner, \nusually interspersed with targeted violence-reduction activities. These \nactivities include role playing, trust-building games, and other \nmethods of teaching kids stress management and alternatives to \nviolence.\n  Safe Night USA 1999 will occur in both rural and urban areas. The \nPublic Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the Black Entertainment \nTelevision (BET) Network will broadcast the events nationally. The \nfollowing community partners have joined with Safe Night USA: the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, National Civics League, 100 Black \nMen of America, the Resolving Conflict Creatively Center and Educators \nfor Social Responsibility, American Academy of Pediatrics, Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America and \nthe National 4-H Youth Council.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that both families and communities \nunderstand that we are not powerless to help prevent destructive \nbehaviors, such as drug abuse, in our children. Safe Night USA helps \ndevelop a strong, committed partnership between schools, community and \nfamilies to foster a drug-free and violence-free environment for our \nyouth. I believe Mr. President that Safe Night USA is a wise investment \nup front--it is a simple idea that works--and I am proud that it \noriginated in my home state of Wisconsin. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir cooperation in passing this resolution and I wish the 10,000 \nlocal Safe Night USA events great success on June 5, 1999, as they join \nin one nationwide effort to combat youth violence and substance abuse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto appear in the Record at the appropriate place as if read, \nwithout intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 112) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 112\n\n       Whereas over 1,500,000 people, 220,000 of them juveniles, \n     were arrested last year for drug abuse;\n       Whereas over 1,000,000 juveniles were victims of violent \n     crimes last year;\n       Whereas local community prevention efforts are vital to \n     reducing these alarming trends;\n       Whereas Safe Night began with 4,000 juvenile participants \n     in Milwaukee during 1994 in\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\n     response to a 300 percent increase in violent death and \n     injury in that city between 1983 and 1993;\n       Whereas Safe Night involved over 10,000 Wisconsin \n     participants and included 100 individual Safe Nights \n     throughout Wisconsin in 1996;\n       Whereas Safe Night has been credited as a factor in \n     reducing the teenage homicide rate in Milwaukee by 60 percent \n     in just the first 3 years of the program.\n       Whereas Wisconsin Public Television, the Public \n     Broadcasting Service, Black Entertainment Television, the \n     National Latino Children's Institute, the National Civics \n     League, 100 Black Men of America, the Resolving Conflict \n     Creatively Center and Educators for Social Responsibility, \n     the Boys and Girls Club of America, the Community Anti-Drug \n     Coalitions of America, the National 4-H Youth Council, Public \n     Television Outreach, and the American Academy of Pediatrics \n     have joined with Safe Night USA to lead this major violence \n     prevention initiative;\n       Whereas community leaders, including parents, teachers, \n     doctors, religious officials, and business leaders, will \n     enter into partnership with youth to foster a drug-free and \n     violence-free environment on June 5, 1999;\n       Whereas this partnership combines stress and anger \n     management programs with dances, talent shows, sporting \n     events, and other recreational activities, operating on only \n     3 basic rules: no weapons, no alcohol, and no arguments.\n       Whereas Safe Night USA helps youth avoid the most common \n     factors that precede acts of violence, provides children with \n     the tools to resolve conflict and manage anger without \n     violence, encourages communities to work together to identify \n     key issues affecting teenagers, and creates local \n     partnerships with you that will continue beyond the \n     expiration of the project; and\n       Whereas June 5, 1999, will witness over 10,000 local Safe \n     Night activities joined together in one nationwide effort to \n     combat youth violence and substance abuse: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates June 5, 1999 as ``Safe Night USA''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the day \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n     SEC. 2.

I want to thank Senator Johnson for his leadership on this \nmatter and for bringing this matter to my attention. Vermont does not \nhave a copayment requirement for prisoners' health care so the problems \nthat his Marshal had brought to his attention last year, were not \nmatters that had arisen in Vermont.\n  I also want to thank those at the Department of Justice who have made \nsuggestions to improve the proposals on this subject over the last \ncouple of years. I am glad the I have been able to contribute \nconstructively to that process of improvement over the past weeks and \nagain today.\n  A most important part of this bill is its protection against \nprisoners being refused treatment based on an inability to pay. I am \nglad to see my suggestion that the protection of section 2(f) in this \nregard be included in section 3 of the bill, as well, be incorporated \nin the substitute amendment accepted by the Judiciary Committee and \nreported to the Senate. I thank the Department of Justice for having \nincluded this suggestion in its recent April 27 letter.\n  Today we make additional improvements to the bill to ensure that it \ncan serve the purposes for which it is intended. In particular, I have \nsuggested language to make clear that since the goal of the bill is to \ndeter prisoners from seeking unnecessary health care, copayment \nrequirements should not apply to prisoner health care visits initiated \nand approved by custodial staff, including staff referrals and staff-\napproved follow-up treatment for a chronic condition. In addition, the \namendments I have suggested adds to those health care visits excluded \nfrom the copayment requirement visits for emergency services, perinatal \ncare, diagnosis or treatment of contagious diseases, mental health care \nand substance abuse treatment. Like preventative care, all these types \nof health care for prisoners should be encouraged and not discouraged \nby a copayment requirement. It would be harmful to custodial staff and \ndetrimental the long term interests of the public to create artificial \nbarriers to these health care services.\n  Finally, I have suggested that we review this new program and its \nimpact next year rather than delaying evaluation for the 2-year period \ninitially provided by the bill. The bill constitutes a shift in federal \ncorrections and custodial policy and it is appropriate that the impact \nof these changes be evaluated promptly and adjusted as need be.\n  I continue to be concerned that we are imposing an administrative \nburden on the Bureau of Prisons greatly in excess of any benefit the \nbill may achieve. I wonder about alternatives to cut down on \nunnecessary health care visits besides the imposition of fees, many of \nwhich may go uncollected. The contemplated $5 a visit fee for prisoners \ncompensated at a rate as low as 11 cents an hour seems excessive, but \nthat is how the BOP wishes to proceed.\n  I also fear that the effort will lead to extensive litigation to sort \nout what it means and how it is implemented. As we impose duties and \nlimitations on correctional authorities, that is one of the \nconsequences of such duties.\n  I will be interested to see whether funds end up being received by \nvictims of crime either with respect to restitution orders or by the \nVictims of Crime Fund through the elaborate mechanisms created by this \nlegislation. I hope that victims will benefit from its enactment as \nopposed to experiencing another false promise. In this regard, I wonder \nwhy there is no benefit to victims from the fees collected from federal \nprisoners held in nonfederal institutions. If our policy is to benefit \nvictims, the ownership of the facility ought not deter that policy. \nSurely the copayment fee is not designed as payment for the health care \ntreatment itself or even payment for the administrative overhead of the \nsystem.\n  Despite my concerns, this bill does have the support of the BOP and \nU.S. Marshals Service. Just as I facilitated the bill being reported \nfrom this Committee, today I am acting to allow the Senate to pass an \nimproved version of the bill.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the committee substitute be agreed to, the bill \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill appear in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise after this very long but, I \nthink, good debate on the defense authorization bill to thank the \ndistinguished chairman of our committee, the Senator from Virginia, and \nour ranking member, the Senator from Michigan, for their hard work on \nthis bill. I have to add all the staff that worked very hard too.\n  It is a huge authorization, as you know, Mr. President. It represents \n16 percent of the total expenditures of our Government, for the \nDepartment of Defense. We fund and try to prepare for the finest \nmilitary and strongest military operations in the world; over a million \nmen and women--1.4 million active-duty men and women. This bill has \nprovided, because of the hard work on both sides of the aisle, some \nsignificant and much-needed increases to support our men and women, to \nhelp our forces be even more ready, more professional, better trained \nand better prepared for all the new threats that we face in the world \ntoday.\n  So I thank them for their work, and acknowledge that in this bill \nthat received an overwhelming vote, we had one of the largest increases \nof expenditures for the readiness of those active forces, pay \nprovisions to help make the salaries more competitive with the booming \neconomy we are currently enjoying here in the United States.\n  Thanks to the leadership of our great colleague from Georgia, Senator \nCleland, we were able to add some additional funding for GI benefit \nexpansions, the first in over two generations, so the men and women in \nour armed services can share those benefits with their spouses and \ntheir children, improving educational opportunities across the board.\n  There are many other provisions funding the increase in technology, \nthe first downpayment on our missile defense system, which has come a \nlittle bit too late for some and right on time for others. I think it \nis the right step for our Nation.\n  I join my colleagues in thanking the leadership that has brought this \nbill to final passage today. There is more work to be done. There were \nsome disappointments, obviously some shortcomings, but no piece of \nlegislation is perfect. We will have opportunities to work in the \nfuture, as this Congress progresses.\n  Because the floor was so busy earlier today I waited until now to \ntake this opportunity, but I did not want this day to end without \nnoting the historic event that took place today with the indictment of \nYugoslavian President Milosevic by the International War Crime \nTribunal. As was recorded earlier, Justice Louise Arbour announced that \nhe and his four deputies and military leaders have in fact been \nindicted for the atrocities they have committed. This body passed \nalmost unanimously--it was unanimously for those present--a resolution \nearlier this week, urging the Tribunal to act, saying the United States \nwill put up what resources are necessary to make sure justice is done; \nthat not only can war criminals be identified, but cases can be built \nin the proper and legal way so they can be successfully prosecuted for \nwhat has occurred.\n  I was particularly moved by an article I plan to pass around to the \nMembers of the Senate and to send to family and supporters around the \nNation, written by Carol Williams of the Los Angeles Times. That \nreported in horrific detail some of the crimes being committed against \nthe Kosovars. What was particularly troubling in this article was her \nfocus on the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war.\n  She recounted in great detail the experiences of a group of young \nwomen, young girls--very young, 12, 13, 14 and 15--who had been \nviolated over and over again; sometimes, as she outlined in this \narticle, within hearing distance--but not sight or comfort--of parents. \nIn this particular part of the world, though, what makes this doubly \nhorrific and horrifying and tough is that victims of rape often accuse \nthemselves, as if they themselves committed the crime. There is shame \nthat is brought, in this particular culture, to them and to their \nfamilies. So after having barely lived, surviving this ordeal, they are \nthen turned away, in many instances, from their fathers, their mothers, \ntheir brothers, their sisters.\n  So there is a tremendous injustice that is occurring. Many of the \nwomen in the Senate talked at great length today about this and were \njoined by our colleagues in various meetings throughout the day.\n  I just want to say, as we break for this Memorial Day, that while we \nmay take a few days of rest from our work, as one Senator, I am \nprepared to come back and daily, weekly, monthly and for years if \nnecessary, continue to come to this floor and talk about war crimes and \njustice and holding people accountable. Had we done a better job of \nthis in Bosnia, I think we could have perhaps prevented the atrocities \nwe are seeing in Kosovo today.\n  I hope the international community in every way--whether it is a \nlarge country or small country, and the people in the United States--\nwill let their elected officials know we want these war criminals \nprosecuted, we want justice brought to these families, and we want the \nresources and the comfort and counseling available to these young \nwomen--women of all ages--who have lived through the horror and the \nterror of what has been wrought in that part of the world.\n  Thank God we live in this country. It is not perfect, terrible things \nhave happened, but I can say on the eve of this Memorial Day recess how \nproud I am and mindful and grateful of the great sacrifice that has \nbeen made by men and women in uniform who have given their lives so \nthat we, in this country, can live in relative peace and prosperity \nwithout fear of being pulled from our homes at night, having our homes \nburned and our family members violated or executed.\n  We have gone through periods of history of which we are not proud. \nBut I am proud of the work this Congress does in putting forth \nlegislation and finances to support efforts that are so important, like \nthe one in which we are engaged. We will not stop until we have a \nmilitary victory. We will not stop until the diplomatic means have been \naccomplished. We will not stop until we have been able to help the \nKosovars move back into their nation and help this part of Europe join \nthe mainstream of Europe so they can live in peace, prosperity, and \ndemocracy and, finally, until justice is done to the women, children, \nand families who have been so barbarically handled in the last several \nmonths.\n  Again, I thank the leadership for their good work on this \nlegislation. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/27/senate-section/article/S6452-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6452-S6453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 7, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
