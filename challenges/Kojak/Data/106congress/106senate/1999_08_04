The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1233, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1233), making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2000, and for other purposes.\n  Pending:\n\n       Lott (for Daschle) amendment No. 1499, to provide emergency \n     and income loss assistance to agricultural producers.\n       Ashcroft amendment No. 1507 (to amendment No. 1499), to \n     provide stability in the United States agriculture sector and \n     to promote adequate availability of food and medicine for \n     humanitarian assistance abroad by requiring congressional \n     approval before the imposition of any unilateral agricultural \n     or medical sanction against a foreign country or foreign \n     entity.

Under the previous order, there will now be 40 \nminutes for debate to be equally divided between the proponents and \nopponents prior to the vote on a cloture motion.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 5 minutes.\n  I rise today in strong opposition to cloture on the majority leader's \nmotion to recommit. If it carries, the Agriculture appropriations bill \nwill be reported back to the floor with what is known as the Jeffords \ndairy compact amendment and will be subject to 30 hours of continuous \ndebate.\n  Now, as most in the Senate know by now, I am committed to fighting \nthe creation, expansion, or continuation of the price-fixing cartels \nknown as dairy compacts. They embody bad national policy, bad economic \npolicy, bad precedent, and disastrous implications for farmers who are \nforced to operate outside the protectionist walls these compacts throw \nup.\n  But that is not only why I oppose the Jeffords amendment. I oppose \nthe Jeffords amendment because it would do something much worse. It \nwould remove the Federal Government from the milk market order system. \nThe Jeffords compact amendment would specifically disallow USDA from \nspending money to administer the milk market order system. What would \nbe the result of that? According to the Secretary of Agriculture, with \nwhom I spoke yesterday, the result would be ``chaos and confusion'' in \nthe dairy industry. USDA would have no way to enforce any price system, \nso processors would end up setting the price of milk. Farmers would \nhave no recourse to USDA or anywhere else if they thought they were \nreceiving an unfair price.\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\n  What does the amendment achieve by creating this mess? Certainly not \nwhat its proponents claim. The amendment would not continue the current \npricing system, or 1-A, as many of you know it. Regardless of whether \nthis amendment passes or not, the old pricing system will expire on \nOctober 1.\n  I have a letter from the general counsel of USDA that says just that, \nand I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                Office of the General Counsel,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: In your letter of July 23, 1999, you ask \n     several questions concerning our issuance of a final rule to \n     implement the milk marketing order reform required by the \n     Agricultural Market Transition Act and the effect of a \n     possible appropriations bill prohibition on the use of fiscal \n     year 2000 funds to implement the reform.\n       As you know, the final dairy reform order was published in \n     the Federal Register on April 2, 1999, and we are now in the \n     process of conducting referenda to determine if the orders \n     should be implemented. This will be completed and a final \n     implementing order published at the end of August. \n     Implementation will thereafter occur on October 1st without \n     further action by the Department. You are correct in your \n     understanding that existing marketing orders and the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact will expire upon \n     implementation of milk marketing order reform on October 1st. \n     If the Department were prohibited from spending \n     appropriations to carry out the order reform, it would not be \n     able to provide oversight for the milk marketing order \n     system. Day-to-day operation of the respective order areas \n     could continue, however, because such operations are funded \n     through industry assessments, not appropriated funds. As you \n     correctly point out, the specific implementation date \n     requirement contained in Public Law 105-277 prohibits the \n     Department from altering the effective date. The issue of \n     whether the statutory language also prevents the Secretary \n     from rescinding the order presents novel questions which will \n     require further analysis.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles R. Rawls,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. The amendment will not create new dairy compacts in the \nSoutheast or open up the current Northeast Compact to any new members. \nNone of those items is contained in this amendment.\n  The amendment will not extend the life of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact. USDA has made it clear that the compact will expire on October \n1, whether this amendment passes or not.\n  So, then, why are we even considering this amendment? I can only \nimagine it is because the proponents of the amendment are betting that \nthey will get some of the things they promised--most notably, an \nextension of the Northeast Dairy Compact--in conference.\n  I think that is a cynical and an irresponsible bet, especially by \nSenators who are not even on the conference committee. Under an \nuncertain and unregulated system, dairy farmers across the country \nstand to lose $194 million a year. Furthermore, this very week dairy \nfarmers all across America are voting on what sort of milk market \nsystem they want. So should we not wait to see what farmers have to say \nbefore we bet their farms on the Jeffords amendment?\n  The Jeffords amendment is not 1-A. It is not a dairy compact. It is a \ndesperate last attempt to carve a dairy cartel for the Northeast out of \nthe current pricing system. Unfortunately, the authors of the amendment \nused an ax rather than a knife, and the result will be a milk market \norder system that will be a bloody mess.\n  The proponents of this amendment have accused us of describing their \namendment in a way that makes it more terrifying than the ``Blair Witch \nProject.'' They are correct. Their amendment is more terrifying. That \nis because the chaos it would create would not be a fiction; it would \nbe real.\n  The Jeffords amendment is opposed by the 300,000 farmers of the \nNational Farmers Union and the 300,000 taxpayers of the National \nTaxpayers Union. I urge my colleagues to join the taxpayers and the \nfarmers of your States and oppose cloture on the Jeffords amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, has the Senator from Wisconsin finished?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, the reason we are here \ntoday is to talk about cloture, whether we should have time to fully \ndiscuss and be able to make sure that this body knows the importance of \nwhat we want to do, and that is to protect the dairy farmers of the \nUnited States. We are not here to discuss the fine points of the issues \nwhich the Senator from Wisconsin has brought out, with which we \nsincerely most heartily disagree, but whether or not we ought to have \nthe opportunity and whether it is important enough to this country and \nto the dairy farmers to have a full discussion by getting cloture. If \nwe don't get cloture, then chaos will happen in many areas, in \nespecially New England which has a compact which would go out of being \nand would require dramatic action in order to repair the damage that \nwould be done.\n  Dairy farmers around the country are watching the actions of the \nSenate this week with great anticipation and anxiety. They know that \nunder the 1996 farm bill, Congress instructed the Secretary of \nAgriculture to develop much needed new pricing formulas for how milk is \npriced. Unfortunately, they also know that Secretary Glickman's \nresulting informal rulemaking process is developing pricing formulas \nthat are fatally flawed and contrary to the will of Congress.\n  The Nation's dairy farmers are counting on this Congress to prevent \nthe dairy industry from being placed at risk and instead to secure its \nsound future.\n  This chart says it all. This is the devastation that will come from \nthe proposed order of the Secretary. What this shows is, with the new \norder 1-B, there is only one area of this country that will \nsubstantially benefit. Guess what area that is? Wisconsin and \nMinnesota. The rest, clearly delineated by the red, will lose money--\nall of them. There is a little green in the tip of Florida, there is a \nlittle green on the coast of California, and there is a little green in \na couple of States, but the rest all lose money.\n  The question is whether 1-A, which was studied, should be replaced to \nmake sure that does not occur. Mr. President, 1-A, which is supported \nby a letter to the Secretary by 61 Members of the Senate, will not \ncreate this devastation. In fact, it will provide an orderly system for \nfarmers all over this country to make a decent income.\n  Secretary Glickman's final pricing rules, scheduled to be implemented \non October 1, will cost dairy farmers, not the Government, millions of \ndollars in lost income from their pockets. There are no Federal funds \ninvolved with this. That is something that may be confusing because in \nthe past, the dairy program cost millions of dollars. It does not cost \nanyone anything now.\n  This amendment will prevent the Secretary's rule from being \nimplemented, thereby maintaining the current law for dairy pricing for \nanother year.\n  Do not be taken in by any of the misleading claims made by the \nopposition, including their references to the letter from USDA \nsupposedly indicating the amendment does not accomplish its purpose. \nFirst of all, it can be easily modified in conference and, secondly, it \ndoes accomplish its purpose. This will allow a new rulemaking procedure \nfor the Secretary to carry out the will of Congress for a new and \nimproved pricing structure. It will also allow the Northeast Dairy \nCompact pilot project--remember, this is a pilot project which was put \ninto law in 1996 to see if by States gathering together they can \norganize an order system which would protect them from high prices to \nthe consumers and low prices to farmers because of the fact, when you \nget into milk situations, you can get devastation with a little bit of \nsurplus.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Chair. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment which \nhelps dairy farmers across the country.\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\n  I think the least the Senate should do when debating a relief bill \nfor farmers is to not reduce farm income.\n  The Department of Agriculture's milk marketing order--the so-called \nmodified ``option 1-B''-- would reduce farm income by about a million \ndollars per day. That doesn't sound like farm aid to me. It sounds like \na recipe for disaster.\n  Why should dairy farmers in Mississippi, North Carolina, Georgia, or \nCalifornia, for example, have their income cut by USDA rules when other \nfarmers will get helped under this bill? I think dairy farmers are as \ndeserving as other farmers.\n  Isn't it enough that the price of milk paid to dairy farmers dropped \nby almost 40 percent recently? Why should the Secretary be allowed to \nchange current policy to punish dairy farmers even more by reducing \ntheir income?\n  Sixty-one Senators signed a letter to Secretary Glickman opposing the \ncuts in farm income that would result from implementing the so-called \noption 1-B.\n  Those sixty-one Senators pointed out that ``dairy farmers . . . are \nreceiving essentially the same price for their milk that they received \nfifteen years ago while the cost of production has increased. Option 1-\nB would further reduce the price of milk received by farmers in almost \nall regions of the country, thereby reducing local supplies of fresh, \nfluid milk and increasing costs for consumers.''\n  This amendment--the Lott amendment--mandates that current law be \ncontinued and that option 1-B be put on ice.\n  I must address some unfortunate misinformation that is being spread \nabout the amendment.\n  We received a ``Dear Colleague'' letter from Senator Feingold that \nincorrectly suggests that the Lott amendment would terminate the milk \nmarketing order system.\n  That, of course, is not the case. Probably only a few Senators want \nto eliminate milk differentials and the marketing order system. The \ngreat majority of Senators, including myself, believe that this is not \nthe time to terminate the milk order system.\n  The Lott amendment would not terminate that system and a letter from \nthe General Counsel of USDA that is being used by opponents of the Lott \namendment does not even make that point.\n  Indeed, the General Counsel says: ``the issue of whether the \nstatutory language also prevents the Secretary from rescinding the \norder presents novel questions which will require further analysis.''\n  But, we already know this amendment does not terminate the marketing \norder system since it is drafted the same way we drafted a similar \nextension of the milk marketing order system last year.\n  Section 738 of last year's appropriations bill provided a similar \nextension. No one at USDA argued that last year's extension terminated \nall milk marketing orders.\n  Indeed, Congress can pass laws that supercede rules issued by \nDepartments.\n  Of course any drafting glitch could be fixed at Conference, but there \nis no glitch since we are simply extending current law, just like we \ndid last year.\n  I want to address other misinformation that is being spread. Some \nhave been saying that the amendment could mean higher prices for \nconsumers.\n  I will compare milk prices in New England against the Upper Midwest \nany day of the week.\n  A General Accounting Office, GAO, report dated October, 1998, \ncompared retail milk prices for various U.S. cities.\n  For example for February, 1998, the average price of a gallon of \nwhole milk in Augusta, ME, was $2.47 per gallon.\n  The price for Milwaukee, WI, was $2.63 per gallon. Prices in \nMinneapolis, MN, were much higher--they were $2.94 per gallon.\n  Let's pick another New England city--Boston. The price of a gallon of \nmilk was $2.54 as compared to Minneapolis, MN, which was $2.94 per \ngallon.\n  Let's look at the cost of 1% milk for November, 1997, for example.\n  In Augusta, ME, it was $2.37 per gallon, the same average price as \nfor Boston, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. In Minnesota, the price was \n$2.82 per gallon.\n  I could go on and on comparing lower New England retail prices with \nhigher prices in other cities for many different months.\n  It is clear that our Compact is working as it was intended to by \nbenefitting consumers, local economies and farmers. I will submit a \nlengthy list of additional price comparisons to prove my point for the \nrecord.\n  I conclude by saying that sixty-one Senators warned the Secretary of \nAgriculture to not cut farm income by implementing option 1-B.\n  What we are offering is narrowly tailored, sensible and modest. It \nsimply extends current law. Punishing dairy farmers in New England and \nother regions of the country makes no sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in protecting farm income for \ndairy farmers by voting for cloture for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to make a few additional comments on \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  The success of the Northeast Dairy Compact is undeniable. In fact, \nthanks to the Northeast Compact, the number of farmers going out of \nbusiness has declined throughout New England for the first time in many \nyears.\n  If you are a proponent of States rights, regional compacts are the \nanswer. Compacts are State initiated, State ratified, and State \nsupported programs which assure a continuous safe supply of milk for \nconsumers.\n  If you support interstate trade, then regional compacts are the \nanswer. The Northeast Dairy Compact has prompted an increase of milk \nsales from neighboring States into the northeast compact region.\n  If you support a balanced budget, then regional compacts are the \nanswer. The Northeast Compact does not cost taxpayers a single cent, \nand this is a lot different than most farm programs.\n  If you support farmland protection programs, then regional compacts \nare the answer. Major environmental groups have endorsed the Northeast \nDairy Compact because they know it helps preserve farmland and prevent \nurban sprawl.\n  If you are concerned about the impact of prices on consumers, then \nregional compacts are the answer. Retail milk prices within the compact \nregion are lower on average than in the rest of the country, something \nthe opponents do not point out.\n  The Northeast Compact has done exactly what it was established to do: \nstabilize fluctuating dairy prices, assure a fair price for dairy \nfarmers, keep farmers in business, and protect consumer supplies of \nfresh milk.\n  Many of our friends in the South have seen how the compact provides a \nmodest but crucial safety net for struggling dairy farmers, and I think \nall of us should look at these compacts as a way to help farmers \nwithout costing the taxpayers.\n  There are many additional areas to discuss. I am going to reserve my \ntime, but in closing I do want to say this: It is clear that our \ncompact is working as intended by benefiting consumers, local \neconomies, and farmers.\n  Sixty-one Senators have warned the Secretary of Agriculture to not \ncut dairy farm income by implementing option 1-B. What we are offering \nis narrowly tailored, sensible, and modest. It simply extends current \nlaw.\n  We are here to protect hard-working dairy farmers. I urge the 61 \nSenators, plus everyone else, to join with us and vote for cloture on \nthis amendment. The 61 Senators who signed that letter to Secretary \nGlickman should, and I hope that other Senators, having listened to \nthis debate, will as well.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I first thank the senior Senator from Wisconsin for his \nleadership and dedication on this issue. He has been determined, and I \nthink effectively, in fighting this battle that we have to fight on \nbehalf of Wisconsin dairy farmers, upper Midwestern dairy farmers, and \nI think dairy farmers all over this country. I thank him and join in \nhis words that we will fight this thing as hard and as long as we have \nto, to prevent this extremely unfair idea of trying to continue the New \nEngland Dairy Compact.\n  But the really interesting thing about the measure before us, the \nissue the cloture is going to be about, is that it really does not have \nthe impact that a lot of Senators think it might have.\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\n  The Jeffords-Leahy amendment that they have offered will withhold \nfunding--it will withhold funding--for implementation of the Federal \nmilk marketing order reform in an attempt to preserve the Northeastern \nInterstate Dairy Compact.\n  They thought this amendment would produce the same result it did when \na similar amendment was offered during the appropriations bill last \nyear--and that is a delay of milk marketing order reform--and then an \nextension of the compact. But it does not do that. As the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin has indicated, it does not do that.\n  This isn't what the 61 Senators whom the Senator from Vermont was \ntalking about signed a letter about. It isn't about picking 1-B or 1-A. \nThat isn't what it does. What it simply does is create chaos. That is \nexactly what Senator Kohl has indicated. And we are not asking you to \njust take our word for it. Take the word of the general counsel of the \nUSDA, who has made it clear that he believes the legal effect of this \nlatest dairy initiative by the Senators from Vermont will be \nuncertainty and no Federal oversight of the system.\n  A lack of funding at USDA will throw administration of the Federal \nMilk Marketing Order Program into chaos, effectively leaving no program \nat all.\n  The Senator from Vermont hangs his hat on the notion that this letter \nsays, at the end, that the issue involves novel questions. But that \nignores the heart of the letter, which I want to repeat. It is a letter \naddressed to Senator Kohl, dated August 2, 1999, from Charles Rawls, \ngeneral counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture. It says:\n\n       You are correct in your understanding that existing \n     marketing orders and the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact \n     will expire upon implementation of milk marketing order \n     reform on October 1st. If the Department were prohibited from \n     spending appropriations to carry out the order reform, it \n     would not be able to provide oversight for the milk marketing \n     order system. Day-to-day operation of the respective order \n     areas could continue, however, because such operations are \n     funded through industry assessments, not appropriated funds.\n\n  So it is not equivocal about whether, in fact, this will happen. It \nsimply says that the compact will expire and that in fact at this point \nwe will not have an order system. That is not ambiguous.\n  I think it is very ironic that the Senator from Vermont came up and \ntried to argue that somehow our position on this is unfair to the rest \nof the country. It is just the reverse. The amendment that has been \noffered actually makes things much worse for almost the entire country \nthan the current status under the bill.\n  Under the Jeffords-Leahy amendment, the impact on dairy income in \nvarious regions is startling. For the Northeast--if you can believe \nthis--it involves a net loss of $225 million in dairy income, if this \nchaos ensues; in the Appalachia area, $122 million in lost dairy \nincome; in Florida, $100 million; in the Southeast, $112 million in \nlost dairy income--and down the line.\n  Overall, I believe the figure is a total loss of some $194 million \nnet income if this amendment goes through and the consequence that we \nbelieve occurs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the National Farmers Union, also addressed to Senator \nKohl, of August 3, indicating opposition and concerns about this \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Herbert H. Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: I write today on behalf of the 300,000 \n     members of the National Farmers Union to express our concern \n     regarding the Jefford's amendment that would prohibit the use \n     of funds for USDA to implement or administer dairy marketing \n     order reform later this year.\n       As you know, expiration of the current national marketing \n     order is due October 1st, and with the passage of the \n     Jefford's amendment, dairy farmers across the nation could be \n     left without any federal marketing order that could risk \n     destroying the remnants of the dairy safety net.\n       We have deep concerns about pitting region versus region in \n     agricultural policy, especially dairy policy. We strongly \n     encourage a policy that will benefit all dairy producers \n     nationally.\n       Specifically, we support legislation to establish dairy \n     compacts and amend the federal order system if those \n     provisions are coupled with legislation to establish the \n     national dairy support price at $12.50 per hundredweight. If \n     Congress chooses to amend the federal order system, the \n     amendment should strike the provision in the final rule that \n     increases the processors' manufacturing allowance at the \n     expense of family farmers.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our position on dairy \n     policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leland Swenson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator from Wisconsin if I could be granted \n1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair and Senator Kohl.\n  The other piece that I think ought to be printed in the Record, \nespecially in light of the comments of the Senator from Vermont with \nregard to some of the groups interested in this issue, is a letter from \nthe National Taxpayers Union strongly opposing this amendment and \nspecifically saying that, ``the Dairy Compact concept acts as a cartel \nsystem that only a Robber Baron could admire.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, August 3, 1999.\n\n Vote NO on Cloture on Tomorrow's Ag Approps Dairy Amendment--And Keep \n                   the Glass Half Full for Taxpayers\n\n       Dear Senator: Tomorrow the Senate will vote on cloture for \n     an amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations Bill that is \n     intended to halt the progress of dairy subsidy reform. In \n     order to prevent this consumer rip-off and preserve the \n     prospect of modest gains towards a competitive dairy market, \n     the 300,000-member National Taxpayers Union (NTU) urges you \n     to vote ``NO'' on this cloture motion.\n       The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) final rule on \n     Milk Marketing Order reform was, at best, an imperfect \n     solution. In an ideal legislative and regulatory climate, the \n     cumbersome 893-page document would be jettisoned in favor of \n     a comprehensible blueprint that simply substitutes a free \n     market for the current cartel. In the absence of this \n     approach, taxpayers' interests can best be served by ongoing \n     Congressional oversight of the results of USDA's plan, rather \n     than legislative micro-mandates that only further cloud a \n     murky reform.\n       Price-setting mechanisms such as the Northeast Dairy \n     Compact can not only cost consumers millions due to \n     overinflated prices, they can also raise omnious Interstate \n     Commerce issues. Rather than promoting trade and preventing \n     abusive tariffs among states--the clear intent of the \n     Constitution's Commerce Clause--the Dairy Compact concept \n     acts as a cartel system that only a Robber Baron could \n     admire.\n       The 1996 Freedom to Farm Act held the promise of finally \n     phasing out the dairy price support system as well as \n     sunsetting the Northeast Dairy Compact. The bill passed \n     Congress by strong bipartisan margins. Today, some Members \n     believe that this timetable for reform should be discarded \n     entirely or that new compacts should be authorized. Either \n     action would signal a move in the wrong direction. NTU, along \n     with many Members, would actually support a more aggressive \n     timetable towards wholesale elimination of dairy subsidies.\n       The impact of tomorrow's amendment, which would withhold \n     USDA implementation of milk marketing order reform, may not \n     be entirely predictable. But its original intent is clear to \n     sabotage the bipartisan consensus in Congress toward a freer \n     milk market, and open the door for re-regulation in \n     conference. For this reason, NTU urges you to play it safe \n     for taxpayers, and vote ``NO'' on cloture on the Dairy \n     Amendment to Agriculture Appropriations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Pete Sepp,\n                                Vice President for Communications.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I, of course, join with my senior \nSenator and friend from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, in asking that we not \ntake what is, frankly, an irrational step of using this mechanism that \nwas forced because of the rule XVI change to pretend that somehow this \nwill extend the dairy compact. It will not do that. It will just lead \nto a chaotic situation--that the Department of Agriculture cannot do \ntheir job of administering the milk marketing order system.\n  I thank the Senate and the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield Senator Grams up to 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the cloture motion \non the\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\nmotion to recommit the appropriations bill to committee with \ninstructions to include the Jeffords/Leahy amendment.\n  First, I would like to express my displeasure with this attempt to \ndodge the clear purpose of Rule 16.\n  I am at a loss to understand how we can reinstate Rule 16 one week \nthen turn around and justify offering what is an extremely \ncontroversial policy change that is clearly non-germane on a major \nappropriations bill. Drafted to circumvent Rule 16 restrictions, Mr. \nJeffords' proposed changes to the farm bill almost guarantee litigation \nand confusion in the milk marketing system due to the uncertainty over \nits effect. It is a controversial, non-germane issue that does not \nbelong on an appropriations bill as a floor amendment.\n  It is important that I remind some of my colleagues that this \namendment does not extend authorization of the compact to your states. \nAlso, this August 2nd letter from Charles Rawls, General Counsel for \nUSDA, states that funds have already been spent to implement the milk \nmarketing order reform and the reform could still operate without \noversight from USDA. The order reform is administered by producer \nassessments so no other federal funds are required to implement it. \nThus, though the Jeffords Amendment intends to maintain the status quo \nin milk marketing orders by not funding implementation, counsel for \nUSDA states that the specific implementation date requirement contained \nin Public Law 105-277 remains unaltered. Any uncertainty in the effect \nof this amendment is between whether the reform can be implemented \nwithout USDA oversight or whether we will have no dairy marketing \norders at all. Reinstating the current system similar to 1A is simply \nnot an option here.\n  Mr. President, as the letter from Mr. Rawls shows, it's not clear \nthis amendment would save the Northeast Compact, and it certainly does \nnot solve any problems for the other states seeking to form compacts. \nNot only does the amendment fail to extend compacts to other areas of \nthe country outside the Northeast, it also does not implement Option 1-\nA.\n  Despite the fact that I do not believe Mr. Jeffords' amendment \naccomplishes its intended goal I also urge you to vote against cloture \non the simple grounds of rejecting the concept of providing a benefit \nto producers in one area of the country which gives them a competitive \nadvantage over dairy farmers in other regions of the United States.\n  Dairy farmers are suffering all over the country. Why support this \ncompact legislation that helps mainly one area of the country at the \nexpense of others? Why support an effort that would send the signal \nthat we can consider endless controversial non-germane issues on \nappropriations bills in the future? Why risk passage of needed relief \nto America's farmers?\n  Besides addressing the narrow issue of the pending amendment, I would \nlike to remind you why compacts that penalize consumers, particularly \nlow-income consumers, milk processors, and regional dairy producers are \nso dangerous, and urge my colleagues to reject this blatantly unfair \nbarrier that penalizes some of the best and most efficient dairy \nfarmers in America.\n\n  First, I would like to explain what dairy compacts are. The Northeast \nDairy Compact raises the price of Class I fluid milk above the \nprevailing federal milk marketing order price within the participating \nstates, and, I might add, above what the market would pay. Milk \nprocessors have to pay the higher price for the raw milk they process, \nand this higher price is passed along to the consumer at the grocery \nstore. With higher prices, consumption goes down, and children are the \nbiggest losers. I don't argue against a fair price--or honest price for \nany dairy farmer in Minnesota or Vermont, but I cannot support price \nfixing that distorts the free market.\n  The Northeast Compact was authorized in 1996 during consideration of \nthe larger Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act. This \ncontroversial issue was inserted in the conference committee, avoiding \na separate vote, after the measure had been overwhelmingly defeated on \nthe floor. While most of the FAIR Act was designed to help farmers \ncompete in world markets and reduce government involvement in \nagriculture, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact established a \nregional price-fixing cartel within our very own country that promotes \nhigher production which depresses prices outside the compact. The \nNortheast Dairy Compact has harmed dairy farmers in Minnesota, and this \nkind of unfair subsidy should be terminated.\n  When this issue came to the fore, compacts were roundly condemned in \nthe major newspapers of the compact region. The New York Times, Boston \nHerald, the Connecticut Post, and the Hartford Courant all weighed in \nagainst the cartel, in addition to national publications such as USA \nToday and the Washington Post.\n  Again, compacts were hardly consensus legislation to begin with. The \nHouse refused to put the provision in its broader farm bill. And I must \nreiterate, the Senate voted on the floor to strip the Compact language \nfrom its bill. Despite these defeats, the compact provision was slipped \ninto the bill in conference and signed by the President. The compact \nlegislation could not withstand the scrutiny of a fair debate on the \nfloor, and had to be muscled in at the last minute in conference.\n  Knowing that this scheme was a bad idea from the start, Congress \nlimited the life of the compact. That's why proponents will seek an \nextension by amendment today.\n  Retail prices of milk jumped immediately after the higher Compact \nprice was implemented. As predicted, the milk produced in New England \nincreased by four times the national rate of increase in a six-month \nperiod following compact implementation. The surplus milk was converted \ninto milk powder, leading to a 60% increase in milk powder production.\n  Soon after implementation, the Northeast Compact had to begin \nreimbursing school food service programs for the increases in cost \ncaused by the milk price hikes; an admission that prices have gone up \nand consumers are being affected. However, low-income families that \nneed milk in their diet are not being reimbursed by the Compact for \ntheir increased costs. Milk is a food staple, and are we going to vote \ntoday to extend this milk tax that hits low-income citizens hardest who \nspend a high percentage of their income on food? What's next, a special \ntax on bread, eggs, ground beef, or potatoes? Consider the low-income \nfamilies with small children and the elderly on fixed incomes in your \nstate and ask if this is the population you want bearing the brunt of \nthis regressive milk tax.\n\n  I cannot stress to my colleagues enough that you simply cannot \ncontain the market distortions and economic hardship that these compact \nschemes cause. Proponents present an idyllic picture of the compacts as \nonly a few cents hike in the price of milk to preserve the small, rural \ndairy farmer. This is simply not true. Dairy compacts are an economic \nzero-sum game in which there are many losers--most importantly the \nconsumer (especially the low-income consumer) and dairy farmers in non-\ncompact regions. The real winners in this zero-sum game are large dairy \nproducers in the Northeast that receive literally tens of thousands of \ndollars in subsidies for their already profitable businesses, not the \nsmall dairy farmer who supporters said was the focus of this idea. The \naverage six month subsidy for large Northeast dairy farms is projected \nto be $78,400. Dairy farmers in Minnesota would relish that income over \nthe whole year, but Minnesota farmers wisely reject this effort to \ndistort the system and harm their fellow farmers in other states.\n  It also is erroneous to characterize this issue as small family farms \nin one region falling victim to large, corporate-style farming \nconglomerates in another. There are no, if you will, ``Wal-Marts'' of \ndairy farming in Minnesota. In our state, we have families that farm as \na way of life, know that they must stay efficient to remain \ncompetitive, and want desperately to compete on a level playing field. \nMinnesota has thousands of family farms--passed from generation to \ngeneration --that are struggling to stay afloat in a rigged market that \nunfairly favors producers in a different part of the country. And many \nhave failed. Compacts are not a policy that saves family farms.\n  As Wayne Bok, President of the Minnesota-based co-op Associated Milk\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\nProducers has put it, consider what would happen if the Northern states \ndecided they wanted to produce oranges, and formed a compact to do so. \nOranges sold in the North would receive a higher price than oranges \nsold in other regions. As a result, production of oranges would \nincrease in the North. Prices in the South would drop until production \ndecreased to compensate for the increase in Northern production. \nMoreover, Northern farmers would begin to convert from, say, corn and \ndairy farming, to the now more profitable farming of oranges.\n  Would this be good for the country's most efficient orange growers in \nFlorida and California? Absolutely not.\n  Would this be good for consumers?\n  Absolutely not.\n  This outrageous scenario demonstrates the ridiculousness of current \ndairy policy. Let each farm region of the country do what it does best \nand don't erect artificial barriers that keep the products of the most \nefficient producers out of the hands of the consumers.\n  In 1996 Congress and the President committed to a new farm policy, \nmoving our country away from artificial price and supply controls, and \nfreeing farmers to compete on the world market. American farmers are \nthe most skilled and efficient in the world, and they deserve the \nopportunity to compete and expand their markets. At the same time that \nwe are calling upon our global trading partners to bring down their \ntrade barriers for the benefit of both consumers and producers, we \nattempt to continue or construct new barriers between regions in our \nown country that discourage the free flow of commerce and create \nsignificant market distortions and price increases. Its hypocritical \nfor us to demand free trade at a global level but enact trade barriers \nwithin our own country.\n\n  I urge my colleagues today to commit to fairness in dairy policy. \nPlease be fair to consumers and dairy producers--vote against this or \nany other compact amendment.\n  I must also address the other intended effect of the dairy amendment, \nthe proposal to zero out funding for implementation of the final rule \npresumably to maintain the status quo in federal milk marketing orders \nand to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact. I believe that Mr. Jeffords' \namendment fails to accomplish this intent.\n  The current milk marketing system requires processors to pay higher \nminimum prices for fluid milk the further the region is located from \nEau Claire, Wisconsin. To reform this antiquated, Depression-era method \nfor supplying milk to consumers, which basically picks winners and \nlosers in the dairy industry, Congress, through the 1996 FAIR Act, \nrequired USDA to significantly reduce the number of milk marketing \norders (regions) in the country and transition to a more market-\noriented system of milk distribution. After many months of study and \nhaving received comments from hundreds of market participants, USDA \nproposed Options 1-A and 1-B. The Option 1-A proposal made minimal \nchanges to the old marketing order pricing system, while Option 1-B \ncontained some basic free market reforms and modernizations of the \nsystem. The Midwest did not like what we saw in 1B, actually, and like \nthe compromise even less, but it was a small step in the right \ndirection.\n  The compromise came after the USDA received testimony concerning the \ntwo alternatives, and its final rule again takes steps toward \nsimplifying and modernizing the milk marketing order system. The new \ncompromise orders will be effective October 1, 1999. I hoped for a \nproposal closer to 1-B, but accepted the need for compromise and have \nsupported it.\n  Option 1-A is basically no reform, and would ignore the direction of \nCongress in the FAIR Act. It would increase prices for consumers by $74 \nmillion per year, affecting most the low-income consumer that spends a \nhigh percentage of their wages on food. Option 1-A also keeps in place \na regionally discriminatory milk pricing system that benefits producers \nin some parts of the country at the expense of dairy farmers in other \nregions, much like compacts. Again, it's a government program that \npicks winners and losers, not allowing the market to set the prices. It \nis opposed by free market taxpayer advocacy groups, consumer groups, \nregional producer groups, and processor groups, and it does nothing to \nprotect the nation's supply of fresh fluid milk; our nation produces an \nabundance of milk that is sufficient to supply consumers' needs.\n\n  Secretary Glickman, writing about the final rule, said that:\n\n       USDA's own analysis shows that nationally, dairy farmers \n     will realize virtually the same cash receipts under the new, \n     fairer plan as they do now, and when aggregated, the all-milk \n     price will remain essentially unchanged from that under the \n     existing program, which virtually all sides agree sorely \n     needs changing[.]\n\n  Moreover, Chairman Lugar said that the final compromise rule ``is a \ngood first step toward a policy that places the nation's dairy industry \nin a position to better meet the challenges of the global markets of \nthe new century[.]''\n  Again, the final rule is a compromise, not the best for either 1A or \n1B advocates but a middle ground. We should not rush to reverse a \nprocess that took months to complete in order to keep the status quo.\n  What we have here is a double whammy. Compacts are bad enough, but \nretaining the failed dairy policies of the past is just \nincomprehensible.\n  Finally, what we need to ask ourselves even more is why are we \nconsidering these controversial issues on this appropriations bill. The \nJudiciary Committee has jurisdiction over compacts and Agriculture over \nmilk marketing orders. Please respect these committees' opposition to \nthese amendments which circumvent their jurisdiction, respect the \nreimplementation of Rule 16, and vote against this attempt to legislate \nthrough the appropriations process. And most of all, reject an \namendment that doesn't even accomplish its intended purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to the \nproposed amendment that would effectively extend the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact and open the door to the creation of \nadditional interstate dairy compacts. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the cloture motion. These interstate compacts would allow \nstates to form alliances that would create economic barriers and foster \neconomic warfare between the states. First, I want to commend my \ncolleagues for their efforts on behalf of their states. In particular, \nSenator Jeffords has been a forceful advocate for dairy compacts. But \nalthough I share the concerns of my colleagues for the future of all \nAmerican farmers, we cannot authorize interstate compacts that would \nencourage activities which are contrary to the constitutional principle \nof establishing and maintaining a national free market for the products \nof all citizens.\n  To date, only one dairy compact, the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact, has been authorized by Congress. It initially passed as an \namendment in conference to the 1996 farm bill, after the Senate had \nstripped the compact language out of the bill on the Senate floor. The \ncompact authorization was for 2 years only, but was extended last year, \nuntil October 1, 1999, by an amendment to appropriations legislation. \nSince the creation of this compact, a number of state legislatures have \nauthorized the creation of new interstate dairy compacts. And today, \nonce again, an amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill has \nbeen introduced that would extend the life of the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact and possibly lead in conference to the authorization of a \nSouthern Compact.\n  The Framers of the Constitution intended the compact clause to help \npreserve national unity by prohibiting States from entering into \ninterstate compacts without congressional approval. See Virginia v. \nTennessee, 148 U.S. 503 (1893). Like the commerce clause, the compact \nclause prevents States from joining forces to the detriment of the \nnational interest. It is true that the overwhelming majority of \ncompacts serve benign purposes that are not intended to insulate States \nfrom competition or to harm the national economy, or otherwise \nadversely affect the national interest. Indeed, Congress has approved \nhundreds of interstate compacts. These compacts have facilitated \nnationally beneficial projects such as the development of\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\nhighway, railroad, and subway transportation, the construction of \nbridges, the allocation of water-control rights, the establishment of \nboundary lines, and protection against forest fires. These are \nprecisely the type of agreements the compact clause was intended to \nfacilitate.\n  The proposed dairy compacts, however, would frustrate, rather than \nfacilitate, free trade among the States. In essence, dairy compacts \nprohibit interstate competition by preventing non-compact dairy farmers \nfrom freely setting the price for their dairy goods sold in compact \nstates. These compacts represent economic protectionism, pure and \nsimple. Indeed, this is an attempt by a group of states to dictate to \nthe rest of the country's dairy farmers the terms under which they can \nsell their goods into compact regions. It is unimaginable that the \nSenate would vote to embrace a form of economic protectionism that \nflies in the face of the Constitutional principle of a free market \nsociety.\n\n  As the Supreme Court stated in H.P. Hood v. DuMond, 336 U.S. 525, 529 \n(1949):\n\n       . . . our system, fostered by the Commerce Clause, is that \n     every farmer and every craftsman shall be encouraged to \n     produce by the certainty that he will have free access to \n     every market in the Nation, that no home embargoes will \n     withhold his exports, and no foreign state will by customs \n     duties or regulations exclude them. Likewise, every consumer \n     may look to the free competition from every producing area in \n     the Nation to protect him from exploitation by any. Such was \n     the vision of the Founders . . .\n\n  If we continue to approve dairy compacts, that vision will be \nforsaken. And, if we continue down this road, I ask my colleagues: \n``what's next?'' Will we be asked to protect the poultry industry? Why \nnot protect regional software or Internet companies? If the logic \nbehind these dairy compacts is that states or regions should be allowed \nto collude to raise artificially the price of dairy products to protect \nfarmers and producers at the expense of the consumer, then why not give \ncertain states or regions the right to collude to raise artificially \nthe prices of other goods and services? Because AOL employs so many \npeople in Maryland and Virginia, shouldn't those two states be \npermitted to agree to prevent any company from offering Internet access \nto consumers in Maryland or Virginia at a price below that offered by \nAOL? The minimum price could be justified by stating its purpose is to \nprotect the jobs created by AOL in these states. Certainly, the \nargument would go, the purpose is not to eliminate competition--that is \njust an unfortunate circumstance of protecting an industry that \ncontributes significantly to the states' economies.\n  This hypothetical may sound farfetched, but it is not. The logic is \nthe same: ``We need to protect our state's industries regardless of the \neffects on competition or consumers.'' No, my colleagues, we simply \ncannot start down the road of protecting one region's industries \nagainst others, regardless of how significant an industry may be to one \nstate's interests. We cannot elevate one region's concerns over the \nnation's interest in ensuring a stable, free market that thrives on \ncompetition.\n  A vote against these compacts is not a vote against dairy farmers. \nAll of the Senators who are opposed to these compacts, myself included, \nsympathize with the plight of so many of America's farmers who are \nstruggling to stay in business, but we cannot solve this problem by \npitting one industry against consumers, or one region against the \nnation. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I cannot support dairy \ncompacts that allow states to collude to thwart competition, the \nresults of which ultimately harm America's consumers. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the dairy compact amendment which would \nallow less efficient producers in one region of the country to exclude \nlower priced dairy goods from other regions in an effort to protect \ntheir farmers and producers at the expense of consumers. This is not \nthe type of agreements the founders envisioned interstate compacts \nwould facilitate--indeed, it is exactly the type they feared.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise with Senators Specter and \nSchumer in support of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. This \nissue is one of critical importance to the dairy farmers of New Jersey. \nIt is rare that I come before this body to talk about issues affecting \nour Nation's farmers, however this is an issue of extreme importance to \nmy state and family farms nationwide.\n  Today New Jersey has less than 200 family dairy farms. These farms \nhave been in families for centuries, and have been handed down from \ngeneration to generation. I've met with New Jersey's family farmers, \nfrom Sussex and Warren and Hunderdon Counties, and heard their \nconcerns. I know how important they are to my State. Dairy farming is \nnot an easy or lavish life. They milk 7 days a week, 365 days a year, \nstarting out long before dawn, before most of us are out and about.\n  These courageous farmers want to keep their farms, and pass them down \nto their children. However, without our help, they will not be able to \nrealize this dream. The family farm is the backbone of agriculture in \nNew Jersey; however, today, it is on the verge of extinction. In fact, \nNew Jersey has lost 42 percent of its dairy farms in the past decade.\n  Erratic fluctuations in the prices dairy farmers receive for their \nraw milk is causing such losses that these farmers are forced out of \nbusiness. These farms produce over 289 million pounds of milk each \nyear, but as prices decline and costs continue to increase, farmers \nneed help to stabilize milk prices for survival. Without a mechanism to \nensure stable prices for milk, New Jersey's family dairy farms will be \nforced out of business.\n  However, this problem is not unique to my State. Family farms all \nacross the country are hurting. Our Nation's dairy farmers recently \nexperienced a 37 percent drop in the price they receive for their milk. \nThis presents a dilemma for family farms, which must still pay the same \namount to feed their cows, hire help, and pay utility costs. This \nenormous strain will no doubt force some dairy farmers out of business.\n  We must protect America's family farms, and ensure the future \nvitality of America's dairy industry by re-authorizing and expanding \nthe Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. I am hopeful that my colleagues \nwill consider the farmers of my state when this issue is debated in \nconference.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Jeffords \namendment to delay implementation of the final pricing rule on Federal \nmilk market order reform. The intent of this amendment is to delay the \nexpiration of the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am proud to be a strong \nsupporter of the Compact, which is a proven success that is critical to \nthe survival of dairy farmers in Maine and throughout New England.\n  First approved by Congress in the 1996 farm bill, the New England \nDairy Compact already has a proven track record of quantifiable \nbenefits to both consumers and farmers. The Compact works simply by \nevening out the peaks and valleys in fluid milk prices, providing \nstability to the cost of milk and ensuring a supply a fresh, wholesome, \nlocal milk.\n  This past year, the Compact has proven its worth to both dairy \nfarmers and consumers. As prices climbed and farmers were receiving a \nsustainable price for milk, the Compact turned off, allowing the market \nto function through principles of supply and demand. But when prices \ndropped sharply, the Compact was triggered to soften and slow the blow \nto farmers of an abrupt and dramatic drop in the volatile, often \nunpredictable milk market.\n  Consumers also benefit from the Compact. Not only does the Compact \nstabilize prices, thus avoiding dramatic fluctuation in the retail cost \nof milk, it also guarantees that the consumer is assured the \navailability of a supply of fresh, local milk. We've known for a long \ntime that dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet, but \nrecent studies are proving that dairy products provide a host of \npreviously unknown nutritional benefits. Just as we are learning of the \ntremendous health benefits of dairy foods, however, milk consumption, \nespecially among young people, is dropping. It is a crucial, common-\nsense, first step to reverse this trend, for milk to be available and \nconsistently affordable for young families.\n  Finally, the Compact, while providing clear benefits to dairy \nproducers and consumers in the Northeast, has proven it does not harm \nfarmers or taxpayers from outside the region. A 1998\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nreport by the Office of Management and Budget showed that, during the \nfirst 6-months of the Compact, it did not adversely affect farmers from \noutside the Compact region and added no costs to Federal nutrition \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, many of Maine's dairy farmers tell me that the Compact \nis critical to their long-term survival and ability to continue to \nmaintain a way of life vital to rural communities. On behalf of these \nfarmers and consumers throughout New England and the country, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Jeffords amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of extending the Federal \nMilk Marketing Order system for one year, and in support of the \npreservation of small family dairy farms throughout Maine and all of \nNew England.\n  As you are aware, Mr. President, the Farm Bill of 1996 authorized the \nUSDA Secretary to fundamentally revisit the federal Milk Marketing \nOrders, which is a regulation voluntarily initiated and approved by a \nmajority of producers in a given area. The regulation places \nrequirements on the first buyers or handlers of milk from dairy \nfarmers, such as processors who distribute fluid milk products in a \ndesignated marketing area. One of those requirements is that handlers \nmust pay an assigned minimum price according to the use of the milk. \nAlso, a milk order requires that all payments by handlers be pooled and \nthe same average price is paid to individual dairy farmers.\n  On January 30, 1998, the USDA proposed two options to reform \ndifferentials, including Option 1-A that closely reflects the current \nprogram, which is a market-oriented option for fluid milk prices, and \nOption 1-B that would be accompanied by transition assistance for dairy \nfarmers. I immediately heard from Maine dairy farmers, who asked for my \nsupport for the Option 1-A differential because it is the fairest and \nmost equitable pricing option for them as it stabilizes prices for \ndairy farmers and ensures that consumers do not pay higher milk prices \nin the supermarket.\n  My response was to join 60 other Senators on April 29, 1998 and send \na letter to USDA Secretary Glickman in support of Option 1-A, saying \nthat the other option, Option 1-B, would further reduce the price of \nmilk received by farmers in almost all regions of the country, thereby \nreducing local supplies of fresh, fluid milk and increasing costs for \nconsumers.\n  My actions the previous year, 1997, were the same as I joined 47 \nother senators, in writing to Secretary Glickman stating that Option 1-\nA was the most viable and economically sound approach to the future \npricing of fluid milk.\n  When the USDA announced its final rule on March 31, 1999, it selected \na form of Option 1-B that will reduce monies to dairy farmers in New \nEngland by at least 2 percent. The final rule will become law in \nOctober unless there is Congressional action to stop the final rule. I \nbelieve the Congressional action to extend the Milk Marketing Order \nsystem until October 1, 2000--which also extends the Northeast Dairy \nCompact until that time--is required so that there is an appropriate \ntime period to assess such a major and potentially devastating change \nto the pricing formula for producers throughout my region, and other \nregions as well.\n  I am currently a cosponsor of S. 1256, Senator Coverdell's bill that \nwill implement Option 1-A for Class I fluid milk as part of the \nimplementation of the final rule to consolidate the federal Milk \nMarketing Orders.\n  Mr. President, since the Northeast Compact was put in place in 1996, \nthere has been no groundswell of opposition from the consumers of New \nEngland, but they have actually preferred to protect a cultural way of \nlife for the region. In addition, for this August, the Maine dairy \nproducers will be receiving an extra $2.28 per hundred weight for their \nmilk because the Compact is currently in place--and this is still not \nbringing in enough money to the dairy farmers to meet their cost of \nproduction. No one is getting rich off of the Compact, Mr. President, \nbut they will get poorer or go out of business after this October if \nthe Compact is allowed to expire.\n  The Compact has only helped stabilize the dairy industry in the \nNortheast and protected farmers and consumers against volatile price \nswings. The Compact has protected against the loss of small family \nowned dairy farms and protected against a decrease in the fresh local \nsupply of milk at a fair price for consumers.\n  Mr. President, Maine had over 2,000 dairy farms in the 1980s. We now \nhave less than 500. The Compact has helped stem the tide of the loss of \nsmall family owned dairy farms--and a way of life. We have been talking \non the floor for two days now about how natural disasters are affecting \nthe family farmer. I urge you not to create a manmade disaster by \nallowing the Northeast Compact to expire. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the extension of the federal Milk Marketing Orders--which will \nalso extend the Northeast Dairy Compact--and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield me 1 minute?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and his colleague \ndiscussed the National Farmers Union. I hope everybody reads the letter \ndated June 18, 1999, because it says:\n\n       . . . we support legislation to establish dairy compacts \n     and amend the federal order system if those provisions are \n     coupled with the legislation to establish the dairy support \n     price of $12.50 per hundredweight.\n\n  Even though my distinguished colleagues from Wisconsin quote from the \nNational Farmers Union as somebody we should be listening to, my \ncolleagues specifically oppose what the National Farmers Union says \nthey want. I would vote for that NFU proposal in a minisecond; I had \nhoped that since the NFU proposal benefits all dairy farmers that we \ncould have worked together on this. But the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin opposes it.\n  There are a lot of quotes going around here. The National Grange \nstrongly supports the Northeast Dairy Compact. They represent 300,000 \nmembers nationwide, and they say that ``regional dairy compacts offer \nthe best opportunity to preserve family dairy farms.''\n  If we are going to quote some of these organizations, let us be \nhonest in what they say. They support the dairy compacts. These farm \norganizations strongly support it. A few processors and the Senators \nfrom Wisconsin do not.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding.\n  I rise today to express my strong support for the dairy compact and \nurge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the dairy amendment offered \nby Senators Leahy and Jeffords. I believe the dairy compact will not \nonly help stem the tide of farm closures but will help New York \nconsumers by halting the trend of consolidation within the dairy \nindustry into a few large farms that control most of the market. This \nproposal gives two hopes for New Yorkers: 1-A, which is far better for \nus than 1-B; and second, if the dairy compact is kept alive, we hope to \nbe added. We realize that because of technical rules, we couldn't do it \nhere, but we are hopeful that will go forward.\n  In conclusion, I am well aware of the strong objections of my \ncolleagues from Wisconsin and Minnesota. But for upstate New York, one \nof the few areas of the country losing population and not sharing in \nthe Nation's current prosperity, the dairy compact is a matter of \neconomic survival. I sincerely hope that we can find some common \nground----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That will allow the dairy industry to prosper in both \nregions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL. Before I yield to the Senator from Minnesota, I will quote \nfrom the National Farmers Union letter:\n\n       . . . with the passage of the Jeffords amendment, dairy \n     farmers across the nation could be left without any federal \n     marketing order that could risk destroying the remnants of \n     the dairy safety net.\n\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\n\n  The National Farmers Union is not supportive of the Jeffords \namendment. It is categorically clear. I yield up to 3 minutes to \nSenator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, to add to what my colleague said from \nthe same letter:\n\n       We have deep concerns about pitting region versus region in \n     agricultural policy, especially dairy policy. We strongly \n     encourage a policy that will benefit all dairy producers \n     nationally.\n\n  I don't have time to engage in a long discussion by way of policy. \nThere is just no time for doing that. Let me make an appeal to my \ncolleagues. In Minnesota, we have 8,700 dairy farmers. We rank fifth in \nthe Nation's milk production. It is $1.2 billion for our farmers. We \nare losing three family farmers a day.\n  What the Secretary of Agriculture is now trying to do is change the \nmilk marketing order system, in the words of the Farmers Union, that \nwill benefit dairy producers nationally, to try to bring about some \nfairness. Now what we have is an effort on the part of some of my \ncolleagues to basically block the Secretary of Agriculture from \nimplementing this reform.\n  I say to every single colleague, Democrat and Republican alike, I \ndon't have time to argue all of the policy implications, but I make an \nappeal as a Senator from Minnesota to not vote for cloture. I make an \nappeal as a Senator from Minnesota to support the kinds of changes that \nthe Secretary of Agriculture is trying to make that will bring about \nsome fairness and won't pit region against region and will give dairy \nfarmers in our country, family farmers, a chance to make it.\n  This is an incredibly important question for my State of Minnesota. \nOther Senators would argue the same way if it were their State. I hope \nthey will vote against cloture, and I appeal to them to do so.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes remain for the opponents; 2 \nminutes 49 seconds for the proponents. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  To correct that, the Senator from Wisconsin has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. KOHL. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is my 20th year dealing with dairy \nprograms, and I understand the confusion that results in Members' minds \nwho have not been in this body or had the exposure of sitting on the \nAgriculture Committee. Let me try to correct, as best I can, some of \nthe statements that have been made.\n  First of all, this amendment conforms with the dictates of rule XVI. \nWe cleared that with the Parliamentarian. Also, the amendment is \nlegally sound and the intent is clear. The letter from USDA was \nexpected, as will be further lawsuits. What they state in the last part \nof the letter is: Rescinding the order presents novel questions which \nwill require further analysis.\n  Let me correct the situation about who makes the money in this \ncountry with respect to the dairy farmers. For each period of time the \nUSDA reports what the mailbox price is to the dairy farmer. They go \nregion by region. The charts that we have seen show that, for instance, \nNew England, in 1998, received $14.89 per hundredweight, 10 cents below \nthe national average. More importantly, the Midwestern farmer received \n$15.27 per hundredweight average, 28 cents above the national average. \nSo who is making money right now? They are making money, not us.\n  Incidentally, the American Farm Bureau supports the 1-A option, which \nis all this is about. This is a cloture vote. It is designed for us to \nhave an opportunity to demonstrate the importance and the necessity to \nVermont and New England and the whole country that we must change what \nnow is in the offing. The dairy farmers, as this chart shows, will be \ndevastated, as will be the rest of the country. The only exception is \nwhere? Minnesota and Wisconsin and surrounding areas. They are the ones \nthat are going to make the money if we can't change this situation.\n  Also, the compact has worked extremely well. California, for \ninstance, is so big as a State they don't need a compact, but they are \ndoing exactly what the six States in New England are doing. Theirs is \nworking fine. And the New England compact is working fine.\n  Incidentally, the opponents asked for a study. The study they wanted \nwas from OMB, from whom they thought they would get a friendly study. \nThey did a study of the compact. What did they find out? The compact \nworked fine. It worked well. It has helped save the farmers. The \nconsumers had a 5-percent lower price than the rest of the country. \nWhy? Because the States got together. They formed a compact. They take \ncare of matters by having consumers on board and everybody sets the \nprice. It is working beautifully. That is why almost half the States in \nthe Nation decided to take a look and said, hey, this is a good idea. \nWe ought to have compacts. We can protect our consumers. We can protect \nour farmers. Vermont has demonstrated to the country a way to help \ndairy farmers. We ought to have that opportunity. All we are talking \nabout is a chance to do that, a chance to get everybody together for a \nlengthy, solid debate which is allowable when you get cloture.\n  This issue is only cloture, so that we can discuss these things and \nremove all of the statements that have been made which are contrary to \nthe facts.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will talk a little bit about the numbers \nthe Senator from Vermont was using. He said that somehow right now \nMinnesota and Wisconsin dairy farmers are making more money than the \nother farmers around the country. That is simply not true. By $2, $3, \n$4 per hundredweight, the rest of the country is getting more money \ntoday than what Minnesota and Wisconsin dairy farmers are allowed to \nreceive for their milk.\n  And that is why I say under this old, arcane program, if we were \ngoing to go start a new dairy program today, it would never look \nanything like this. But when they say we are getting more money, that \nis not true. They are way up in prices, $17, $18, $19 a hundredweight \nfor milk, and we are at $10, $11, $12, $13. If ours comes up 20 cents a \nhundredweight under this arrangement and theirs stays about the same, \nwe are not even close to them yet.\n  So this is a very small move in the right direction for reforms. But \nit by no means is putting Minnesota or Wisconsin ahead of anybody in \nthe country. I still think it is unfair for all the other States under \nthis old program to stand and discriminate against dairy farmers in \nMinnesota and Wisconsin. We want fairness in this program--nothing \nmore, nothing less.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes remain.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, to reiterate, we have to wonder what is \ngoing on. I know the upper Midwest massively overproduces milk. We are \nsimply asking to produce the milk we are going to consume in our area. \nThey massively overproduce it. As the Minneapolis Star Tribune \nexplained, Minnesota farmers want to sell ``reconstituted milk in \nSouthern markets.'' They talk about drawing water out and shipping down \nsome ``glop.'' I will let the reporter of debates figure out how to \nspell that. I don't know how. It sort of looks like it sounds.\n  All we want is fresh milk in our region. We are not trying to take \nover any other part of the country. We have something that we have \nproved works. It doesn't cost the taxpayers anything. It helps \nstabilize farm income. Consumers have a voice in it and like it in the \narea. All we are saying is let us make some determination in our own \npart of the world. We are talking about billions and billions of \ndollars in farm aid in this bill. The amendment that Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Lott, and I, and others support says we don't want any Federal \nmoney; we want to set things the way we are now doing it, protecting \nour consumers and our farmers.\n  Mr. President, I know the Upper Midwest massively overproduces milk--\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\nthey overproduce far more than they can consume--and thus want to sell \nthis milk in the South.\n  I have read the press reports about how they want to dehydrate milk--\ntake the water out of milk--and then hydrate it by adding water in \ndistant states. The Minneapolis Star Tribune explained that Minnesota \nfarmers want to sell ``reconstituted milk in Southern markets.''\n  The article from February 12, 1992, points out that ``technology \nexists for them to draw water from the milk in order to save shipping \ncosts, then reconstitute it.''\n  Regular milk needs refrigeration and weighs a lot and is thus \nexpensive to ship. Also, only empty tanker trucks can come back since \nnothing else can be loaded into the milk containers.\n  But dehydrated milk can be shipped in boxes.\n  By taking the water out of milk, the Upper Midwest can supply the \nSouth with milk.\n  I realize that according to a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article in 1990 \nthat Wisconsin farmers defended the taste of reconstituted milk. The \narticle points out that Dan Hademan, of Wisconsin, ``says fluid milk \nshould be treated the same nationwide, whether it is fresh whole milk \nor reconstituted milk.''\n  That article notes ``Upper Midwest farmers say technological advances \nin making powdered milk and other concentrates has improved the taste \nand texture of reconstituted milk.''\n  However, the House National Security Committee had a hearing on this \nreconstituted milk issue in 1997. I will quote from the hearing \ntranscript:\n\n       . . . the Air Force on Okinawa decided that the \n     reconstituted milk was not suitable for the military and as a \n     quality of life decision they closed the milk plant and opted \n     to have fluid milk transported in from the United States.\n\n  There was a great article in the Christian Science Monitor a few \nyears ago that talks about the school lunch program. It mentions the \nfirst time that the author, as a first-grader, was given reconstituted \nmilk.\n  He said: ``Now, I like milk. . . . But not this stuff. Not watery, \ngray, hot, reconstituted milk that tasted more like rusty pump than \nanything remotely connected with a cow. We wept. We gagged. We \nchoked.''\n  The second problem with the strategy of Wisconsin and Minnesota \nfarmers selling their milk down South is what about ice storms or snow? \nWhat happens when flooding or tornado damage or other problems stop \nthese trucks laden with milk?\n  Southern parents might not be able to buy milk at any price any time \nan ice storm hits the Upper Midwest if the South does not have fresh, \nlocal, supplies of fresh milk. Just remember the panic that affects \nWashington, D.C., when residents think we might get what is called in \nVermont a ``dusting of snow.''\n  Most Americans do not remember why Friday, March 5, 1999, is \nsignificant. But most dairy farmers will remember that date as long as \nthey live.\n  On that date, the Department of Agriculture announced the largest cut \nin milk prices ever--a month-to-month drop of $6.00 per hundredweight.\n  This was the largest month-to-month drop in history--yet retail store \nmilk prices remained high. Processors made huge windfall profits. And, \nwhile the milk prices received by farmers dropped by almost 40 percent \nthe prices stores charged to consumers hardly dropped.\n  Imagine a month-to-month drop in other commodity prices of almost 40 \npercent. Imagine what that would do to your family farmers.\n  The only region in the country that enjoyed some modest protection \nagainst this huge drop in farm prices was New England--because of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact.\n  Half of the states have approved a similar system regarding dairy \npricing. While a regional diary compact does not offer complete \nprotection against huge and unexpected drops in the price of milk for \nfarmers, it does provide a modest measure of relief.\n  It is a safety net that prevents farmers from hitting rock bottom.\n\n\n                 the compact increased interstate trade\n\n  Contrary to the views of opponents of the compact, note that OMB \nreports that the Northeast Compact has increased interstate trade in \nfluid milk.\n  This only makes sense. Dairy farmers fortunate enough to be living in \nstates neighboring the Northeast compact region have increased milk \nsales into the compact area to gain the benefits of the higher compact \nprice. OMB reported an 8 percent increase in trade--increased sales of \nmilk into the compact region from New York and other neighboring states \nto take advantage of the higher prices.\n  If other states could trade places with New York, I am certain that \nthose farmers would quickly figure out that they should sell milk into \nthe Compact region to take advantage of the modestly higher benefits of \nthe compact.\n  The Northeast Compact does not cost taxpayers a single cent. This is \ndifferent from the costliness of many farm programs.\n  If you support farmland protection programs, regional compacts are \nthe answer. Major environmental groups have endorsed the Northeast \nDairy Compact because they know it helps preserve farmland and prevent \nurban sprawl.\n  And if you are concerned about the impact of prices on consumers, \nregional compacts are the answer. Retail milk prices within the compact \nregion are lower on average than in the rest of the nation.\n  The Northeast Compact has done exactly what it was established to do: \nstabilize fluctuating dairy prices, ensure a fair price for dairy \nfarmers, keep them in business, and protect consumers' supplies of \nfresh milk.\n  Many of our friends in the South have seen how the compact provides a \nmodest but crucial safety net for struggling farmers. They, too, want \nthe same for their farmers, and their farmers deserve that same \nopportunity.\n  Congress should not stand in the way of these state initiatives that \nprotect farmers and consumers without costing taxpayers a penny.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time remains on the opposition \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 45 seconds for the opposition, and \n2 minutes remain on the Senator's side. If neither side seeks \nrecognition, time runs equally.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think it is important to understand \nwhy we are here. First of all, this is a cloture vote. There are \nobvious disputes and they ought to be resolved. But complicated issues \nsuch as this can't be resolved in 40 minutes. We need to have a full \ndebate on these issues. It is important to dairy farmers and all \nfarmers. We must not end today by refusing to allow us to go forward, \nto take the Vermont/New England compact, a model that is being looked \nat by States all over the country because it works so well to protect \nits farmers and consumers. We should be able to debate that fully and \nnot to run out of time by virtue of the rules.\n  In addition to that, this chart shows it all. It shows who is going \nto win and lose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, before I close, I want to make it known that \nsome other Senators, including Senators Lugar and Grassley, wanted to \nbe down on the floor to speak in favor of this side, but they could not \nget here.\n  I simply want to say to my colleagues, if we invoke cloture on this \nbill now, then we will kill the bill. But if we pass the Jeffords \namendment, I believe we will kill the dairy industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? One minute remains on each \nside.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield to Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\ndairy compacts; anticonsumer, antifarmer, regionally divisive, contrary \n     to the heart of the constitution, ineffective and inefficient\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr President, I rise today to make a few remarks \nconcerning dairy compacts.\n  When most people think of dairy states they think of Wisconsin, \nVermont, or Minnesota--not California, Texas, or Idaho. However, Idaho \nis now sixth in total milk production,\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\njust ahead of Texas. Dairy cow numbers in Idaho are projected to grow \nfrom 292,000 in 1988 to 398,000 in 2008. While potatoes are still \nranked first as the top agriculture commodity in Idaho, dairy products \nare a close second. I tell you this so you know that dairy policy is \nimportant to me and my state.\n  Although I am speaking, in part, on behalf of the interests of Idaho \ndairy farmers, let me assure you that the national debate about dairy \ncompacts is far more than just an old fashioned regional squabble \nbetween Northeast and Southern dairy interests, on the one hand, and \nthe interests of the rest of the country's dairy farmers, on the other. \nThis debate is all about whether the Senate will say ``enough is \nenough'' and put an end to an incredibly bad policy proposal.\n  In my 19 years in Congress I cannot remember any major farm \nlegislation that has been as overwhelmingly contrary to the interests \nof farmers, consumers, public health, the U.S. economy, and our \nConstitution as the amendment to extend and expand interstate dairy \ncompacts. This is a lose, lose, lose situation if there ever was one. \nIt's bad for the country and it's bad for the Senate, which it is \nneedlessly dividing along regional lines.\n  An expanded Northeast Compact and a new Southern Compact will combine \nto impose an enormous milk tax on consumers in compact states. If \ncompact commissions raise prices to the limit allowed by the proposed \namendment, the costs to Eastern, Mid-Atlantic and Southern consumers \nwould be enormous. Based on USDA data and USDA's estimates of milk \nprices for the rest of this year and for next year, the costs could \nsoar to as high as $2.6 billion a year.\n  It only gets worse. Higher milk prices there will reduce milk \nconsumption and increase milk production. Consumers will lose in two \nways; they will have to pay more and they will drink less of a calcium-\nrich product. That's not very good public policy at a time when the \nNational Academy of Sciences is urging Americans to take steps to \neliminate their dangerous calcium intake deficit. The scope of the \nconsumption decline is suggested by a January 1999 study of the \neconomic impacts of an expanded Northeast Dairy Compact and a new \nSouthern Dairy Compact conducted by the University of Missouri's \nCommercial Agriculture Program. The study was endorsed by the federally \nfunded Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, otherwise known \nas FAPRI. Findings of that study suggest that milk consumption could \ndrop by more than 200 million gallons a year if compacts expand into \nthe Mid-Atlantic and Southern states.\n  The damage doesn't stop there. It reaches into every corner of the \nnation. Because dairy farmers in compact states will get paid more, \nthey will produce much more milk. If you doubt that, just look back to \nwhat happened when Congress pushed milk prices to unprecedented levels \nin the 1980's. Increased production and lower consumption will mean \nthat the nation, which already had record milk production last year, \nwill be awash in milk.\n  That impact is even worse for dairy farmers in states like Idaho, \nwhich are not covered by dairy compacts. First of all, their incomes \nwill be drastically reduced because dairy compacts ultimately drive \neveryone else's milk prices down. As milk production increases and \nconsumption drops in dairy compact states, the nation's milk surplus \nwill grow and milk prices will fall. The University of Missouri study \nshowed that dairy farms in states outside of dairy compact regions \nwould lose $310 million in the first year alone. And that study was \nbased on an unrealistically-low, minimum, dairy compact price hike. It \nalso did not include all of the states covered by today's amendment. If \nall states are included and compact commissions boost prices as high as \nthe proposed legislation would allow, the loss of income will be \nroughly four times as large as estimated by the Missouri study.\n  In addition, the overproduction in dairy compact states will flood \nthe market in compact states with dairy products made from surplus milk \nproduced in compact states. That means sharply less market access for \nlow-cost, efficient dairy farms in the Upper Midwest, Plains, and \nMountain regions. Just like all protectionist schemes, dairy compacts \npenalize efficiency and reward inefficiency.\n  If this seems hard to believe as we head into the 21st century, just \nremember this: by definition, dairy compacts prevent cheaper milk, \nproduced by more-efficient farmers in noncompact states, from entering \ninto compact states at less than the compact price. Dairy compact \nproponents argue that dairy compacts do not impose interstate trade \nbarriers because they allow other states to sell milk into compact \nregions at the compact price.\n  Technically that's true. In practice, it's completely misleading. The \nproblem with the argument is that the increased production caused by \nhigher prices in compact states will virtually eliminate the local \ndemand for milk from efficient producers outside of compact states. \nWhile the market remains open in theory, compact states will be saying \nto Idaho and other noncompact farmers, ``sorry, but we don't need your \nmilk anymore.'' Let's face it, dairy compacts are nothing more than a \nmean spirited attack on other states, skillfully disguised as a cure \nfor small dairy farmers.\n  If the regional inequities and schisms created by interstate dairy \ncompacts are not reason enough for my fellow senators to reject this \namendment, then I hope you will vote against it simply because it \nviolates the basic premises of our Constitution. The establishment of \nregional trade barriers through interstate dairy compacts would \nundermine the interstate competition that fostered the birth of the \nnation and that has been so critical for the sanctity of our \nConstitution. No amount of repeating the unsupportable claim that \ninterstate dairy compacts are a manifestation of states' rights will \nmake it so. The Founding Fathers would surely cringe if they were \nsubjected to that argument in defense of dairy compacts. They knew that \nthe nation would not last if they permitted some regions to be walled \noff at the expense of others. That's why they rejected an Articles of \nConfederation and chose a Constitution anchored by the Interstate \nCommerce Clause. That's also why three Constitutional scholars who \nappeared at a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing last week testified \nagainst interstate dairy compacts.\n  If dairy compacts pit region against region in the Senate, damage \ndairy farmers in noncompact states, cause great harm to consumers, and \nundermine the Constitution, then why are we even having this debate? It \nshould be an open and shut case. Perhaps it has to with the desire of \nsome of my colleagues to do something for the small family dairy \nfarmers in their states. That may be an important objective. However, \nmake no mistake about it. Dairy compacts are a terribly inefficient and \nineffective way of achieving that goal. If you want to help small dairy \nfarms, this is the worst way to do it.\n  The chart on my right (left) makes this abundantly clear. Here are 14 \nof the 28 states that the proposed amendment would allow to join the \nNortheast and Southern Dairy Compacts. The chart shows that small \nfarms--those with less than 50 cows--on average, would receive only \nbetween $1,100 to $5,200 a year from dairy compacts. This is hardly \nsurprising since each farmer receives the same price increase for every \ngallon of milk they produce. Thus, the large farms receive huge \nsubsidies, while the small farms receive only a drop in the bucket. The \nbottom line is that a few thousand dollars in extra income is not \nsufficient to ensure long-term economic viability for these small \nfarms.\n  The Commissioner of Agriculture in Massachusetts, who is a member of \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact Commission, seems to agree. Last October, \nhe put before the Commission a formal proposal that would have \nredistributed the Compact's revenues away from big farms and to the \nsmall farms. The proposal, which was essentially dead on arrival, has \nnever been adopted. Why? Because dairy compacts have nothing to do with \nsaving small family farms.\n  For the sake of argument, however, let's assume that the primary goal \nof dairy compacts is to increase the incomes of small family farms. \nThat would make sense since the Census of Agriculture reveals that in \nNew England, Mid-Atlantic states, and the South, 76%, 86% and 88% of \nthe farms\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\nthat have left the dairy business since 1982 have had less than 50 \ncows. Clearly, small dairy farmers are the most vulnerable ones. Let's \nalso assume, for the sake of argument, as compact proponents insist, \nthat dairy compacts keep small farms in business.\n  Then we can answer the question: is this a good use of the public's \nmoney. If we look at the table to my right (left), we can see how \namazingly inefficient dairy compacts are at transferring money to small \ndairy farms. The relevant question here is: how much do dairy compacts \ncost consumers for each small dairy farmers saved? The answers provided \nin the table are alarming. For the 14 New England, Mid-Atlantic and \nSouthern states it takes anywhere between $90,000 and $632,000 a year \nin higher milk prices to provide a single small dairy farmer with a \nmeager subsidy of only $1,000 and $5,200. At the extreme, for every one \ndollar of subsidy the compact gives to a single small dairy farmer, it \ncosts the public roughly $632 in higher milk prices! $632 dollars spent \nto achieve a one dollar impact! That is truly a public policy \nembarrassment!\n  Is this really how the Senate wants to force the public to spend \ntheir money? I certainly hope not! Dairy compacts give new meaning to \nthe expressions ``bureaucratic ineptness'' and ``government \ninefficiency''. Remember the legendary stories about the Pentagon \nspending thousands of dollars for a toilet seat? When you take the time \nto look at the evidence, it becomes clear that dairy compacts make \nthose expenditures look efficient by comparison. This is surely not the \nlegacy that any members of this body will want to carry with them \nthrough their careers.\n  In closing, this is no way to legislate dairy policy. We need to work \non a national policy that is fair to all farmers and that makes us more \ncompetitive on the world market. Dairy compacts are anti-consumer, \nregionally divisive, anti-farmer, contrary to the heart of the \nConstitution, ineffective and hopelessly inefficient. I urge Senators \nto vote no on the Jeffords amendment.\n  Mr. President, again, when we think of dairy, oftentimes we think of \nWisconsin, Minnesota, and Vermont. Let me tell you when we think that \nway, we are not thinking total because California, Texas, and Idaho are \nsome of the leading dairy producers in the Nation. My State is sixth in \nthe Nation right now and growing very rapidly into fifth place, and \nwithin a few years it could even be fourth place.\n  What is being proposed today is not good for our Nation's dairy \nindustry. It is regionalism at its worst. It is establishing economic \nbarriers that don't allow the reasonable flow of commerce, and while it \nis early on argued as good for producers, let me suggest that in the \nend when you create these barriers it is wrong and bad for producers. \nWhen we struggle to create agriculture policy in this country, we \nstruggle to create uniformity.\n  In the dairy industry, uniformity is critically important for the \ngrowth and the overall strength of that industry, both for the \nproducers and for the consumers.\n  I hope we will oppose the cloture motion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a chart on the \neffects of the compact on small dairy farms.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                        DAIRY COMPACTS ARE THE WORST WAY TO TRY TO HELP SMALL DAIRY FARMS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    Annual\n                                                                   consumer    No. farms    Annual      Annual\n                                                                    cost of    with less    compact    consumer\n                              State                                compacts     than 50     subsidy     cost to\n                                                                      (in        cows      per small   save one\n                                                                   millions)                 farm     small farm\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAL..............................................................         $20          52      $1,100    $385,000\nCT..............................................................          14         100       3,800     140,000\nFL..............................................................          43          68       2,500     632,000\nGA..............................................................          35         176       3,900     199,000\nLA..............................................................          16         143       4,000     112,000\nMA..............................................................          27         157       4,300     172,000\nMD..............................................................          25         256       1,200      97,000\nMS..............................................................          12         115       5,000     104,000\nNJ..............................................................          38          67       3,400     567,000\nNC..............................................................          35         180       5,100     194,000\nSC..............................................................          17          60       4,300     283,000\nTX..............................................................          82         603       2,900     135,000\nVA..............................................................          32         355       5,200      90,000\nWV..............................................................          12         134       4,700      90,000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I must state a deep disagreement with my \nfriend from Idaho. We are not talking about any kind of limitations at \nall. The compact we have in Vermont allows anybody to be able to come \nand sell in our market. We are talking about the ability of States to \ndo what California and Idaho already do because they are so large, and \nthat is to have their own milk orders. All we want to do is be able to \nform together--and I point out that when the opposition asked OMB to \nmake a determination as to whether or not our farmers were in any way, \nthrough this pact, violating anything, they came back and said it would \neven save money for some. Look at this chart. This is the end. This \nshows what happens. If you go with 1-B instead of 2-A, the whole \ncountry, including Idaho, loses money. Why my good friend wants to have \nhis farmers lose money, I don't know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I urge a vote for cloture so we can fully debate this.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the Ashcroft \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1507) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10151]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote by which the Ashcroft \namendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nKentucky, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1509 To Amendment No. 1499\n\n               (Purpose: To make a perfecting amendment)\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts], for himself, Mr. \n     Santorum, Mr. Craig, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Burns, Mr. Brownback, \n     Mr. Hagel, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1509 to amendment No. 1499.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, we have had a great deal of discussion in \nregard to the kind of emergency assistance we would all like to see \nhappen in the Senate. We have heard quite a bit of debate as to what is \nappropriate.\n  I have a package that has been endorsed by about six or seven \nSenators--Senator Burns and Senator Santorum, more especially, who have \nbeen especially helpful--Senator Craig, Senator Grassley, Senator \nGrams, Senator Hagel, all of the cosponsors, to try to reach some \naccommodation. I am not sure, but perhaps we could conclude this debate \nand simply have a vote within, I would say, a half hour. I do not know \nwhat my friends and colleagues on the other side would say about that, \nbut I make a recommendation and seek unanimous consent that debate on \nthis amendment be for 30 minutes, with 15 minutes divided equally.\n  Could there be an agreement on that? I see the distinguished \nDemocratic leader nodding his head.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator from Kansas would yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think a 30-minute timeframe, equally divided, would be \nappropriate. We have debated the issue now for some time. This is \nanother iteration, in our view, that is completely unacceptable, but we \nwould be happy to talk about it. Thirty minutes would be acceptable to \nus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator from \nKansas if the amendment has been made available to others of us on the \nfloor. I think the Senator mentioned seven Senators he has worked with, \nbut is the amendment available at this point?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Basically, the amendment is the same as I have discussed \nwith my friend and colleague, with the addition of $400 million for \ndisaster assistance, after talking to the Secretary of Agriculture as \nof this morning. But we have a summary of the amendment, and we will \nendeavor to make as many copies as we can during the debate.\n  I think most of my colleagues on that side--and we have been trying \nto work together--understand what is in the amendment. But without \nquestion we will make the copies available to you.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after the disposal of the Roberts \namendment, it is my understanding that there would then be room for \namendments; is that correct? I ask the parliamentary situation after \nthe disposal of the Roberts amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir, additional amendments would be in \norder.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be in order \nafter the disposal of the Roberts amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, could the Senator share \nwith us what his amendment is about?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is the elimination of the sugar quota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have no objection to the offering of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair.\n  I say to the distinguished Democratic leader, I would have hoped that \nhe could have described my amendment as perhaps acceptable as opposed \nto the completely unacceptable amendment by the Senator from Arizona, \nand I would hope that would be the case.\n  It is my understanding now we have 30 minutes of time and 15 minutes \non a side. I am going to yield time to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania who has been a real help to us in trying to put together \nan amendment that will be acceptable to all parties.\n  I do also thank my friends across the aisle, more particularly \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Conrad and Senator Harkin. We had a \ndiscussion yesterday. I know this amendment does not cross every ``t'' \nor dot every ``i'' in their eyes, but I would say to them that we on \nour side have tried to move at least to a compromise bill that could be \nworked out.\n  I had a telephone conversation with Agriculture Secretary Dan \nGlickman about 45 minutes ago. I want to point out that the Secretary \nof Agriculture, and many on the other side, and many on this side, have \nhad the opportunity to work on many farm bills together.\n  There have been 13 emergency or supplemental bills in the last 10 \nyears in regard to agriculture. That shows you the tremendous change \nthat occurs in global agriculture. We have worked together on many of \nthese bills. Secretary Glickman and I are very good friends. We have \nvery strong differences of opinion from time to time; there is no \nquestion about that, but we have tried to work together as a team on \nbehalf of agriculture.\n  In regard to this debate, I suggest to everybody that today is the \nday for compromise and teamwork on behalf of our hard-pressed farmers \nand ranchers. I do not think they want us debating over and over again \nthe philosophy or the ideology in regard to farm bills. What they want \nis emergency assistance, and we can then address the problems that we \nhave all talked about in regard to a long-term agenda on behalf of \nagriculture.\n  Today is not the day to express strong opinions about the current \nfarm bill or assess blame or make the political rhetoric. We have had \nthose days.\n  Today is the day to pass an emergency bill. Senators Burns and Gorton \nand Santorum and Grassley and Grams and Hagel and I have offered an \namendment, now endorsed by the National Association of Wheat Growers, \nthe American Soybean Association, and the American Farm Bureau. \nObviously, we have not had enough time to contact all of the commodity \norganizations, all the farm groups. But I think, without question, most \nof the farm groups, if not all, certainly support this approach.\n\n  What does it do? The purpose of this amendment is to provide direct \nincome assistance to farmers and ranchers in the fastest way possible. \nI know my colleagues across the aisle would prefer a different way, or \nat least a portion of this assistance to come in a different way, in \nwhat is called the LDP program. That is an acronym for the Loan \nDeficiency Payment.\n  This amendment does provide the assistance through the transition \npayment, which will provide assistance to farmers in 10 days. We went \nthe LDP route during the last emergency assistance--or to be more \naccurate, there was emergency assistance granted in the last emergency \nbill.\n  It took the Secretary of Agriculture 6 to 8 months to get assistance \nto farmers. We do not need to do that. So it is the fastest way \npossible. As I have indicated, it is through the structure called the \nadditional transition payments that are contained in the farm bill. It \ndoes it with additional payments of 100 percent.\n  Let me say something about the 100 percent for those farms that are \nin program crops. It means not only do you get a transition payment; \nyou get another transition payment 100 percent\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\nequal to that. I will venture to say, with that payment most farmers in \nAmerica, in terms of wheat and corn and your basic crops--and, yes, in \nregard to cotton and step 2, which is another program--that extra \nincome assistance will move those prices at least to the cost of \nproduction and maybe even more.\n  As opposed to other amendments, this approach that has been offered \ndoes not change current farm program policy. You do not need to rewrite \nthe farm bill during the appropriations process or during an emergency \nbill.\n  You may have very strong beliefs about this farm bill. I do. But now \nis not the time to rewrite the farm program in regard to this emergency \nbill. We can do that next year. I hope we do not in the middle of an \nelection year, but obviously people have strong beliefs. I do not \nbelieve this is the appropriate place.\n  The bill also provides assistance to soybean and oil seed \nproducers. It provides assistance to livestock producers, to cotton \nproducers, with regard to the step 2 program that has been so \neloquently described by the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Cochran, and to specialty crop \nproducers and others who do not receive program crops.\n\n  I say to Senators paying attention--I hope they are, either in their \nofficers or wherever they are--all of you who represent farmers who do \nnot have program crops not covered by the farm bill, this amendment \nprovides the most assistance to those who are in specialty crops and \nothers. We do not go down every commodity and raise amendments such as \nthe one that is going to be introduced by the Senator from Arizona. \nSome of these commodities, some of these programs raise a lot of \nobjections. We have had historic debates in that regard. Let's not go \ndown that path. We give money to the Secretary of Agriculture for \nspecialty crops. Only the USDA can determine which of those crops, \nwhich of those regions really need the assistance. I think that \napproach is best.\n  Most important, it contains funds for crop insurance reform to keep \nthe crop insurance premiums at current levels. We reduced them last \nyear. They will spike up again. So we have money to keep those at that \nlevel.\n  I tell my colleagues, finally, those of us who have tried to keep \nthis bill under $7 billion for budgetary concerns, we have also \nprovided another $400 million for disaster assistance as a result of \ntalking to the Secretary of Agriculture, who was in West Virginia with \nSenator Byrd yesterday. We have all seen on television the effects of \ndrought. Anybody who comes from farm country understands the effects of \ndrought. Secretary Glickman said: I need money immediately. So we \nprovided $400 million. Will it be enough? I don't know. But at least in \nterms of that request, I think it is appropriate. As I say, Secretary \nGlickman was in West Virginia with Senator Byrd, and the need is very \ncrucial. That brings the total of the package to $7.5 billion, but we \nhave a drought on hand and we have an emergency.\n  All this assistance is provided without each commodity or specialty \ncrop coming to the table in a bidding war. We have already had that, \nreopening, as I have indicated, the historic and unneeded debates of \nthe past. Instead we have emergency assistance that will provide \nfarmers needed assistance down the road. If you want to look at farm \nprogram policy in future debates with hearings, perhaps that is \nappropriate.\n  How much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Three minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, might I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, who, I might add, is a valuable member of the Agriculture \nCommittee and who talks with us continually about farmers who are not \nin the program crop arena, the value of crop insurance, and the value \nof disaster assistance, because there are some areas of the country \nthat need assistance that are not covered by the farm bill. I thank the \nSenator for his contribution.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the distinguished former chairman of the House \nAg Committee and obviously one of the most knowledgeable people on \nagriculture in this country. It has been a pleasure to work with him.\n  To pick up on the point he just made, I will speak to Senators who do \nnot come from areas which have program crops, places such as \nPennsylvania, many of them, places such as Pennsylvania, New York, and \nMaryland, and most of the New England States, where previous emergency \npackages had very little to offer for those of us who have farmers \nexperiencing difficulty in that area of the country.\n  Obviously, we are experiencing horrible difficulties with the drought \nthat is occurring in the Mid-Atlantic region. I did not vote for either \nof the packages yesterday because I didn't think they offered anything \nof real value to the farmers that I represent and to the region of the \ncountry that I try to represent on the Agriculture Committee. But this \npackage does.\n  Three things the Senator from Kansas just mentioned: No. 1, the money \nfor specialty crops--most of the crops that are grown in Pennsylvania \nare specialty crops; they are not program crops--$300 million; $400 \nmillion for help with crop insurance premiums. We need to get more \npeople in the Crop Insurance Program in Pennsylvania. If my farmers \nsaid one thing to me overwhelmingly, it was: Of all the things you can \ndo to help us, give us some money to help us begin to get into crop \ninsurance, to begin to insure ourselves against these losses and \nagainst the fluctuations of the market.\n  Farmers want to be self-sufficient. They don't want disaster \npayments. They don't get AMTA payments. What they want is some \nmechanism where they can begin to control their destiny and ensure some \nincome for their family. That is what we are trying to do, to help them \nin transitioning.\n  Finally, $400 million, as the Senator from Kansas just mentioned, for \ndisaster assistance for this year's 1999 crops. Obviously, we have no \nidea what the extent of the drought is going to be and the damage, but \nit is going to be extensive. It is going to be very tough on our \nfarmers in Pennsylvania and throughout the Mid-Atlantic States.\n  I say to all those Senators who represent that area of the country, \nyou now have a bill you can vote for that is going to do something \nmeaningful for your farmers. I hope we can get bipartisan support for \nthis amendment and get this acted upon quickly.\n  I thank the former chairman and distinguished member of the \nAgriculture Committee for his terrific work on this amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes, and I \nthink my colleague, perhaps both of my colleagues, would like to add a \ncomment.\n  My hope has been, and still is, that we will have a bipartisan \nsolution to this issue today. This is not such a solution.\n  A number of discussions have taken place with a number of Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle. We face the same crises: collapsed prices \nin rural America and a drought that is spreading across our country.\n  There is not a Republican or a Democratic way to go broke on the \nfamily farm. It is just human misery and tragedy that allows those to \nlose their hopes and dreams and lose their farms because of economic \ncollapse in Asia or price collapse in the U.S. or the worst crop \ndisease of a century or a wet cycle that means 3 million acres can't be \nplanted in our State this spring. It is not the farmer's fault. So we \nneed to do something. The question is, What do we do?\n  We have had several different plans. This is the third, I guess, that \nwill be voted on in the Senate. It is short on disaster aid, as we \nknow. We know there is a disaster occurring. Turn on the television set \nand listen to the newscasts. They say it is the worst drought in a \ncentury in some parts of this country. We might as well be prepared to \nface that. We ought to add some of that to this legislation.\n  Second, my colleague, in his presentation of the amendment, talked \nabout dollars going to producers immediately. As we all know, AMTA is \ngoing to get dollars to people who aren't producing. That is one of the \nproblems.\n\n[[Page S10153]]\n\n AMTA is a payment scheme based on 1991 and 1995 production history. \nThey are going to be sending money to the people who aren't producing \nanything.\n  One other point: My expectation is that this amendment does not \nchange the payment limits. I wonder how many of my colleagues know that \nthe potential, under this approach--and I am able to be corrected, if I \nam inaccurate--the potential under this approach is to pay $460,000 \nessentially to a farmer, $460,000 as a new payment limitation. The \n$80,000 payment limit under current law is doubled. So for AMTA and \nLDPs, the potential is $460,000 for a producer.\n  Who wants to tell a wage earner in some community someplace that we \nwant you to pay taxes so we can give a little help to family farmers? \nAnd by the way, some might get $460,000. What kind of a payment limit \nis that? How does one describe this as help to family-sized farms?\n  We don't need to help agrifactories in America. We don't need a \nDepartment of Agriculture. We don't need a farm program. If our future \nis in agrifactories, we don't need to construct these kinds of programs \nor have a Department of Agriculture, for my money.\n  The purpose is to try to protect and help and nurture family farming \nas an enterprise in this country because it strengthens our country. \nBut $460,000 in payment limits? A potential farmer will get $460,000? \nWhat kind of nonsense is this? My expectation is that it is still part \nof the amendment. My hope is that we will still have an opportunity for \na bipartisan solution today.\n  Those of us who come from farm country, in both the Republican and \nDemocratic Parties here, serve the same interests, have the same \ndesire, and have the same passion to try to help family farmers get \nthrough this troubled period.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from Kansas will \nyield for a couple of questions so I can better discern what we have \nhere. I ask the author of the amendment exactly how this differs from \nthe last package, the Cochran amendment, which is set aside right now. \nAs I look at it, the difference between this package and what we voted \non yesterday, the Cochran amendment, is $400 million for crop insurance \npremium reductions and $400 million for disaster payments for 1999 crop \nlosses. Is that correct?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is correct. That is not all of the differences, but \nthe Senator has accurately described two of the differences.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I have looked at other things in the bill and I \ncan't find any differences other than that.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, what we tried to do with the \napproach, rather than specifically mentioning some of the crops that \nhave been in controversy on the floor from time to time--and I am \ntalking about sugar and peanuts and tobacco--we have simply provided a \nfund for the Secretary of $300 million for specialty crops and others \nnot specifically mentioned elsewhere in the amendment.\n  In talking to Secretary Glickman as of this morning and going over \nspecified funding for these crops, which may or may not need assistance \nin regard to weather problems or lost income problems, he indicated he \nwould rather have that at his discretion. After all, it is the USDA, in \nthe end result, that would be able to determine at the end of the crop \nyears, after harvest, specifically what the situation is.\n\n  When I mention specific numbers for these particular programs, I am \nnot going to indicate that the Secretary is endorsing this bill in \ntotal by any means, but I think his preference would be that he would \nhave the discretion to address these as needed, as opposed to saying we \nare getting X number of dollars for this particular program. Then we \nget into a bidding war, and the Senator knows that is what has happened \nin the past.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I ask the Senator, there was, if I am not \nmistaken, in the Cochran amendment $300 million for specialty crops; is \nthat right? I thought that was in the Cochran amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, I don't have a copy of the \nCochran amendment with me. In our original amendment it was $200 \nmillion. We increased that to $300 million. The Senator may be correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am told it was $50 million in the Cochran.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is correct. I thank the Senator for reminding me.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The other point--and, again, I ask the Senator; maybe he \ncan't figure it out now, but maybe his staff can pencil it out--as I \nlook at the bill, you have reduced the livestock and dairy portion of \nthe Cochran amendment from $325 million to $250 million.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator has those figures, I am sure that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am just looking, and it is hard to discern things \nsometimes in these bills. I am told by my staff the total amount of \nfunds for livestock is reduced from $325 million to about $250 million. \nIf I am wrong, correct me.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I now have staff here; I now have my brains on the \nfloor, so I am happy to respond.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In examining this amendment now before us, the difference \nis about $800 million, give or take a little bit. So while the package \nyesterday was about 6.9, this raises it to about 7.7, if I am not \nmistaken.\n  My opinion on this, Mr. President, is that while we are making some \nmovements here, I think things are working right.\n  I yield again to my friend from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Cochran \namendment had--I apologize to my friend and colleague because I don't \nhave the specifics of the Cochran amendment here, and I should. Staff \nhas informed me that there was $350 million for livestock payments at \nthe discretion of the Secretary, and we provided $250 million. I am \nmaking an assumption, but most of the problems we are experiencing now \nare in the Senator's area in regard to hog producers.\n  In talking with Secretary Glickman today, I don't think we can make a \ndetermination yet as to where most of that money would go--the extra \n$100 million, if in fact we can call it extra. Well, it goes from $350 \nmillion to $250 million. It went to crop insurance, and it went to \nadding $100 million more on the disaster side. It was a matter of \npriorities.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for clarifying that.\n  Again, I make the point that I think we do see some movement. I am \nstill hopeful we can reach a decent compromise on these packages. I \nbelieve that is accomplishable.  I think we can accomplish that.\n\n  I might just say that I think the $400 million in disaster payments \nfor this year, I say to my friend from Kansas, is still inadequate, too \nlow. From all of the indications we get from disasters up and down the \neast coast, in the Mid-Atlantic States, plus some of the disaster we \nhave had out in North Dakota and other places, and flooding, as we have \nhad in my State of Iowa, $400 million is simply not going to be enough \nto handle the disasters this year. I think we need to work a little bit \nmore on that in terms of disaster payments for this year.\n  The $400 million you put in for the crop insurance, I applaud. We had \nthat in our bill. I think that is a good measure. I am a little \nconcerned about the payments for oilseeds. Here is where we get into \nthe policy issue on the AMTA payments and LDP.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. May I ask a question of the Senator? Would he yield for \na question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think I am probably running out of time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will make it brief. We have $400 million for the \ndisaster program. That is a commitment to agriculture to know that the \nSecretary can begin to work on the problem in the Atlantic States. That \ndoesn't mean if down the road we have continued droughts--it is the \nworst in a hundred years in the Atlantic region--that we will not be \ncommitted to doing what we have to do. But to do it here, we have no \nway of knowing what that crop damage will be. So I urge the Senator to \nsay here is $400 million in regard to all of the problems we are \nexperiencing in terms of national disasters, and it doesn't mean that \ndown the road that could not be addressed; we just don't\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\nknow at this particular time. I don't think it would be responsible to \nadd a whole bunch more money when we don't even know.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. We can work on that. The Senator may \nnot be wrong on that. That may be closer to what we probably should be \ndoing. There are other things in that disaster part I tell the Senator \nto look at. We did not completely fill the needs of last year's \ndisaster. I think the Senator from North Dakota can talk about that. We \nhad about $300 million in our bill just to meet the disaster needs of \nlast year that were not fully paid for. So I ask you to look at that. \nYou may be right on not anticipating or knowing exactly where the Mid-\nAtlantic States are right now. But there are other things we had in our \ndisaster bill that we do know about and that do need to be addressed.\n  Lastly, I want to say again, on the payments to oilseeds, which is in \nthe Senator's bill, which is about $500 million, this really gets to \nthe heart of whether we should have all AMTA payments or some mix of \nthat and LDPs. Under AMTA payments, of course, you don't get any \npayments for soybeans. Under LDP, you do. Under the proposal we had, \nwhich our side offered yesterday, under LDP, we estimated there would \nbe about $1 billion that would go to soybean producers for their losses \nthis year. Under the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, \nthere is $500 million in payments to all oilseeds, including soybeans. \nSo we had not only $1 billion in the LDP, we had about $1 billion in \npurchases. So the $500 million is about a fourth of what we estimated \nthe need would be for oilseeds.\n  That is why I still hope we can reach some compromise on having a \nblend of AMTA payments and LDP payments, because I think LDP payments \nwould more adequately respond to the needs of oilseeds than would a \n$500 million payment.\n  Other than that, as I said, I think there is some good progress here, \nand I think there is some basis for reaching some kind of compromise \nagreement before the Sun sets today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield time off the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are making progress. I can feel the \nconcrete breaking. I don't think we are quite there yet because at this \npoint this is not a bipartisan proposal before us. There has not really \nbeen a negotiation between the two sides. There has been a negotiation \non the other side.\n  There are a number of things I believe are deficient in terms of the \nproposal that is before us. We do not keep the promise of the disaster \npackage of last year. We devised a formula. We didn't fully fund it. \nThe result was that people got 85 percent of what was promised.\n  No. 2, there is not sufficient money for the crop losses that are \noccurring now. Some say, well, we don't know the full amount. That is \ntrue. But I can tell you that we know enough to know that $400 million \nis not going to solve the problem. In my State alone, we know the \nflooded land losses. We absolutely know what has occurred there. Three \nmillion acres have not even been planted and millions more planted \nlate.\n  In the Democratic alternative, we have $250 million for flooded \nlands. I don't see anything specifically set aside in this proposal--\nnot $1 is set aside--specifically to address the problem of flooded \nlands. That is just not acceptable. Partly because of the way this came \nabout, I suppose it is the result.\n  We have not had a true discussion. We basically had the other side \nsaying this is it, take it or leave it. On that basis, we don't have \nmuch choice but to leave it because it does not address the needs of \nthe people we represent.\n  I say that as a preface to the remarks that are more positive; that \nis, there are some very good parts of the proposal the Senator has \nadvanced, the chief being the crop insurance of $400 million. That goes \nin exactly the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the opponents has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Burns, who has worked very hard on this \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Kansas. I will be \nvery brief.\n  I do not know of any piece of legislation that has ever been proposed \nhaving to do with agriculture that has been perfect. If there is one \nplace where it is hard to find a one size fits all, it is in this \nbusiness of agriculture because we are diverse in climate, in growing \nconditions, in crops, and everything else. It is pretty tough to find \nthat perfect bill.\n  What we have sought is balance. On balance, I think this addresses \nthe needs as we think they are now, and also it is a step towards what \nwe think it will be at the end of the crop year. I think it is very \nimportant that the commitment to agriculture is here. Without changing \nprograms, putting cash on the farm as fast as we possibly can is in \nthis piece of legislation.\n  Let's take it for what it is. Sure, we can sit and pick it apart. \nYes, we would like to see some things changed for Montana that won't \nfit the things in Mississippi. But I think what we have is balance.\n  With the leadership of Senator Roberts and Senator Craig, and a lot \nof us who have worked very hard on this for a long time, knowing the \nprospects in front of us, I thank them for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield 1 additional minute to the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, who has also worked \nextremely hard on this compromise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in the course of the last 2 days, we have \nattempted to understand and define the situation in agriculture. The \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday did \nan excellent job of crafting a package that goes to the heart of the \nproblem.\n  Yesterday, I had hoped we could include crop insurance in it so we \ncould keep that management tool alive, shaping it so that it becomes \nmore usable to farmers, so that we are not here again after a disaster \noccurs trying to define that disaster. As we have heard in conversation \nthis morning, it is nearly impossible to define at this time.\n  This particular amendment offers $400 million to maintain the 1999 \nlevel for crop insurance premium write-downs. It also deals with \nspeciality crops in a way that I think is very important in \nunderstanding farming diversity. At the same time, it still strikes \nthat balance in working to limit well beyond what those on the other \nside had offered, and I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, can I ask the distinguished Senator, if I \ncould finish up my time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thought the chair had announced that all time had \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Idaho has \nexpired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I apologize to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I may go step 1 instead of step 2.\n  Mr. President, on the definition of ``bipartisan,'' bipartisan is \nwhere you accept our view and not your view, and different Senators can \ndefine that depending on their strong opinion.\n  Let me point out that when this started, the amount of funding was \nsomewhere between $4 billion and $5 billion, and many thought that was \ntoo much. It is now $7.5 billion. If that isn't compromise, and some \nwould think in the wrong direction, I don't know what compromise is.\n  Let me point out that Senators came to me from both sides of the \naisle. This\n\n[[Page S10155]]\n\nhas not been exclusively a Republican initiative by any means. They \nworried that too many of these programs were not specified, and they \nhad a lot of problems with those individual programs.\n  Let me point out that when I met with my good friends and colleagues \nin that Cloakroom and discussed this issue for about 20 minutes, if \nthat isn't bipartisan, colleagues, I must have been in the wrong \nCloakroom.\n  Now we are into a discussion as to whether or not there is enough \ndisaster assistance when the Secretary of Agriculture indicated that \n$400 million was at least a first step for him to take a look at it. \nThen we are into these acronyms of LDP and AMTA. That is why people's \neyes glaze over when we have any debate on farm program policy. We \nought to give the money out. Under AMTA, you get it in 10 days. Under \nLDP, it takes months. We are arguing about acronyms and we are arguing \nabout numbers.\n  Let's get the assistance to farmers and end this debate and don't \nchange the farm program policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, has all time been yielded or used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1509. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the order is the \nSenator from Arizona will offer an amendment at this point. My purpose \nfor rising is to confirm that and also to ask if we can get an \nagreement to limit time for debate on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, that is the order.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1510 To Amendment No. 1499\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds for the sugar \n             program, other than the marketing assessment)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 1510.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7  . SUGAR PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be used to pay the \n     salaries and expenses of personnel of the Department of \n     Agriculture to carry out section 156 of the Agricultural \n     Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7272), other than subsection \n     (f).\n       (b) Marketing Assessment.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act or any other Act shall be used to pay \n     the salaries and expenses of personnel of the Department of \n     Agriculture to carry out and enforce section 156(f) of the \n     Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7272(f) through \n     fiscal year 2001.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if it is agreeable with the distinguished \nmanagers on both sides, I offer a unanimous consent agreement for 1 \nhour equally divided, 30 minutes on either side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition \nof the McCain amendment, I be recognized to offer an amendment on dairy \ncompacts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, I was not able to hear what \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania was suggesting. Will the Senator repeat \nthe request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond to the distinguished \nmajority leader, I have been trying to get this amendment up. In order \nto get it sequenced, I have asked unanimous consent to bring up an \namendment on dairy compacts. A number of Senators intend to discuss it \nbriefly and not to press it to a vote because it is legislation on an \nappropriations bill, but we think it important to consider the matter \nso it may be taken up in conference.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Arizona \nregarding time? Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, did we agree \nto an hour equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, I want to let my colleague, the Senator from Wisconsin, know that \nI have been working with Senator Specter on this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask to be recognized for as much time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have offered this amendment for myself, \nSenator Gregg--I am sure Senator Feinstein--that will prohibit the \nAgriculture Department from using Federal funding for administering the \nvarious and sundry programs that benefit the sugar industry. This \namendment is carefully tailored by just cutting off funds so that it is \nnot in violation of rule XVI.\n  The amendment is to send a strong signal to my colleagues that it is \ntime to end the heavily subsidized sugar program. The Federal \nGovernment is burdened with an unnecessary and unprofitable loan \nprogram for big sugar producers and enforcing mandated import quotas on \nforeign sugar.\n  The sugar program has long since outlived its purpose. It was \noriginally enacted in the Depression era to aid our flailing economy. \nAs our economy resurged, the need for sugar subsidies diminished. \nCongress recognized this by eliminating the program in 1974, but\n\n[[Page S10156]]\n\nproponents of the sugar program were able to resurrect it in 1981 \nproving again that in this city nothing is ever effectively killed if \nit is subsidized to special interests. Efforts were made to abolish the \nprogram once again in the 1996 farm bill, but defenders of the sugar \nprogram kept it alive and even extended it.\n  The sugar program is a system of Federally-subsidized loans, import \nrestrictions and protective price supports that equates to little more \nthan corporate welfare. The present program restricts foreign \ncompetition and ensures a high domestic price for sugar far in excess \nof world prices. The Agriculture Department also guarantees loans for \nsugar processors and producers that may not be fully repaid in dollars \nback to the Government. The current law allows loan borrowers to pledge \nsugar as collateral to satisfy repayment obligations.\n  Several independent reviews of the sugar program have demonstrated \nthat the biggest economic burden of this program falls on the American \ntaxpayers. The Heritage Foundation stated that ``the sugar program is \nbig government and corporate welfare at its worst.'' Given the big \ngovernment and corporate welfare we have in this town, that is a pretty \nimpressive statement. The Coalition for Sugar Reform, counting among \nits members such groups as the National Audubon Society and Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, and others, has touted this program as \nburdensome and unfair to the consumer. These groups are leaders in \nadvocating for reform and eventual elimination of this costly subsidy.\n  The continuing existence of the sugar program has resulted in U.S. \nconsumers paying three times the current world price for sugar and \nsugar-contained products. The General Accounting Office estimates that \nsugar price supports force American consumers to pay $1.4 billion every \nyear in artificially inflated sugar prices. Mandatory price quotas keep \nthe price of American-grown sugar at roughly 22 cents a pound compared \nto 6 cents a pound for sugar grown in other parts of the world.\n  This is truly outrageous. Defenders of the sugar program support \nthese inflated consumer prices by claiming that the sugar program is \ncritical to the viability of our domestic sugar industry. Reports have \nshown that we are hurting our viability as a domestic sugar industry by \ncontinuing this program because America's farmers cannot compete with \nforeign markets and are forced to close sugar refineries. Since this \nprogram has been in effect, 12 of the 22 U.S. sugar refineries have \nbeen forced to close, eliminating thousands of jobs.\n\n  In the February 1998 Reader's Digest, there is a story about the \nNation's largest candy-cane manufacturer opening a plant in Jamaica in \norder to stay competitive with foreign companies. Sugar prices in \nJamaica are as much as 50 percent cheaper than in the U.S.\n  Yet, the sugar program continues to reap benefits for a small sector \nof the sugar economy. Only by political clout has this corporate \nwelfare program survived.\n  A close examination of this program reveals that its true benefits \nare only realized by big sugar tycoons. Less than one percent of the \nNation's sugar growers gobble up 58 percent of the program benefits. \nThese are not small family farmers. In a recent year, 33 cane sugar \ngrowers obtained more than $1 million each from this Government \nboondoggle. In fact, one grower received $65 million.\n  The average consumer is not aware that food products, like candy, \ncereal or ice cream, are subject to a higher price dictated by the \nFederal Government--and it is a price that is likely to be twice as \nhigh because of sugar price supports. Not too many average grocery \nshoppers realize they are paying at least 10 cents more per pound of \nsugar because of these costly sugar mandates.\n  We cannot ask American consumers to continue to pay more for sugar \nthan the rest of the world. This richly sweet program for big sugar \nproducers has a sour aftertaste for average citizens and our Nation's \neconomy.\n  What I am proposing, because of rule XVI, is simply a one-year halt \nto the sugar program. The American consumers would be held harmless for \none year to give us time to undertake a long overdue debate on \nlegislation to reform and phase out the sugar program.\n  This amendment retains the sugar industry's responsibility to pay a \nminiscule assessment on domestic sugar, although I would be glad to \neliminate that. I do not think that is a very important aspect of this \namendment. With all the benefits received by the sugar industry, this \nrelatively small assessment is supposed to be the sugar industry's sole \ncontribution to reducing annual budget deficits. Last year, this \nassessment generated $37.8 million in revenues. With all that the \nFederal Government and the American consumers have spent over the years \nto support this inflated sugar program, this modest return of revenues \nto the treasury is certainly warranted, although I would be glad to \neliminate it.\n  I believe we should end the subsidies to the sugar industry and \neliminate the sugar program that is unfair to consumers. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and bring fairness back to our \nAmerican consumers.\n  Mr. President, in the New York Times of Monday, July 14, 1997, they \ntalked about:\n\n       . . . $1.5 billion a year from consumers to a handful of \n     large sugar growers. Almost half of the benefits from the \n     sugar program go to little more than 1 percent of growers. . \n     . .\n       There is a second, powerful reason to eliminate sugar \n     subsidies. They breed excessive production of sugar cane in \n     environmentally sensitive areas. In the Florida Everglades, \n     about a half-million acres of wetlands have been converted to \n     sugar cane production. Excessive sugar cane production has \n     interrupted water flows and contaminated the Everglades with \n     polluted agricultural run-off.\n\n  When I argue for campaign finance reform, I refer to a well-known \nfamily in Florida that has realized the American dream, the Fanjul \nbrothers. Alfonso Fanjul is the chairman and chief executive officer of \nFlo-Sun, a prominent Democrat who cochaired President Clinton's 1992 \nFlorida campaign.\n  Jose ``Pepe'' Fanjul, is a prominent Republican who served on the \ncampaign finance committee of 1996 GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole. \nHe also is vice chairman of the National Republican Party's finance \ncommittee.\n  They are major--major--givers of soft money, major contributors.\n  I will include in the Record that during the 1995-1996 election \ncycle, members of the Fanjul family contributed $774,500 to Federal \ncampaigns. It is an excellent investment. In return, a grateful \nCongress maintains a sugar price support program worth approximately \n$65 million annually to the Fanjuls.\n  That is a pretty good investment; and they are getting a great return \non it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think we have to go back and forth.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am willing to accommodate the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. I understand he has a time conflict.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona and appreciate the opportunity to \njoin him on this amendment which is one of those amendments that comes \nto the floor of the Senate supported by logic, common sense, and good \neconomics, but is opposed, regrettably, by the forces who wish to take \nadvantage of the farm program for the purposes of promoting a product \nin a noncompetitive, nonmarket-type process.\n  The Senator from Arizona has outlined some of the harm that is done \nby the President's sugar program. Most of that harm is directed at the \nAmerican consumer who ends up paying $1.4 billion in taxes for all \nintents and purposes because it is a fee, a cost of sugar, they now \nincur which exceeds the market price of sugar they end up paying--a \n$1.4 billion surcharge on the American consumer in order to keep in \nplace a sugar industry which is totally noncompetitive.\n  If you were to describe the sugar industry, you would think you were \ndescribing the Cuban sugar industry, not the American sugar industry. \nThe sugar industry sets the price. The price is at least twice the cost \nof sugar on the world market. And then essentially it guarantees that \nthe sugar grower\n\n[[Page S10157]]\n\nand the processors will be able to realize that price.\n  Who pays the burden? The consumer. They end up paying twice as much \nfor sugar as sugar is worth on the open market. What does that \ndescribe? That describes a nonmarket system of selling a product. That \ndescribes essentially a socialist system of selling a product. That \ndescribes a system that might have worked in Eastern Europe 15 years \nago or might have been used in Eastern Europe 15 years ago--it \nobviously didn't work--or a system which may still be in place today in \nCuba. But it certainly doesn't describe a system one would expect the \nUnited States, the force for a free market economy in the world, would \nbe putting forward for the purposes of producing a commodity such as \nsugar. The effect, however, goes well beyond the fact that consumers in \nAmerica are paying this $1.4 billion in extra cost, which is \nessentially a tax on them.\n\n  This sugar program stifles competition. Seventeen growers get 38 \npercent of the benefit of this program, 17 growers. Why is that? \nBecause there isn't any competition in the system. It discourages \ninternational trade. We look at our Caribbean neighbors and we say: How \ncan we help you? Then we essentially invade Haiti and spend literally \nhundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars to try to stabilize \nthat economy to no avail, where at the same time we are saying to Haiti \nand all the other Caribbean nations who are capable of producing sugar, \nno, we are not going to purchase your sugar because we are going to \nsubsidize our sugar, and we are going to essentially close you out of \nour markets.\n  It harms the environment. As has been pointed out by the Senator from \nArizona, the sugar cane growing in Florida has had a serious impact on \nthe quality of the environment of the Everglades, a key area of natural \nregeneration in the southern Florida area.\n  It affects jobs. Why does it affect jobs? Because if you don't have a \ncompetitive industry, you don't have a marketplace approach, you are \nessentially putting in a straitjacket the production capabilities of \nthe American economy.\n  Why is America the most productive country in the world? Because we \nare the most free market country in the world. That free market creates \njobs. People have the opportunity to compete. People have the \nopportunity to grow their industries. In the sugar industry, we have no \ncompetition because we have a process which is essentially a socialized \nsystem, and it requires unnecessary government involvement in the \nproduction of a commodity.\n  Why should the American people have to depend on the Federal \nGovernment to price the product of sugar? It makes absolutely no sense. \nWhy shouldn't the marketplace price the product of sugar? That is what \nwe do with everything else. If you go out and you buy a Ford car, the \nFederal Government doesn't say to Ford: It doesn't matter how many cars \nyou sell or who you sell them to, we are going to pay you $20,000 per \ncar; and if you only sell the cars for $17,000, it doesn't matter \nbecause we are going to pay you $20,000 anyway.\n  We don't say it to Apple Computer. We don't say it to Microsoft. We \ndon't say it to the housing industry. But we do say it to the sugar \nproducers in this country. It doesn't matter how much sugar you \nproduce; it doesn't matter if your production costs are twice what they \nmay be in the world market; it doesn't matter. We are going to set the \nprice. We are going to pay you the price and the price is going to have \nno relation to demand. It is going to have no relation to competition. \nThe only thing it is going to have a relation to is the amount of \nrevenue that is going to fall into the pockets of a very small number \nof growers in this country today who benefit from this program.\n\n  It is interesting, as we look at the farm programs in this country, \nthere is only sugar left that has this sort of a protection. It is able \nto accomplish this because it has diffused the issue of the maintenance \nof this outrageous subsidy across the entire American consumer base. \nRather than having it flow directly out of the American Treasury into \nthe growers' pockets, this program has been structured so that it flows \ndirectly out of the consumer into the growers' pockets. Because of \nthat, there has been a winking at this program; this program has sort \nof slipped through the cracks, where the rest of the farm commodities \nin this country have been forced to have some relationship, under \nFreedom to Farm, of having their product production tied to the product \ndemand. Sugar has not been subjected to that test at all.\n  So we have a program that should never have been put in place in the \nfirst instance because it is so atypical to a marketplace economy. But \nclearly, with the passing of Eastern Europe and the concept of a \nsocialized marketplace, it clearly should not be surviving today, yet \nit does survive.\n  I think the Senator from Arizona may have touched the reason. It is \npolitical influence. It is the capacity of the grower community to \nassert its influence within the legislative process. But it still is \nnot fair, and it is not right. It is not appropriate to ask the \nAmerican consumer to spend $1.4 billion of their hard-earned money on a \ncommodity simply to benefit a small group of growers--17 growers \ngetting 38 percent of the benefit.\n  That $1.4 billion could go a long way towards educating children, \ntowards getting better child care, towards improving the lifestyle, the \nhealth care, even the nutrition of the people who are paying that \nprice. Yet that money is not going to go to those purposes. Instead, \nthat money is going to flow simply to support an industry which has \ntotally separated itself from the free market.\n  I strongly endorse this amendment. I have offered it in the past \nmyself. I hope this time the Congress will step up and recognize that \nit should vote on behalf of the consumers and abolish this outrageous \ntax and put to rest this last vestige of Eastern European economics in \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to tell the Senators from New \nHampshire and Arizona that this is a sweet deal, but I can't say that \nbecause they are obviously deadly serious and, in my opinion, are \ndramatically misrepresenting a program that has not slipped through the \ncracks at all. It was negotiated and put in the 1996 farm bill to \nbenefit hundreds of growers in my State and in other States across the \nNation. It is to develop a program that doesn't cost the taxpayers of \nthis country one dime.\n  For the Senator from New Hampshire to say that a consumer goes to the \nmarketplace and buys a candy bar, and therefore is paying a government \ntax is false on its face and false by its fact. They are paying what \nthe candy bar company retails the product for.\n  Let me repeat for the record and for all listening, sugar farmers, \ncane or beet sugar raisers, in this country do not receive one \nGovernment payment. There is no subsidy involved. Instead, there are \nloan programs they can use for marketing purposes, and they pay them \nback with current interest rates. The Senator from Arizona knows that. \nThat is the way the program works. He is striking that out, but he is \nleaving the assessment in place. So he is saying: You can't have a \nrelationship to your Government where we are going to tax you if you \nraise or produce sugar in this country.\n  USDA estimates the sugar program saves taxpayers $500 to $700 million \nper year in deficiency payments on corn farmers and others who are \npaying an added 25 cents for the value of that product. These are the \nfacts with which we are dealing. Governments of all sugar-producing \ncountries have directly intervened in their production and have \ndramatically subsidized that production, driving down prices in the \nworld market. Those are the facts that our growers deal with on an \nannual basis. American workers in 42 States benefit from the sugar \npolicy. The sweetener industry has a positive annual impact of about \n$26.6 billion in the U.S. economy, and they add about 420,000 jobs to \nthat economy.\n  Here is the strange fact: You are being told sugar producers are \nmaking lots of money and the consumer is paying for it.\n  When we passed this new farm program in 1996, from that time forward,\n\n[[Page S10158]]\n\nthe price of cane sugar has dropped about 5 percent to the producer. \nThe cost of beet sugar has dropped about 13 percent.\n  Now, it is interesting that sugar products have gone up 20 to 30 \npercent, so the consumer is paying more, but the producer is getting \nless under this program. So when you have a Senator standing on the \nfloor saying the producer is making out like a bandit, well, if a 13-\npercent reduction in beet costs and a 5-percent reduction in cane is \nreal--and it is--who is making out like a bandit? I guess it is the \nretailer or manufacturer that has nothing to do with this. It is the \nmarketplace at work.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I rise in support of the McCain amendment. I first got involved in \nthe sugar program when the last remaining West Coast sugar refinery \ncame into my office to essentially say they were in the process of \nbeing put out of business by this program because they could not buy \nenough sugar on the world market to refine it. That refinery is C \nSugar. I found that the sugar program is little more than a system of \nimport restrictions, subsidized loans, and price supports that benefit \na limited number of sugar growers.\n  Recently, Congressman George Miller and I asked the GAO to take a \nlook at the sugar program. A week ago, they put out this report \nentitled ``Sugar Program: Changing the Method For Setting Import Quotas \nCould Reduce Costs to Users.'' In short, the GAO found that the USDA's \npolicy has allowed too little sugar to be imported into the country. \nThis has increased costs to consumers and restricted our domestic \nrefineries' access to sufficient quantities of sugar.\n  The GAO found:\n\n       USDA has continued to target the same stocks-to-use ratios \n     for determining annual tariff-rate quotas, despite the fact \n     that the resulting quotas have maintained domestic market \n     prices that are 2 or more cents higher than necessary for \n     avoiding loan forfeitures. This imposes unnecessary costs on \n     U.S. sugar users--about $400 million annually.\n\n  They also found that:\n\n       USTR's current process for allocating the sugar tariff-rate \n     quota does not ensure that all sugar allowed under the quota \n     reaches the United States market.\n\n  This finding is particularly troubling to me. By limiting the amount \nof raw cane sugar available for production, 40 percent of the jobs in \nthe sugarcane refining industry have been lost in this country. Since \n1982, 9 out of 21 cane sugar refineries in the United States have been \nforced out of business by this program. Those that have remained open \nare struggling to survive under onerous import restrictions.\n  I first became involved in this issue in 1994 when David Koncelik, \nthe president and CEO of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, \ninformed me his refinery was forced to temporarily close because it had \nno sugar. This 93-year-old refinery is the Nation's largest, and the \nonly such facility on the West Coast. C refines about 15 percent of \nthe total cane sugar consumed in the United States.\n  C requires in excess of 700,000 tons of raw cane sugar to meet its \nsales demand. Hawaii is C's sole source for its domestic raw cane \nsugar needs. But Hawaii's cane sugar industry has been in decline for \nover 10 years. This has meant that C is forced to cover over half of \nits annual consumption through imports from other countries.\n  The highly restrictive sugar import system forces C to pay an \ninflated price for raw sugar from both domestic and foreign suppliers. \nThis is just plain wrong. Even more devastating, however, the quota \nsystem limits the amount of sugar available to the refinery. Simply \nput, C has been unable to get enough sugar to refine, and it has been \nforced to close its doors on several occasions. This is as a result of \nthe sugar program.\n  In a letter to me, Mr. Koncelik notes:\n\n       The C Sugar refinery in Crockett, California, was forced \n     to close from November 8 to November 15 because it ran out of \n     raw sugar. This closing is extremely costly. Other competitor \n     refineries, Savannah and Domino, have had similar \n     experiences. The Government-imposed shortage is forcing up \n     the market price for raw sugar to levels that are bankrupting \n     refiners.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The USDA is unnecessarily \n     disrupting operations and injuring the nation's cane sugar \n     refining industry by failing to increase the annual sugar \n     import quota to adequate levels.\n       The C Sugar refinery in Crockett, California was forced \n     to close from November 8 to November 15 because it ran out of \n     raw sugar. This closing is extremely costly. Other competitor \n     refineries, Savannah and Domino, have had similar \n     experiences.\n       The Government-imposed shortage is forcing up the market \n     price for raw sugar to levels that are bankrupting refiners. \n     The tight import quota is keeping the price of raw sugar well \n     above the Government support level, and well above the level \n     at which Government loan forfeitures might occur. The \n     increase in the cost of raw sugar since 1994 has cost the \n     refining industry in excess of $80 million.\n       The structure of the market is such that refiners cannot \n     cover these increase costs in the refined sugar market. As a \n     result, C and all other refiners are losing money, and some \n     have for three years.\n       In addition, the deplorable condition of the refining \n     industry has triggered justifiable concern within the food \n     processing industry over the sugar supply. In the absence of \n     a viable refining industry, which accounts for over 50 \n     percent of refined sugar sold in the United States, the \n     specter of temporary food plant closing is real and not \n     imagined.\n       There is an urgent need for an immediate and, this time, \n     meaningful increase in the sugar import quota. I would \n     appreciate it if you would discuss this matter with Secretary \n     Glickman and Ambassador Kantor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David Koncelik,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The reduced production capacity has resulted in a \nsevere downsizing of the workforce at this refinery. As recently as \n1987, C employed over 1,400 people. These are not minimum wage jobs \nwe are talking about; the average employee in the cane refining \nindustry earns about $43,000 a year. In 1995, C had to eliminate 30 \npercent of its workforce just to remain viable under the quota system \nmandated by the sugar program.\n  C now employs just over 500 people. These jobs and many others \naround the Nation are at risk if reforms are not made to the sugar \nprogram.\n  In addition to choking off the refineries' access to sugar, the U.S. \nsugar policy also has had an adverse impact on consumers. An earlier \nreport by the GAO found that the program costs sugar users an average \n$1.4 billion annually, as has been mentioned. That equates to $3.8 \nmillion a day in hidden sugar taxes.\n  The report found that:\n\n       Although the sugar program is considered a no-net-cost \n     program because the Government does not make payments \n     directly to producers, it places the cost of the price \n     supports on sweetener users--consumers and manufacturers of \n     sweetener-containing products--who pay higher sugar and \n     sweetener prices.\n\n  What this means is that, unlike traditional subsidy programs, the \nfunds don't come directly from the Treasury. Instead, the sugar program \nplaces the cost on consumers by restricting the supply of available \nsugar which causes higher domestic market prices. This is our \nGovernment program; it makes no sense.\n  On numerous occasions over the past 5 years, I have asked the \nadministration to reform the sugar program. Simply increasing the \namount of sugar available through the import program would provide \nimmediate relief to C and all other domestic refineries. To date, no \nsuch permanent reform of the program has occurred. In the absence of \nthese reforms, Congress must take stronger action.\n  Congress has had opportunities in the past to kill this program and \nwe have not taken them. As a result, workers have lost jobs and \nconsumers have lost money.\n  Regardless of what happens with this amendment, the effort to reform \nthe sugar program is not going to end. Senators Schumer, Chafee, Gregg, \nMoynihan, myself, and others have introduced legislation that would \nphase out the subsidy over the next several years.\n  If the administration refuses to work with us to make the program \nresponsive to the needs of the domestic sugar refinery industry and to \nour consumers, we will have no choice but to push for passage of this \nbill.\n\n[[Page S10159]]\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Louisiana 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding time.\n  It is not unusual that we are doing the sugar amendment again. It \nseems that we do it about every 2 years. We have been doing it for \nprobably the last 20 years.\n  It is interesting that this time we are doing it on a bill that is \ndesigned to help American agriculture, except that I think this \namendment is being offered to try to eliminate an entire farm program \nfor only one commodity. But this amendment is on a bill we are working \non to try to help American agriculture. So I guess the only thing \nunusual is not that we are doing a sugar amendment but that we are \ndoing it on a bill that is designed to help American farmers. And, of \ncourse, the amendment would do the exact opposite.\n  It is interesting that some of my colleagues said, well, the program \nonly helps a couple of folks in south Florida when in truth the fact is \nthat about 420,000 people earn their living every day either directly \nor indirectly because of the sugar industry.\n  The distinguished Senator from Hawaii knows its importance in the \nState of Hawaii. He has been involved not only with sugarcane-producing \nStates but also sugar-beet-producing States. It is a program that has \nactually undergone a great deal of change and modification and \nimprovement over the years.\n  In the last farm bill, which was in 1986, we made some serious \nchanges in the sugar program. I think most people involved in it said: \nLook, we are going to try to make the program better than it has been, \nand we are trying to address some of the legitimate concerns but also \ntrying to provide some protection for this very important American \nindustry, to do it consistent with our international obligations. We \nhave done that. Domestic production controls were eliminated. There is \nno limit on how much you can produce in beets or in sugar. You can do \nas much as the market will bear.\n  The guaranteed minimum price was eliminated. It is one of the few \ncommodity crops that doesn't have a minimum guarantee of what the \nfarmer is going to be receiving from the Government.\n  We had a special tax for deficit reduction in the last farm bill, \nwhich was increased by 25 percent.\n  This means sugar farmers were actually given an assessment to pay for \nthe Federal deficit. Of course, now that the deficit is gone, it makes \na great deal of sense to eliminate the assessment.\n  Minimum imports--talking about not getting enough sugar--in the last \nfarm bill were increased by about 20 percent, a substantial increase \nover the previous years' pattern on the amount of sugar being imported \nfrom about 41 countries that are greatly helped by the program.\n  Forfeiture of sugar crop penalties were imposed.\n  The point is that we made some serious changes to the program in \norder to improve it. So to come before the Senate, on a bill that is \ndesigned to help farmers, and offer an amendment to hurt farmers sort \nof seems inconsistent. But, well, what else is new?\n  The other point I would make is how many Members of Congress have \nletters from constituents complaining about the price of a candy bar?\n\n  How many of us have stacks and stacks of letters complaining about \nthe price of a soft drink, or stacks of letters complaining about the \nprice of a 5-pound bag of sugar in the supermarket?\n  They don't do that because it is not a price that is out of \nproportion to what it has been in the past. Because of the program, it \nhas not spiked upward or crashed downward but has remained fairly \nstable so that people can predict what it is going to cost for a 5-\npound bag of sugar.\n  It is interesting that the only real complaints about the price of \nsugar come from the large industrial users and not from consumers in \nAmerica.\n  I remember my colleague, Senator Craig, was here back in the old \ndays, I would say, when we first started these debates, and Senator \nInouye was there, of course. It was the soft drink manufacturers who \ncomplained about the price of sugar. It made them charge too much for \ntheir soft drinks because they had sugar in them. Then they eliminated \nthe sugar, and the price of the soft drinks went up even more. The \nactual can of soft drink with no sugar was selling for more than the \nprice of a can of soft drink with sugar. They said, well, the price of \nsugar is making us raise the price of the soft drink.\n  Then they went to sugar-free drinks, and they charged more for that \nthan they did for the can with sugar in it. They actually increased the \nprice of soft drinks about four times because it said the sugar price \nwent up.\n  Guess what happened when the price of sugar went down? Did they \nreduce the price of a soft drink? Don't hold your breath. They did not. \nThe price of soft drinks kept going up.\n  The only complaint we have about the sugar program to any extent \noutside the Chamber is from the professional lobbyists and the large \nindustrial users which, for the most part, have changed over to the use \nof corn sweeteners and other things in the soft drink industry.\n  I suggest that what we have is a program that works better than most \nfarm programs because it doesn't have any Federal tax subsidy being \nused to hurt the income for sugar farmers. We use it by trying to \nregulate foreign companies from dumping cheap subsidized sugar from \nother countries onto the U.S. market. Some would way that is pretty \ngood. Why don't you let them do that because then the price of sugar \nwould be much lower? The problem with that theory is if they knocked \nout all of the American beet farmers and sugar cane farmers, the price \nwould be lower for a short period of time, but when they monopolize the \nmarket and again control the market, they certainly would have the \nability to exercise a sugar cartel and charge whatever they wanted, and \nwe couldn't compete.\n  In summary, we made great changes in 1996. The program is working. \nConsumers are not complaining. They have a stable price for a very \nimportant product.\n  Like we say back home in Louisiana, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix \nit.'' Not only is it ``ain't broke,'' but it works very well, and \nshould be maintained.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Hawaii 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \neloquence and wisdom of the statement of my friend from Louisiana.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is kind of fun to have these debates. I \nlook forward to a chance to once again talk about how the world sugar \nindustry works.\n  The Senator from Arizona indicated that we are having to pay three \ntimes the world market price because of the sugar program. It is just \nnot right. That isn't the case. It appears to be the case, but it is \nwrong. Here is the reason it is wrong.\n  The vast majority of sugar in the world doesn't sell on the world \nmarket. The vast majority of sugar in the world sells under contract. \nThose contract prices are much higher than the so-called world market \nprice. The world market price is a dumping price. It is what happens \nwhen producers produce more than they contracted for. They take that \nexcess and they dump it on the market and sell it at fire sale prices.\n  The world market price they talk about is, in fact, not a world \nmarket price. It does not represent what sugar sells for. It is totally \nmisleading. As a result, you come to a wrong conclusion.\n  The truth is that the last time we took away the sugar program, what \nhappened to the price of sugar? Did the price of sugar go down? Does \nanybody remember? The price of sugar shot up. My, what a surprise.\n  This sugar program is supposed to be producing higher prices. Yet \nwhen it was removed the last time, sugar prices\n\n[[Page S10160]]\n\ndid not go down; they went up. In fact, they went up dramatically.\n  It is because people do not understand how the sugar market works. \nThis program in effect stabilizes prices.\n  Every country has a sugar program. In fact, every country that is a \nproducer has a program. Our major competitors spend much more on theirs \nthan we do on ours.\n  This program helps stabilize prices for consumers and for producers.\n  When sugar prices fall, do candy prices fall? Let's go back and look. \nLet's check the record. Interestingly enough, the last time we saw \nsugar prices fall we also saw candy prices go up. We saw cereal prices \ngo up. The fact is there is almost no relationship between the price of \nsugar and the finished products that some are talking about. In fact, \nthis program stabilizes prices for consumers and for producers.\n\n  Finally, on the question of who benefits, those who are producers \nclearly benefit from stabilization. I believe those who are consumers \nbenefit from stabilization. In my State, we are not talking about a \nbunch of rich folks; we are talking about family farmers who are in \ndeep trouble right now. If we take away this program, they will be in \neven deeper trouble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I inquire the amount of time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to endorse the comments of my \nassociates who have spoken in the last few minutes. This is an \ninteresting program. We have been through this before. We went through \nit in 1996. There were extensive changes made in the farm bill in 1996 \nthat resulted in a number of changes. We have a program that has \nprovided consumers with low, stable prices. It operates at no direct \ncost to the taxpayers. It helps reduce the Federal deficit and creates \n420,000 jobs.\n  The Senator from California was talking about the closing of one \nplant. I am talking about growers, family farmers in Wyoming. I don't \nrecognize the description by the Senator from Arizona of the people who \nare involved. That is not the way we do it.\n  A number of things have changed that I think are very important. It \nwas mentioned, when we didn't have a sugar program, the average cost of \nraw sugar was up to nearly 70 cents. It is now somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 20. Sugar policy benefits consumers. In developed \ncountries, the average price is 60 cents; the highest is 92. The U.S. \nprice is 41. We are 32 percent below the average consumer price for \nsugar.\n  It has been pointed out that at the same time raw sugar prices have \ngone down almost 6 percent, the cost of products such as cereal have \ngone up 18 percent; ice cream, 18 percent; candy, 20 percent; cookies \nand cakes, up 25 percent. That is not the reason the cost of goods has \ngone up.\n  Under the farm bill, there is no minimum price guarantee. They have \nno recourse loans other than when there is an exception to the imports. \nSugar farmers receive no Government payment and have not since the \n1970s. Indeed, they do pay a marketing assessment that goes to reduce \nthe deficit, an unusual characteristic.\n  This business of the ``world price'' that has been discussed is \nclearly a dump price. The average production cost is 18 cents; the \naverage world price is 9 cents. Figure out if that is really the market \nworking. Of course it isn't. It is a dumped price.\n  The farm bill is not the time to discuss the sugar bill. It was \nextended in 1996 in the farm bill, to be reviewed again in the year \n2002. The sugar industry is very happy to reduce the import quotas if \nthe rest of the world does the same thing.\n  We are talking about small producers, not huge money conglomerates. I \nam a little offended at the idea that soft money is the reason that \npeople support this program. This is a program that has served us well. \nThe time when we are talking about strengthening agriculture is not the \ntime to do this.\n  I urge my associates in the Senate to reject this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the Senator from Louisiana 2 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the \nremarks of my senior Senator from Louisiana who has led this fight \nsuccessfully for many years and who has crafted a program that is \nworking not only for sugar growers in 40 States around the country, \nwith over 400,000 jobs represented directly or indirectly, it is also \nactually working for the refineries and the consumer.\n  I am surprised that this amendment has come up, particularly at this \ntime. I don't believe it is good to kick farmers while they are down. \nThat is what this amendment does. The rural economies in our country \nare really struggling. Commodity prices from the west coast to the east \ncoast, to Louisiana, up to the Dakotas, have been at historic lows. We \nare struggling to find the balance as to how our agricultural community \ncan compete.\n  The sugar growers in Louisiana are highly efficient. We can compete \nwith farmers all over the world, but we can't compete with foreign \ngovernments. That is what this whole issue is about. This sugar program \nis working for everyone. It costs the taxpayer nothing. It has actually \nbeen a revenue raiser since 1991. Now is simply not the time to kick \nthe farmers when they are down.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of my senior colleague from \nLouisiana. I thank the manager for giving me and other Senators time to \nspeak on this important issue, and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her \nvery important and direct statements about this issue.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Craig, Senator Breaux, and others on the floor, in opposing \nthis amendment.\n  I find it interesting; whenever we talk about sugar, we talk about \nthe ``world price,'' which doesn't have any relationship to anything of \nimportance. The people who describe ``world price\" are people who go to \na sidewalk sale in front of a store and pick up some odds or ends that \nsomebody is trying to sell at 90 percent off list price and then say: \nLook what I bought this for; this is the price for that product.\n  No, it is not; it is a sidewalk sale.\n  The same is true with sugar. Most sugar is traded country to country \nby long-term contract. Very little sugar is moved on the open market. \nThat which is represents an overhang and surplus and represents the \ndump price or the surplus price. Those are the facts.\n  Somehow there is a notion we should be the victims in this country as \na group of producers; whatever the lowest common denominator is, we \nought to ride the elevator to the bottom with everybody. Calling the \nprice of sugar on the world market the world price is a misnomer. Most \nsugar is traded by contract, and it is traded in circumstances where at \nleast you get back the cost of production and a decent profit.\n  This price they are talking about, don't be fooled by it. It doesn't \nmean anything. It is not related to the production of sugar in this \ncountry.\n  Now, who is producing sugar? I find it ironic that in the middle of \nthis discussion about the farm crisis, in the middle of the discussion \nabout the plight of families out there struggling to survive, when the \nAsian economy has collapsed, exports are down, and prices have \ncollapsed, and in my State we have had the worst crop disease in 100 \nyears, and my State had 3 million acres that could not be planted \nbecause it was too wet this spring, we are told there is one part of \nthe farm program that ought to be dismantled.\n  At least this is a part of the farm program that works and has \nhistorically worked. It doesn't cost Federal money. It doesn't cost the \ntaxpayer anything. It provides stability of sugar prices for the \nAmerican consumer. It provides some modicum of stability for the \nproducers.\n  Who are the producers? Family farmers. I was in a room with 1,000 of \nthem in Fargo, ND. These are folks who work on that tractor in the \nwinter, get it all ready, and then take all the risk\n\n[[Page S10161]]\n\nto put the crop in, plant those beets, take the risk of the harvest, \nand take the risk through their cooperative. These are good people, and \nthey are going through tough times. The last thing in the world we \nought to do is pull the rug out from under those people who are \nproducing our beets and cane and decide we should dismantle this \nprogram.\n  There is so much in the farm program that doesn't work, and I have \nbeen on the floor for days talking about it. Why go to the part of the \nfarm program that has worked historically to help the producer and say, \nby the way, let's find something that does work and get rid of it? It \ndoesn't make any sense at all.\n  Let me conclude by saying this is about family farmers as far as I am \nconcerned. It is not about the theory of sugar production or a sugar \nprogram or a world price. It is about providing stability for \nconsumers, yes but it is about providing stability of income for some \nfamilies that are trying to make a living on the land in this country. \nIt is not easy for them. This program is helping them without cost to \nthe American taxpayer. This program has helped them without injury or \ncost to the American consumer.\n\n  This program is well conceived and well constructed, is contributing \nsomething, and is an asset to American family farmers in this country. \nThe last thing in the world we should do, and the last time we ought to \ndo it, would be to get rid of the sugar program at this point in this \ndebate on the farm program. We ought to preserve the sugar program. We \nought to fight for it and preserve it because it works. We ought to do \nthat in the context in which we are working today, to help family \nfarmers in other ways as well, with the disaster program, the response \nto the farm crisis, and perhaps a change in the underlying farm law at \nsome point in the future.\n  But this is narrow. This is an amendment that says let's get rid of \nthe sugar program. I was unaware of this amendment until an hour or so \nago. I did not see any organization developing in the Congress or in \nthe Senate to say let's have a discussion about this. This is a program \nthat has worked so well. Then we have an amendment and then debate for \nan hour. I think that describes the difficulty.\n  Let us support the sugar program. Let us defeat this amendment. It is \nimportant for family farmers in this country to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, for his closing comments. Before doing so, \nlet me say both the cane interests that he represents and the beet \ninterests that I represent have worked together over the years to build \na program that many have outlined today. It works well in the market. \nThe Senator from Wyoming has played an important role in helping define \nthat program.\n  Let me yield to the Senator from Louisiana for his closing comments.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I say to our colleagues who may be \nwatching some of this debate, the last time this amendment was \noffered--and it is offered to the Senate on an annual basis--was on the \nSenate Agriculture appropriations bill in 1997. The distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, at that time moved to table the \neffort to do away with the program. I remind all Senators we had a \nrecorded vote and 63 Senators voted to table it at that time.\n  I hope people understand the program is working. We made major \nchanges in 1996. It operates at no cost to the taxpayers and has \nprovided a stable floor of prices for the product, sugar, that we \nimport and produce domestically.\n  The point again is, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' It is \nworking as we in the Congress intended it to work. It is working for \nproducers and consumers. This is something that is almost a rarity in \nagricultural programs. It has been very difficult to come up with a \nproper balance.\n  This program is working. It is working as Congress intended. We \nshould keep it and not try to kill it when it is working as well as it \nis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Florida 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the statement \nthat was made earlier relative to the role of the Florida sugar \nindustry and the Florida Everglades. As one who grew up in the Florida \nEverglades and feels deeply about the importance of the State and \nnational effort which is underway to restore them, I think it is \nimportant to set the record straight.\n  The sugar industry has appropriately been designated for a major part \nof the effort to restore the Everglades. Thus far, they have not only \nmet but exceeded the requirements that have been imposed for the \nreduction of phosphorus from the waters before they enter the main part \nof the Everglades. Sugar has participated in the development of a \nrestudy plan, which will soon be debated by this Senate, and sugar has \nbeen a strong supporter of the restoration of the Everglades through \nthe Corps of Engineers restudy plan.\n  It is important for the success of the salvation of the Everglades \nthat each of the stakeholders play their role. I can state at this time \nthat sugar is playing its appropriate role and a strong sugar industry \nis going to be a key element in achieving the objective of saving the \nFlorida Everglades.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me close out the debate on this side of \nthis issue by saying to Senators that you will have an opportunity to \nvote to table the McCain amendment in a few moments. It is an amendment \nthat really does not face the reality of the situation today. While \nproduct prices across the country, are low, we have one program in \nagriculture that is working reasonably well. That is a program that, in \nvalue to the farmer, beet or cane, since 1990, has actually gone down. \nBut it has not translated through to the consumer because the sweetener \nindustry, and the confectionery industry have continually raised their \nprices. This is not a subsidy, nor is it a cost to the taxpayer. There \nis no net cost to the taxpayer. All of these recourse loans are repaid \nat current interest rates. It is important to recognize it is a way of \nmarketing and effectively distributing the product of this agricultural \nproducer.\n  It has also been clearly pointed out that you cannot compare current \nvalues and markets with world markets because most sugar around the \nworld is sold on contract. That which is not is dumped to the bottom. \nSo to compare that, it is not even apples and oranges; it is apples \ncompared with nothing.\n  It is important this program be retained. We revised it dramatically \nin 1996 in the new farm program, and it has worked effectively since \nthat time. I hope those who supported us in 1996 on a similar amendment \nwill stand with us today, in behalf of the American producer, both cane \nand sugar beet and the American consumers. American consumers find \nthemselves paying substantially less than other consumers, some nearly \n$1 billion less on an annualized basis than other comparable consumers \naround the world in developed nations that are large consumers of \nsugar.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to table the McCain \namendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as I listen to all the evils attributed to \nthe sugar program during today's debate on the McCain amendment, I \nhardly recognize the tiny white crystals that sweeten my cereal each \nmorning.\n  Sugar is an essential element of human nutrition. It's also one of \nthe least expensive food items you will find in an American kitchen. \nWhen you go to a restaurant, there are only two things available at no \ncharge and in unlimited quantity: water and sugar. Despite these \nachievements, sugar is being abused and maligned on the Senate floor.\n  As I listen to the criticism of the sugar program,I think that some \nof my colleagues have lost sight of a basic fact that American \nconsumers clearly understand: sugar is probably the best bargain you \ncan find at the grocery store today. A pound of refined sugar\n\n[[Page S10162]]\n\ncosts 39 cents. American sugar farmers and the U.S. sugar program help \nmake sugar affordable.\n  Consumers elsewhere around the globe do not enjoy the low prices we \nhave in America. If you visit a grocery store in other industrialized \nnations you will get ``sticker shock'' when you pass the sugar display. \nIn Tokyo, consumers pay nearly 90 cents for a pound of sugar, more than \ntwice the U.S. price. In Europe, prices average 50 to 70 cents per \npound. Obviously, sugar is no bargain in Europe and Japan.\n  On average, the retail price for a pound of sugar is 54 cents in \ndeveloped countries--38 percent more than the price in American \nsupermarkets. Consumers in developing countries pay a significant \npremium for sugar. When they go to market, all they get is the same \none-pound box of sugar as we do in America, but they pay substantially \nmore for it--38 percent more.\n  Thanks to a farm program that assures stable supplies at reasonable \nprices, sugar is a remarkable bargain for American consumers. U.S. \nconsumers pay an average of 17 cents less per pound of sugar than their \ncounterparts in other industrialized nations. Low U.S. prices save \nconsumers $1.4 billion annually. That's why I say that the sugar \nprogram is a great deal for American consumers. Thanks to the sugar \nprogram, U.S. consumers enjoy a plentiful supply of sugar at bargain \nprices.\n  I thank my colleagues for rejecting this amendment. If Congress \nterminates the sugar program, not only will a dynamic part of the \neconomy disappear from many rural areas, but consumers will also lose a \nreliable supply of high-quality, low-price sugar.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain amendment \nand urge my colleagues to support American agriculture by supporting a \nprogram that has consistently proven its worth to American consumers.\n  Our current sugar program provides consumers one of the cheapest \nprices for sugar in the developed world. In 1998, U.S. sugar prices \nwere approximately 32 percent below other developed countries.\n  One reason for these low prices has been the obvious success of the \ncurrent Sugar program. The purpose of the program is to protect the \nincomes of domestic sugar producers by supporting domestic prices. The \nprogram does this by making available loans to sugar processors and by \nrestricting sugar imports. There is no cost, therefore, to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Because of the support this program has given America's sugar \nproducers, American consumers have benefitted from a healthy industry \nthat has provided us a steady, quality product. Consider, however, what \ncould happen if our domestic sugar industry was suddenly forced out of \nbusiness by heavily-subsidized, low-quality foreign sugar. Could we \nguarantee that sugar prices would continue at an affordable level, or \nthat American consumers would receive a high-quality product that was \nproduced under safe, healthy conditions?\n  When we compare the cost of U.S. sugar with the price of sugar on the \nworld market we must also not forget the other benefits that come from \na healthy domestic sugar industry, including the benefit of increased \nemployment for our rural communities. Economies in rural communities \nare not like economies in more urban settings. Rural economies cannot \nmake the kind of rapid adjustments that are available to more populated \nareas. When a sugar processing plant of about 250 people goes out of \nbusiness in rural America, even though its number of employees may seem \nsmall under urban standards, those 150 employees can make up a large \npercentage of the local work force. The impact of this sudden high \nunemployment can resound through such a community for many, many years.\n  Furthermore, it is unfair to compare the cost of U.S. sugar with the \nprice of sugar on the world market because when we look at the actual \nsource of the world price we learn it is not an accurate or comparable \nprice. In reality, it is a dump price, or in other words it is the \nprice sugar-exporting countries get for dumping their highly-subsidized \nsugar on world markets.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support \nAmerica's farmers and to support America's consumers by opposing this \namendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1510, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment by removing part (b) of this amendment. That has to do with \nthe marketing assessment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, the \namendment is modified.\n  The amendment as modified is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7. SUGAR PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be used to pay the \n     salaries and expenses of personnel of the Department of \n     Agriculture to carry out section 156 of the Agricultural \n     Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7272), other than subsection \n     (f).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am always entertained by this debate, \nespecially by my friend. I understand the argument of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle because they have a philosophy concerning big \ngovernment and government has the answer to our problems and we should \nsubsidize industries and also practice protectionism. I understand \nthat.\n  It is a little harder for me to understand the philosophy on this \nside of the aisle, which is supposed to be less government, less \nregulation, fewer subsidies, lower taxes, and looking out for the \nindividual.\n  The combination of import restrictions, guaranteed prices, and \nsubsidized loans keep the prices artificially high. There is no \nobjective economist in America who will disagree with that. There will \nbe people in the sugar growing industry and those who represent States \nwhere sugar is grown, but that is a fact. It transfers about $1.5 \nbillion a year from consumers to a handful of large sugar growers. \nAlmost half the benefits from the sugar program go to little more than \n1 percent of growers. The high prices act as a tax on food, and it hits \nhardest at poor families who typically spend a large fraction of their \nbudget on food and other necessities.\n  If this proposal passes, according to any objective economist, \nincluding our much respected Heritage Foundation and others, the sugar \nprice could fall 20 cents for a 5-pound bag.\n  The advocates justify their subsidies as needed to counter foreign \nsubsidized imports and protect the jobs of domestic workers. Neither \nargument withstands scrutiny. There are ample rules to prevent foreign \ncountries from dumping Government-subsidized sugar in the U.S. markets. \nAlso, by propping up raw sugar prices, the program has driven half the \nU.S. sugar refiners out of business or out of the country, taking the \njobs with them.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry to see the Senator from Florida defend the \nsugar growers because everybody knows, and any environmental \norganization will agree, that what has happened in the Everglades has \ncaused enormous damage.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 60 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Whether they are willing to kick in and fix it is one \nthing, but I think any environmental organization would attest to the \nfact that the increase of a half million acres of sugar growing around \nthe Everglades has done significant damage to the Everglades.\n  I am glad they are being forced to pay for part of the cleanup since \nthey are clearly a great part of the problem. I also think it is wrong \nwhen one family gets $35 million in subsidies--35 million of taxpayer \ndollars. I think it is wrong. I think most Americans think it is wrong, \ntoo. I do not expect to win this amendment, but some day we are going \nto realize that by subsidizing big producers, whether they be for sugar \nor anything else, the American people will grow a little weary of this \nkind of expenditure of their taxpayer dollars and demand we change.\n  I yield back my remaining time. I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Has all time been used or yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been used or yielded back.\n\n[[Page S10163]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1512 To Amendment No. 1499\n\n(Purpose: To reauthorize, and modify the conditions for, the consent of \n   Congress to the Northeast Dairy Compact, to grant the consent of \nCongress to the Southern Dairy Compact, and to require the Secretary of \nAgriculture to use certain methods for pricing milk under consolidated \n                     Federal milk marketing orders)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1512 to amendment No. 1499.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. This amendment calls for the creation of a dairy compact \nthat would extend beyond the New England States, which currently have a \ndairy compact, and would include a number of other States, such as \nPennsylvania, New York, and others. The purpose of this dairy compact \nis to stabilize the price of milk. The price of milk has fluctuated \nenormously. In December of last year, it was as high as $17.34 per \nhundredweight; in June of this year, it went down to $11.42 per \nhundredweight.\n  There is currently a dairy compact in effect for the Northeastern \nStates--not including Pennsylvania or New York--which will expire in \nOctober of this year. The compact will provide some stability in the \nindustry and will guarantee consumers an uninterrupted supply of milk. \nThere has been some concern expressed about the cost to the consumers. \nWhen the Northeast Compact went into effect, the prices for milk within \nthe compact region were 5 cents lower than retail prices in the rest of \nthe Nation.\n  This bill would authorize member States to enter into a voluntary \nagreement to create a minimum price for milk in the compact region that \ntakes into account the regional differences in the costs of production. \nIn addition to providing the stability, it will ensure, with an \nappropriate safety net, that milk can be produced and be available for \nvery important programs like WIC--Women, Infants, and Children--and the \navailability generally.\n  Pennsylvania passed legislation that will enable Pennsylvania to \nenter into this compact if it is authorized by the Congress. Some 40 \nSenators have cosponsored similar legislation, and Governor Ridge \nsigned legislation that would permit my State of Pennsylvania to enter \ninto the compact.\n  Mr. President, as I outlined earlier, when seeking a unanimous \nconsent agreement, I do not intend to press this issue to a vote. I do \nnot intend to do so because of the rule of the Senate that bars \nlegislation on an appropriations bill--a recently revived rule. But I \nam putting it in the Record today and outlining its basic purpose, with \nthe intent to bring it up in the conference with the House to try to \nget this enacted into law.\n  I am pleased now to yield to the distinguished Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania. I am proud to work with him on this amendment. As was \nstated, this would reauthorize the Northeast Dairy Compact and extend \nit to New York and Pennsylvania, as well as New Jersey, Maryland, \nDelaware, and Ohio. It also implements the 1-A pricing structure.\n  I have visited dairy farms throughout New York State, and I have \nbecome an enthusiastic supporter of the compact, which will preserve \nthe economy and a rural way of life in my State and throughout the \ncountry. Over the last 10 years, New York State has lost a third of its \ndairy farms, dropping from 13,000 to 8,600. These are not just 8,600 \nfarms; they are the backbone of a rural economy. We in New York State \nhave the third largest rural population of any State, and the dairy \ncompact is vital.\n  I have talked to constituents in New York City, and they would, in \nsome cases, pay a little bit more for milk. But we need to bring both \nparts of the State together. As I have asked my upstate constituents to \nsometimes consider the problems we have downstate and be mindful of \nthose, I ask the same of my downstate constituents about upstate.\n  The cost is not great. The New England compact price of milk has not \nrisen by more than 4 cents a year; that is, $3.50 a family. WIC is \nexempt. There is a move I support to exempt senior citizen programs.\n  So it is not going to cost anyone very much to help preserve a \nportion of our State and a way of life. I am disappointed, of course, \nthat we were unable to garner the 60 votes for the New England compact. \nI understand why the Senator from Pennsylvania--and I agree with him--\nwill not pursue this to a vote at this point, but we do this in hopes \nthat in conference we can be added to the compact.\n  Both of my good friends from Wisconsin led a strong, valiant fight on \nthe other side. The only thing I would ask them to understand is how \ndesperately our State needs this compact. I am hopeful that we can find \nsome common ground that will benefit both areas.\n  But in the meantime, New York needs entry into the compact. We need \n1-A, and I hope that my colleagues will look at this amendment and \nmight be able to support it in conference.\n  I yield whatever remaining time I have. I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania for yielding time to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I had hoped that the last vote had ended the \ndebate on dairy compacts. But if my colleagues wish to eulogize these \ncartels, I am happy to join them.\n  First, I want to explain why I care so much about this issue. \nWisconsin is the dairy state. We have 22,000 farms, and almost all of \nthem family-owned businesses. We have thousands more residents who make \ntheir living buying\n\n[[Page S10164]]\n\nand selling dairy products, farm equipment, barns, feed, even the early \nmorning coffee served to the farmers who come to town straight from \ntheir milking barns each morning. Dairy compacts do not only strike at \nan industry in my state. They strike at the heart and soul of \nWisconsin, at our way of life.\n  The Northeast dairy compact legislatively raises the price of class I \nmilk above the prevailing federal milk marketing order price for \nfarmers in the States lucky enough to be in the compact region. By a \ncomplicated formula, all dairy farmers in the region--regardless of \nwhat class milk they produce or for what use--receive some extra \nsubsidy from the region's milk processors based on their overall milk \nproduction. Of course, this is a classic anti-market incentive for \nthese farmers to produce more milk than the region needs or demands.\n  Besides having a very real cost to the Treasury, the overproduction \nof all sorts of milk in the compact region causes prices to fall in \nnon-compact states for milk used to produce cheese, butter, milk powder \nand other products likely to be exported out of State. If the Northeast \ndairy compact becomes permanent, the oversupply problem will grow \nexponentially as Northeast farmers make the capital investments \nwarranted by their permanent guarantee of an artificially high price \nfor all of their milk. If compacts spread to other regions of the \ncountry, non-compact regions--the fewer and fewer farmers operating in \na free market--will be squeezed even more by even more overproduction. \nThe cost to the Treasury would be unjustifiable. The cost to efficient \nfamily farms in the Midwest would be unbearable.\n  This is more than bad economic policy. The regional favoritsm it \nembodies is downright un-American. What other industry sees prices set \nbased soley on what region of the country the producer produces? What \nother industry faces trade barriers erected within the United States?\n  You may support dairy compacts today based on the hope your State \nmight join a dairy compact soon or based on indifference to a dairy \nindustry problem that doesn't have much to do with your State. But \nremember your support tomorrow when your neighboring state or region \nthrows up a wall to keep you from selling fruit or vegetables or grain \nor beef or cars or computers in their State. That is no way to run a \ncountry. That is no policy for States that are allegedly united into \none country. Mr. President, I hope we can put this issue to rest for \nthe year and move forward with this important agricultural \nappropriations bill. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me associate myself with all of the \ncomments of the senior Senator from Wisconsin with regard to the merits \nof this amendment.\n  Again, I agree that this has to be one of the most bizarre pieces of \nthe American economy that the Congress ever sought to set up.\n  We are extremely pleased and happy with the vote on cloture. There \nwas a full court press to try to get cloture on this very hard fought \nissue.\n  Frankly, the proponents of the compact didn't even come close. That \nis the message that is sent.\n  So when the Senator from Pennsylvania indicates that he is going to \nwithdraw this amendment, which certainly is within his rights, and then \nfight for it in conference, let me simply point out at this point that \nI could offer a point of order, which I assume would be agreed to by \nthe Presiding Officer, which would make it clear and indisputable that \nthis simply does not belong on an appropriations bill under rule XVI. \nThat is clear.\n  So if it isn't appropriate in the Senate to do it, and it is against \nour rules, I would suggest it doesn't belong in conference either.\n  The message from the Senate is clear. All the efforts were made on \nboth sides to try to win that cloture vote. The message is very simple. \nThis body is not representing to the conference or anyone else any \nother conclusion other than that the compact should come to an end, as \nthe Secretary of Agriculture has proposed.\n  I will not offer that point of order in deference to the Senator from \nPennsylvania. But I want to be very clear in the Record that that is \nthe posture from the Senate as this bill ultimately goes to conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the parliamentary situation. \nBut I want to strongly support the amendment of both Senator Specter \nand Senator Schumer.\n  The distinguished Senator from New York has been a tremendous \nadvocate for his dairy farmers, and this amendment is critical to \nkeeping them in business. Upstate New York, just as Vermont, needs a \ncompact to keep their dairy industry alive.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, has \ntaken the lead on this issue for years for his dairy farmers in \nPennsylvania. He recognizes that participating in our regional compact \nwill increase farm income at a time when dairy farmers around the \nNation are in dire straits.\n  I will continue to fight for them--for a Southern compact and for a \nNortheast compact. There will be other opportunities this year. I stand \nunited with them. Congress should not stand in the way of the wishes of \n25 Governors, 25 State senates, and 25 State assemblies, or house of \nrepresentatives--especially when all they want is to provide a safety \nnet for their dairy farmers without raiding the Federal Treasury.\n  We talk about billions of dollars in farm programs. We are asking \neverybody to embrace these compacts because they do not cost the \ntaxpayers anything.\n  Napoleon said that ``sometimes the most trifling thing decides the \nfate of battle.'' In this case, the new rule changes of rule XVI \ncoupled with bringing up the Senate Agriculture appropriations bill \nmakes it difficult to extend the compact to the additional 19 States \nthat already have approved compacts. Eventually it will be done. I will \ndo everything possible to get it done.\n  The National Grange pointed out that ``regional dairy compacts offer \nthe best opportunity to preserve family dairy farms.''\n  The Grange goes on to support the Southern Dairy compact since a \nSouthern Compact would ``provide dairy farmers in that region with a \nstable price structure for the milk they produce while assuring the \nregion a viable supply of locally produced milk.''\n  I support both the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, and the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, and appreciate all of the \ntremendous work they have done for the dairy farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I take sharp exception to the argument of \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, where the assertion is made \nthat we fell far short of cloture. We had 53 Senators who voted in \nfavor of cloture. We are moving up the line toward the requisite 60 \nnumber.\n  I might point out that on the campaign finance reform bill after some \nsubstantial years of effort there are 52 votes. I am one of the 52. I \nbelieve the campaign finance bill is going to get to 60 just as I think \nthe chances are excellent that we may well get to 60 on this cloture \nvote.\n  But the important point is that 53 Senators signified their desire to \nsupport strong dairy prices. That is much more significant in terms of \nbeing two votes over the majority. It is hard to get 51 Senators in \nthis body to agree to anything. It is harder yet to get 52, and harder \nstill to get 53.\n  There is a widespread recognition in this body, including the 40 \nSenators who have cosponsored this legislation. I believe there is a \nlot of support signified by 53 votes for cloture.\n  We will have an opportunity to move ahead with this bill when it gets \nto conference.\n  We will let the conference work its will and it may return to the \nfloor. There are very good reasons for this bill. I understand there \nare regional differences, and what may benefit the farmers of \nPennsylvania may detract to some extent from the farmers in other \nStates.\n  In our Government, in our democracy, we work these things out as best \nwe can. I hope we can find some common ground. If we can't, let the \nCongress work its will.\n\n[[Page S10165]]\n\n                     Amendment No. 1512, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I formally withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    specter dairy compact amendment\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment. On April 27, I introduced S.J. Res. \n22, along with 39 of my colleagues. Support for S.J. Res. 22, which \nreauthorizes the Northeast Dairy Compact and ratifies the creation of \nthe Southern Dairy Compact, is impressive.\n  As we know, Secretary Glickman's final pricing rule, which is \nscheduled to be implemented on October 1, 1999, will cost dairy farmers \nmillions of dollars in lost income. In addition, successful pilot \nprogram of the Northeast Dairy Compact will expire on October 1, 1999, \nunless congressional action is taken.\n  This amendment would: Extend the Northeast Dairy Compact until 2002 \nand ratify a Southern Dairy Compact as a pilot program until 2002; \nMandate Option 1-A for the pricing formula for Class 1 milk; and \nRequire the Secretary of Agriculture to use formal rule making to \ndetermine the pricing formula for Class III milk.\n  This amendment must be addressed before the October 1, 1999, \ndeadline. We have an opportunity to give the states the right to help \nprotect their farmers with no cost to the federal government and \ncorrect the Secretary of Agriculture's flawed pricing rules.\n  This amendment is about fairness to both farmers and consumers. It \nhas the broad support of governors, state departments of agriculture, \nthe American Farm Bureau, and dairy cooperatives and coalitions from \nthroughout the country. Even the Land-O-Lakes Cooperative in the Upper \nMidwest supports this important amendment.\n  However, I am aware that some of my colleagues oppose our efforts to \nbring fairness to our states and farmers. Also, unfortunately, Congress \nhas been bombarded with misinformation from an army of lobbyists \nrepresenting the national milk processors, led by the International \nDairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the Milk Industry Foundation. These \ntwo groups, backed by the likes of Philip Morse, have funded several \nfront groups to lobby against this amendment.\n  I would like to set the record straight. It is crucial that Congress \ndebate the issues presented on the merits, rather than based on \nmisinformation. When properly armed with the facts, I believe you will \nconclude that the Northeast Dairy Compact was a successful experiment \nthat works and that other states should be given the opportunity to \nprove whether a dairy compact would work for them.\n  This amendment reauthorizes the very successful Northeast Dairy \nCompact pilot program and allows the Southern Dairy Compact to operate \nas a pilot program until 2002, when Congress would have an opportunity \nto revisit and carefully consider the Northeast and Southern Compacts \nin the 2002 farm bill.\n  Currently the bill to reauthorize the Northeast and ratify the \nSouthern compact has 40 cosponsors. Twenty-five states have passed \ndairy compacts and now even more than half the states in the county are \ninterested in having the right to form dairy compacts. During the past \nyear Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, \nGeorgia, Missouri and Kansas, have all passed legislation to form a \nsouthern dairy compact. Texas is also considering joining the Southern \nCompact.\n  The Oregon legislature is in the process of developing a Pacific \nNorthwest Dairy Compact as well. New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, \nPennsylvania, and New York have passed state legislation enabling them \nto join the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact, which was authorized by the 1996 farm \nbill as a three-year pilot program, has been extremely successful. The \nCompact has been studied, audited, and sued--but has always come \nthrough with a clean bill of health. Because of the success of the \nCompact it has served as a model for the entire country.\n  One look at the votes cast by each state legislature, and you can see \nthat there is little controversy over what is in best interest for the \nconsumers and farmers in each respected state. For example, in Alabama \nand Arkansas, both legislative chambers passed compact legislation \nunanimously. It passed unanimously in the North Carolina Senate and by \na vote of 106-1 in the North Carolina House. In the Oklahoma State \nSenate, it passed by a vote of 44-1 and unanimously in the Oklahoma \nHouse. It passed unanimously in the Virginia State Senate and by a vote \nof 90-6 in the Virginia House. In Kansas, the bill passed in the Senate \nby a vote of 39-1 and an impressive 122-1 in the Kansas House.\n  A 1998 report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), requested \nby Members from the Upper Midwest, on the economic effects of the Dairy \nCompact illustrates the Compact's success. The OMB reported that during \nthe first six months of the Compact, consumer prices for milk within \nthe Compact region were five cents lower than retail store prices in \nthe rest of the nation.\n  OMB concluded that the Compact added no federal costs to nutrition \nprograms during this time, and that the Compact did not adversely \naffect farmers outside the Compact region. This is an important fact to \nremember as some of my colleagues may debate that the Compact harms the \nfarmers in the compact region.\n  Congressional opponents of the Compact also requested an audit of the \nDairy Compact Commission by the USDA's Office of Inspector General and \nfederal auditors gave the Compact Commission a clean bill of health. \nThe auditors stated unequivocally that the Commission has properly \nadministered funds and provided $46 million to dairy farmers.\n  The courts also agree that the Compact is legally sound. Last \nJanuary, a Federal appeals court rejected a challenge to the Dairy \nCompact by the Milk Industry Foundation. The Court found that the \nCompact was constitutional and the U.S. Agriculture Secretary's \napproval of the Compact was justified.\n  Recently seventeen Governors from throughout the Northeast and \nSoutheast sent a letter to the Majority Leader of the Senate and House, \nurging Congress to consider and support the Dairy Compact legislation. \nThe Governors of the Compact regions speak not only for their farmers \nand consumers but for the rights of the States. The message to Congress \nfrom Governors nationwide has been clear. ``Increase the flexibility of \nstates and support legislation that promotes state and regional policy \ninitiatives.''\n  I would now like to address the actual and potential impact of dairy \ncompacts on milk production and the cost to taxpayers. In short, dairy \ncompacts have and should have little impact on production and operates \nwithout cost to taxpayers and the federal government, not one penny. \nOpposition claims to the contrary, even accounting for the admitted \nuncertainty of dairy economics, are overblown and distorted.\n  First, these compacts contain specific provisions designed to ensure \nthe prevention of surplus production attributable to operation of the \ncompacts. The compacts are entirely self-funded, without any recourse \nto the federal (or state) treasury and preclude any cost to taxpayers. \nAdditionally, the states have agreed to the condition of consent \ncontained in S.J. Res. 22 which requires the compact commissions to \nreimburse USDA for any surplus purchases made, should the internal \nprotection devices fail. While the latter provision does not directly \nprevent the potential adverse impact of surplus production on the \nnational marketplace, it does act as a further restraint on the \ncommission's function. It is only logical to see that the last thing \nthe commissions would want is to end up as funding USDA purchases of \nsurplus powdered milk production for the national milk market!\n  With this analysis in mind, I would like to briefly respond to the \nclaims about milk production and taxpayers costs made by opponents of \ndairy compact legislation. The International Dairy Foods Association, \nthe trade organization for the processors' lobby which is leading the \nopposition to S.J. Res. 22, claims that the Northeast Compact has \nresulted in an estimated 60 percent increase in milk powder production \nwhile national powder production increased only by 2 percent, and that \nthe USDA has expended $11 million in surplus production purchases\n\n[[Page S10166]]\n\nattributable to the regional production increase. In various statements \nagainst dairy compacts, opponents have cited the percentage increase in \nmilk powder production and purchase costs with approval.\n  Anyone who has worked in the area of dairy pricing and statistics \nknows of the hazards of attempting to quantify analysis of this most \ncomplex sector of our economy. The above analysis proves the point. It \nis certainly true that milk powder production in the northeast \nincreased during the first six months of operation of the Northeast \nCompact at a rate above the national average. Yet the reasons are not \nas simple--only because of operation of the Northeast Compact--as \nopponents of dairy compacts would have us believe. First, one of the \nlargest cheese processing plants in the region shut down during this \ntime, and the raw milk supply had to be converted from cheese to powder \nproduction. On the other side of the equation, national production \nduring this period was quite depressed, despite the apparent two \npercent increase, because of a dramatic downturn in California and \nsouthwest production. Hence the otherwise seeming disparities in rates \nof production.\n  Furthermore, the claim that USDA spend $11 million in surplus \npurchases attributable to the Northeast Compact's operation is \nblatantly misleading. In fact, $1.7 million in such reimbursement was \nprovided--nowhere near the $11 million amount claimed by the \nopposition. In addition, whether the $1.7 million represents purchases \nwhich more reflect the increase in powder production attributable to \nthe shut down of the cheese plant, and other factors, remains an open \nquestion of economic analysis, despite the reimbursement provided also \nby the Compact Commission.\n  Opponents further cite with approval the claim of IDFA that operation \nof the Northeast Compact will cost taxpayers an estimated $400 million \nannually. This claim is made without basis or analysis and must not be \nrelied upon at all. Simply put, CBO gave the Northeast Compact a zero \nsource, which is a long, long, way from $400 million.\n  I feel I should take some time to explain just how the Compact \noperates. The Northeast Dairy Compact Commission has the authority to \nregulate Class 1 (or fluid) milk prices. The commission, which consists \nof consumer, processor and farmer representatives appointed by each \nstate's governor, determines both the price necessary to yield a \nreasonable return to producers and distributors as well as the \npurchasing power of the public through a formal rule making procedure. \nAny regulation is subject to a two-thirds vote by a state delegation as \nwell as a producer referendum.\n  All milk consumed in compact-affected areas is uniformly regulated. \nThis provision ensures an equal benefit to New York or California \nfarmers who supply milk to the compact states. The Compact Commission's \nprice regulation works in conjunction with the federal government's \npricing program, which establishes minimum prices paid by processors \nand received by dairy farmers for raw milk produced on farms.\n  The Compact regulation raises these minimum prices as they relate to \nthe market for fluid, or bottled milk. Part of the difference between \nthe Compact's minimum price and the federal minimum price is set aside \nto compensate any cost that may be associated to the WIC programs and \nschool lunch programs.\n  Processors purchasing milk to produce other dairy products such as \ncheese or ice cream are not subject to the Compact's pricing \nregulations, although all farmers producing milk in the region, for any \npurpose, share equally in the regulation's benefits.\n  Here is how it works. The Commission established $16.94 per \nhundredweight as the Compact over-order price for Class 1 milk. All \nmilk processors having sales of fluid milk in New England are required \nto pay a monthly over-order obligation. This obligation is the \ndifference between $16.94 and the price established monthly by federal \nregulation for the same milk.\n\n  For instance, if the federal price for Class 1 milk was $13.94 for a \nparticular month, the processors' over-order obligation for that month \nwould be $16.94 minus $13.94--or $3.00. Processors multiply their total \nfluid milk sales by this amount and that is what they pay into the \nCompact Commission.\n  Three percent of the pooled price regulation proceeds are then set \naside to hold harmless the impact on New England WIC programs. At least \n4 cents but no more than 5 cents is deducted from the pooled proceeds \neach month and placed in a reserve fund established in the event of \nlate payments by handlers.\n  Approximately half of the unobligated balance of this fund is added \nback into the pool for redistribution in the following month in order \nto prevent the reserve fund from growing too large.\n  Farmers receive the balance of the proceeds in accordance with the \nClass 1 utilization rate--the percentage of milk produced that actually \ngoes towards drinking milk, not cheese or other manufactured products. \nTherefore, the producer price is derived by dividing the balance of the \npool proceeds by the total number of pounds of all producer milk in the \nregion.\n  The Compact Commission makes disbursements to farmer cooperatives and \nmilk handlers, who then make the individual payments to farmers based \non their production.\n  When the Compact regulation first took effect in July of 1997, the \nCompact over-order obligation was $3.00. During that month, 245,001,960 \npounds of milk, or 46.14% of the total milk in the region was sold as \nClass 1 milk. This resulted in a pool paid into the Commission of \n$7,350,058.80. After the WIC and reserve fund adjustments were made, \nthe balance of the pool proceeds was $6,903,009.44. When this number \nwas divided by the total number of pounds of all producer milk, in this \ncase 531,000,726 pounds, the resulting producer price was $1.30.\n  For many farmers in Vermont and New England, the Compact payments \nhave meant the difference between keeping the farm and calling the \nauctioneer.\n  Federal dairy policy is difficult to explain at best. As a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, I served as the ranking member of the \nDairy and Livestock Subcommittee. During my years in the House, I \nworked very closely with the programs that impacted dairy farmers and \nconsumers. Of all the programs and efforts by the federal government to \nhelp our nation's dairy farmers, the most effective and promising \nsolution have seen thus far is the creation and operation of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact.\n  I would like to address the actual and potential impact of dairy \ncompacts on consumer prices. In short, opposition claims about the \nactual and possible impact of dairy compacts on consumers, including \nlow income consumers, are unfounded and grossly distorted.\n  While farm milk prices have fluctuated wildly, remaining constant \noverall during the last ten years, consumers prices have risen sharply. \nThe explanation for this is apparently that variations in store prices \ndo not mirror the wild fluctuations in farm prices.\n  In other words, when farm prices go up, the store prices go up, but \nwhen the farm prices recede, the store prices do not come back down as \nquickly or at the same rate. Hence, and quite logically, if you take \naway the fluctuations in farm prices, you take away the catalyst for \nunwarranted increases in store prices.\n  Let's take a look at what the retail price has done in the Compact \nregion compared to other areas that do not have Compacts in place. This \ndemonstrates several extremely important points that dispute the claims \nthat the compact hits consumers with higher retail prices compared to \nother regions. The average price per gallon of milk in Boston remained \nsteady at $2.89 for February, March and April of 1999 in the Compact \nareas. Meanwhile retail prices across the country widely fluctuated and \nwere most often higher than in the Compact area of New England.\n  Again, I would like to make it very clear that the Compact only \nregulates fluid milk used for drinking, called Class I milk. Although \nnot shown on this chart, milk prices in suburban areas of New England \ncan often be found for $2.00 or less per gallon. Generally, the shelf \nprice of milk has increased proportionally to increases in producer \nprices, yet, has not decreased\n\n[[Page S10167]]\n\nat the same rate when farm prices have dropped. The result has been an \nupward price ratcheting in the retail milk price--a rise of about 30 \npercent between 1985 and 1993 while the farm price actually fell.\n  Even with the Northeast Dairy Compact, New England retail milk prices \nare among the lowest in the country!\n  Contrary to the claims of the opposition, regional compact regulation \nremain open to the interstate commerce of all producer milk and \nprocessor milk products, from whatever source. Compacts establish \nneither ``cartels'', ``tariffs'' nor ``barriers to trade'' and are not \neconomic ``protectionism.''\n  According to the opponents characterizations, dairy compacts somehow \nestablish a ``wall'' around the regions subject to compact regulation, \nand thereby prohibit competition from milk produced and processed from \noutside the regions.\n  These are entirely misleading characterizations. It is really quite \nsimple and straightforward: All fluid, or beverage milk sold in a \ncompact region is subject to uniform regulation, regardless of its \nsource within or outside the compact region. This means that all \nfarmers, including farmers from the Upper Midwest, providing milk for \nbeverage sale in the region, receive the same pay prices without \ndiscrimination.\n  Despite what some of my colleagues have said, the Northeast Dairy \nCompact is working as it was intended to. Instead of trying to destroy \nan initiative that works to help dairy farmers with cost to the federal \ngovernment, I urge my colleagues from the Upper Midwest to respect the \nstates' interest and initiative to help protect their farmers and \nencourage that region of the country to explore the possibility of \nforming your own interstate dairy compact.\n\n  When the June 1999 Compact payments were paid, the Compact will have \nreturned an average of 51 cents per hundredweight of milk to farmers \nover the past two years of operation. The average Vermont family farm \nrealized an additional $13,000 net income during the life of the \nCompact. For seven of those months no payments were made because market \nprices were above the Compact floor.\n  In April of this year, farmers felt the effect of a record $6.00 per \nhundredweight drop in the Basic Formula Price. In New England, blend \nprices dropped an unprecedented $3.93 per hundredweight from the \nprevious month, but the Compact payment of $1.43 made up nearly half of \nthe loss for Northeast farmers.\n  We would like every region of the country to have the same \nopportunity to provide stability for their farmers and consumers that \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact provides for our region.\n  Earlier today, when we were debating the cloture vote on the dairy \namendment, I responded to my colleague from Minnesota statement that \nthe dairy compact somehow lowered his farmer's price of milk. I would \nagain, refer to the USDA mailbox price. The mailbox price is the net \nprice that dairy farmers receive for the milk that is marketed under \nthe Federal milk marketing program.\n  The average prices shows on this chart include all payments received \nfor milk sold and deducts all costs associated with marketing milk. As \nyou can see, in 1998 New England received $14.89 per hundredweight, ten \ncents below the national average.\n  Most importantly, despite claims that the Northeast Dairy Compact \nmeans smaller checks for Midwest farmers, they received $15.27 per \nhundredweight, twenty-eight cents above the national average, and \nthirty-eight more cents per hundredweight than New England producers.\n  The amendment also mandates that the Secretary use Option 1-A as the \npricing formula for fluid milk. As I discussed earlier today, the \nSecretary's rule, known as 1B, is sue to be implemented on October 1, \nunless congressional action is taken.\n  Sixty-one Senators and more than 240 House members signed letters to \nSecretary Glickman last year supporting the pricing option known as \nOption A-1, for the pricing of fluid milk. The majority of the country \nand dairy industry support Option 1-A.\n  Most all areas of the country are better off under Option 1-A, \nincluding the Upper Midwest. Option 1-A is based on solid economic \nanalysis, benefiting both farmers and consumers. It takes into account; \ntransportation costs for moving fluid milk; regional supply and demand \nneeds; costs of producing and marketing milk; and the need to attract \nmilk to regions that occasionally face production deficits.\n  Finally, the amendment requires the Secretary of Agriculture to hold \nformal hearings to determine how the Class II, and Class IV price will \nbe calculated. There is concern that the Secretary's final rule will \ndrop the price paid for cheese by as much as $.40 per hundredweight. \nThe amendment would give both producers and processors the opportunity \nto have input on the formula through the formal rule making process.\n  This amendment is about helping farmers and protecting consumers. \nFarmers deserve our support and recognition. It is sometimes easy to \nforget just how fortunate we are in this country to have the world's \ncheapest and safest food supply.\n  I listened with great interest to the sugar debate earlier today. I \nsupport this Federal no-cost that provides stability to farmers and \nconsumers in sugar growing states. I don't have sugar growers in \nVermont. I have dairy farmers. But that does not mean I should not \nsupport a commodity program that helps protect farmers in other states \nwith no cost to the federal government.\n  I noticed that during the debate several of my colleagues that argued \nso pationately about protecting the sugar program, did not support my \nefforts to protect the dairy program. Agriculture, nationwide needs our \ncollective help. Let's not divide agriculture, but join together to \nprotect our nation's most important resources.\n  I am certain that my colleagues will agree with me that dairy farmers \ndeserve a fair price for their products. What does it say about our \nvalues when some of the hardest working people, our farmers, are \nunderpaid and unappreciated? In the last couple of days we have debated \nproviding billions of dollars in assistance to farmers who face the \ncurrent disasters. This amendment would help prevent a disaster for \nAmerica's dairy farmers by giving the states and the dairy farmers the \ntools to face the challenges of improving and stabilizing farm prices.\n  In Vermont, dairy farmers help define the character of the state. I \nam proud to work to protect them and to protect the traditions and \nspecial qualities of the state.\n  I realize that this amendment is not in order at this time, however, \nI urge my colleagues to give great consideration to the importance of \nthis amendment and the need to address these important issues as soon \nas possible. Supporting this amendment respect the interstate \ncooperation among states, protects the interests of consumers, and \nsupports America's dairy farmers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two ``Dear Colleague'' letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1999.\n\n  Setting the Record Straight: Dairy Compacts and Interstate Commerce\n\n       Dear Colleague: We would like to set the record straight \n     regarding the relationship between dairy compacts and \n     interstate commerce. Contrary to the claims of the \n     opposition, regional milk markets subject to dairy compact \n     regulation remain open to the interstate commerce of all \n     producer milk and processor milk products, from whatever \n     source. Compacts establish neither ``cartels,'' ``tariffs'' \n     nor ``barriers to trade'' and are not ``economic \n     protectionism.''\n       Opponents of dairy compacts, most particularly the \n     International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) have variously \n     claimed that dairy compacts operate to the benefit of dairy \n     farmers and processors within the compact regions and to the \n     detriment of those outside the compact regions. According to \n     the opponent's characterizations, dairy compacts somehow \n     establish a ``wall'' around the regions subject to compact \n     regulation, and thereby prohibit competition from milk \n     produced and processed from outside the regions.\n       These are entirely misleading characterizations. Yet \n     despite all these misleading descriptions, the regulatory \n     theory of compacts is really quite simple and \n     straightforward: All fluid, or beverage milk sold in a \n     compact region is subject to uniform regulation, regardless \n     of its source within or outside the compact region. This \n     means that all farmers, including farmers from the Upper \n     Midwest, providing milk for beverage sale in the region, \n     receive the same pay prices under\n\n[[Page S10168]]\n\n     the regulation without discrimination. Similarly, all \n     processors with sales in the region must pay the same price \n     for raw milk used for those sales, regardless of the location \n     of the processing facility or the location of the farm \n     sources of their raw milk supplies.\n       Hence, there is no ``economic protectionism'' or the \n     erection of barriers to trade. except for the uniform \n     regulation, the market remains open to all, and the benefits \n     of the regulations are provided without discrimination to all \n     participating in the market, including those who participate \n     in the market from beyond the territorial boundaries of the \n     region.\n       We hope you will conclude as have 40 of our colleagues that \n     dairy compacts provide fair and equitable milk market \n     regulation, that promotes the interests of the regions which \n     have proposed the compacts without discrimination against \n     farmers or processors from other regions.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Jeffords.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Ted Kennedy.\n     Charles Schumer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 1999.\n\n Setting the Record Straight: The Impact of Dairy Compacts on Consumer \n                                 Prices\n\n       Dear Colleague. Over the past number of months, the milk \n     processors lobby has bombarded Congress with disinformation \n     about the impact of dairy compacts on consumer prices. \n     Consistent with the time-honored tradition of industry \n     lobbyists working to defeat legislation contrary to their \n     vested interest, this storm of paper is only intended to \n     confuse the issues involved so as to convince you to oppose \n     the dairy compact legislation, regardless of the actual \n     facts.\n       Twenty-five states have formally presented these compacts \n     for review and approval. Congress must respond by debating \n     the issues presented on the merits. This is especially true \n     with regard to the critical question of the impact of dairy \n     compacts on consumers. On this issue, the opponent's claims \n     are particularly distorted and unfounded.\n       Can we truly believe that twenty-five governors and the \n     host of state legislative committees and deliberative bodies \n     which have approved these compacts would have approved them \n     if they were likely to have the horrific impact on consumers \n     proclaimed by the opposition?\n       The opponents claim that the Northeast Compact has caused \n     milk prices to rise ``15 to 20'' cents per gallon. They also \n     claim that in its first year, the Northeast Compact cost New \n     England consumers $65 million in higher milk prices, and that \n     with the creation of a southern compact, consumers would pay \n     $600 million a year in higher milk prices. These claims are \n     nothing but the grossest of scare tactics.\n       The opponents base their analysis on the OMB study which \n     reviewed the economic impacts of the Northeast Compact during \n     its first six months of operation. In fact, the OMB study \n     concluded that the potential impact of the Northeast Compact \n     on prices might be as low as approximately five cents a \n     gallon. In any event, OMB carefully prefaced its assessment \n     by stating that no reliable conclusions could be drawn based \n     upon a limited data set of six months.\n       Perhaps more to the point, the design of the dairy compacts \n     and the actual operation of the Northeast Compact Commission \n     should assure Congress that the interests of low income \n     consumers are adequately protected. Each state delegation to \n     the commissions created by dairy compacts must include a \n     consumer representative. This assures that consumers have a \n     voice in pricing decisions, and means that they will \n     certainly have more of a voice than they now have in today's \n     highly concentrated marketplace.\n       Moreover, the Northeast Compact Commission has acted to \n     provide for reimbursement of the state WIC programs of even \n     potential adverse impacts, regardless of actual impact, and \n     for reimbursement to the School Lunch programs for any \n     documented adverse impact. In design and actual practice, \n     then, dairy compacts work to protect rather than harm \n     consumers, particularly low income consumers.\n       We hope you will side with the states' actual judgement \n     that these compacts are in the public interest, and choose to \n     support this vital legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jesse Helms, Max Cleland, Daniel Moynihan, Mary L. \n           Landrieu, Patrick Leahy, Jim Jeffords, Olympia Snowe, \n           Charles Schumer, Arlen Specter.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 1484 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1513 To Amendment No. 1499\n\n               (Purpose: To make a perfecting amendment)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nit be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1513 to amendment No. 1499.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment relating to economic \nand disaster assistance. This is the amendment that the Senate voted \nagainst tabling when a motion to table the amendment was made by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle.\n  A vote has already been taken on a motion to table this amendment, \nbut it was then, under leadership agreement on how to proceed to this \nbill, withdrawn.\n  This action that has just been taken puts this amendment back before \nthe Senate. There was an amendment offered by the Democratic leader and \nthe Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, which was also the subject of a \nmotion to table. That motion to table was agreed to.\n  Before the Senate now is the issue of economic and disaster \nassistance for farmers in the form of the so-called Cochran amendment.\n  To refresh the memory of Senators, this is an amendment that seeks to \ngive the Secretary of Agriculture authority and funds with which to \ndeal with the economic crisis that exists in production agriculture \ntoday. This is funding for the fiscal year that begins next October 1, \nso it is not an endeavor to deal with all of the existing problems in \nagriculture in the current fiscal year, but it is an effort to deal \nwith economic problems during the harvesting and marketing of the 1999 \ncrop throughout the country.\n  There is already in place a $6 billion disaster program that was \napproved last year that has been administered by the Department. Some \nof those checks for weather-related disasters went out to farmers as \nrecently as June. We are hopeful if any additional funds are needed for \nthis crop-year, the President will submit a budget request asking for \nadditional funds.\n  There has been some discussion during the debate on the floor that \nthere is nothing in this amendment that provides immediate assistance \nfor drought victims and the like. The point is, in a recent \nsupplemental that we had on funding the military action in Kosovo, that \nsubject was raised and an amendment was offered, which was rejected, \nthat would provide additional disaster assistance funds in this crop-\nyear and in the next crop-year as well. What we did was adopt the \nsense-of-the-Senate language that would ask the President to submit a \nsupplemental request if additional funds were needed over and above \nthat amount that had already been provided by the Congress. No request \nhas been made.\n  A letter was written to the President in June, signed by 22 Senators, \nreiterating the fact that we approved language requesting a \nsupplemental request if one was needed and that nothing had been heard. \nWe did get an acknowledgment to the letter, but we have had no \nsubsequent request.\n  The chairman of the Agriculture Committee, the Senator from Indiana, \nMr. Lugar, has been having hearings in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, yesterday and again today, getting information, getting \nexpert advice and testimony on the condition of agriculture in America \ntoday to determine what level of assistance is appropriate, what level \nis needed, and what kind and character should this assistance take. We \nhave had a long debate. Senators on both sides have expressed their \nviews on this subject, and we are at a point now where we have to \neither adopt an amendment or not adopt an amendment providing disaster \nassistance.\n  It seems to me it would be appropriate now, after hearing all the \nevidence, after reviewing all the arguments, to proceed with the \nadoption of this amendment and go to conference with the House and try \nto resolve whatever differences we may have on this issue with House \nconferees and then come back with a conference report for the \nconsideration of the Senate. If we do not have a provision for\n\n[[Page S10169]]\n\ndisaster or economic assistance in our bill, this will not be an item \nthat can be considered in conference. So I think it is very important \nfor the Senate to approve this amendment, giving us a conference \nvehicle for further consideration of this issue with the House. If we \ndo not approve this amendment or some other amendment that could be \noffered, then we will not have a vehicle.\n  We have already expressed our views as a body on the Daschle-Harkin \nproposal. It was rejected. This amendment was not rejected. The motion \nto table was not agreed to. So it is now back before the Senate for its \nconsideration.\n  I am going to review briefly what this legislation contains and urge \nSenators to approve the amendment. We can have a record vote on that if \nthe Senate desires or we can adopt it on a voice vote. It suits me to \nadopt it on a voice vote, but I am putting Senators on notice that is \nthe issue before the Senate now. If anyone wants to request a record \nvote, they are free, of course, to come to the Senate floor and do \nthat.\n  The bulk of the funds provided in this amendment--which now has a \ncost estimated by the Congressional Budget Office of almost $7 \nbillion--the bulk of the assistance is in the form of increased \npayments, so-called AMTA payments. That is the agricultural market \ntransition payments. These are payments that are made to commodity \nproducers under existing farm law, provided to help farmers make the \ntransition from a Government-controlled and mandated agricultural \nproduction system to a more open and free market system where farmers \ncan make their own decisions about what they plant on their crop \nacreage. In the past, the Government had tight controls over not only \nwhat crops could be subsidized by the Government, but how much acreage \ncould be planted with those crops. If you violated the rules, you lost \nyour right to Federal assistance.\n\n  Under the new program, Federal assistance is provided without regard \nto what crop you plant or how much of the acreage you use. There is no \nmandatory set-aside of acreage, telling farmers you cannot plant but so \nmuch of your acreage this year, as was the case under preexisting \nagricultural legislation. The amount of money that would be paid \ndirectly to farmers as authorized in this legislation would represent \n100 percent of the total of the 1999 producers AMTA payment. So in \neffect, by the passage of this amendment, we would double the amount of \nmoney that would go to farmers who are entitled to agriculture market \ntransition assistance payments. That comes to a total of $5.54 billion. \nThere is no redtape. There is no discretion in the Department of \nAgriculture. There is no special procedure for establishing \neligibility. If you are eligible under current law for a transition \npayment, you are eligible for this additional payment. The checks go \nout.\n  It was shown in the experience this year in administering the current \ndisaster assistance program that the AMTA payment system was the most \nefficient way of providing assistance to farmers who were entitled to \nadd additional benefits under an economic assistance program. So that \nis why in this amendment we have elected to use that vehicle to \ndisseminate funds for disaster and economic assistance to farmers \nbecause of this year's economic stress in agriculture. But not all \nfarmers are eligible for AMTA payments. Because they are not, most of \nthe rest of the funds in the bill are used for disaster assistance for \nthose farmers that they may need.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture is, for example, given discretion to \nestablish a program to provide assistance to livestock and dairy \nproducers. There is a livestock assistance program in place now which \nwas utilized to deliver disaster assistance provided last year. So, \nbecause of that experience, it seems logical that the Department of \nAgriculture will be able to provide regulatory guidance and eligibility \nstandards for those who suffered by reason of drought or other \nconditions that have adversely affected them if they are in the \nlivestock business. This applies to beef cattle production; it applies \nto hog production; and it applies to dairy.\n  So it is a program that is included in this legislation. Other \nspecialty crops are included as well--fruits and vegetables. Other \ncrops and other commodities that are grown by landowners who are \ninvolved in production agriculture are intended to be included in this \nprogram, and the Secretary of Agriculture is given the authority to use \nfunds appropriated in this amendment to provide assistance to those \nfarmers as well.\n  We do not try to pick and choose among farmers, whether you are \neligible or not eligible for benefits. The intent is we want all \nfarmers to benefit from this program under this amendment.\n  There is also, at the conclusion of our bill, a provision that states \nthe sense of the Congress with respect to a more aggressive policy with \nagricultural trade issues. There have been situations that have \ndeveloped around the world where our producers and exporters have been \nshut out of markets or have been discriminated against because of \ntariffs or other rules and regulations adopted by other countries or \ngroups of countries that have made it impossible for us to have access \nto markets that we have traditionally enjoyed or which we ought to by \nright have an opportunity to enjoy.\n  We are urging the administration to be more aggressive in \nstrengthening trade negotiating authority for American agriculture, and \nwe express Congress' objectives for future trade negotiations. We ask \nthe President to evaluate and make recommendations on the effectiveness \nof our existing export and food aid programs.\n  I think we have heard enough about what the facts are. Senators who \nhave been to their own States have had an opportunity to view the \nsituation, to talk with their farmers, and to understand the stress \nthat is confronting American agriculture today.\n  Here are some of the Department of Agriculture's own facts and \nestimates that had been given to our subcommittee when we had our \nhearings earlier this year: 1999 net cash farm income is expected to \ndecline $3.6 billion below last year's level. Incidentally, in 1998, \nnet farm income for wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, and rice was 17 \npercent below the previous 5-year average. For this crop-year, 1999, \nthe projections indicate that income for the same crops will be 27 \npercent below the previous 5-year average.\n  Those are the projections that persuade me that disaster and economic \nassistance is not only important for us to consider but is necessary \nfor us to deliver if we have the expectation of maintaining health and \nvitality in American agriculture.\n  I think the facts are clear and justify the amendment we are offering \ntoday to provide disaster assistance and economic assistance to \nagricultural producers for the 1999 crop-year. The bulk of the \nassistance is going to be made available in the most efficient way \npossible: through the disbursement of the market transition payments \nproviding a 100-percent bonus, in effect, to all who are eligible for \nthose payments.\n  Those who are soybean farmers or who grow other oilseeds will be \nentitled to benefits under a special program. They do not receive these \ntransition payments, but they will receive benefits under this \namendment. The same is true of livestock farmers, whether they are beef \ncattle, pork producers, or dairymen.\n  We think we have created a balanced program, one that is fair to all \nfarmers, one that will help put money in the pockets of farmers, not \njust give them a promise of loans or technical assistance or other \nadvice from the Government. Our amendment does not just add money to \nGovernment agencies; it does not just increase the size of Government \nagencies; it sends the money directly to the producers.\n  We have also agreed to add to this bill, at the request of other \nSenators, additional funds for crop insurance benefits. That was not \nincluded in the original amendment that was offered as a part of the \nCochran amendment, but it will be added to this amendment in the form \nof a modification. We have heard the persuasive arguments in support of \nthat suggestion, and we have agreed to accommodate those Senators who \nare interested in that additional benefit.\n  My hope is Senators will review the amendment as we are modifying the \namendment and will support it, and we can then move on to the final \nconclusion of this legislation.\n\n[[Page S10170]]\n\n  Mr. President, if there is no Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was prepared at this time to offer an \namendment, but I will not be offering an amendment because Senator \nCochran, Senator Kohl, and myself have worked out an agreement on an \namendment which will ultimately be part of the bill, and I will leave \nit to the chairman of the subcommittee to decide the best course to \nbring it into the bill. I am happy we have been able to work this out \nbecause I think it is a critically important issue and to which I want \nto take a few minutes to alert the membership.\n  I happened to read a few months ago an article in Forbes magazine \nwhich was an eye opener. It really disturbed me, and I asked my staff \nto take a look at it a little more closely. The article is entitled \n``Blood Money.'' It documented that many medical devices that were \napproved and manufactured for a single use had been cleaned and reused \non patients without any demonstration to the Food and Drug \nAdministration that the devices are, in fact, safe and fully functional \nafter this reprocessing.\n  When I tell you these devices, it may give you some pause to consider \nthe types of things that have been manufactured and labeled for a \nsingle use and are being reprocessed and used over and over again. Here \nare some of the most commonly recycled disposables: electrophysiology \ncatheters for heart catheterizations; sequential compression devices; \nbiopsy forceps; pulse--this is where my liberal arts education will \nfail me--oximeter sensors; laparoscopic instruments. Think of all the \nlaparoscopic procedures going on now. One of the things we find is that \nmany of the instruments that are being used have been labeled single \nuse and are being so-called cleaned and reprocessed and used again.\n  Continuing with some of the most commonly recycled disposables--\ndrills, bits, blades, catheters, and many other things.\n  At least a third of the hospitals ignore the manufacturer's warnings \nand recycle these so-called disposable products for their patients \nwithout telling their patients.\n  As you can see, we are not talking about bedpans here. We are talking \nabout highly invasive and high-risk devices, devices that come in \ncontact with the patient's blood or other bodily fluids. This reuse is \nhappening without the knowledge of patients and without a requirement \nthat the devices be shown to still be safe and effective after \nreprocessing.\n  Here in the United States we have a Food and Drug Administration \nwhich oversees the safety of drugs, medical devices, biologics, foods, \nand cosmetics. Let me say that I am one of the biggest fans in \nWashington of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Dr. Jane Henney, who is now the head of that agency, is an \nextraordinarily talented person. Though she and I have had some debates \non various issues, I am grateful that she has left the private practice \nof medicine to give these years of public service to the Food and Drug \nAdministration because this FDA literally inspects and approves \ndevices, instruments, prescription drugs--all sorts of things--that we \ntake for granted in our everyday life.\n  FDA approval is considered the gold standard all around the world. \nYet that gold standard is only being applied to devices when they first \ncome on the market. The FDA takes a look at these various devices as \nthey are being sold to determine whether or not they are safe and \neffective, as they should. With that approval, they are sold to \nhospitals around America.\n  But when it comes to the issue of reprocessing this disposable \ndevice, which is used a second, third, or fourth time, I am afraid the \nFDA has not been as effective as they should be. The Los Angeles Times \nran an article 2 days ago reporting a bacterial outbreak in a Colorado \nhospital due to contaminated reused cardiac catheters. One of the \npatients involved died because of that outbreak.\n  This chart makes reference to the Federal MEDWATCH program which is \nan effort to get a report from any hospital if it shows that a device \nhas resulted in some problem. One of the adverse event reports that was \nreported to FDA's MEDWATCH shows that the tip of a catheter that had \nbeen reused six times broke and lodged in a 32-year-old man's right \natrium--if you recall from biology, that is inside the heart--where it \nis still lodged today.\n  The Los Angeles Times article also talks about another incident where \na 4-inch-long tip traveled from a patient's heart to his stomach, \nleading to additional surgery in which the doctors opened the man's \nstomach in an attempt to remove it.\n  I find this shocking. You or I could be admitted to a hospital \ntomorrow, and without our knowledge we could be exposed to a device of \ncompletely unknown standard.\n  I have here some charts that depict some reused devices that were \nretrieved from hospitals in exchange for new devices. They show that \nmany of the devices had either remaining blood or tissue on them or \nwere damaged, so they could not have met the standards FDA had for \noriginal manufacturers.\n  This is an example of a cutting device. It shows, unfortunately, that \nit was still contaminated when it was removed from the hospital.\n  There are other photographs as well, each one raising a question as \nto whether or not these devices, when used, were sufficiently cleaned \nor up to the job that they were called to do. We have several other \nphotographs. I think they all demonstrate that.\n  The amendment which I have offered, and which has been accepted by \nboth the majority and minority, is supported by various consumer \ngroups--Public Citizen, the Consumer Federation of America, and the \nConsumers Union--and patient groups such as AIDS Action, the \nAlzheimer's Association, the National Organization for Rare Diseases, \nthe National Women's Health Network, and by health professionals, such \nas the American Nurses Association, that say we should reserve a very \nsmall amount of FDA's medical device money--in this case $1 million --\nout of the $154 million allocated for medical and radiological devices \nto provide oversight for these reused medical devices.\n  One has to wonder why we spend any money on device safety if the \ndevice only has to be safe when it is used initially. In the case of \nthe catheter that is now lodged in a patient's heart, it was reused six \ntimes. This was supposed to have been used once.\n  When you go in for heart surgery or these diagnostic treatments, it \nnever crosses your mind to ask the doctor: Incidentally, will all the \ndevices you are going to use in the course of my treatmment be used for \nthe first time only? Has someone else used this catheter before? Has it \nbeen reprocessed? Is it being reused?\n  That never dawns on the patient, but in fact we find a third of the \nhospitals are reusing these devices. That is why I think this amendment \nis so necessary.\n\n  I think we can do a lot better. In fact, I believe we can go a lot \nfurther than my amendment goes. I will be introducing a bill shortly \nthat will completely overhaul this system to provide patients with \nassurance that all medical devices used on them are of a high standard \nand that we can accurately track injuries and infections due to \nreprocessed devices.\n  My amendment attempts to take a small step to encourage the FDA to \nprovide necessary oversight of reprocessed devices. America uses the \nFDA to make sure that products, including medical devices, are safe. It \ndoes not make sense to have safety equipment for devices when they are \nbrand new but to turn a blind eye thereafter. All medical devices \nshould be required to be safe.\n  I might add, in closing, that at a recent hearing before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I asked Dr. Henney about the efforts \nbeing made by the Food and Drug Administration to deal with this \nproblem. She referred me to Dr. Jacobson. Dr. Jacobson is currently the \nacting director of the Center for Devices. He acknowledged my question \nabout reusing medical devices was a difficult one. He also acknowledged \nthat the FDA is in the process of establishing standards and procedures \nto\n\n[[Page S10171]]\n\nmake sure that these reused devices are safe. I am heartened that, when \nbrought to his attention, the FDA was responsive. Frankly, I think we \nneed a lot more. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair for the time. I also extend my thanks to Senator \nCochran of Mississippi and Senator Kohl of Wisconsin for agreeing to \nthis amendment which will be made part of the bill, so that $1 million \nin the Food and Drug Administration is going to be directed toward the \nefforts to clean up the reuse of these medical devices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In an effort to reduce costs under managed care, more \nthan a third of all hospitals across the country are now reusing \nmedical devices that are labeled by the original manufacturer as \n``disposable'' or ``for single-use only.'' More than a million devices \na year are being reprocessed and then used on patients without their \nknowledge, in violation of the original manufacturer's recommendation \nor warning, and without a determination by the FDA that these devices \nare safe and effective.\n  To protect patient safety, FDA requires that before a medical device \nmanufacturer can begin selling a single-use device as reusable by \nadditional patients, the manufacturer must file the appropriate \npremarket notification to prove the safety and efficacy of the reused \ndevice.\n  But this requirement only applies to original equipment \nmanufacturers, and not to hospitals, other providers, or third party \nreprocessors. When hospitals, or third-party reprocessors, prepare a \n``single-use only'' device for use again in another patient, they do \nnot supply the FDA with any information on the safety and efficacy of \nthe device and they do not notify the FDA of their intent to remarket \nthe used device.\n  The FDA does require third-party reprocessors to register with the \nAgency and to conform to the ``Good Manufacturing Practices'' required \nof device manufacturers. The larger reprocessors are registered with \nthe FDA and may be inspected for compliance. But there are numerous \nsmaller reprocessors that do not register with FDA, and hospitals that \nreprocess in-house do not register either.\n  Even when registration takes place, is not a form of approval. \nCompliance with Good Manufacturing Practices does not assure that the \nreprocessing results in a safe and effective device. The reprocessing \nindustry is, for the most part, unregulated.\n  Some of the disposable devices that are reprocessed and reused are \nhighly invasive and are contaminated with blood and tissue during use. \nA few examples include:\n  Balloon angioplasty catheters for dilating coronary arteries;\n  Electrophysiology catheters for cardiac testing;\n  Biopsy forceps and biopsy needles for removing tissues and cells;\n  Laparoscopic instruments for surgical procedures.\n  Inadequate cleaning and sterilization of these devices prior to reuse \ncan lead to cross-contamination of patients and hospital staff.\n  Single-use devices are often made from heat sensitive plastics, and \nhave intricate, inaccessible parts which can be difficult, if not \nimpossible, to clean. They often contain long narrow tubing, acute \nangles, crevices, coils, joints, and porous surfaces where contaminants \ncan collect. The potential is high for contamination by blood, \nrespiratory secretions, gastric secretions, and fecal matter.\n\n  Cleaning and resterilizing can also threaten the operation of a used \nsingle-use device. Physical, mechanical or electrical properties can be \naltered when the device is subject to harsh chemicals, high \ntemperatures, pressure, gases, and physical removal of debris. Proper \nuse of the device in the initial patient may also alter the performance \nof the device.\n  Reprocessors say that they test these devices. But any testing is \ndone without the benefit of the data and other proprietary information \nin the original manufacturer's Premarket Notification to the FDA.\n  The FDA has conducted studies on balloon angioplasty catheters. These \ndevices are threaded from an artery in the leg into the heart, and then \ninflated to open the coronary arteries. The studies concluded that many \nof the narrow spaces in these catheters were contaminated with blood, \nand that the balloons no longer inflated properly.\n  Studies by FDA on reprocessed electrophysiology catheters have found \ndebris accumulated at the edges of the electrodes. These devices are \nalso threaded into the heart, and measure electrical activity to locate \nabnormal heart tissue and burn it away.\n  FDA concluded that the determination as to which devices can be \nsafely reused must be made on a model-by-model basis, and should not be \nmade for an entire class or type of device.\n  Other independent studies on biopsy forceps used to collect samples \nfrom the colon and digestive tract showed that over 80% were \ncontaminated with blood, tissue, or fecal matter. The devices in this \nstudy were taken from hospital shelves where they were waiting for \nreuse on future patients.\n  Injuries and product failures have also been associated with reused \ndisposable devices. In January of this year, metal from an \nelectrophysiology catheter electrode fell off and lodged in the heart \nof a 32-year-old woman in Kansas. The device had been reprocessed six \ntimes.\n  In another case, a reprocessed catheter partially separated, and the \ntip was retained only by a small piece of wire. In this case, \nfortunately, the patient was not injured, but the potential for serious \ninjury was great.\n  The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 gave FDA the authority to \nexercise pre-market control over medical devices for the first time. \nThe Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 required hospitals and other \nfacilities that use medical devices to report adverse events to FDA. A \nbox on the MedWatch adverse event form asks if the device was being \nused for the first time or was reused.\n  Additional information is needed on how many times a device has been \nreused and the name of the reprocessor, so that the Agency can identify \nsigns or trends of problems with the reuse of a particular class or \nmodel of device, or with a particular reprocessor or process.\n  The amendment we offer today will help ensure the safety and \neffectiveness of reprocessed medical devices.\n  I commend the FDA for its continuing efforts to improve the premarket \nreview program. This effort has resulted in reduced review times of \nPremarket Notifications, so that in 1997 and 1998, FDA had no backlog \nof these marketing applications.\n  FDA should now move forward and require medical device reprocessors \nto demonstrate that reprocessed devices are safe and effective for use.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this is the modification that I \nmentioned in my remarks, when I sent the Cochran amendment to the desk, \nthat we were making to add $400 million for the Crop Insurance Program \nto the Cochran amendment. There are other technical changes, but that \nis the substantive change that is made by this modification, for the \ninformation of Senators.\n  We are also hopeful, after talking with the distinguished Democratic \nleader, that it is possible we will be able to move to a vote on the \nCochran amendment--the details of that are being discussed now with \nleaders on both sides and interested Senators --and then consider any \nother amendments that may be offered on this subject--we know of two \nsuggested major amendments that may still be presented to the Senate \nfor its consideration--to have votes on those or on motions to table \nthose amendments, and then move on to consideration of other amendments \nwhich have been suggested by Senators.\n  We have a list of amendments the managers have agreed to accept. \nThere are a few that we know of that Senators have indicated an \ninterest in offering which we are not able to accept, but we hope that \nif there are Senators who have amendments they intend to offer, they \nwill let us know about this. We have asked each Cloakroom to try to \nfind out what we can expect in the way of additional amendments because \nwe would like to conclude action on this bill this afternoon or early \nthis evening. We think that is certainly possible under the arrangement \nthat has just been discussed with the managers by the Democratic \nleader.\n  We appreciate the cooperation of all Senators.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my hope is that we are able to find a \nway this afternoon to adequately deal with this question of disaster \nrelief. I know Senator Cochran has just reoffered and now modified the \nproposal he made previously. We had a tabling vote on that proposal and \nthe tabling vote did not prevail. So we know at least somewhat where \nthe votes are on the Cochran proposal.\n  He has modified it, as I understand, to include $400 million with \nrespect to crop insurance. My hope is that we can move beyond this \nproposal, which I think is short on what is necessary, to a couple of \nadditional proposals that we may be able to agree to with respect to \nprocedure at least.\n  This proposal that is now before the Senate does not provide \nassistance for disaster relief. We now see, in every television and \nradio newscast that we turn to or refer to on the front pages of the \npapers, the worst drought in this century in some parts of our country. \nWe know disaster relief is going to be necessary because of this \ndrought. We ought to begin to get a start on that in any emergency \npackage we pass dealing with family farmers.\n  There are a number of other things that are left out of the proposal \nthat has just been offered. My hope is that we can, in the next couple \nof hours, improve this package to the point where most of us believe it \ndoes what we believe it should do for family farmers.\n  I want to mention, again, we are not on the floor dealing with an \nagricultural disaster or agricultural crisis issue because of something \nfarmers have done. It is not their fault the Asian economies have \ncollapsed. It is not the farmers' fault in my State that they have \nsuffered the worst crop disease of the century. It is not their fault \nwe have 3 million acres that couldn't be planted this spring because of \nwet conditions. Incidentally, that would not be dealt with in the \nCochran proposal, flooded lands and so on. This is not the fault of \nfamily farmers.\n  We have faced a very serious problem at this point. There is a \nresponsibility for the Congress to help. This is the appropriate place \nto do that. This is the Agriculture appropriations bill. We have been \ndiscussing this now for a number of months. The collapse in the grain \nand commodities and livestock markets have been spectacular and have \nbeen noticed by everyone who cares about the farm economy and family \nfarmers. This is not a surprise to anyone that we are dealing with this \nquestion now.\n  While there may be disagreements on the floor of the Senate about \nexactly how to do it, I think in the end, when we finish this \nafternoon, we should have been able to pass a piece of legislation \ndealing with the farm crisis that provides opportunity and hope to \nfamily farmers. If we just kick it around a bit and just tune it up a \nlittle bit so that it looks better or sounds better or appears better \nbut doesn't provide the kind of help necessary for family farmers, this \nhas all been wasted effort. If we are not able to provide a reasonable \nsafety net and/or during tough times some emergency help that gives \nfamily farmers a chance to get from here to there, that gives them a \nchance to feel that there is some hope for the ability to continue \nfarming, then we haven't accomplished anything at all.\n  The test, then, this afternoon is not whether we pass the proposal \nbefore us. That proposal is insufficient. It doesn't meet the needs. \nThe test is whether we can pass one of a couple other proposals that we \nwill, I hope, shortly make in order by consent that will be debated \nunder short time considerations and then will be voted upon.\n  Those of us from farm country understand every day the dichotomy \nabout this economy of ours. We hear about all of the wonderful things \nin the American economy. Yet in farm country, we see a near total \ncollapse of rural communities, rural counties, and the economies of \nfamily farming. We understand this Congress cannot say it doesn't \nmatter. It does matter in this country.\n\n  I am not going to revisit all the history of the current farm bill, \nbut the philosophy of the current farm bill is that family farmers in \nthis country shall be transitioned out of the farm program. Farm \nprograms shall cease to exist at some point and the transition payments \nshall allow farmers to get from here to no farm program.\n  The folly of that is to believe that family-sized farms out there by \nthemselves, trying to float in this sea of uncertainty, with all of the \npotential adverse effects of weather and grain markets and all of the \nother catastrophes that can befall a family farmer, that they can do \nthis by themselves. When grain markets collapse and grain prices fall \nto half, that doesn't matter because family farmers can manage that.\n  That is folly. They can't manage that. Family farmers will not make \nit. They won't make it across this price valley unless Congress extends \na helping hand. The helping hand ought to be an investment in this \ncountry, an investment in a disaster package that says family farmers \nmatter to this country in many different ways, and we want to try to \ngive them the capability and the hope that they can survive beyond this \nprice catastrophe.\n  I say again, as I close, the current amendment which is before the \nSenate is deficient in many ways. It falls far short of doing what is \nnecessary in the area of flooded lands, for example, and many other \nareas. It simply doesn't offer the kind of support we need in rural \nAmerica to respond to the current disaster and to respond to the \ncurrent crisis with respect to the collapse of farming commodity \nprices.\n  Most deficient is the fact that the underlying amendment doesn't \naddress the disaster issue at all that is now enveloping large parts of \nour country and devastating family farm producers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, after consultation with the Democratic \nleader and other Senators, my understanding of the procedure now that \nis agreed upon is that the Cochran amendment can now be adopted by \nvoice vote.\n  Then there will be two other amendments on the subject of disaster \nassistance that will be offered and voted on. The times for those votes \nhas not yet been agreed upon. But we can take the first step by \nadopting the Cochran amendment on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The amendment (No. 1513), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S10174]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am waiting for Senator Harkin. He should be here in a \nmoment. We intend to offer an amendment per the previous agreement.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1514 To Amendment No. 1499\n\n     (Purpose: To provide emergency and income loss assistance to \n                        agricultural producers)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk, an \namendment in the second degree, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senators Harkin, Daschle, \nKerrey, Johnson, Conrad, Baucus, Durbin, Wellstone, Lincoln and \nSarbanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Conrad, \n     Mr. Baucus, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Lincoln and Mr. \n     Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 1514 to amendment \n     No. 1499.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is we have a time agreement of 15 \nminutes on each side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield, I am happy to agree that this \namendment would have 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am advised that I need to do this. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time for debate prior to a motion to table the pending \namendment be limited to 30 minutes, to be equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in an attempt to try to find a solution to \nthe issue of providing relief during this farm crisis, I am offering an \namendment, in the second degree, on behalf of myself and Senator Harkin \nand other Members here on the Senate floor.\n  As Members of the Senate will recall, the proposal we offered \nyesterday was a proposal that called for $10.7 billion in crisis \nrelief. That $10.7 billion has been modified in this second-degree \namendment, and is $9.837 billion. We have reduced it nearly $1 billion \nby making adjustments in a range of accounts.\n  The accounts include emergency short-term land diversion, disaster \nreserve--a number of different programs that we have adjusted, that we \nhave thought it appropriate to adjust in order to try to find a \ncompromise that would cost less but still provide significant support \nand help to family farmers.\n  My colleague, Senator Harkin, and I have worked, along with Senator \nConrad and Senator Daschle, Senator Johnson of South Dakota, and \nothers, to see if there is some way we can provide for legislation that \nwill offer assistance at a level that is greater than that which now \nrests with the underlying amendment.\n  I had indicated previously that the amendment offered by Senator \nCochran does not deal with disaster issues. There isn't money for \ndisaster issues in that piece of legislation. There isn't money for \nflooded lands. There are a number of deficiencies in that amendment, \nand it simply does not reach the level that is necessary to address \nthis farm crisis.\n  So in an attempt to see if we can find some middle ground, in an \nattempt to offer an amendment that is almost $1 billion less than we \nhad offered previously, by making adjustments in about seven or eight \ncategories, we are trying to see if we can get a favorable vote on this \namendment.\n  This amendment, if it should fail, as I understand it, will be \nfollowed by one additional amendment.\n  But let me at this moment call on my colleague from Iowa who has \njoined me in offering this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield as much time as the Senator from Iowa consumes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I compliment and thank my \ncolleague from North Dakota for crafting this new proposal and for all \nof his hard work on behalf of farmers and ranchers all over this \ncountry. Senator Dorgan has, indeed, been a leader in this Senate in \nfocusing attention on the fact that so many of our farmers and ranchers \nare in dire straits, and that we need a substantial package of relief \nand help to get them through this winter and into next year.\n  What Senator Dorgan has now sent to the desk is, hopefully, a \nreaching out to our colleagues and friends on the Republican side to \njoin us in this effort. The proposal we had yesterday that I had \noffered was $10.7 billion. This is now $1 billion less. So we have come \ndown $1 billion. We have taken some money out of places which, quite \nfrankly, this Senator thinks is going to be hard to explain to some \nfarmers. But in order to try to reach an agreement with our colleagues \non the other side, for at least a meaningful package, Senator Dorgan \nand I and others have crafted this new package that is $1 billion less \nthan what we offered yesterday.\n  This may, indeed, be the Senate's last chance to vote on a meaningful \npackage of support for our farmers and ranchers.\n  Again, the amounts that are in this package are pretty close to the \nminimum of what we are going to need. I cannot, for the life of me, \nunderstand why we have the proposal again before us that, as I \nunderstand it, is about $400 million more than what it was yesterday.\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\n  I don't know, the Senator from Mississippi might correct me on that, \nbut I think it is about $400 million more. I think that includes crop \ninsurance.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  That is a step in the right direction to put that $400 million for \nthe Crop Insurance Program. That was in our initial proposal. I am \ndelighted to see it in this one.\n  But I must say the entire package is still not enough. Will it help? \nSure, it will help. Heck, $100 would help. I have farmers out in my \narea who would take $100. One thousand dollars would help. Yes; this \nwill help.\n  If I might analogize it a little bit, it is the kind of help that if \na person is out there drowning in deep water, and you throw him one of \nthose little life preservers, the drowning person grabs ahold of the \nlife preserver, only to find out there is a slow leak in it. It is \ngoing to keep that person alive for a while, give him a few more \nmoments of life on Earth. Then the air is going to go out.\n  That is sort of the way I see the Republican amendment before us now. \nIt will help. It will get some farmers through. It is going to leave a \nlot behind. I think it is going to hold out some false hopes. The last \nthing our farmers and ranchers need now is false hope. They need real \nhope that we are going to significantly address the problem.\n  Again, I point out that the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMississippi includes payments that go out to farmers all as agriculture \nmarketing transition adjustment payments, so-called AMTA payments. \nThese payments are based upon old-fashioned, outdated ag policies. What \nI mean by that is that the AMTA payments are based upon something known \nas base acres and proven yields. Base acres has gone out the window; we \ndon't have that any longer; and yet they reach back, years back, to \ntake base acres and proven yields in order to make the payments.\n  I want to forewarn my colleagues: You are going to see a lot of \nstories in the paper this fall and this winter about people getting \nthese payments who aren't even farming, aren't even raising a crop. But \nthey are going to get them because several years ago, 10 years ago, \nthey had some base acres and they had an established proven yield. They \nmay not even have that any longer, but they are going to get a payment. \nThey are going to get an AMTA payment.\n  Yet a young producer who may not even have been in business 10 years \nago, who started up in this decade, does not have base acres, does not \nhave proven yields, but they are out there struggling to get by, they \nare not going to get the same AMTA payment. They will get a modest LDP \nthis fall that is already in the bill, but this amendment offers no \nfurther relief under the loan deficiency payments.\n  To be sure, I understand that Senator Cochran's amendment has a $500 \nmillion payment to soybeans and oilseeds. Again, that is helpful. But \nunder our LDP program the payments to soybean producers would be in the \nneighborhood of about $1 billion, not $500 million. They deserve some \nhelp also. I shouldn't just say soybeans. I mean all oilseeds, whether \nit is safflower or canola oilseeds, would also get more under the LDP \npayment than they would under the AMTA payment.\n  That is why I believe the Cochran amendment is still insufficient and \nwhy I believe the amendment sent forward by the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan, again may be our last best hope to get meaningful \nhelp to all the farmers--all of them, not just a few.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding the time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will reserve the remainder of my time in the event the \nmanager wishes to speak at this point.\n  Mr. President, if Senator Cochran does not have a speaker, let me \nthen finish by saying that while I think the proposal that was offered \ntoday is improved by Senator Cochran--adding the $400 million for crop \ninsurance improves it--as we indicated yesterday, it is not sufficient. \nIt does not provide help for disaster.\n  It provides payments directly to farmers using AMTA. AMTA might sound \nlike a foreign language to some people, but AMTA is a mechanism by \nwhich payments are made to people based on a 1991-1995 crop history, \nand we will have payments going to people who aren't producing \nanything. All of a sudden, they will open their mailbox and get a \ncheck. We will have payments made to people who aren't in trouble at \nall because AMTA is disconnected from any relationship to production.\n  We have proposed that the payments go with respect to a loan \ndeficiency payment that relates to production, relates to people who \nare not able to receive the adequate price they need for their \ncommodity. It tries to say let us use scarce public money here, Federal \ntax dollars, where they might be invested and do the most good.\n  It doesn't make much sense to throw a 5-foot rope to somebody \ndrowning in 30 feet of water. One can say thanks for the rope, but it \ndidn't save anybody. What we need to do at the end of today is to have \nsaid: Well, we have done something to try to address the farm crisis, \ncollapsed commodity prices, collapsed livestock prices, devastating \ncrop disease in some parts of the country, devastating drought in \nothers, and flooding in yet other parts of the country. We need at the \nend of the day to say we have put together a package of help that says \nto those family farmers trying to do business under those \ncircumstances: You have a chance here to survive. You can make it \nacross these price valleys.\n  Putting together an inadequate package and then just going home is \nnot solving problems. It is just prolonging the day, probably by a \nmonth or 2 or 6 months, by which farmers might have a chance to make a \ndecision later that they are going to have to be out of business.\n  That is not what we want to do for farmers. Family farmers are \nimportant to this country. I come here with a real passion for family \nfarming. It is because I grew up in a rural area of this country and I \nknow what it takes to raise livestock. I know what kinds of efforts and \npassions people put into trying to operate a family farm. I see now the \ntears in the eyes of family farmers who stands up at meetings with me \nand say: I am losing the farm. This is a farm my grand-dad operated and \nmy dad operated, and I am losing it. I am not a bad farmer, I am a good \nfarmer, but I can't make it with Depression-era prices for wheat and \ncorn. I just can't make a living that way.\n  Members of the Senate couldn't make a living that way. People on \nminimum wage couldn't make a living that way. Nobody can make a living \nwhen their prices collapse. Is there anybody you know of who has half \nthe income they used to have a couple years ago and are doing well? I \ndon't think so. That is what this is about.\n  Are we going to invest in family farming? Are we going to extend a \nhelping hand to say, you matter, we want to help you, or are we going \nto pass a bill that is inadequate and say, we passed it, so credit us \nfor passing a bill?\n  I hope my colleagues will take a close look at this compromise, \n$9.837 billion, nearly $1 billion less than that which we offered \nyesterday. My colleagues, Senators Harkin and Conrad and others, \nsincerely hope we will be able to accept this as a compromise and then \nunderstand that we have done something significant and real, something \nhelpful to America's family farmers and for America's family farmers.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I don't know of any Senators on this side of the aisle who desire to \ndebate this issue any further. We have had a full debate of all of the \nissues surrounding this amendment--the issues of disaster and income \nassistance.\n  I observe that the proposal that is now before the Senate, offered by \nthe Senators from North Dakota and Iowa and others who may be \ncosponsors, is very similar to the amendment that has already been \nvoted on, on a motion to table the Daschle-Harkin amendment. On that \nvote, the motion to table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\n  There are some reductions in the individual items of assistance that \nare included in the bill, but the bill is basically the same bill \nsubstantively and in terms of the procedures used to deliver the \ndisaster assistance. We were told also that the earlier bill had been \nestimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost over $11 billion. \nIt had been advertised as having a cost of $10.793 billion. This has \nbeen revised downward from that previous estimate to $9.83 billion.\n  The individual items we observe that have been changed: There is $100 \nmillion less for dairy. There is a reduction in the livestock \nassistance program from $200 million to $150 million. There was a so-\ncalled flooded land program at $250 million in the earlier proposal \nwhich is now $150 million. There is a cancellation of the so-called \nemergency short-term land diversion program and also of the producers \nerroneously denied eligibility for the 1998 relief program. There are \ntwo programs in the emergency conservation area that have been reduced \nin cost, and one has been canceled.\n  Those are the highlights of the changes that have been made in this \nlegislation from the way it appeared when the Senate voted to table the \namendment earlier in the consideration of this bill. So it is virtually \nthe same amendment. There have been some modifications.\n  I urge Senators to vote to table the amendment when that motion is \nmade. It is the intention of this manager to yield back all time that \nremains on this side, and I will be prepared to do that whenever the \nSenator from North Dakota says they are ready to vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 11 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, of those items that my colleague, Senator \nCochran, described as having been reduced, in most cases, they were \nreduced from a level of funding that we thought was necessary. But I \nsay that, in almost every case, these items have no entry on the \nunderlying amendment. There isn't any money available in the Cochran \nproposal that the Senate has considered.\n  So it is true, we have had to reduce some accounts. But whatever is \nleft is certainly more than exists in the farm crisis package that has \nbeen offered today by my colleague.\n  I hope that our colleagues will look at this in the spirit in which \nit is offered and believe that a compromise is important and necessary \nand believe it is far better during a farm crisis to try to extend the \nhelping hand to people who are producing and provide help, because \nprices have collapsed for that which they have produced, than it is to \nconcoct another approach that says: Let's just send checks out there \nand hope some of them get in the right mailboxes. That is what AMTA is \nand what it does. That is why it is not effective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield back all time remaining on this \nside on the amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1514.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I understand it, under the agreement \nthere was an opportunity for another disaster assistance amendment to \nbe offered. It is my understanding that an agreement has been reached \nto limit the time for debate on that amendment to 30 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a motion to table.\n  I make that suggestion to see if it is satisfactory with the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the understanding.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1517 To Amendment No. 1499\n\n               (Purpose: To make a perfecting amendment)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1517 to amendment No. 1499.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is an attempt to have a pure \ncompromise between the two sides on the question of disaster relief for \nagriculture. The Democratic plan previously proposed was at $10.8 \nbillion. The Republican plan that we started with was $6.9 billion. \nThis is for $8.8 billion. First, it compromises on the money.\n  Second, on the payment methodology, it adopts what the Republicans \nhave insisted on, the use of enhanced AMTA payments for income support. \nThis is a sincere attempt to compromise on the question of disaster \nrelief.\n  Beyond that, there are significant differences. This is a disaster \nbill that actually has disaster aid. Our amendment has $500 million set \naside for 1999 crop income losses. There is nothing in the underlying \namendment. Let me repeat that for people who are listening, and for our \ncolleagues. Our amendment has $500 million for 1999 crop income losses \nfrom droughts and floods. The underlying amendment has zero. We are \ntalking about a disaster bill that, on the Republican side, does not \nhave disaster provisions. It has provisions to offset the dramatic loss \nfrom the plummeting crop prices, but it does not have provisions to \naddress drought or flooded lands.\n  In addition, the underlying amendment has no money for the unmet 1998 \ndisaster assistance promise that was made. Last year, the government \ncame up short. We gave farmers compensation based on a formula. They \ngot 85 percent of what Congress had promised. My amendment improves on \nthat. It closes the gap between what was promised and what was \ndelivered. The underlying amendment has no money for dairy. Our \nproposal has $200 million for dairy. The underlying amendment has no \nmoney for price reporting. We have a modest amount of money for that. \nThe underlying amendment has no money for agricultural mediation. We \nhave a small amount of money for that.\n  In addition, the underlying amendment has no money for section 32 \ncommodity purchases to address the drought and the livestock price \ncollapse that we have seen for hogs. Our amendment does.\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\n  The underlying amendment, the Cochran amendment, is at $7.5 billion. \nOur amendment is at $8.8 billion. It represents a pure compromise on \nthe dollars. It represents an acceptance of the Republican payment \nmechanism--all AMTA payments. As I have indicated, the other \ndifferences are as follows: The underlying amendment has about $200 \nmillion for specialty crops; we have $300 million. The underlying \namendment has $325 million for livestock assistance and section 32; we \nhave $550 million. The underlying amendment has nothing for 1999 crop \nincome losses; we have $500 million. The underlying amendment has \nnothing for dairy; we have $200 million. The underlying amendment has \nnothing for the unmet 1998 disaster promise; we have $162 million. The \nunderlying amendment has money for tobacco farmers; so do we.\n  We also have some miscellaneous provisions and deal with raising \npayment limits. We have the same approach as in the Republican \nproposal.\n  This is an attempt to have a straightforward compromise between the \ntwo positions. I hope very much our colleagues will accept it. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I know of no Senators on this side who are requesting \nrecognition to debate this amendment. I observe that there has been a \nlot of discussion and consideration in the Senate on all of the issues \nthat are included in this proposed amendment. Nothing really has been \nchanged except the vehicle for delivery of assistance--that has been \nchanged--and a reduction in total cost.\n  We still observe this is not a CBO estimate of the cost. The earliest \ncost of the Harkin amendment was over $10 billion, but then CBO sends \nus an estimate and it is over $11 billion. So one thing for Senators to \nkeep in mind is that the cost of this proposed amendment is still \nconsiderably higher than the Cochran amendment that has previously been \nagreed to by the Senate on a voice vote this afternoon.\n  I hope Senators will continue to support the managers' effort to \ntable this amendment and proceed to then consider the remaining \namendments we have available to be disposed of in connection with this \nlegislation. We think the underlying amendment fully addresses the need \nfor action to deal with the problem of lost income and disaster \nassistance. It may not be perfect. There is no provision in the House \nbill on this subject. So we have an opportunity in conference to work \nout differences. If there are developments between now and the time \nwhen we do go to conference with the House, we will have an opportunity \nto address those issues.\n  I am hopeful Senators will understand this is our first action on \nthis subject by the Congress. We have had no support from the \nadministration in terms of trying to identify an appropriate level of \ndisaster assistance for current problems. We already have a disaster \nprogram that is still being administered by the Department of \nAgriculture which was approved in the last Congress. That is a $6 \nbillion program. We are willing to continue to work with the \nadministration and with Senators in this Chamber to design the best \npossible economic assistance program.\n  We think this is a very strong effort and is a sign that we are \nserious about dealing with the problems in agriculture. It is a strong \ncommitment. It is a $7 billion effort that has already been agreed to \nthis afternoon. So we will continue to talk to Senators on both sides \nof the aisle to try to reach a point where we have a consensus and we \nhave an understanding that will be acceptable not only to Congress but \nget the signature of the White House as well. We realize that is a fact \nof legislative life. But this is an important issue.\n  We appreciate the way Senators have responded to the challenge, \ndiscussing the options and voting for the measures that have been \nbefore us. But it is my intention, once the Senator has used his time \nor yielded it back, to yield the time that remains on this side and \nmove to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank both Senator Conrad \nfrom North Dakota and Senator Grassley from Iowa. This is the first \nbipartisan effort we have had.\n  I also want to key on what the Senator from Mississippi just said. I \nappreciate very much what the Senator from Mississippi did earlier with \nthe voice vote, basically saying let's try to get some agreement on \nwhat our baseline is going to be.\n  I am wondering. I say to the Senator from Mississippi, it seems some \nthings put together in the package by Senators Grassley and Conrad \nmight be agreeable to the Senator from Mississippi. Perhaps all of them \nare not. I wonder if the Senator will be willing to consider adding by \nvoice vote some of the things? Look, for example, at the 1999 \nagricultural disaster losses. That almost on the face cries out for \nfunding, it seems to me.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Mississippi will respond to that. I know \nearlier we had a voice vote that set down a foundation of what we were \ngoing to do. Since this is the first truly bipartisan effort we have \nhad, which is exactly what we are going to need in order to get the \nPresident's signature and the House to come along, we have a ways to go \nbefore we can get something signed and assistance out to farmers who \nare in need.\n  As I said, I appreciate very much the Senator from Mississippi--there \nis no question he understands there is a real need there, and it is not \na question of whether or not he wants to help. He has a problem with \nsome of the details of it and the timing of it. I wonder if there is \nanything on this list that the Senator from Mississippi by voice vote \nwill be able to add in at this stage of the game?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, no, there is \nnot.\n  Mr. KERREY. Let me ask specifically on the ag disaster income loss, \nit seems to me--this is for 1999 that had been promised previously--\nthis is just a matter of keeping a promise that was made previously. \nThe Senator still would not--he can shake his head no if the answer is \nno. I am seeking some way to build on what Senator Grassley and Senator \nConrad have done, which is trying to split the difference here and come \nup with a proposal.\n  Their proposal, for example, the most controversial one right off the \nbat, was they have all the money going out in an AMTA payment. As the \nSenator from Mississippi knows, the earlier effort reached by partisan \nagreement was one of the most difficult issues. Democrats wanted the \nmoney to go out in LDPs, and Republicans wanted it to go out in AMTA. \nWe yielded in the bipartisan proposal of which I am fully supportive. \nIt seems to me it would be reasonable at least to consider putting this \n1999 assistance that has been promised on the appropriations bill. Does \nthe Senator not agree with that?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am happy to \ndiscuss this. I do not think we are going to make any progress in \nreaching an agreement in the way the Senator from Nebraska has \nundertaken to try to explore the options. This is, is it the third day? \nIt seems as if it has been 3 days. Maybe it has just been 2. Time \npasses so fast when you are having fun trying to work something out.\n  We have undertaken in good faith to try to arrive at a package of \nassistance that will address the needs, as we understand them, in \nagriculture. If the Senator has listened to the debate, as I am sure he \nhas, there have been some Senators who do not think there should be any \nfunds made available at this time for this purpose because the harvests \nhave not been completed and we do not know what the losses are in some \nareas of the country.\n  This year, some farmers are predicted to make more money than they \ndid last year. In my State, aquaculture is considered to be having a \nvery good year. There was a big feature story just this week in our \nState's press about that. But there are some farmers who are having a \nterrible time. Many of them are in the newspapers and photographs where \ndrought has hit crops in this region of the country.\n  We are all aware of those problems. To suggest to me that I should \nnow look at this last amendment that has a\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\nlong list of things in it and I should select things that I could be \nwilling to accept puts me in a position that is really untenable. I \nthink the Senator understands that. So I think his questions are not \nonly facetious but not well intended to really achieve the result of a \ncompromise.\n  I cannot speak for all Senators on this side of the aisle when trying \nto respond to a question such as that. I can say that there is a lot of \ndiversity in the Senate. We have come together to agree on an approach. \nIt is a generous approach, and I think we are willing to go to \nconference with that. I am willing to take that to conference and \ndefend it and improve it if we can, if the House has some better ideas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nebraska has \nexpired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield back all the time remaining on \nthis side on the amendment. I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator withhold until Senator Grassley has a \nchance to speak? I am not out of time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be happy to withhold if the Senator wants to \ntalk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe the Senator from North Dakota has 4 \nminutes, 56 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I give 4 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about the hope that we \ncould get a bipartisan agreement. I spoke also about the fact that I \nconsider ag programs and Social Security and Medicare as social \ncontracts that we have with segments of our population and the \nGovernment, and the extent to which, for the most part, those social \ncontracts have been bipartisan when there have been changes made.\n  I welcomed the opportunity yesterday to have Democratic leaders and \npeople interested in agricultural issues wanting to meet with \nRepublicans to reach that bipartisan accord. An accord such as this is \none where each side gives some. I think Republicans have given, the \nextent to which this is more than some magic $7.5 billion, but, there \nagain, as the Senator from North Dakota explained, it is about halfway \nbetween the extremes of what both parties were offering.\n  What I know is very strongly felt by a lot of people on the other \nside of the aisle is that there should be a division of the cash \ninfusion into agriculture between AMTA payments and LDPs. We on this \nside of the aisle believe more strongly about that than almost any \nother issue--that that is the wrong way to go, for two reasons: One, \nLDP is a convoluted way to get money to farmers; and the second one is \nthat when we have an emergency such as this, we ought to be able to get \nthe money to the community as fast as we can. This can be done within \n10 days after the President signs the bill.\n  On the other side of the aisle, at least I can say for the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, they have given a lot in order to reach this \ncompromise. It is very deeply felt by Republicans that all of this \nmoney should go out through AMTA. This is give and take on both sides, \nand I hope that it does get a massive amount of support so we can say \nwe did something with a social contract that is bipartisan, which is a \ntradition of this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes so that two other Senators may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from Mississippi for the \naccommodation.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nMississippi for letting us have this additional time.\n  Again, I rise to support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and my colleague from Iowa. Sure, there are some things in \nthis with which I do not agree. I do not think it all ought to go out \nin AMTA payments.\n  Obviously, the body has spoken. The Republicans have the votes on \nthat. So it is done.\n  There is a better way of putting it out through the LDP system, but \nthat is a moot point right now. What we are down to is really how much \nwe are going to put out there and whether or not we are going to \ndribble it out or do something meaningful.\n  We keep coming down from the amendment we offered the other day for \nabout 10.7; then we came down to 9.8, and I guess this now is about \n8.5.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, 8.8.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is 8.8.\n  So, again, I hope that Senators will see fit to at least endorse and \nvote for this package. The amendment offered by Senator Cochran has no \nmoney for section 32 purchases, which I think is going to be very \nimportant for our pork and cattlemen, to buy up some of this excess \nstuff we have and put it into food banks, school lunch programs, and \nthings such as that.\n  I also must say there is no money in the Cochran amendment for price \nreporting. Quite frankly, I still think we have an obligation to do \nsomething about the unmet needs from the 1998 floods we had that so \ndevastated North Dakota and some other parts of this country. Quite \nfrankly, in this amendment, this compromise proposal that Senator \nConrad and Senator Grassley have offered, there is money for that.\n  So I think it does represent a true compromise. It represents a sort \nof meeting between where we started yesterday and where the manager of \nthe bill started. Again, I think there are some provisions in there I \nwish we could have changed, but we had our votes and we were not on the \nwinning side of that.\n  So I think we can at least now have an agreement to get the amount of \nmoney out there, even though it is through the AMTA payments, that is \nneeded and to provide some of the money for some of the areas that the \nCochran amendment has omitted.\n  I thank the managers, and I thank Senator Conrad for yielding me this \ntime. I urge support of the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator for yielding me \nthis time.\n  I am one of the newer Members of the Senate. I have not taken to the \nfloor of the Senate often to speak yet. But I have been on the floor of \nthe Senate five times already to speak on this issue of the \nagricultural crisis. I think it is immensely important to this Nation \nand certainly vital to the rural areas of our country.\n  I compliment my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad. I think \nthe spirit in which this bipartisan effort has been crafted is \nessential in being able to produce good policy for this country.\n  I also agree with the words of my colleague from Mississippi that \nwithout a doubt this is a diverse body, and especially when it comes to \nagriculture, oftentimes we certainly see our diversity in terms of \nregions more than parties. I compliment his leadership in many of these \nareas.\n  But I do think the debate and the differences we have seen are \ncertainly reflective of the necessity now to review agricultural policy \nin this country. I truly encourage my colleagues to take a look at this \nbipartisan approach that has been presented by Senator Conrad.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is not all that I hoped for for \nfarmers in Minnesota, but I thank Senator Conrad and Senator Grassley \nfor this compromise effort.\n  I think we are doing more for dairy. I think we are doing more for \nlivestock producers. I think we are doing much more for disaster \nrelief, which is terribly important to farmers in my State and farmers \nall across the Nation.\n  I hope that we get a very strong vote. I think at this point in time \nin the week this is the very best we can do. I am pleased to support \nthis effort.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I just urge my colleagues to give our \namendment close consideration. This is the\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\nonly amendment that is bipartisan. We have compromised on the dollar \namounts almost down the middle. We have provided the Republican payment \nmechanism.\n  We have $500 million to address drought and flooded lands. There is \nnothing in the underlying amendment for that. We have $200 million to \naddress the crisis in dairy. There is nothing in the underlying \namendment for that.\n  This is $8.8 billion, in a bipartisan proposal, to deal with the \ndisaster. I hope my colleagues can support it on a bipartisan basis.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor and yield back our time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, all time has been consumed or yielded \nback.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1517. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 256 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Crapo\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, at the time the Ashcroft amendment was \nagreed to, it was offered in a form that related to the Harkin-Daschle \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. The Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have been asked to seek unanimous \nconsent that it be in order to reoffer the Ashcroft amendment regarding \nsanctions, that the amendment be considered agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I announce that I have been asked to seek that consent. I know a copy \nof the agreement has been furnished to staff on both sides, and it has \nbeen hotlined. I don't have a response as to whether it has been agreed \nto. So I am raising the question as to whether or not that consent can \nbe granted.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will object if that unanimous consent \nrequest is placed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. In that event, as I understand the parliamentary \nsituation, the Senator from Missouri could offer his amendment on \nsanctions for the consideration of the Senate and, at this time, it \nwould be parliamentarily permissible for him to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my intention to send an amendment \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1516 to Amendment No. 1499\n\n(Purpose: To provide stability in the United States agriculture sector \n  and to promote adequate availability of food and medicine abroad by \n     requiring congressional approval before the imposition of any \n unilateral agricultural or medical sanction against a foreign country \n                           or foreign entity)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my intention to send an amendment \nto the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered \nas read, the amendment be considered agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1094\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the issue of \nfarmland preservation. I have an amendment that was filed. It is \namendment No. 1094. I will not call up that amendment, but I do want to \nspeak on it for a couple of minutes.\n  The reason I will not call the amendment up is the amendment is now \nsubject to rule XVI. It is on farmland preservation, which was an \nauthorized program under the farm bill in 1996, but because the program \nwas so successful, all the money has been used in the authorization. So \nwhile I would very much like to see more money be appropriated for this \nprogram that shares very broad bipartisan support, the job\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\nbefore us is to get this program authorized. Since legislating on \nappropriations bills is now not the order of the day, and I support \nthat, we are going to have to work through the authorization process.\n  But the Farmland Preservation Program, I think, has probably been \nshown to be one of the most successful pieces of legislation in \npreserving open space and critical farmland that we have seen in this \ncountry. In fact, last year, $7 billion of farmland protection money, \npreservation money, was approved via voter referendum throughout the \ncountry. That is an enormous commitment on the part of States and \nlocalities to preserve this vital agricultural land and at the same \ntime preserve a way of life and preserve vital open space in places \nwhere the pressure for development is extremely high.\n  The area of my State that is under the most development pressure is \nthe southeastern corner of Pennsylvania. The counties there, from \nLancaster County to Chester County, Bucks County, York County, and \nothers, have done a great job in their own programs. In fact, all those \nprograms I mentioned, county programs, were started long before the \nFederal Government ever even thought of participating in helping them \nacquire land. In fact, we have helped. The $35 million--that is all it \nwas, $35 million--from the Federal level which was spent over the first \n3 years of the farm bill preserved over 127,000 acres of land that is \nunder great pressure of development on 460 farms.\n\n  In Pennsylvania alone, we have a 10-year backlog, a 10-year waiting \nlist of farmers who voluntarily want to preserve their land and \npreserve, as a result, the family farm to be able to pass it on from \ngeneration to generation. States and localities, in partnership with \nthe Federal Government--and as I said, in some cases without the \nFederal partnership--have bought these development rights so they can \nget some money to help keep this farm within the family. In fact, in a \nthird of the cases--and we will be dealing with the tax bill tomorrow--\nthese development rights were sold by farmers so they could pay death \ntaxes, they could pay inheritance taxes, estate taxes--call them what \nyou want. They sold their development rights on the farm so they could \nkeep the farm in the family because of what the Federal Government has \ndone in taxing their estates upon death.\n  That is a remarkable situation. Hopefully, if we can get the \nPresident to sign the tax bill we will pass tomorrow, we can go a long \nway toward avoiding that kind of use for these development rights. \nThese development rights can then be used to modernize, to upgrade, and \nto make more competitive these agricultural lands that are under this \nintense development pressure.\n  I am disappointed we are not going to be successful in agreeing to \nthe $10 million that is in this amendment. It would go a long way to \nrelieve that backlog, not only in Pennsylvania but in the 19 other \nStates that have participated in the Federal program. Since the Federal \nprogram was enacted, many more States have passed laws--in fact, 52 \njurisdictions in States and localities have adopted some sort of \nfarmland preservation program that would dovetail very nicely with the \nFederal effort.\n  This is an important issue to the people, particularly in the eastern \npart of the State of Pennsylvania. It is an important issue, I know, to \nmy colleagues all throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England States, \nmany of whom are cosponsors of this legislation; also in California, \nwhere Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein worked to pass the original \nfarmland preservation amendment back in 1996.\n  I am hopeful that the Agriculture Committee on which I serve will \nbring up this legislation and reauthorize it for the remaining part of \nthe farm bill so we can include this in the Agriculture appropriations \nbill next time. I commend and thank Senator Lugar who, a couple of \nweeks ago, held a hearing in the Agriculture Committee about this \nsubject. We had some very enlightened testimony. It shows how \nincredibly popular this program is across the country and how important \nit is to preserve a way of life in rural America, particularly those \nareas that are threatened by development pressure.\n  I am hopeful, again, while we will not be able to accomplish it here \ntoday, that soon in this session of Congress we will pass a \nreauthorization of this program and be able to fund it in future \nappropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, seeing no one else seeking the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1516, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I modify my amendment with the \nmodification that is at the desk.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       Guidelines With Respect to State Sponsors of International \n     Terrorism.--(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of the \n     Act, the export of agricultural commodities or medicine or \n     medical devices to the government of a country that has been \n     determined by the Secretary of State to have repeatedly \n     provided support for acts of international terrorism under \n     section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2371) shall only be made----\n       (1) pursuant to one year licenses issued by the United \n     States Government for contracts entered into during that one \n     year period and completed within a twelve-month period after \n     the signing of the contract; and\n       (2) without benefit of federal financing, direct export \n     subsidies, federal credit guarantees or other federal \n     promotion assistance programs.\n       (B) Quarterly reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees shall be submitted by the applicable agency \n     charged with issuing licenses in subparagraph (A)(1).\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment, as modified, be considered agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table. I further ask unanimous consent that \nany rule XVI objections to the amendment be inappropriate and out of \norder and be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, is it so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1516), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri and others who were interested in the sanctions amendment that \nhe had offered and which had been approved in a different form earlier \nin the consideration of the bill for working to put this legislation \ntogether in a form that could be adopted by the Senate tonight. I know \nthe Senators from Florida and New Jersey were interested in this \nlegislation, and the author of the amendment has shown strong \nleadership in bringing this issue to the Senate and in pushing it the \nway he did to get it approved. I compliment him and those who worked \nwith him to try to resolve this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of remarks by \nway of appreciation to the other Senators as well, to Senator Hagel, to \nSenator Graham of Florida, Senator Mack of Florida, Senator Torricelli, \nand to all the Senators who worked together. It was important for us to \nmake the fine-tuning adjustments that make this a better piece of \nlegislation, and I commend them for their cooperation.\n  I trust, even expect, that in implementing this process, the \nadministration will endeavor to streamline to the maximum extent \npossible the process by which food and medicine can be exported \npursuant to this provision. This is what our farmers and ranchers and \nthose who produce our medicinal supplies expect from their Government \nand the people expect from America. For example, I urge the \nimplementing agencies to use general licenses to the maximum extent \npossible, but obviously this provision provides some judgment and \nexercise by the administration in this regard.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis patience in this respect. I am grateful to him and pleased to have \nhad this opportunity to make this contribution to the measure. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think progress is being made by the\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\nmanagers and our staff members with those Senators who have suggested \namendments to the bill. We are compiling a list of amendments that will \nbe agreed upon. There are a few that have not been resolved and that \nprobably will require either disposition by voice vote or rollcall vote \neither up or down or on a motion to table.\n  I am just suggesting we are getting to that point toward the end of \nthe bill when we are ready to wrap this up. We hope we are not in too \nlate tonight. If Senators will cooperate and offer the amendments they \nhave, we will appreciate that very much.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1499, As Amended\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, at this point in the proceeding, I know \nthe pending business is the Cochran amendment and it is at the desk. I \nknow of no other amendments that are going to be offered to that \namendment. The bill will be open for amendment further upon the \nadoption of that amendment. It is an amendment that has already been \nvoted on twice, once on a motion to table and then adopted on a voice \nvote. I am prepared to move forward to dispose of that disaster \nassistance issue.\n  I am awaiting the advice of the Chair. Do we have to have third \nreading? If we do, I will request it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on \namendment No. 1499, as amended. Does the Senator wish a rollcall vote?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The staff is advising me that the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Is there further \ndebate?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, point of inquiry of the manager of the \nbill to understand where we are. We will be voting on the managers' \nbase bill as has been put forward in amendments so far; is that where \nwe are? I want to understand where we are.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Any parliamentary inquiries can be directed to the Chair.\n  I tried to explain the vote. It is on the Cochran amendment. We have \nvoted on it twice--on a motion to table; and it was adopted on a voice \nvote. It was an amendment to the Daschle-Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to understand for sure what all this contains \nin it, whether or not I am looking at the proper bill, the Cochran \namendment No. 1499 to S. 1233. I want to make sure I have the right \nsection, section G, regarding the tobacco program in the base bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I will be \nglad to suggest the absence of a quorum and go over the bill and try to \nanswer any questions the Senator has.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the \namendment before us today by the Senator from Mississippi. While I know \nmy friends who support this amendment have the best of intentions in \noffering the agricultural relief package, I must say I am concerned \nwith the direction of this debate.\n  We find ourselves today, Mr. President, in an increasingly familiar \nplace. Once again, there is a crisis in farm country and the Congress \nis called on to construct a comprehensive package of relief and \nsupport. The amendment before us would spend more than $7 billion on--\namong other things--direct cash payments to farmers. This follows our \nefforts last year when we provided just short of $6 billion in \nemergency payments to America's farmers. Since 1988 emergency \nsupplemental acts and farm disaster acts have amounted to approximately \n$17 billion in emergency supplemental funding for USDA programs.\n  Now I understand that much of this money was spent helping farmers \nwho had suffered crop losses through drought, seasonal storms and other \nnatural disasters. In fact, a portion of last year's emergency \nappropriations went to farmers who were harmed by weather conditions \nrelated to the El Nino phenomenon and other acts of God.\n  In other words, we were attempting to help farmers in previous years \nbecause times were bad. What concerns me about this effort today is \nthat we are helping farmers because times are good. Increasingly in \nthese relief bills we are seeing the bulk of support going in response \nto low commodity prices. In fact, much of the rhetoric we're hearing is \ngoing to the issue of declining farm income and the difficulty farmers \nin the heartland and elsewhere are having finding markets for their \ngoods.\n  Today we're not addressing a crisis borne of declining productivity. \nIt is not that America's farmer's aren't extremely good at what they \ndo. Rather exactly the opposite. We are here because--stimulated by \nscience and technology--farm productivity has persistently grown more \nrapidly than other sectors of the economy. More importantly, \nagricultural productivity has outstripped demand. And it leaves us \nfaced with the one of the most basic economic functions: in the face of \noverwhelming supply and insufficient demand, prices will fall.\n  In nearly all sectors, this phenomenon is a quiet one. The ``unseen \nhand'' of the market in most cases allocates resources among the \npopulation and prevents market saturation. But in the farm sector, \nCongress is often asked to intervene in this process and all too often \nin the past, we have. For far too long, we have allowed politics rather \nthan economics to allocate agricultural resources and determine \nbusiness success or failure. As seen by the overwhelming failure this \ncentury of centrally planned economies across the globe, political \nallocation leads to economic stagnation and long-term failure.\n  It is for these reasons I fear our continued subsidization of the \nfarm sector thwarts the free market process and will ultimately harm \nwell-run farms by enabling continued market saturation. I understand \nthe production of food is essential to the past and future of our \ncountry. I also recognize the instability and risk farmers face on a \nyear to year basis and appreciate the need for occasional assistance. \nThe New York Times, for example, contains an article yesterday \ndiscussing the drought disaster facing farmers in Maryland and West \nVirginia and the need for assistance in those areas. I do not discount \nthe need for federal disaster relief. In Florida, Agriculture is a \nmajor part of our economy, and certainly there have been circumstances \nwhen we've called on Congress to assist us after hurricanes or winter \nfreezes. These natural events warrant Congressional consideration and \nour best efforts. However, it seems our debate here is increasingly \nabout politics rather than economics or weather-related disasters.\n  In 1996, the Congress passed a Farm Bill which provided farmers of \nour major export crops with direct payments to transition them off the \nold subsidy programs and onto the free market. These direct payments \nwere supposed to diminish each year until 2002. Instead, we are here--\nfor the second year in a row--considering legislation to increase these \npayments. Once again, Congress is using emergency payments to undo the \n1996 Farm Bill and circumvent the free market. I hear my colleagues \nblaming the free market for price failures and I find this to be a \nsomewhat misguided notion. In fact, the market is working all too well; \nthe overcapacity in agriculture that was papered over by government \nprice supports for generations is now in full view. And the results are \nevident in the low commodity prices we're seeing on the markets today.\n  I support the ideals and practices of family farming. I do not, \nhowever, support continually subsidizing businesses that fail. This is \nwasteful and destructive. By paying farmers who are unable to make \nprofits in farming, you only delay their ultimate failure, and deter \nthem from seeking other alternatives for income and employment. In \naddition, these farms that would otherwise fail still can produce crops \nthat dilute the market and drive prices down, thereby creating a \nvicious cycle that we are seeing realized in this year's crisis in farm \ncountry.\n  This problem far outstrips any two-day debate on emergency cash \npayments for farmers. What we need, Mr.\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\nPresident, is long-term structural solutions that solve the underlying \nproblems of oversupply in the face of insufficient world demand. One \nmajor impediment to the movement of people out of the farming sector \nand into other areas of the economy is the punitive capital gains taxes \nowed by farmers who sell their land. I will be introducing legislation \nsoon to repeal the capital gains tax on the sale of farmland. This will \nallow farmers to realize an additional dollar in five on the sale of \ntheir land. They can then use this money to help them in the transition \nto non-farm businesses or work. While I agree with my colleagues that \nwe need solutions to the crisis in American agriculture, I submit we \nneed solutions that solve the underlying economic problems rather than \npatchwork measures that do little more than treat the symptoms and \ndefer the problem to another year and another Congress.\n  Mr. President, my opposition to this amendment is not based on a \ndisdain or lack of appreciation for American agriculture. On the \ncontrary, I believe it is a vital part of our economy and food security \nis clearly in our national interest. But the farming way of life is not \nserved by government handout and bailouts of alarming size and \nregularity. Rather--like most other businesses--it is only preserved \nthrough sound business practices, hard work and an understanding of \nmarket fundamentals. Agriculture does not operate outside of the laws \nof supply and demand, and I urge my colleagues to carefully consider \nthe long-term impact of continual subsidization on this important \nsector of the American economy.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose this amendment and explore ways to \nhelp farmers who are facing natural disasters rather than price \ndisasters. We cannot allow the short-term politics to deter us from the \nlong-term effort to steer agriculture towards the free market. Nobody \nwants to see failure in America. Nobody wants to see families lose \ntheir farms. Nobody wants the agrarian way of life in America to fade \nfrom existence. For these very reasons, Congress has an obligation to \nstay the course and lay the free-market groundwork for a prosperous \nfarm economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) The Clean Air Act requires that federal reformulated \n     gasoline contain oxygen as a means of achieving air quality \n     benefits.\n       (2) While both renewable ethanol and MTBE may be used to \n     meet this Clean Air Act requirement, MTBE is in substantially \n     greater use than ethanol.\n       (3) MTBE is classified as a possible human carcinogen, and \n     when leaked into water causes water to take on the taste and \n     smell of turpentine, rendering it undrinkable.\n       (4) MTBE leaking from underground fuel storage tanks, \n     recreational watercraft and abandoned automobiles has led to \n     growing detections of MTBE in drinking water, and has \n     contaminated groundwater and drinking water throughout the \n     United States.\n       (5) Approximately five to ten percent of drinking water \n     supplies in areas using reformulated gasoline now show \n     detectable levels of MTBE.\n       (6) MTBE poses a more pervasive threat to drinking water \n     than the other harmful constituents of gasoline because MTBE \n     is more soluble, more mobile and slower to degrade than those \n     other constituents.\n       (7) Renewable ethanol provides air quality and energy \n     security benefits without raising drinking water concerns.\n       (8) A substantial increase in renewable ethanol production \n     would enhance the energy security of the United States by \n     reducing dependence upon foreign oil.\n       (9) A substantial increase in renewable ethanol production \n     would help alleviate the financial crisis facing farmers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should--\n       (1) phase out MTBE in order to address the threats MTBE \n     poses to public health and the environment;\n       (2) promote renewable ethanol to replace MTBE as a means of \n     enhancing energy security and supporting the farm economy;\n       (3) provide assistance to state and local governments to \n     treat drinking water supplies contaminated with MTBE;\n       (4) provide assistance to state and local governments to \n     protect lakes and reservoirs from MTBE contamination.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is very unusual that an amendment has \nsuch strong bipartisan support and unlikely allies across the aisle. \nThis is one of those. I will tell you the reason.\n  We have a situation in this country that has just been recognized by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency where we have been using an \noxygenate in gasoline, MTBE, methyl tertiary butyl ether, an additive \nwhich is in essence, without going into technicalities, poisoning the \nwater across this country, and particularly in my home State where MTBE \nis in use. It is an oxygenate, and it has been used in the blending of \ngasoline. We thought it was safe, and we thought it cleaned up the air. \nIt does help clean up the air, but it is in fact harming our water \nsupply.\n  While other oxygenates such as ethanol may be used to meet the \nrequirement of the Clean Air Act which calls\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\nfor 2 percent of our gas to be reformulated, MTBE is the oxygenate of \nchoice for most refiners, and today it fulfills 85 percent of the \ndemand for oxygenate that the Clean Air Act requires. Ethanol fulfills \nonly 8 percent of that demand.\n  Why did I offer this to the Agriculture bill? I think that is a \nlegitimate question. Some Senators have asked me. Because I will tell \nyou that if we can use more ethanol, it is going to help our farm \nStates in a big way. Senator Fitzgerald is going to go into that point \nfar more than I will. He knows the subject. If we can help our farm \nStates increase their income, that is going to reduce the cost of \nsubsidies to taxpayers. So this is very much related to the Agriculture \nbill.\n  Unlike other harmful constituents of gasoline, such as benzene, when \nMTBE leaks from underground fuel tanks, it moves through the water very \nfast and very far. After it is released into the environment, it \nresists degrading. Once in the water, MTBE, even at the very low level \nof 5 parts per billion, can cause that water to take on the taste and \nsmell of turpentine, rendering it undrinkable.\n  My colleague from Texas said, How do you know it is undrinkable? The \nanswer is, there have been many hearings all across my State of \nCalifornia. People have testified that where MTBE leaks into the \ndrinking water supply, the water smells. We had a chance to smell that \nwater. You wouldn't even put it close to your lips.\n  MTBE is a possible carcinogen in animals, and it is a probable \ncarcinogen in humans. Why on Earth would we continue to add it to our \ngasoline, knowing it will leak into our drinking water supply? There is \nno Federal drinking water standard for MTBE to protect the public \nhealth, because the studies necessary to determine if there is a safe \nlevel of MTBE have not been performed. Let me tell you the news on \nthis.\n  Many of us have been calling for a phaseout of MTBE. Senator \nFeinstein has her own bill. I have a bill. We know there is a reason. \nThere is a reason to ban it, because the EPA has just stated that it \nshould be decreased dramatically. This is the first time they have ever \nstated that in their blue-ribbon panel.\n  In Santa Monica, CA, the people of that city lost 71 percent of their \nlocal water supply because of MTBE contamination. Imagine being told \nyou cannot drink the water because it is contaminated. They were forced \nto close nine high-volume drinking water wells. Before the \ncontamination, those wells served 6.5 million gallons of water per day. \nEfforts to clean up continue today. The city estimates that it will \ncost $160 million to clean up the affected wells.\n\n  I want to tell you that the EPA has spent hundreds of millions of \ndollars in an effort to clean up the contamination from MTBE. Just in \nthe city of Santa Monica, they say it is going to cost $160 million to \nclean up those affected wells.\n  Why are we continuing to use MTBE? We know enough now to move away \nfrom it. We have alternatives, and our resolution talks about that. We \nhave litigation now concerning cleanup, and alternative water supply \ncosts continue to rise.\n  Santa Monica's contamination is just the tip of the iceberg. I think \na lot of you have heard about Lake Tahoe. What a beautiful place that \nis. Yet in South Lake Tahoe, CA, we have lost 13 of 34 drinking water \nwells because of MTBE contamination.\n  If somebody stands up on the floor of the Senate and says this is \npremature and that we have not looked at this enough, I say: Come to \nCalifornia. Take a look at Lake Tahoe. Talk to the people of Santa \nMonica. They have lost their water supply. Read the blue-ribbon panel \nreport of the EPA that was very reticent to take it on initially. They \nfinally did. That blue-ribbon panel says that MTBE is bad.\n  In Santa Clara, CA--that is in the Silicon Valley--MTBE has been \ndetected in the local drinking water supply reservoirs, and it is \ncreating a real problem there. We have seen it in the ground water in \nthat county in over 400 sites, and many of those sites are very near \npublic water supply wells.\n  I don't want to have to come back here every year and talk to you \nabout the tragedy of MTBE destroying the water. We take this first step \ntonight. Several of our colleagues want to speak on this. I will \nquickly summarize. Hopefully, we will hear from other colleagues.\n  We know that California isn't the only place where there is trouble. \nGovernor Davis has signed an executive order prohibiting MTBE in \nCalifornia after December 31, 2002.\n  Last year, Maine announced it would take steps to reduce MTBE's use \nafter a study revealed between 1,000 and 4,300 private wells could \ncontain unhealthful levels of MTBE. New Hampshire is considering taking \nsimilar action. In New Hampshire, MTBE has been detected in more than \n100 public wells.\n  We cannot allow the States to take on this fight by themselves. After \nall, it is up to Congress because of the Clean Air Act and the \nrequirement to make sure that a safe additive is used.\n  In summary, I think we have a terrific chance tonight to send a very \nclear signal to the Environmental Protection Agency. It is simply a \nsense of the Senate, but I think it will have a lot of weight because \nwe have never voted on the MTBE question before. This would be our \nfirst vote. We will have a vote most likely on a motion to table.\n  The bottom line is MTBE is poison. It is poisoning water supplies. It \nis a known danger. We have options, including ethanol. We have other \noptions. We can do two things at once: We can send a message to the \nEPA, phase out MTBE; and at the same time send a message to our farmers \nwho need a message of hope that they have a product that can fill the \nvoid.\n  I hope we will get a good vote on this. If there is a motion to \ntable, I hope we will have a strong vote against that. I look forward \nto listening to my colleagues who have been extraordinary in helping to \nshape this resolution and helping get it to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know it is kind of late tonight and \neverybody is eager to go home, and I know we are dealing with a farm \nbill, an agriculture appropriations bill. I also know that this \namendment is cloaked in the garb of being a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution and sense-of-the-Senate resolutions tend to be viewed as \nrelatively insignificant.\n  I want to argue that this is not insignificant, that this amendment \nis not based on any scientific study. We should not be making a major \nenergy policy decision in America tonight at 7:30 as we debate the \nagriculture appropriations bill. I want to argue that we should table \nthis amendment. Let me explain why.\n  First of all, we all have trouble pronouncing it. MTBE is an ether \nderivative that EPA has certified lowers the amount of pollution \ngenerated when an internal combustion engine burns gasoline. This ether \nderivative makes gasoline burn more thoroughly. As a result, it is the \ndominant oxygenate used in reformulated gasoline all over America. It \nhas been a major contributor toward improving the environment in those \nareas of the country where there is both a high concentration of \nautomobiles and people.\n  We have had relatively limited scientific analysis of this problem, \nother than a clear finding that California's underground storage tanks \nare leaking gasoline into the ground. If there are holes in these \ntanks, it seems the obvious solution to the problem is to fix those \nunderground tanks.\n  When gasoline leaches into the ground, the gasoline and all of its \ncomponents start to leach through the soil. What has been found, and \nwhat our dear colleague from California is referring to, is the \ndiscovery that this ether derivative, in areas surrounding leaking \nunderground storage tanks, is starting to show up in ground water and \nin wells. Ultimately, if these leaks are not fixed, all the other \ncomponents that make up gasoline will be found in ground water.\n  Here are the problems:\n  No. 1, compared to MTBE, ethanol is in very limited supply, and our \nNation's capacity to produce more of it is substantially limited from \nyear to year.\n  No. 2, ethanol has several problems that MTBE does not. Let me state \ntwo. One, it tends to vaporize at a much lower pressure. We are going \nto create a problem because ethanol vaporizes\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\nmore rapidly than MTBE and could in itself create another environmental \nproblem. Two, Distributors have a very difficult time getting it into \nvarious parts of the country. It is quite competitive where it is \nproduced, but it is very difficult to transport. If this should be \nimplemented, the result of these two problems would be a spike in \ngasoline prices.\n  Ethanol is a wonderful derivative, and I am not arguing one against \nthe other. I am trying to explain that if you remove the dominant \nderivative and attempt to ban it, you force the substitution of another \nderivative which has a fixed supply from year to year based on \nagricultural production levels. You are going to produce shortages that \nwill be exacerbated by the fact that ethanol tends to degrade in a \npipeline.\n  I urge my colleagues to not get into a long debate on a subject that \nfew Members are qualified to debate. Fortunately, the distinguished \nchairman of the Environment Committee is here, a man respected by \npeople on both sides of the aisle, who opposes this amendment. I will \nlet him explain why.\n  To sum up, here is the problem. We have leaking underground tanks. We \nneed to fix the leaks in the underground tanks. It is bad to go around \npouring gasoline, no matter what additives are in it, into the ground. \nRather than California fixing its leaking underground tanks, we are \nbeing called on by the Senator from California to take a major step in \ngoing on record by encouraging Administrator Browner to ban MTBE, which \nshe has the power to do.\n  This is not a trivial, throw away sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We \nare, by taking this position, in essence, encouraging the Administrator \nto take action that would produce gasoline shortages in over half the \ncountry, that would spike gasoline prices, that would create a new \nenvironmental problem because of vaporizing ethanol. Why are we doing \nit? Because we have leaking underground tanks. Let's fix the tanks.\n  If the Senate were asking support for programs to do something about \nthe leaking tanks, that would be one thing. But to ban a gasoline \nadditive, which is the dominant additive in producing clean air in \nAmerica because you have holes in tanks that are not being fixed in \nCalifornia is a policy which I think is totally irresponsible. This is \nnot a decision that should be made by the Senate on a farm bill at 7:30 \ntonight.\n  I urge my colleagues, when the motion is made to table this \namendment, to vote to table it. Not because Members are not concerned \nabout leaking underground tanks and about MTBE in potential underground \nwater or drinking water, because I think we ought to be concerned.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me finish and I am happy to yield.\n  I think we ought to be concerned. But the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works is holding hearings; they are working with \nAdministrator Browner; they are trying to come up with a comprehensive \npolicy in committee.\n  This is an area that is very complicated. I don't think there is \nanybody here, without reading it off a piece of paper, who can \npronounce the ether derivative that is MTBE, much less understand its \nchemical makeup and its advantages in clean air and its disadvantages \nif you spill it in a creek.\n  So I do not doubt the Senator from California is well intended, \ntrying to do something that she thinks sends a good signal. But we are \nnot talking about signals. We are talking about the energy policy of a \nnation that is dependent on energy. This is not a good policy to decide \non the floor when the committee of jurisdiction is working on this \nproblem right now on a bipartisan basis. So I urge my colleagues to not \nsupport this amendment, and in tabling it, simply refer it to the \ncommittee of jurisdiction. Let's get a comprehensive look at it; let \nthe committee decide how to deal with this problem.\n  Might I say, I am from one of the ten largest corn-growing States in \nthe Union. I hope my colleagues from farm States are not going to jump \nonto bad science, bad environmental policy, and disastrous economic \npolicy in the name of trying to ban the use of MTBE, which receives no \nGovernment subsidy, in favor of ethanol, which is already highly \nsubsidized. I hope we will not get into this deal, ``I am going to \nsupport it because I have corn in my State.''\n  I have corn in my State and I have oil in my State. I am glad the \nLord put one there and we brought the other there to grow it. But the \npoint is, this is a serious issue that deserves more attention than it \nis going to get tonight in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote to table this amendment and give the committee an \nopportunity to do something about it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate my friend's strong feelings on this point. I \nknow he appreciates mine. I want him to know I did actually say the \nfull name of MTBE.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is tough.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is very tough: Methyl tertiary butyl ether, MTBE.\n  Mr. GRAMM. You looked down.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I did look down. Methyl tertiary butyl ether, let the \nRecord show I have mastered it.\n  The point is what I have mastered--I want to ask my friend a \nquestion--is that this is a serious problem wherever the MTBE shows up, \nand I have discussed in my abbreviated statement the places it has. Has \nthe Senator had the opportunity to read the blue-ribbon committee's \nreport? I do not know that he has because it is very fresh off the \npress. I wanted to say to my friend, is he aware that in this the EPA \nblue-ribbon panel says the new tanks are simply not the solution? \nBecause we have had new tanks put into place in California, and it is \nnot working. This stuff is leaking. It is leaking badly.\n  Also, I know my friend talked about environmentalists and I also want \nto know if he knows the list of environmental organizations that \nsupport what we are doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have both the blue-ribbon panel findings \nand the names of the environmental organizations printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline--Executive Summary and \n                     Recommendations, July 27, 1999\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The Federal Reformulated Gasoline Program (RFG) established \n     in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and implemented in \n     1995, has provided substantial reductions in the emissions of \n     a number of air pollutants from motor vehicles, most notably \n     volatile organic compounds (precursors of ozone), carbon \n     monoxide, and mobile-source air toxics (benzene, 1,3-\n     butadiene, and others), in most cases resulting in emissions \n     reductions that exceed those required by law. To address its \n     unique air pollution challenges, California has adopted \n     similar but more stringent requirements for California RFG.\n       The Clean Air Act requires that RFG contain 2% oxygen, by \n     weight. Over 85% of RFG contains the oxygenate methyl \n     tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and approximately 8% contains \n     ethanol--a domestic fuel-blending stock made from grain and \n     potentially from recycled biomass waste. There is \n     disagreement about the precise role of oxygenates in \n     attaining the RFG air quality benefits although there is \n     evidence from the existing program that increased use of \n     oxygenates results in reduced carbon monoxide emissions, and \n     it appears that additives contribute to reductions in \n     aromatics in fuels and related air benefits. It is possible \n     to formulate gasoline without oxygenates that can attain \n     similar air toxics reductions, but less certain that, given \n     current federal RFG requirements, all fuel blends created \n     without oxygenates could maintain the benefits provided today \n     by oxygenated RFG.\n       At the same time,the use of MTBE in the program has \n     resulted in growing detections of MTBE in drinking water, \n     with between 5% and 10% of drinking water supplies in high \n     oxygenate use areas \\1\\ showing at least detectable amounts \n     of MTBE. The great majority of these detections to date have \n     been well below levels of public health concern, with \n     approximately one percent rising to levels above 20 ppb. \n     Detections at lower levels have, however, raised consumer \n     taste and odor concerns that have caused water suppliers to \n     stop using some water supplies and to incur costs of \n     treatment and remediation. The contaminated wells include \n     private wells that are less well protected than public \n     drinking water supplies and not monitored for chemical \n     contamination. There is also evidence of contamination of \n     surface waters, particularly during summer boating seasons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The major source of groundwater contamination appears to be \n     releases from underground gasoline storage systems (UST). \n     These systems have been upgraded over the\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\n     last decade, likely resulting in reduced risk of leaks. \n     However, approximately 20% of the storage systems have not \n     yet been upgraded, and there continue to be reports of \n     releases from some upgraded systems, due to inadequate \n     design, installation, maintenance, and/or operation. In \n     addition, many fuel storage systems (e.g. farms, small above-\n     ground tanks) are not currently regulated by U.S. EPA. Beyond \n     groundwater contamination from UST sources, the other major \n     sources of water contamination appear to be small and large \n     gasoline spills to ground and surface waters, and \n     recreational water craft--particularly those with older \n     motors--releasing unburned fuel to surface waters.\n\n\n                         The Blue Ribbon Panel\n\n       In November, 1998, U.S. EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner \n     appointed a Blue Ribbon Panel to investigate the air quality \n     benefits and water quality concerns associated with \n     oxygenates in gasoline, and to provide independent advice and \n     recommendations on ways to maintain air quality while \n     protecting water quality. The Panel, which met six times from \n     January-June, 1999, heard presentations in Washington, the \n     Northeast, and California about the benefits and concerns \n     related to RFG and the oxygenates; gathered the best \n     available information on the program and its effects; \n     identified key data gaps; and evaluated a series of \n     alternative recommendations based on their effects on: air \n     quality; water quality; and stability of fuel supply and \n     cost.\n\n\n       The Findings and Recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel\n\n     Findings\n       Based on its review of the issues, the Panel made the \n     following overall findings:\n       The distribution, use, and combustion of gasoline poses \n     risks to our environment and public health.\n       RFG provides considerable air quality improvements and \n     benefits for millions of US citizens.\n       The use of MTBE has raised the issue of the effects of both \n     MTBE alone and MTBE in gasoline. This panel was not \n     constituted to perform an independent comprehensive health \n     assessment and has chosen to rely on recent reports by \n     a number of state, national, and international health \n     agencies. What seems clear, however, is that MTBE, due to \n     its persistence and mobility in water, is more likely to \n     contaminate ground and surface water than the other \n     components of gasoline.\n       MTBE has been found in a number of water supplies \n     nationwide, primarily causing consumer odor and taste \n     concerns that have led water suppliers to reduce use of those \n     supplies. Incidents of MTBE in drinking water supplies at \n     levels well above EPA and state guidelines and standards have \n     occurred, but are rare. The Panel believes that the \n     occurrence of MTBE in drinking water supplies can and should \n     be substantially reduced.\n       MTBE is currently an integral component of the U.S. \n     gasoline supply both in terms of volume and octane. As such, \n     changes in its use, with the attendant capital construction \n     and infrastructure modifications, must be implemented with \n     sufficient time, certainty, and flexibility to maintain the \n     stability of both the complex U.S. fuel supply system and \n     gasoline prices.\n       The following recommendations are intended to be \n     implemented as a single package of actions designed to \n     simultaneously maintain air quality benefits while enhancing \n     water quality protection and assuring a stable supply at \n     reasonable cost. The majority of these recommendations could \n     be implemented by federal and state environmental agencies \n     without further legislative action, and we would urge their \n     rapid implementation. We would, as well, urge all parties to \n     work with Congress to implement those of our recommendations \n     that require legislative action.\n     Recommendations to enhance water protection\n       Based on its review of the existing federal, state and \n     local programs to protect, treat, and remediate water \n     supplies, the Blue Ribbon Panel makes the following \n     recommendations to enhance, accelerate, and expand existing \n     programs to improve protection of drinking water supplies \n     from contamination.\n       Prevention\n       1. EPA, working with the states, should take the following \n     actions to enhance significantly the Federal and State \n     Underground Storage Tank programs.\n       a. Accelerate enforcement of the replacement of existing \n     bank systems to conform with the federally-required December \n     22, 1998 deadline for upgrade, including, at a minimum, \n     moving to have all states prohibit fuel deliveries to non-\n     upgraded tanks, and adding enforcement and compliance \n     resources to ensure prompt enforcement action, especially in \n     areas using RFG and Wintertime Oxyfuel.\n       b. Evaluate the field performance of current system design \n     requirements and technology and, based on that evaluation, \n     improve system requirements to minimize leaks/releases, \n     particularly in vulnerable areas (see recommendations on \n     Wellhead Protection Program in 2, below).\n       c. Strengthen release detection requirements to enhance \n     early detection, particularly in vulnerable areas, and to \n     ensure rapid repair and remediation.\n       d. Require monitoring and reporting of MTBE and other \n     ethers in groundwater at all UST release sites.\n       e. Encourage states to require that the proximity to \n     drinking water supplies, and the potential to impact those \n     supplies, be considered in land-use planning and permitting \n     decisions for siting of new UST facilities and petroleum \n     pipelines.\n       f. Implement and/or expand programs to train and license \n     UST system installers and maintenance personnel.\n       g. Work with Congress to examine and, if needed, expand the \n     universe of regulated tanks to include underground and \n     aboveground fuel storage systems that are not currently \n     regulated yet pose substantial risk to drinking water \n     supplies.\n       2. EPA should work with its state and local water supply \n     partners to enhance implementation of the Federal and State \n     Safe Drinking Water Act programs to:\n       a. Accelerate, particularly in those areas where RFG or \n     Oxygenated Fuel is used, the assessments of drinking water \n     source protection areas required in Section 1453 of the 1996 \n     Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments.\n       b. Coordinate the Source Water Assessment program in each \n     state with federal and state Underground Storage Tank \n     Programs using geographic information and other advanced data \n     systems to determine the location of drinking water sources \n     and to identify UST sites within source protection zones.\n       c. Accelerate currently-planned implementation of testing \n     for and reporting of MTBE in public drinking water supplies \n     to occur before 2001.\n       d. Increase ongoing federal, state, and local efforts in \n     Wellhead Protection Areas including: enhanced permitting, \n     design, and system installation requirements for USTs and \n     pipelines in these areas; strengthened efforts to ensure that \n     non-operating USTs are properly closed; enhanced UST release \n     prevention and detection; and improved inventory management \n     of fuels.\n       3. EPA should work with states and localities to enhance \n     their efforts to protect lakes and reservoirs that serve as \n     drinking water supplies by restricting use of recreational \n     water craft, particularly those with older motors.\n       4. EPA should work with other federal agencies, the states, \n     and private sector partners to implement expanded programs to \n     protect private well users, including, but not limited to:\n       a. A nationwide assessment of the incidence of \n     contamination of private wells by components of gasoline as \n     well as by other common contaminants in shallow groundwater;\n       b. Broad-based outreach and public education programs for \n     owners and users of private wells on preventing, detecting, \n     and treating contamination;\n       c. Programs to encourage and facilitate regular water \n     quality testing of private wells.\n       5. Implement, through public-private partnerships, expanded \n     public Education programs at the federal, state, and local \n     levels on the proper handling and disposal of gasoline.\n       6. Develop and implement an integral field research program \n     into the groundwater behavior of gasoline and oxygenates, \n     including:\n       a. Identifying and initiating research at a population of \n     UST release sites and nearby drinking waters suppliers \n     including sites with MTBE, sites with ethanol, and sites \n     using no oxygenate;\n       b. Conducting broader, comparative studies of levels of \n     MTBE, ethanol, benzene, and other gasoline compounds in \n     drinking water supplies in areas using primarily MTBE, areas \n     using primarily ethanol, and areas using no or lower levels \n     of oxygenate.\n       Treatment and remediation\n       7. EPA should work with Congress to expand resources \n     available for the up-front funding of the treatment of \n     drinking water supplies contaminated with MTBE and other \n     gasoline components to ensure that affected supplies can be \n     rapidly treated and returned to service, or that an \n     alternative water supply can be provided. This could take a \n     number of forms, including but not limited to:\n       a. Enhancing the existing Federal Leaking Underground \n     Storage Tank Trust Fund by fully appropriating the annual \n     available amount in the Fund, ensuring that treatment of \n     contaminated drinking water supplies can be funded, and \n     streamlining the procedures for obtaining funding.\n       b. Establishing another form of funding mechanism which \n     ties the funding more directly to the source of \n     contamination.\n       c. Encouraging states to consider targeting State Revolving \n     Funds (SRF) to help accelerate treatment and remediation in \n     high priority areas.\n       8. Given the different behavior of MTBE in groundwater when \n     compared to other components of gasoline, states in RFG and \n     Oxyfuel areas should reexamine and enhance state and federal \n     ``triage'' procedures for prioritizing remediation efforts at \n     UST sites based on their proximity to drinking water \n     supplies.\n       9. Accelerate laboratory and field research, and pilot \n     projects, for the development and implementation of cost-\n     effective water supply treatment and remediation technology, \n     and harmonize these efforts with other public/private efforts \n     underway.\n     Recommendations for blending fuel for clean air and water\n       Based on its review of the current water protection \n     programs, and the likely progress that can be made in \n     tightening and strengthening those programs by implementing \n     Recommendations 1-9 above, the Panel agreed\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\n     broadly, although not unanimously, that even enhanced \n     protection programs will not give adequate assurance that \n     water supplies will be protected, and that changes need to be \n     made to the RFG program to reduce the amount of MTBE being \n     used, while ensuring that the air quality benefits of RFG, \n     and fuel supply and price stability, are maintained.\n       Given the complexity of the national fuel system, the \n     advantages and disadvantages of each of the fuel blending \n     options the Panel considered (see Appendix A), and the need \n     to maintain the air quality benefits of the current program, \n     the Panel recommends an integrated package of actions by both \n     Congress and EPA that should be implemented as quickly as \n     possible. The key elements of that package, described in more \n     detail below, are:\n       Action agreed to broadly by the Panel to reduce the use of \n     MTBE substantially (with some members supporting its complete \n     phase out), and action by Congress to clarify federal and \n     state authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of \n     gasoline additives that threaten drinking water supplies;\n       Action by Congress to remove the current 2% oxygen \n     requirement to ensure that adequate fuel supplies can be \n     blended in a cost-effective manner while quickly reducing \n     usage of MTBE; and\n       Action by EPA to ensure that there is no loss of current \n     air quality benefits.\n       The oxygen requirement\n       10. The current clean Air Act requirement to require 2% \n     oxygen, by weight, in RFG must be removed in order to provide \n     flexibility to blend adequate fuel supplies in a cost-\n     effective manner while quickly reducing usage of MTBE and \n     maintaining air quality benefits.\n       The panel recognizes that Congress, when adopting the \n     oxygen requirement, sought to advance several national policy \n     goals (energy security and diversity, agricultural policy, \n     etc) that are beyond the scope of our expertise and \n     deliberations.\n       The panel further recognizes that if Congress acts on the \n     recommendation to remove the requirement, Congress will \n     likely seek other legislative mechanisms to fulfill these \n     other national policy interests.\n       Maintaining air benefits\n       11. Present toxic emission performance of RFG can be \n     attributed, to some degree, to a combination of three primary \n     factors: (1) mass emission performance requirements, (2) the \n     use of oxygenates, and (3) a necessary compliance margin with \n     a per gallon standard. In Cal RFG, caps on specific \n     components of fuel is an additional factor to which toxics \n     emission reductions can be attributed.\n       Outside of California, lifting the oxygen requirement as \n     recommended above may lead to fuel reformulations that \n     achieve the minimum performance standards required under the \n     1990 Act, rather than the larger air quality benefits \n     currently observed. In addition, changes in the RFG program \n     could have adverse consequences for conventional gasoline as \n     well.\n       Within California, lifting the oxygen requirement will \n     result in greater flexibility to maintain and enhance \n     emission reductions, particularly as California pursues new \n     formulation requirements for gasoline.\n       In order to ensure that there is no loss of current air \n     quality benefits, EPA should seek appropriate mechanisms for \n     both the RFG Phase II and Conventional Gasoline programs to \n     define and maintain in RFG II the real world performance \n     observed in RFG Phase I while preventing deterioration of the \n     current air quality performance of conventional gasoline.\\2\\\n       There are several possible mechanisms to accomplish this. \n     One obvious way is to enhance the mass-based performance \n     requirements currently used in the program. At the same time, \n     the panel recognizes that the different exhaust components \n     pose differential risks to public health due in large degree \n     to their variable potency. The panel urges EPA to explore and \n     implement mechanisms to achieve equivalent or improved public \n     health results that focus on reducing those compounds that \n     pose the greatest risk.\n       Reducing the use of MTBE\n       12. The Panel agreed broadly that, in order to minimize \n     current and future threats to drinking water, the use of MTBE \n     should be reduced substantially. Several members believed \n     that the use of MTBE should be phased out completely. The \n     Panel recommends that Congress act quickly to clarify federal \n     and state authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of \n     gasoline additives that pose a threat to drinking water \n     supplies.\\3\\\n       Initial efforts to reduce should begin immediately, with \n     substantial reductions to begin as soon as Recommendation 10 \n     above--the removal of the 2% oxygen requirement--is \n     implemented.\\4\\ Accomplishing any such major change in the \n     gasoline supply without disruptions to fuel supply and price \n     will require adequate lead time--up to 4 years if the use of \n     MTBE is eliminated, sooner in the case of a substantial \n     reduction (e.g. returning to historical levels of MTBE \n     use).\n       The Panel recommends, as well, that any reduction should be \n     designed so as to not result in an increase in MTBE use in \n     Conventional Gasoline areas.\n       13. The other ethers (e.g. ETBE, TAME, and DIPE) have been \n     less widely used and less widely studied than MTBE. To the \n     extent that they have been studied, they appear to have \n     similar, but not identical, chemical and hydrogeologic \n     characteristics. The Panel recommends accelerated study of \n     the health effects and groundwater characteristics of these \n     compounds before they are allowed to be placed in widespread \n     use.\n       In addition, EPA and others should accelerate ongoing \n     research effortsd into the inhalation and ingestion health \n     effects, air emission transformation byproducts, and \n     environmental behavior of all oxygenates and other components \n     likely to increase in the absence of MTBE. This should \n     include research on ethanol, alkylates, and aromatics, as \n     well as of gasoline compositions containing those components.\n       14. To ensure that any reduction is adequate to protect \n     water supplies, the Panel recommends that EPA, in conjunction \n     with USGS, the Departments of Agriculture and Energy, \n     industry, and water suppliers, should move quickly to:\n       a. Conduct short-term modeling analyses and other research \n     based on existing data to estimate current and likely future \n     threats of contamination;\n       b. Establish routine systems to collect and publish, at \n     least annually, all available monitoring data on: use of \n     MTBE, other ethers, and Ethanol; levels of MTBE, Ethanol, and \n     petroleum hydrocarbons found in ground, surface and drinking \n     water; and trends in detections and levels of MTBE, Ethanol, \n     and petroleum hydrocarbons in ground and drinking water;\n       c. Identify and begin to collect additional data necessary \n     to adequately assist the current and potential future state \n     of contamination.\n       The Wintertime Oxyfuel Program\n       The Wintertime Oxyfuel Program continues to provide a means \n     for some areas of the country to come into, or maintain, \n     compliance with the Carbon Monoxide standard. Only a few \n     metropolitan areas continue to use MTBE in this program. In \n     most areas today, ethanol can and is meeting these wintertime \n     needs for oxygen without raising volatility concerns given \n     the season.\n       15. The Panel recommends that the Wintertime Oxyfuel \n     program be continued (a) for as long as it provides a useful \n     compliance and and/or maintenance tool for the affected \n     states and metropolitan areas, and (b) assuming that the \n     clarification of state and federal authority described above \n     is enacted to enable states, where necessary, to regulate \n     and/or eliminate the use of gasoline addictives that threaten \n     drinking water supplies.\n     Recommendations for evaluating and learning from experience\n       The introduction of reformulated gasoline has had \n     substantial air quality benefits, but has at the same time \n     raised significant issues about the questions that should be \n     asked before widespread introduction of a new, broadly-used \n     product. The unanticipated effects of RFG on groundwater \n     highlight the importance of exploring the potential for \n     adverse effects in all media (air, soil, and water), and on \n     human and ecosystem health, before widespread introduction of \n     any new, broadly-used, product.\n       16. In order to prevent future such incidents, and to \n     evaluate of the effectiveness and the impacts of the RFG \n     program, EPA should:\n       d. Conduct a full, multi-media assessment (of effects on \n     air, soil, and water) of any major new addictive to gasoline \n     prior to its introduction.\n       e. Establish routine and stastistically valid methods for \n     assessing the actual composition of RFG and its air quality \n     benefits, including the development, to the maximum extent \n     possible, of field monitoring and emissions characterization \n     techniques to assess ``real world'' effects of different \n     blends on emissions.\n       f. Establish a routine process, perhaps as a part of the \n     Annual Air Quality trends reporting process, for reporting on \n     the air quality results from the RFG program.\n       g. Build on existing public health surveillance systems to \n     measure the broader impact (both beneficial and adverse) of \n     changes in gasoline formulations on public health and the \n     environment.\n\n\n                               appendix a\n\n       In reviewing the RFG program, the panel identified three \n     main options (MTBE and other ethers, ethanol, and a \n     combination of alkylates and aromatics) for blending to meet \n     air quality requirements. They identified strength and \n     weaknesses of each option:\n       MTBE/other ethers--A cost-effective fuel blending component \n     that provides high octane, carbon monoxide and exhaust VOCs \n     emissions benefits, and appears to contribute to reduction of \n     the use of aromatics with related toxics and other air \n     quality benefits; has high solubility and low \n     biodegradability in groundwater, leading to increased \n     detections in drinking water, particularly in high MTBE use \n     areas. Other ethers, such as ETBE, appear to have similar, \n     but not identical, behavior in water, suggesting that more \n     needs to be learned before widespread use.\n       Ethanol--An effective fuel-blending component, made from \n     domestic grain and potentially from recycled biomass, that \n     provides high octane, carbon monoxide emission benefits, and \n     appears to contribute to reduction of the use of aromatics \n     with related toxics and other air quality benefits; can be \n     blended to maintain low fuel volatility; could raise \n     possibility of increased ozone precursor emissions as a \n     result of commingling in gas tanks if ethanol is not present \n     in a majority of fuels; is produced currently primarily in \n     Midwest, requiring enhancement of infrastructure to meet \n     broader demand; because of high biodegradability, may\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\n     retard biodegradation and increase movement of benzene and \n     other hydrocarbons around leaking tanks.\n       Blends of Alkylates and Aromatics--Effective fuel blending \n     components made from crude oil; alkylates provide lower \n     octane than oxygenates; increased use of aromatics will \n     likely result in higher air toxics emissions than current \n     RFG; would require enhancement of infrastructure to meet \n     increased demand; have groundwater characteristics similar, \n     but not identical, to other components of gasoline (i.e., low \n     solubility and intermediate biodegradability).\n\n\n                               appendix b\n\n     Members of the Blue Ribbon Panel\n       Dan Greenbaum, Health Effects Institute, Chair.\n       Mark Buehler, Metropolitan Water District, So.

Sneller, Member EPA Blue Ribbon Panel)\n\n       (The complete text of Mr. Sneller's dissenting opinion on \n     the Panel's recommendation to eliminate the federal oxygen \n     standard for reformulated gasoline has been submitted for \n     inclusion in the final report and recommendations of the Blue \n     Ribbon Panel.)\n       In its report regarding the use of oxygenates in gasoline, \n     a majority of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline \n     recommends that action be taken to eliminate the current \n     oxygen standard for reformulated gasoline. Based on \n     legislative history, public policy objectives, and \n     information presented to the Panel, I do not concur with this \n     specific recommendation. The basis for my position follows:\n       1. The Panel's report concludes that aromatics can be used \n     as a safe and effective replacement for oxygenates without \n     resulting in deterioration in VOC and toxic emissions. In \n     fact, a review of the legislative history behind the passage \n     of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 clearly shows that \n     Congress found the increased use of aromatics to be harmful \n     to human health and intended that their use in gasoline be \n     reduced as much as technically feasible.\n       2. The Panel's report concludes that oxygenates fail to \n     provide overwhelming air quality benefits associated with \n     their required use in gasoline. The Panel recommendations, in \n     my opinion, do not accurately reflect the benefits provided \n     by the use of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline. Congress \n     correctly saw a minimum oxygenate requirement as a cost \n     effective means to both reduce levels of harmful aromatics \n     and help rid the air we breathe of harmful pollutants.\n       3. The Panel's recommendation to urge removal of the oxygen \n     standard does not fully take into account other public policy \n     objectives specifically identified during Congressional \n     debate on the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. While projected \n     benefits related to public health were a focal point during \n     the debate in 1990, energy security, national security, the \n     environment and economic impact of the Amendments were \n     clearly part of the rationale for adopting such amendments. \n     It is my belief that the rationale behind adoption of the \n     Amendments in 1990 is equally valid, if not more so, today.\n       Congress thoughtfully considered and debated the benefits \n     of reducing aromatics and requiring the use of oxygenates in \n     reformulated gasoline before adopting the oxygenate \n     provisions in 1990. Based on the weight of evidence presented \n     to the Panel, I remain convinced that maintenance of the \n     oxygenate standard is necessary to ensure cleaner air and a \n     healthier environment. I am also convinced that water quality \n     must be better protected through significant improvements to \n     gasoline storage tanks and containment facilities. Therefore, \n     because it is directly counter to the weight of the vast \n     majority of scientific and technical evidence and the clear \n     intent of Congress, I respectfully disagree with the Panel \n     recommendation that the oxygenate provisions of the federal \n     reformulated gasoline program be removed from current law.\n\n        Lyondell Chemical Company--Summary of Dissenting Report\n\n       While the Panel is to be commended on a number of good \n     recommendations to improve the current underground storage \n     tank regulations and reduce the improper use of gasoline, the \n     Panel's recommendations to limit the use of MTBE are not \n     justified.\n       Firstly, the Panel was charged to review public health \n     effects posed by use of oxygenates, particularly with respect \n     to water contamination. The Panel did not identify any \n     increased public health risk associated with MTBE use in \n     gasoline.\n       Secondly, no quantifiable evidence was provided to show the \n     environmental risk to drinking water from leaking underground \n     storage tanks (LUST) will not be reduced to manageable levels \n     once the 1998 LUST regulations are fully implemented and \n     enforced. The water contamination data relied upon by the \n     panel is largely misleading because it predates the \n     implementation of the LUST regulations.\n       Thirdly, the recommendations fall short in preserving the \n     air quality benefits achieved with oxygenate use in the \n     existing RFG program. The air quality benefits achieved by \n     the RFG program will be degraded because they fall outside \n     the control of EPA's Complex Model used for RFG regulations \n     and because the alternatives do not match all of MTBE's \n     emission and gasoline quality improvements.\n       Lastly, the recommendations will impose an unnecessary \n     additional cost of 1 to 3 billion dollars per year (3-7 c/\n     gal. RFG) on consumers and society without quantifiable \n     offsetting social benefits or avoided costs with respect to \n     water quality in the future.\n       Unfortunately, there appears to be an emotional rush to \n     judgment to limit the use of MTBE. For the forgoing reasons, \n     Lyondell dissents from the Panel report regarding the \n     following recommendations:\n       The recommendation to reduce the use of MTBE substantially \n     is unwarranted given that no increased public health risk \n     associated with its use has been identified by the Panel.\n       The recommendation to maintain air quality benefits of RFG \n     is narrowly limited to the use of EPA's RFG Complex Model \n     which does not reflect many of the vehicle emission benefits \n     realized with oxygenates as identified in the supporting \n     panel issue papers. Therefore, degradation of air quality \n     will occur and the ability to meet the Nation's Clean Air \n     Goals will suffer and under these recommendations.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Areas using RFG (2% by weight oxygen) and/or Oxyfuel \n     (2.7% by weight Oxygen)\n     \\2\\ The Panel is aware of the current proposal for further \n     changes to the sulfur levels of gasoline and recognizes that \n     implementation of any change resulting from the Panel's \n     recommendations will, of necessity, need to be coordinated \n     with implementation of these other changes. However, a \n     majority of the panel considered the maintenance of current \n     RFG air quality benefits as separate from any additional \n     benefits that might accrue from the sulfur changes currently \n     under consideration.\n     \\3\\ Under Sec. 211 of the 1990 Clean Air Act, Congress \n     provided EPA with authority to regulate fuel formulation to \n     improve air quality. In addition to EPA's national authority, \n     in Sec. 211(c)(4) Congress sought to balance the desire for \n     maximum uniformity in our nation's fuel supply with the \n     obligation to empower states to adopt measures necessary to \n     meet national air quality standards. Under Sec. 211(c)(4), \n     states may adopt regulations on the components of fuel, but \n     must demonstrate that (1) their proposed regulations are \n     needed to address a violation of the NAAQS and (2) it is not \n     possible to achieve the desired outcome without such changes.\n     The panel recommends that federal law be amended to clarify \n     EPA and state authority to regulate and/or eliminate gasoline \n     additives that threaten water supplies. It is expected that \n     this would be done initially on a national level to maintain \n     uniformity in the fuel supply. For further action by the \n     states, the granting of such authority should be based upon a \n     similar two part test:\n     (1) states must demonstrate that their water resources are at \n     risk from MTBE use, above and beyond the risk posed by other \n     gasoline components at levels of MTBE use present at the time \n     of the request.\n     (2) states have taken necessary measures to restrict/\n     eliminate the presence of gasoline in the water resource. To \n     maximize the uniformity with which any changes are \n     implemented and minimize impacts on cost and fuel supply, the \n     panel recommends that EPA establish criteria for state waiver \n     requests including but not limited to:\n     a. Water quality metrics necessary to demonstrate the risk to \n     water resources and air quality metrics to ensure no loss of \n     benefits from the federal RFG program.\n     b. Compliance with federal requirements to prevent leaking \n     and spilling of gasoline.\n     c. Programs for remediation and response.\n     d. A consistent schedule for state demonstrations, EPA \n     review, and any resulting regulation of the volume of \n     gasoline components in order to minimize disruption to the \n     fuel supply system.\n     \\4\\ Although a rapid, substantial reduction will require \n     removal of the oxygen requirement, EPA should, in order to \n     enable initial reductions to occur as soon as possible, \n     review administrative flexibility under existing law to allow \n     refiners who desire to make reductions to begin doing so.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say I admit I have not read \nthe study, as probably 98 other Members of the Senate tonight have not \nread it, which is the reason we ought to have the committee of \njurisdiction look at it.\n  Second, when we are talking about something leaking into ground water \nfrom tanks, my point is that this is a problem with tanks. We do not \nhave this problem in Texas. We have gone to\n\n[[Page S10189]]\n\ngreat lengths to try to deal with underground tanks that leak. We have \nrequired the tanks to be dug up in every old filling station in the \nState.\n  I think the Senator has raised a legitimate problem about leaking and \nunderground water sources. But the point is we need to fix the tanks. I \nknow of no study that suggests that fixing tanks does not solve the \nproblem.\n  In any case, I want to conclude so Senator Chafee and others can \nspeak. But I want to remind my colleagues that the EPA has the power to \nact in this area. I urge my colleagues not to put the Senate on record, \non a subject that we have relatively little knowledge about, on a farm \nbill, when we are talking about a policy that has profound \nenvironmental impact, including the potential for more air pollution \nbecause of the higher vapor pressure for ethanol as compared to MTBE; \nsecond, shortages of gasoline potentially in huge quantities of the \ncountry because of, one, eliminating the dominant oxygenate in fuels \nfrom consideration; and, second, the problem of transporting the \nalternative to MTBE; and, finally, the potential spike in gasoline \nprices that could occur.\n  This is simply a policy we ought to be dealing with in a systematic \nway. I am delighted the chairman of the committee is dealing with it \nbecause it is a serious problem.\n  I yield the floor. Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise in strong \nsupport of my colleague from California on this legislation. Senator \nGramm is one of my senior colleagues whom I respect as much as anybody \nin this body for his intelligence and hard work. On this issue, though, \nI respectfully disagree.\n  The EPA called for a study last November. They appointed a blue-\nribbon committee that did come up and look into the scientific \nevidence. On that blue-ribbon committee there were representatives, \nimportantly, of the oil industry, which would have an economic interest \nto see that MTBE not be done away with. This committee, this blue-\nribbon panel, had a representative from the American Petroleum \nInstitute and also an oil company. They said of MTBE in our Nation's \nfuel supply, that while all gasoline can possibly leak through an \nunderground storage tank into the ground water, they specifically \npointed out that MTBE is more dangerous when leaking into the ground \nwater than other gasoline components. That is on page 3 of the report.\n  They recommend that MTBE be phased out gradually. Senator Gramm \nbrings up a good point. We have to have an alternative. We may not have \nat the current moment the production capabilities to replace the MTBE \nall at once. But I do believe we have to act quickly because we are \ntalking about our Nation's ground water, and ground water contamination \nis very serious. In California it has been estimated that a \nlarge percentage of their ground water has been contaminated. This is a \npossible carcinogen. We cannot dawdle on an issue such as this. We have \nto move quickly.\n\n  Ethanol, as many of you know, can be used as an alternative to MTBE. \nWe do have an alternative that is environmentally safe and sound. Yes, \nit does help our American farmers. Not only does it help corn growers \nin my State, which is a major corn-producing State, but ethanol can be \nderived from wheat, from rice straws, even from potatoes and, yes, \npotentially it could help farmers all across the country if they could \nproduce the oxygenate for our reformulated fuel in this country.\n  So I am in strong support of this legislation. I think it is good \npublic policy for us to urge the EPA to act quickly. Our Nation's \nground water supply is at stake. We do not want this situation to go on \nany longer. We cannot afford to wait. We must act quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is a very complicated subject. It is \nnot only the pronunciation of MTBE that is complicated. The whole area \nof oxygenates as additives to gasoline adds to the complication that we \nface.\n  There have been several references, and aptly so, to the blue-ribbon \npanel that EPA established to look into MTBE and decide to the best of \nits ability what ought to be done. This blue-ribbon panel has just \nreported, so we have hardly had a chance to see it. I think it was a \nreport in the last 2 weeks. So we have hardly had a chance to see it.\n  I would point this out: The report looked to a reduction in the use \nof MTBE, whereas, if you note from the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nthat the Senator from California has, she looks to a complete \nphaseout--phaseout meaning end the production of, use of, MTBE, in \norder, she says, to address the threats posed by it.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, this is a complicated issue. We have \nhad two hearings on it in the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nwhich has jurisdiction over this matter, and we have been waiting for \nthe report which now has just come in. In September, I can promise \neveryone here that, indeed--the Senator from California is a member of \nour committee--we will have further hearings on it and decide what \nrecommendations we will make to the full Congress.\n  As has been pointed out, to just ban MTBE is not the way to go, \nrecognizing that even though the corn growers are anxious to fill the \ngap, they would themselves recognize there is just plain not enough \nethanol to take care of our Nation at this time.\n  I greatly urge my colleague, the Senator from California, to withdraw \nher amendment. We are going to have a hearing on it. She is going to \nhave an opportunity to have her views expressed come September, which \nis very close. Secondly, I urge my colleagues, absent the Senator from \nCalifornia withdrawing the amendment, to vote to table it and give us a \nchance within the committee to study not only the report itself but \njust to make up our minds in a bipartisan fashion what we think is the \nbest route to go.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for one question?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to make sure my chairman, who I absolutely \nrevere, has read that we do not say ``ban.'' We say ``phase out.'' That \nis a big difference. We phase it out so you make sure you are doing it \nin a wise fashion. That is exactly what Gov. Gray Davis said. I want to \nmake sure that is what we are calling for.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I did say ``phase out,'' that it was to end it. That is \nthe way I read it. Perhaps others may read it differently. My point is, \nwe have a real problem on our hands. We need a little time to examine \nthis, to give attention to the report, to consider it, and make our \nrecommendations.\n  In our committee, we are fortunate to have the chairman of the \nsubcommittee of jurisdiction, Senator Inhofe. I am sure he has some \ncomments in connection with this whole problem.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not mind yielding first to the \nSenator from Illinois to make his remarks and we can go back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \ngraciousness. There will be more to the debate if we take turns \nexpressing our points of view.\n  I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia and my colleague, the Senator from Illinois. I am happy to \njoin both of them as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  First, when we talk about methyl tertiary butyl ether, which we are \nfamiliar with in the Midwest, we have to put it in perspective of what \nrole it has played in terms of providing energy and whether or not it \nadds to problems with pollution, because that is the bottom line.\n  We are talking about additives to gasoline that we hope will clean up \nthe environment. That is why we have the program. That is why we are \nusing ethanol with MTBE because the bottom line is we want to say to \nAmericans: When you use your automobiles, the gasoline you use should \ncontain additives that make America a cleaner place--cleaner air and \ncleaner water. That is why the amendment of the Senator from California \nis so important because we no longer can trust MTBE to meet that \nmission goal.\n  The findings of the EPA blue-ribbon panel on oxygenates in gasoline \nwas reported last week. The panel confirmed\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\nmy long-held belief that MTBE poses a risk to ground water and to the \nhealth and safety of the American public.\n  I hope those who are following this debate will listen carefully to \nthe pervasive nature of MTBE when it occurs in the natural environment. \nMTBE, a petroleum-derived chemical, does not biodegrade. In 5 years of \nwidespread use, MTBE has become the second most commonly found chemical \nin ground water. It is second only to chloroform. One gallon of MTBE is \nenough to pollute 26 million gallons of water.\n\n  So when the Senator from Texas stands and says the problem is in the \nstorage tanks, I suggest to him, no, it goes far beyond that. The \nproblem is in two-cycle engines, for example, as you find on many boats \nwhich use MTBE additives in their fuels, and as they spray out the back \nof those engines, because of their fuel inefficiency, what they are \nspraying into reservoirs and water supplies across America is MTBE \nwhich is not biodegradable. When they test these water supplies, it is \nnot alone from leaking storage tanks but from the fact that this \nadditive is particularly sinister when it comes to the clean water \ngoals that we all share.\n  It has been labeled by the U.S. EPA as a carcinogen. If this additive \ndid not biodegrade and was benign, did not cause any health problems, \nwe would not be here. The fact is, whether it is a leaking storage tank \nor a two-cycle engine spraying it into Lake Decatur or Lake Springfield \nin Illinois, which also serve as water supplies, it increases the risk \nof cancer. That is why it is a particularly sinister additive, and that \nis why the amendment of the Senator from California is so important.\n  Let me give an example in my home State of the dangers of MTBE. Ten \nyears ago, a gasoline spill occurred in Kankakee, IL. To this day, MTBE \nstill contaminates that area's drinking water supply. It does not go \naway, and it causes cancer. It is carcinogenic.\n  With MTBE's future clearly in doubt, now is the time for us to really \nmake clear that corn-based ethanol, or many other crops which can be \nused as a base for ethanol, should step up to fill this void. Ethanol \ncurrently comprises about 15 percent of the reformulated gasoline \nprogram, including a successful effort in Chicago and Milwaukee. That \nis the top RFG, reformulated gasoline, market in the Nation, accounting \nfor 400 million gallons of ethanol demand, or approximately one-third \nof the industry's production.\n  Many of the arguments against the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia suggest since we do not have enough supply of ethanol at \nthis moment to replace MTBE, we ought to stick with it. As the blue-\nribbon panel found, and I think common sense tells us, you would not \nstick with an additive that is this dangerous, one that is so \npervasive, not biodegradable and carcinogenic. It is far better for us \nto set out a national program to expand ethanol production.\n  Naturally, many people are listening and we expect to hear: Durbin, \nyou are from Illinois where they produce most of the ethanol and \nprimarily from one company.\n  I will concede that fact. I am open to suggestions for legislation to \nincrease ethanol nationwide from a variety of sources. I think it is \ngood. It will create better competition and may develop better \nstandards for manufacturers to bring down the cost. I will certainly \nsupport it whatever State wants to engage in ethanol production.\n  It is also important to note that recent studies have found that \nethanol and MTBE are essentially equivalent in terms of their effect on \nozone; that is, in reducing air pollution, so we are not losing in this \ntradeoff moving from MTBE to ethanol. In fact, we are holding our \nground with a much safer additive.\n  Ethanol has lower carbon monoxide emissions and reduced reactivity, \nalong with a lower incidence of environmental contamination when \ncompared to MTBE.\n  Instead of shelving the RFG oxygenate requirements--that additive \nthat makes it safer for the requirement--it would be in our country's \nbest interest to expand the use of a safe oxygenate such as ethanol. \nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture and industry data demonstrate that \nadequate supplies of ethanol would exist to meet the oxygenate \nrequirement in a cost-effective manner with a gradual phaseout of MTBE.\n  I say to my friend--a man I also respect--from the State of Rhode \nIsland that we are not talking about an instantaneous ban on MTBE. \nInstead, we are talking about a phaseout of the use of this additive as \nwe increase the production of the safer additive, the oxygenate \nethanol. In fact, ethanol blends with reformulated gas would be more \ncost effective than nonoxygenated gasoline.\n\n  We need to look no further than rural America to understand the \nbenefits an ethanol-based RFG program would have on our ag economy. The \nUSDA is predicting a bumper corn crop of 9.7 billion bushels. Farm \nprices are in a free-fall, and we need to find alternative uses for our \nagricultural bounty.\n  Illinois annually produces about 40 percent of the nearly 1.5 billion \ngallons of ethanol. Illinois corn accounts for about 17 percent of the \ncrop use for ethanol. As you drive or fly over the Midwest and look \ndown on those cornfields, one out of six of those cornfields is \ndedicated to go into processing and come out as ethanol, which we burn \nin our automobiles. This allows ethanol to gradually replace MTBE as a \ngreat benefit to our fragile rural economy.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Boxer and Senator Fitzgerald on her \namendment and urge my colleagues from both rural and urban States to \nsupport this important effort to encourage the phaseout of MTBE and the \npromotion of ethanol as an alternative.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know Senator Inhofe is patiently waiting, and he is \nchair of the Clean Air Subcommittee, as my chairman, Senator Chafee, \nhas stated, but it is important to know, and I want to know if my \nfriend is aware, that the chairman of the Drinking Water Subcommittee, \nSenator Crapo, is an original coauthor of this.\n  I want to make the point of my friend that we have a situation that \nthis additive was to clean the air, and now we find out it is poisoning \nthe water, and we cannot get it out of the drinking water. The more we \nlet this thing go, without phasing it out, my friend is absolutely \nright, the more expensive it gets, the more of a problem it is, the \nmore poison is spread. To sit here and wait around does not seem to \nmake much sense.\n  I also ask my friend if he is aware that we have large numbers of \nenvironmental organizations that support this, along with many in the \nfarm community, including the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society, and \nCommunities for a Better Environment. I hope my friend asks that we \nplace that in the Record. I wonder if he is aware that Senator Crapo \nbrings a lot of authority, I think, to this particular debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. I was not aware of \nall the details.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the document evidencing the \norganizations supporting the Boxer amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Bluewater Network,\n\n                                                   August 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Bluewater Network and the following \n     signatories strongly support S. 1037 to climinate MTBE use \n     nationwide. Extensive investigation into the hazards of MTBE \n     demonstrates that continued use of this oxygenate will \n     further jeopardize U.S. water supplies and undercut the \n     public's right to clean drinking water, shoulder water and \n     regulatory agencies with unprecedented liabilities and cost \n     burdens, and seriously threaten public health.\n       S. 1037 targets three key areas:\n       (1) It provides EPA with the authority to immediately \n     prohibit MTBE in sensitive or at-risk communities. This will \n     save many areas millions of taxpayer dollars in clean up and \n     liability costs. California alone faces an estimated $1 to $2 \n     billion in MTBE cost. This provision also allows EPA to react \n     swiftly to contamination sites, and effectively prioritize \n     public health.\n       (2) It immediately restricts the use of MTBE to areas where \n     oxygenates are required by the Clean Air Act. This is a \n     common sense approach which will minimize the use and the \n     impacts of MTBE during the phase-out.\n       Voluntary use of MTBE is common throughout the country. \n     Almost all of California's gasoline contains MTBE, while only \n     Los Angeles, San Diego, and Sacramento are required to use \n     oxygenates. MTBE use in\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\n     non-oxygenated zones may increase during a phase-out for \n     various economic reasons involving fuel supply and \n     distribution. For example, Chevron and Tosco recently \n     increased their use of MTBE in Northern California--where \n     oxygenates are not required--despite their agreement with \n     Governor Davis to cooperate with California's MTBE phase-out. \n     Providing immediate restrictions on MTBE in non-oxygenated \n     zones will prevent needless MTBE contamination, and ensure \n     that the use of the chemical does not spread further into \n     these areas.\n       (3) It provides an investigation into the impacts of \n     ethanol, olefins, aromatics, and alkylates which will provide \n     critical information about the impacts of banning MTBE, the \n     general effectiveness of oxygenates, and the overall benefits \n     of the federal Reformulated Gasoline Program. We strongly \n     recommend Senator Boxer include the study of ``other ether-\n     based additives'' in this section to adequately assess the \n     feasibility and risks of chemical additives with similar \n     properties as MTBE (e.g. TAME, ETBE). The elimination of \n     MTBE, and especially the use of non-oxygenated fuels proposed \n     by some refiners, necessitates fuel blending adjustments \n     which employ these chemicals. These studies will ensure that \n     the impacts of non-MTBE fuels are fully realized.\n       We commend Senator Boxer's efforts to combat the MTBE \n     problem nationally. Neither improving underground storage \n     tanks, banning two-stroke engines, and/or lifting the Clean \n     Air Act's oxygen mandate will prevent continued use of the \n     additive, nor will such steps protect our most critical \n     resources and public health from ongoing MTBE contamination.\n       S. 1037 provides critical protections against the inherent \n     risks of MTBE use, and phases out a chemical known to be a \n     significant threat to public health.\n       We look forward to working with you on this issue. If we \n     can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact \n     us. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brooke Coleman,\n                                              Project Coordinator.\n                                              Russell Long, Ph.D.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n\n                              Signatories\n\n       Friends of the Earth, Brent Blackwelder.\n       International Rivers Network, Patrick McCully.\n       Audubon Society, Cassandra Lista.\n       Sierra Club, National Marine Wildlife and Habitat \n     Committee, Vivian Newman.\n       Communities for a Better Environment, Denny Larson.\n       Animal Rights Foundation, Doe McCaffrey.\n       Backcountry Skiers Alliance, Lynn Buhlig.\n       Campaign to Safeguard America's Waters, Gershon Cohen.\n       Concerned Citizens, Renee Chapotel.\n       Earth Island Institute, John Knox.\n       Earth Island Journal, Gar Smith.\n       Earth Rescue, Ian Looney.\n       GaiaLink, Marv Lyons.\n       Hells Canyon Preservation Council, Brenda Schweitzer.\n       Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Andi Weiss Bartczak.\n       Institute of Social Studies, Isaack Otienno.\n       If Not Now, Phil Mitchell.\n       Lake Hamilton Safety Supporters, Stan Cothren.\n       North Farm Cooperative, Sarah Wepman.\n       Ocean Advocates, Fred Felleman.\n       Architects, Designers, Planners for Social Responsibility, \n     Kay Yeuell.\n       Pinniped-Fisheries Project, Laura Seligsohn.\n       San Francisco BayKeeper, Mike Lozeau.\n       Save Our Shores, Vicki Nichols.\n       Coalition to Stop Vail Expansion, Emily Wolf.\n       Site for Social Action, Doug Casner.\n       Surfers Tired of Pollution, Donna Frye.\n       World Stewardship Institute, Sarah Nossaman.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when I heard that the Senator from \nCalifornia was going to bring up her amendment, I came down to the \nfloor. Quite frankly, I came down carrying the credentials of the blue-\nribbon committee. I think there is one thing on which we can all agree: \nIf you actually read the recommendations of the committee, they are not \nconsistent with the amendment that is offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  We have 13 people on the panel. They are from industry, they are from \nsome of the environmentalist groups, chaired by Dan Greenbaum of the \nHealth Effects Institute. I think it is important that we read what \nthis blue-ribbon committee recommends.\n  What they recommend is that they are not through yet. I will just \nread a couple of the recommendations here. They recommend that MTBE \nshould be reduced but not banned. They said that oxygenate mandates \nshould be eliminated. This amendment would increase mandates, not \neliminate them. They said that benefits of ethanol need to be studied \nmore. They did not say they have already been proven scientifically.\n  If there is one thing that has bothered me about the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, it is that some of the things that come out are \nnot based on sound science. In this case, we do have the beginning of \nsound science. We have a recommendation by a blue-ribbon committee, \nmade up of 13 people who are very professional and should represent all \naspects of this issue.\n  Anyway, that is not what their recommendation is. They said that we \nshould not ban MTBE, considering all alternatives and benefits. In \naddition to use as an oxygenate, MTBE is also used as an oxygenate \nenhancer. I think this has not been brought out. There is a reason for \nMTBE to be included.\n  As far as the use of ethanol, as far as the report is concerned, the \nenvironmental benefits are in question. The blue-ribbon panel \nrecommended that it further be studied before its use is increased. \nThat is what the recommendations were of this committee. I think we \nhave plenty of time to have the hearings, as we have discussed.\n  There is another thing that has not been talked about. That is, if we \nwere to adopt the Boxer amendment, some amount of money would have to \ncome from the highway trust fund. Ethanol users receive a tax credit at \nthe current time, and at the end of each year it comes out of the \nhighway trust fund. Therefore, each of our States will have their \nhighway funds reduced if this amendment should pass.\n  It is not possible to switch to ethanol right away, as the Senator \nfrom California suggests. We do not have the national infrastructure to \ntransport the ethanol. A lot of people are not aware that this cannot \nbe added at the refinery; it has to be added at the rack where the \nfuels are mixed.\n  On health effects, only 1 percent of the detections of MTBE in water \nhas met the threshold for smell, which is below the threshold for human \nhealth effects. I really think if we want to use, as our basis, our \ndecision on this amendment being the blue-ribbon panel recommendations, \nwe ought to go ahead and not pass the amendment, allow Senator Chafee \nand me, as chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, to have \nhearings. We are going to have hearings on this, on the blue-ribbon \ncommittee, in September. We are prepared to do that.\n  This is a drastic step. It is something we do not want to get into \nunless we are sure. If you read the report, it says: Do not do it now. \nStudy it. The results are not in. We will have to make further \nrecommendations.\n  We are willing to have the committee hearing on this. I can just give \nyou my word at this time we will have it probably sometime in \nSeptember.\n  I yield the floor or yield for questions.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I just respond to my friend from \nOklahoma by saying that they can still go ahead and have the hearings \nand everything else after we adopt the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. \nNothing prevents the committee from going ahead and meeting and having \nthe blue-ribbon panel appear, and proceed with hearings. But we ought \nto express ourselves here as to the health issues that confront us.\n  I also point out to my friend from Oklahoma that I was reading the \nblue-ribbon panel's page here on this, and I thought I might read the \npertinent parts because it is not quite exactly as my friend from \nOklahoma said.\n  On page 6 it says: ``Recommendations for Blending Fuel for Clean Air \nand Water.''\n\n       Based on its review of the current water protection \n     programs, and the likely progress that can be made in \n     tightening and strengthening those programs by implementing \n     Recommendations 1-9 above, the Panel agreed broadly, although \n     not unanimously, that even enhanced protection programs will \n     not give adequate assurance that water supplies will be \n     protected, and that changes need to be made to the RFG [the \n     reformulated gasoline] program to reduce the amount of MTBE \n     being used, while ensuring that the air quality benefits of \n     RFG, and fuel supply and price stability, are maintained.\n\n  The next paragraph said:\n\n       The key elements of that package, described in more detail \n     below, are:\n       Action agreed to broadly by the Panel to reduce the use of \n     MTBE substantially (with some members supporting its complete\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\n     phaseout), and action by Congress to clarify federal and \n     state authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of \n     gasoline additives that threaten drinking water supplies. . .\n\n  So I think it is quite clear where they are headed on that: To reduce \nMTBE use substantially. Some members even wanted its total elimination.\n  Mr. President, what we are talking about here is a health issue. I \nfind it astounding----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  The Senator was reading from the report. I would like to read the \nnext paragraph that he overlooked. It says they are recommending:\n\n       Action by Congress to remove the current 2% oxygen \n     requirement--\n\n  That is right before ethanol--\n\n     to ensure that adequate fuel supplies can be blended in a \n     cost-effective manner while quickly reducing usage of MTBE. . \n     . .\n\n  Exactly the opposite of what the Senator from California is trying to \ndo with her amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I beg to differ. The blue-ribbon panel's conclusions \nsupport the Senator's resolution. What we are talking about is phasing \nout MTBE, and encouraging the use of ethanol--an oxygenate that reduces \nair pollution and at the same time does not contaminate water supplies \nor adversely affect health.\n  That is what we are talking about. I was responding to the point of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma about what the blue-ribbon panel was saying. \nThey were clearly saying that we ought to substantially reduce or \neliminate the use of MTBE. They want to make sure we have a fuel supply \nthat is not a health hazard to our people. That is what they are \nsaying. That is really the issue before us. It is a health issue, pure \nand simple.\n  Again, I find it astounding that people can argue and say: We have a \nlot of MTBE out there; forget that it is a possible human carcinogen; \nforget that it is highly polluting; let's go ahead and keep using it \nbecause, quite frankly, we don't have anything to replace it with right \nnow. That is the sort of argument that is being used.\n  I thought the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, laid out quite \nsuccinctly how dangerous MTBE is. We have been told, first by the \nSenator from Texas, that it is just a matter of leaking tanks. Well, \nthat is not just it at all. Senator Durbin pointed out motor boats, \nmotor skis, everything else, lawn mowers, motorcycles, airplanes, \neverything else that is using MTBE all leak a little bit, and every \ntime it leaks, MTBE gets into the surface water and ground water.\n  One might say: Well, it is the gasoline leak that is the problem, and \nnot what is in the gasoline. But when you have a gasoline leak, most of \nthe components in gasoline, tend to break down. MTBE breaks down very \nlittle and very slowly, and it permeates rapidly. It is highly soluble \nin water, when it gets in water. If you put some oil in water, it \ndoesn't mix. It can be separated out. But when MTBE gets in water, \nbecause of its chemical properties, it permeates the water quite \nrapidly, and that is what makes it so tough to get it out. It is not \nlike oil or gasoline in water at all. It is highly soluble in the \nwater.\n  As Senator Durbin pointed out, the U.S. Geologic Survey has found \nthat MTBE is the second most commonly found contaminant in ground \nwater. But it has been in widespread use for only about 7 years. The \nsecond most prevalent contaminant in ground water in the United States, \nin a matter of only 7 years. EPA estimates that MTBE already can be \ndetected in 5 to 10 percent of water supplies nationwide.\n  MTBE has been found to be leaking into groundwater at over 10,000 \nsites in California. A state report in Maine found that anywhere from \n1,000 to 4,300 private wells could contain unhealthful levels of MTBE. \nAnd in New Hampshire, MTBE has been found in 100 public wells and water \nsupplies. Five parts per billion is enough to contaminate water and \nmake it taste and smell like turpentine. As I said, it is highly toxic. \nIt is a poison. It permeates rapidly.\n  I think I would like to review a little bit some of the history of \nwhy we are here. In 1990, when we passed the Clean Air Act, trying to \nreduce the pollutants in automobile gasoline, we wanted to get rid of \nthe witch's brew--we always called it the witch's brew--of toxins that \nwere basically used as octane enhancers, such as benzene, xylene and \ntoluene, highly toxic, highly poisonous substances used to enhance \noctane and performance.\n  In order to get rid of those toxics, while maintaining gasoline \nperformance, something was needed to replace them. The oxygenates make \na cleaner burning gasoline while improving octane and gasoline \nperformance. So we came up with the oxygen content standard in the \nClean Air Act so that we could have cleaner gasoline, and reduce the \ntoxics and carbon monoxide emissions. The oxygenate in the fuel does \nthat. It reduces carbon monoxide. We all know what carbon monoxide is--\na pollutant that makes you sick or kills you. So we came up with the \noxygenate standard for that. We got rid of pollution and carbon \nmonoxide. Both MTBE and ethanol were octane enhancers so they could be \nused to make cleaner gasoline and replace the witch's brew of toxics \nlike xylene and benzene and toluene.\n  Because MTBE is a derivative of petroleum, it was much easier to get \nthe MTBE and to use it and to have it marketed more rapidly around the \ncountry than ethanol. That is why MTBE became the largest part of the \noxygenate supply for the reformulated gasoline program.\n  I freely admit that MTBE does do some good in reducing air pollution. \nI would never argue that it doesn't; of course, it does. But we have \nfound that the downside is even worse in terms of its pollution of \nwater supplies. So we say, are we on the horns of a dilemma? We have \nMTBE. It reduces air pollution. It keeps the octane up. But it terribly \npollutes our ground water. Is there nothing we can do?\n  Well, yes, there is. We can move toward using more ethanol. Now, \nethanol is a renewable fuel that provides the clean air benefits, but \nit will not pollute ground water. Ethanol is so safe one can drink it. \nIt is about 190 proof. That is what it is, basically 190 proof, good \nold corn alcohol. That is all it is. You can drink it if you want. It \nis pretty strong, but it won't hurt you. So we can replace it MTBE with \nethanol.\n  Senator Gramm talked about the vapor pressure, the fact that when you \nmix ethanol with gasoline, a funny thing happens. It becomes more \nvolatile. True. Therefore, they say because it is more volatile, it \nevaporates and it causes ozone. Well, I have looked at that, and quite \nfrankly, I think the conclusions about evaporation are outdated and not \nvalid.\n  First of all, it is true that the Reid vapor pressure does go up, so \nit is more evaporative. But if you look at the design and building of \nautomobiles since that time, you find that automobiles are not like \nthey were 20 years ago. The gas tanks have a sealing flap on them. All \ngas tanks have an airtight lock on them now, all cars built probably \nwithin the last 10 to 15 years. Almost all new cars use fuel injection. \nThey don't have carburetors like the old cars used to have. There isn't \nthat much evaporation from automobiles, even when they sit in the hot \nsummer sun. It may be true of older cars, but not of the new cars that \nhave been built within the last 10 or 15 years.\n  Secondly, at most of the gas pumps in the United States now, they \nhave a recapturing mechanism to recapture the fumes from the pumps. So \nthose that say that because we mix ethanol with gasoline and it \nevaporates and causes ozone, that is based upon studies that I believe \nare not valid and are outdated.\n  We do know one thing about ethanol. It reduces carbon monoxide \ntailpipe emissions. And carbon monoxide contributes to ozone formation. \nThe air quality benefits of reduced carbon monoxide emissions has to be \ntaken into account when talking about the evaporation of gasoline \ncontaining ethanol. So we have a proposition. We can replace MTBE with \nethanol. We can enhance the octane. We can clean up the gasoline, cut \nthe toxics and reduce carbon monoxide, and there is absolutely no \npollution water pollution. But Senator Gramm and others have said, and \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, we can't do that. The reason we can't do \nthat is because we don't have an alternative in place right now to \nreplace MTBE.\n  If I read the sense-of-the-Senate resolution of the Senator from \nCalifornia,\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\nit doesn't say we have to do this immediately. It says: It is the sense \nof the Senate that the United States should, one, phase out MTBE in \norder to address the threats that MTBE poses to public health and the \nenvironment--phase it out. We didn't put a time limit on it, just phase \nit out.\n  Well, let me, for the record, point out how we can, without \ndisruptions in fuel supplies, replace MTBE with nonpolluting ethanol. \nWe now produce about 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol annually. We use \nabout 1.2 billion gallons of that in this country and we export the \nrest. We would need about an additional 2.1 to 2.2 billion gallons of \nethanol production to replace MTBE. The current ethanol production \ncapacity that we have in the United States right now is about 1.8 \nbillion gallons annually. So to replace MTBE, the U.S. would need to \nhave the capacity to produce about 3.3 billion gallons of ethanol each \nyear. That is the 1.2 billion that we use domestically, plus the 2.1 it \nwould take to replace MTBE. So that would be about 3.3 billion gallons.\n  In checking with the producers of ethanol, they have told me ethanol \nproduction could be ramped up anywhere in 2.5 to 3 years to meet those \nrequirements. We already have 1.8 billion gallons of annual ethanol \nproduction capacity. We don't even have to double it in order to meet \nthe requirements of replacing MTBE.\n  I point out that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's analysis \nsupports this conclusion that we could, within 2.5 years, and at the \nmost 3 years, ramp up the production of ethanol to replace MTBE. I \nwould have to admit there is probably no way we can phase out MTBE in \nprobably less than 2.5 to 3 years. So as we phase out MTBE, we could \nramp up the production of ethanol.\n  Now, my friend from Oklahoma said we don't have the transportation \nfacilities and things such as that. They would come along, plus, I \ndaresay that ethanol would be produced in a lot of different places in \nthe country. Now it is mostly produced in the Midwest, but it will \nprobably be produced in a lot of other areas in the United States.\n  So for the reasons of health, for the reasons of making sure we don't \nfurther contaminate our ground water and our water supplies in this \ncountry, to ensure that we are able to replace MTBE in an orderly \nfashion with a renewable fuel produced here in this country, I support \nthe sense-of-the-Senate amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Fitzgerald, and others.\n  Lastly, I want to make one more point. The Senator from Texas went on \nabout subsidies for ethanol. I don't think he wants to get involved in \nthat subject. Quite frankly, we have the data to show that the tax \nbreaks to the oil industry vastly exceed the modest tax incentives for \nethanol. That is just during the recent past, not to mention all the \ntax and other subsidies the oil industry has gotten over the last 100 \nyears or so from the U.S. Government. So I don't think the Senator from \nTexas wants to get involved in talking about subsidies, especially when \nwe can point out the huge tax subsidies the oil industry has gotten \nover all these years.\n  In conclusion, the issue before us is framed this evening primarily \nas an environmental and health issue, pure and simple. All of these \narguments from the other side notwithstanding, what we are about is \nsaying the Senate is going on record that we ought to phase out MTBE \nand to promote renewable ethanol to replace MTBE. Ethanol enhances \nenergy security, it supports the farm economy, it improves air quality \nand the environment. There are many reasons to support ethanol, but \nwhen it comes down to the crux of the debate tonight we are talking \nabout the extensive water contamination caused by MTBE and the fact \nthat with ethanol we have a clean and safe alternative to take its \nplace. That is what this debate is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a health issue, yes, but it is \nmore than just an issue of whether or not we are going to continue to \npoison the environment and the ground water and permit poison, on the \none hand, or a product that you can drink, on the other hand, to take \nits place. This is also an economic issue, although we have almost \nexclusively debated the health issues tonight. We just as easily could \nbe conjuring up the debates of previous years between big oil on the \none hand and agriculture on the other hand--agriculture being the base \nproduct for the production of ethanol, and big oil because of its \ninterest in MTBE.\n\n  So it is an economic issue, not just an issue of poisoning the \nenvironment. It is also an issue of whether or not we ought to rely \nupon a renewable source of energy that comes from agriculture and corn, \nto make ethanol, or whether you ought to rely upon a nonrenewable fuel, \nMTBE. It is also an issue of whether or not this country ought to be \nenergy-dependent upon foreign sources, because like our importing more \nthan half of our petroleum, we also import half of our MTBE. The issue \nshould be how we are going to be less dependent upon foreign sources of \nenergy when we fully use our own family farmers to grow our own crops \nand use our own agricultural products to produce ethanol, a renewable \nfuel.\n  It is an environmental issue in regards to whether or not you are \ngoing to produce MTBE from a nonrenewable source, a finite source, and \npoison; or whether you are going to have the more clean-burning, \nrenewable source that doesn't poison from ethanol.\n  Our balance of trade is also an issue due to the fact that one-third \nof our unfavorable balance of trade comes from the fact that we import \nso much of our energy. We should use more of our domestically produced \nenergy, a renewable source of energy which is not imported and not \ncontrolled by oil companies. This would provide the nation with a more \nfavorable balance of trade.\n  Our national defense should not be devoted in part to defending \nforeign sources of energy. An admiral in the Navy once explained that \nabout half of the Navy's budget is dependent upon protecting oil, the \nflow of oil from the Middle East to the United States. This should be \nconsidered a subsidy. This source of energy partially compromises our \nnational defense. We should base our national defense more on energy \nindependence through the use of renewable energy, domestically produced \nenergy, of which ethanol is part of that equation, produced from a \nrenewable source.\n  Yes, this is an issue of poison versus a product that isn't poison. \nEthanol is a product that you can drink, but it has a positive economic \nimpact, solidifies our national defense, benefits our environment, and \nreduces our trade deficit.\n  So let's look at it in a very broad vein because this is not a brand \nnew debate. This is a debate that has been going on in this body over a \nperiod of time, dating back to 1980 when we first started the renewable \nresource of ethanol as a supplement to gasoline.\n  Now, this isn't just a recent health issue because of California and \nwhat the Governor of California has done to phase out MTBE, the \npoisonous product in their State. The Governor has already made that \ndecision. But I have given evidence on the floor in this body, in \nprevious debates on this issue, where people using MTBE in Alaska got \nsick and the Governor had to ask for waivers. I think I also produced \nevidence in those previous debates regarding a similar situation in the \nState of New Jersey, just as an example.\n\n  I think it has been well established that this does not just come \nfrom leaky gasoline tanks leaking into the underground water. It has \nbeen presented very clearly that this product also is emitted into the \nair and because of rainfall finds its way into our water supply.\n  In my State of Iowa, the legislature has banned MTBE. My State banned \nits use in the last legislative session. The Governor of California has \nalso moved to phase the poison out of its fuel. While we have been \nmoving forward on this issue, the debate tonight might appear new to \nmany of my colleagues. To those colleagues it might make sense to study \nthis more, to let the committees make the proper decisions. But there \nare numerous state legislatures that have made the conclusion that MTBE \nshould be banned. I hope we will favorably consider the Boxer amendment \nbecause I think it is very legitimate that we immediately move forward \non this issue.\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\n  Obviously, my State of Iowa, as the No. 1 corn-producing State in the \nNation, will benefit if this poisonous product is phased out. I stand \nguilty of promoting ethanol. But it is not fair to say that just \nbecause you as the traveling public--and every one of you in this body \nowns an automobile--who pull up to the gasoline pump and pay a little \nbit less gas tax because a portion of your gasoline is ethanol which \ndoesn't have the Federal gas tax in it, that this is a subsidy. The \nword ``subsidy'' implies that there is money paid out of the Federal \nTreasury to somebody to use that product. That is not true. Do we want \nto raise the tax on people motoring? Then do away with the ethanol tax \nexemption and you would have it.\n  I think we have the arguments on our side. I think it is going to be \neasy to cloud the issue and claim this needs to be studied. Remember, \nthere are legislative bodies elsewhere in this country that have come \nto the conclusion that this has had enough study and that something as \npoisonous as MTBE should not be in the water.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't address these remarks to any \nexporter of ethanol. But I am really astounded tonight. I think if you \npull out your ledger, every time we have an ethanol vote, my friend or \nsomeone else is standing there to make sure that I vote for it and make \nsure that I vote the same way over and over.\n  Frankly, I wouldn't be voting for ethanol if I had to put up with \nthis kind of argument and justification for being for ethanol. Just put \nthat in your hat. Because this is an absurd argument. Most of those who \nsupport ethanol on this side of the aisle are constantly arguing that \nthe Environmental Protection Agency oversteps all the time--that they \noverregulate, that they do things that cost the American taxpayers too \nmuch. And yet they come here tonight.\n  There is the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. Is this man antienvironment? For most of the same people, they \nhave been arguing that he is too much in favor of the environment. He \ncomes to the floor of the Senate a reputed chairman, and you all make \nthis an environmental issue?\n  You want to make this issue one that says we will sell more corn. I \ndon't believe that is the right way to handle environmental issues in \nthe United States when a blue-ribbon commission issued a report, and \nthe chairman of the committee says: I need time to study it. But it \nwill just be a matter of a few weeks, and we will have a hearing.\n  That is what we should do tonight. We should say to that committee: \nDo your hearings quickly and give us your recommendation.\n  But to stand here on the floor of the Senate and make this a corn-\ngrowers versus a non-corn-growers issue, and try to say it is the \nenvironment when you are counting heads, to every head you are \ncounting, you are sending a memo: This is for corn.\n  Is that why we want you to vote for it? Right. In fact, my friend, \nwho I greatly respect, tried to cover that up in a 15-minute speech \nabout it being something else. But it is an effort to say let us get \nrid of this thing that we are using to make our gasoline better, more \noxygenated, and better for the clean air of our country when there is a \nstudy that is only 5 days old--6 days, whatever it is. You have the \nchairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the full committee \nsaying: Wouldn't you give us time to look at it?\n  Here we have an agriculture bill and somebody making an issue that \nnow what you would do is make Pete Domenici tonight, who is not going \nto vote with you anti-corn growers, says listen, corn growers. You are \nmore apt to make me an anti-corn grower with this kind of approach than \nif you leave it in the committee and let them do their work.\n  I hope some others will join me in that respect because I am not \nagainst corn growers. I don't have very many in my State. But I think \nit is ridiculous to come to the floor and make this kind of argument in \nbehalf of the environment and leaking underground tanks when you won't \neven give the most esteemed environmental chairman we have had around \nhere since Ed Muskie a chance to conduct some hearings on it.\n  Frankly, I hope we either table it or somebody offers a substitute so \nwe can do what is right here tonight.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am finished. But I would be glad to answer a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that Senator Inhofe is the chairman of the \nair quality subcommittee. I understand--and I don't know this--that he \nis the chairman of the water quality subcommittee, which we are talking \nabout, and Senator Crapo is in favor of this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator who?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Crapo.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Crapo is in favor? Of course. Maybe he is \nbecause he is a corn grower. But I do not know that he is.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He is chairman of the water quality subcommittee. That is \nwhat I am told.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All I know is that I mentioned two chairmen. I \nmentioned the esteemed chairman of the full committee and the chairman \nof the subcommittee on clean air. I don't know the makeup of the public \nworks committee. I served on it for 12 years. I think it is a wonderful \ncommittee.\n  But to be honest with you, I am thrilled it is your job and not mine. \nI say to the chairman that I could have been chairman. I am glad he is \nchairman and that I am not.\n  But what I said tonight I believe is true; that is, we ought to tell \nthe committee to do their job and do it quickly. That ought to be the \nvote tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am sitting here looking at the \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee who has been \ntrying to pass a responsible bill all week. All of a sudden, out of the \nblue, we have a sense of the Senate that doesn't belong on the \nAgriculture appropriations at all.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Then you see the chairman of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works who says: Excuse me, but this is my \njurisdiction, and I would like to address it. And he is, as Senator \nDomenici said, one of the most distinguished of our Members.\n  I say to Members, do this: MTBE should be looked at. It is a way to \nclean the air. It is an additive to gasoline to meet the clean air \nrequirements of EPA.\n  We should not have a sense of the Senate that holds up the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. I hope Members will vote to table this \nsense of the Senate and give Chairman Chafee the opportunity to look at \nthis issue to determine if there is something wrong with MTBE, which I \nthink is very much a question.\n  But to have something like this continue to hold up this bill, when \nour farmers certainly need the relief this appropriations bill is going \nto give us, I think is the wrong approach.\n  I urge Members to table this sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I know people are getting restless and I know there will \nbe a substitute offered, but if there is anyone in here who is \npredicating their decision on how to vote on this blue-ribbon \ncommittee, let me read from the report. It totally contradicts what the \nSenator from California is saying. They recommend:\n\n       Action by Congress to remove the current 2 percent oxygen \n     requirement to ensure that the adequate fuel supplies can be \n     blended in a cost-effective manner, while quickly reducing \n     usage of MTBE.\n\n  What she is trying to do is actually fill that 2 percent with \nethanol.\n  Another recommendation says:\n\n       Accelerate air and water affects research on other fuel \n     components likely to take MTBE's place such as . . .\n\n  It names ethanol, aromatics, and alkylates. It says don't do it until \nwe do the research.\n  That is the recommendation of this blue-ribbon committee.\n  Last, it bothers me when people use scare tactics. This blue-ribbon \ncommittee said:\n\n       The great majority of these detections to date have been \n     well below levels of public health concern with approximately \n     1 percent rising to levels above 20 parts per billion.\n\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\n\n  I certainly concur with the recommendation of the Senator from Texas. \nLet Members have a chance to hold hearings on the results of the blue-\nribbon committee. Nothing would be lost.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  It is clear from the debate this is not an issue that should be taken \nup on this bill. Clearly there are questions. The scientific basis is \nnot proven at all. I hope we will not do something that will mar the \nrecord and take the jurisdiction from where it should be, and that is \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1522 To Amendment No. 1521\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send a substitute to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] proposes an \n     amendment number 1522 to amendment No. 1521.\n       Strike all after the first word, and insert the following: \n     ``  . It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works should review the findings of \n     the EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on MTBE and other relevant \n     scientific studies, hold comprehensive hearings, and report \n     to the senate at the earliest possible date any legislation \n     necessary to address the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon \n     Panel.''\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is very cut-and-dried. What we say in \nthis substitute is give us a chance. We have a committee. In September, \nas chairman of the committee--and the chairman of the subcommittee is \nhere--we promise the Senator to hold, very early in September, as soon \nas we can get proper witnesses, a hearing on this subject. It is an \nimportant subject. I recognize that to California it is very important, \nand it is important to other States, likewise.\n  I think that is the proper way to go. It is a complicated subject and \nit involves not just MTBE; it involves the oxygenates that come from \ncorn. That is the way I recommend we proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope we will not accept this. I will be \nvery brief. We all know what this is. This is sending this bipartisan \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution right into the graveyard.\n  My friend, my esteemed chairman, says it is complicated. Let me tell \nhim it is not complicated to understand that MTBE is leaking. It is \nleaking badly. The State of California has phased it out. It is an \nopportunity for other options which will help our farmers. I think this \nis a unique moment.\n  We have Senators agreeing, Members who don't vote together very \noften. We have a long list of environmental organizations that support \nthis. We have a long list of people from the farm States and \norganizations that support this. We don't need to continue with \nhearings.\n  As the Senator from Texas stated, the head of the Environmental \nProtection Agency can take action under her emergency powers to phase \nout MTBE. I believe if we support this sense of the Senate and vote \ndown the second-degree amendment, she will understand that we really \ncare about this issue, we care about getting rid of a possible \ncarcinogen, and we care about helping our fathers at the same time.\n  To me, it isn't that complicated, perhaps because I see what is \nhappening to drinking water in California. Right now in California it \nis going to cost $1 to $2 billion to clean up the poison in our \ndrinking water. And my friends are saying: Plenty of time to study.\n  Members don't want this to happen to their State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to table the Chafee amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1522. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) and \nthe Senator from Florida (Mr. Mack) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), and the Senator \nfrom New York (Mr. Moynihan) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork (Mr. Moynihan) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the only amendment that I am aware of \nthat has not already been agreed to by the managers or a recommendation \nto the Senate for agreement is the amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina. Senator Thurmond has an amendment. After his amendment is \noffered--and it will be accepted--we have a group of amendments that we \ncan recommend be agreed to by the Senate. I know of no other \ncontroversial amendment that would require a recorded vote.\n  Then it would be up to the Senate whether to accept passage of the \nbill on a voice vote or insist on a recorded vote. I have had no one \nask me to request the yeas and nays on final passage. So if that is an \nunderstanding that is agreeable to the Senate, we will proceed to \naccept the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, then the \nagreed-upon list the managers will recommend, and then adopt the bill \non final passage by voice vote.\n  If there is any objection to that, speak up now.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1523\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of foreign assistance funds to promote \n       the sale or export of alcoholic beverages, including wine)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1523.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 51, line 13, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``, or alcoholic beverages, including wine''.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the mission of the Foreign Agricultural \nService, in conjunction with the Commodity Credit Corporation, is to \nopen, expand and maintain global market opportunities for agricultural \ncommodities. One program in place to accomplish this mission is the \nMarket Access Program. This program, funded at $90 million per year, is \na cost-share program to help U.S. companies expand their sales in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  I recognize that export promotion is a vital tool in our Nation's \neffort to expand trade. Since its inception in 1986, the Market Access \nProgram has helped many companies, trade organizations, state and \nregional trade groups, and agriculture cooperatives to build new \nmarkets overseas.\n  There is, however, one aspect of the market access program, which \ngives me great concern. In late June, Secretary Glickman announced the \n1999 allocations of the $90 million authorized, to 65 U.S. trade \norganizations for export promotion activities. Included in that \nallocation is over $3.6 million for the promotion of alcoholic \nbeverages.\n  Even if one accepts the notion that alcoholic beverages are \n``agricultural commodities,'' there is still difficulty in justifying \nthe Federal Government's promotion of such products. I do not believe \nthe United States Government should be funding the marketing of \nalcoholic beverages, within the United States or in export markets. \nFurther support of this market promotion program cannot be justified by \npublic policy reasons or on economic grounds.\n  From a public policy viewpoint, the promotion of alcoholic beverages, \nincluding wine, by the Federal Government is unsupportable. The Federal \nGovernment spends millions of dollars each year researching and \ncombating the ill effects of alcohol. The negative consequences of \nalcohol use and abuse are well documented--disease, cancer, traffic \ndeaths and injuries, economic loss, and a variety of social costs. Last \nSeptember, the National Institutes of Health published a study \nentitled, ``The Economic Costs of Alcohol and Drug Abuse in the United \nStates, 1992.'' The economic costs for alcohol abuse alone were \nreported at over $148 billion. Remember, these statistics were for \n1992. There's no doubt the costs are greater today. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this table be printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. It was for these reasons and others that I was proud to \nbe a part of a National public health campaign that resulted in alcohol \ncontainer warning labels. It is irresponsible and poor public policy \nfor the federal government to continue to subsidize the marketing of \nalcohol beverage products.\n  In addition, it is poor economics to continue to support the alcohol \nbeverage industry's export program. Quite frankly, Mr. President, the \nMarket Access Program has been a huge success for the wine industry. In \nthe 13 years of the Program, the wine industry has received about $90 \nmillion in export program funds. The Wine Institute boasts that the \nCalifornia wine industry has been one of the largest recipients of USDA \nexport promotion funding. This has resulted in record exports each \nyear. During that time, export sales have risen from $35 million in \n1986 to $537 million in 1998. This is a 448 percent increase from \nexport sales of a decade ago.\n  I do not begrudge this success. The wine industry is a legitimate \nindustry, producing and marketing a legal product. It is made up of \nmany small businesses, with thousands of employees. I recognize it \ncontributes billions of dollars to or economy in sales, wages, and \ntaxes.\n  However, the success of the industry, particularly with its record \nbreaking exports, leads me to conclude that federal government export \nsubsidies are improper, and no longer required. The industry's export \nprogram has matured to the point where it can stand on its own. \nCritical market development funds can surely be used to assist less \nsuccessful agricultural commodity export programs.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to discontinue the subsidy of wine \nexports. It is poor public policy and wasteful spending. I would note \nthan the Federal Government has imposed a similar restriction on export \npromotion for tobacco.\n  The amendment I am offering would expand the restriction of Federal \nfunding to alcoholic beverages, including wine.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n   ECONOMIC COSTS OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES, 1992\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Total    Alcohol    Drugs\n              Economic costs                   ($)       ($)       ($)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHealth Care Expenditures:\n  Alcohol and drug abuse services.........     9,973     5,573     4,400\n  Medical consequences....................    18,778    13,247     5,531\n                                           -----------------------------\n      Total, Health Care Expenditures.....    28,751    18,820     9,931\nProductivity Effects (Lost Earnings):\n  Premature death.........................    45,902    31,327    14,575\n  Impaired productivity...................    82,201    67,696    14,205\n  Institutionalized populations...........     2,990     1,513     1,477\n  Incarceration...........................    23,356     5,449    17,907\n  Crime careers...........................    19,198  ........    19,198\n  Victims of crime........................     3,071     1,012     2,059\n                                           -----------------------------\n      Total, Productivity Effects.........   176,418   106,997    69,421\nOther Effects on Society:\n  Crime...................................    24,282     6,312    17,970\n  Social welfare administration...........     1,020       683       337\n  Motor vehicle crashes...................    13,619    13,619  ........\n  Fire destruction........................     1,590     1,590  ........\n                                           -----------------------------\n      Total, Other Effects on Society.....    40,511    22,204    18,307\n                                           =============================\n      Grand Total.........................   245,680   148,021    97,659\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.\nSource: The Economic Costs of Alcohol and Drug Abuse in the United\n  States, 1992.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments have been considered en bloc and agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1524 to 1561) were agreed to, en bloc, as \nfollows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1524\n\n     (Purpose: To provide funding for bovine tuberculosis research)\n\n       On page 13, line 13, strike ``$54,276,000'' and insert \n     ``$54,476,000''. On page 13, line 16, strike ``$119,300,000'' \n     and insert ``$119,100,000''.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment funds a special research \ngrant for the study of Bovine Tuberculosis by the Agricultural \nExperiment Station at Michigan State University. This special research \ngrant will fund the study of methods of transmission of Bovine TB and \nwill also look toward developing vaccines and possibly a cure.\n  In order to fund this grant, I propose to reduce funding for \nCompetitive research grants within the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service (CSREES). Specifically, I intend to \ntake this offset from Animal systems account.\n  In the past year, Bovine TB has spread from the oversized deer \npopulation in the north to a number of herds in Michigan's northern \nlower peninsula. The spread of this disease threatens Michigan's TB-\nfree status and must be controlled as soon as possible. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1525\n\n(Purpose: To provide the reduction of the Food and Drug Administration \n                   capabilities in Detroit, Michigan)\n\n       On page 68, line 5, before the period insert the following: \n     ``, or the Food and Drug Administration Detroit, Michigan \n     District Office Laboratory; or to reduce the Detroit Michigan \n     Food and Drug Administration District Office below the \n     operating and full-time equivalent staffing level of July 31, \n     1999; or to change the Detroit District Office to a station, \n     residence post or similarly modified office; or to reassign \n     residence posts assigned to the Detroit District Office''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1526\n\n       On page 35, line 20, after the semicolon, insert the \n     following: ``not to exceed $12,000,000 shall be for water and \n     waste disposal systems to benefit Federally Recognized Native \n     American Tribes, including grants pursuant to section 306C of \n     such Act, provided that the Federally Recognized Native \n     American Tribe is not eligible for any other rural utilities \n     programs set aside under the Rural Community Advancement \n     Program;''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the chairman and \nranking member for their fine work on this agricultural appropriations \nbill. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Leahy and \nhis staff for their work on this amendment. It will mean a great deal \nto Tribes all over America.\n  Mr. President, I am sure all Senators recognize the important \ncontributions that the Rural Utilities Service is making in every \nstate. RUS has been especially effective in the rural portions of New \nMexico. The RUS's grant and loan programs are making tremendous \nprogress in improving the quality of life of our small towns and in \nIndian Country. The basic health of rural people in New Mexico, as well \nas their economic future, are being greatly improved by RUS's programs.\n  I'd like to take a few minutes to explain what our amendment does. \nUnder current rules RUS can provide no more than 75 percent of the cost \nof a project in the form of a grant. The remaining 25 percent can be in \nthe form of a loan or from some other local source of funds. This \nprogram works well throughout most of rural America. Communities \ngenerally have access to taxing or bonding authority or to state funds \nthat they can use for the required matching funds or to guarantee a \nloan.\n  However, there are some cases where a community doesn't have the \nmeans to provide the required matching funds. Congress has recognized \nthis problem and has created special rules to address these unique \nsituations. One example are colonias, where Congress allows RUS to \nprovide 100 percent of the cost of a project so that the local \ncommunity isn't burdened by these immigrant settlements, and this bill \nprovides up to $20 million for projects in\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\ncolonias. Mr. President, the funding authorization for colonias is a \ngood program, and I thank the Chairman and ranking member for their \ncontinued support of it.\n  Very simply, our amendment would create a parallel program for Indian \nCountry. Currently, RUS is already providing loans and grants to tribes \nusing its standard funding rules. However, some tribes can't take \nadvantage of RUS's programs simply because they don't qualify for the \nloans required to cover 25 percent of a project's cost. Tribes \ngenerally lack taxing or bonding authority to provide these required \nmatching funds.\n  Mr. President, our amendment would allow RUS to provide 100 percent \nof the cost of a project for the most economically disadvantaged tribes \nthat can't otherwise provide the required matching funds. The amendment \nallows up to $12 million for water and wastewater projects for this \npurpose. The funds come from within RUS's existing appropriation. \nWithout our amendment, a few of our tribes will continue to suffer from \na lack of basic water and sewer systems.\n  Mr. President, our amendment is not a substantial portion of RUS's \ntotal appropriation of $630 million, and the funds would not be used \nunless a tribe did not qualify for any of the RUS's other programs. I \nthink this is an important program to help deal with the critical \ninfrastructure needs of our tribes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nNational Congress of American Indians supporting this amendment be \nincluded in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Again, I want to thank Senator Leahy and his staff for \ntheir work on this important amendment and I hope the Senate will \nsupport it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    July 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The National Congress of American \n     Indians (NCAI), the oldest and largest Indian advocacy \n     organization is pleased to endorse the Leahy/Bingaman \n     amendment, number 1067, to the FY2000 agriculture \n     appropriations bill (S. 1233). This amendment will make \n     available $12 million dollars in direct funding for water and \n     wastewater projects in Indian Country.\n       The funds for the amendment are from within the Rural \n     Utilities Service's (RUS) $630 million dollar total \n     appropriation. In general, tribes are already eligible for \n     RUS funding; however, current rules limit RUS grants to a \n     maximum of 75 percent of a project's cost.\n       Infrastructure development in Indian Country is at a \n     critical need. The tribes who can benefit the most are unable \n     to access RUS grants due to their inability to obtain the 25 \n     percent matching requirement from either loans or other \n     funding sources. Moreover, tribes generally lack taxing and \n     bonding authority to obtain the matching funds normally \n     required by RUS.\n       The structure of the new program in the amendment parallels \n     the $20 million dollar grant program established for the \n     colonias located along the United States/Mexico border, which \n     also allows RUS to provide 100% of the cost of a project. A \n     similar $20 million grant program is also provided in the \n     bill for rural and Native Americans in Alaska. We believe \n     your amendment will benefit a number of tribes throughout \n     Indian Country and we thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     W. Ron Allen,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1527\n\n(Purpose: To limit the use of appropriated funds for award of contracts \n                      through the HUBZone program)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7____. Contracts for Procurement of Food for Peace \n     Commodities.--(a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) HUBZone sole source contract.--The term ``HUBZone sole \n     source contract'' means a sole source contract authorized by \n     section 31 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657a).\n       (2) HUBZone price evaluation preference.--The term \n     ``HUBZone price evaluation preference'' means a price \n     evaluation preference authorized by section 31 of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657a).\n       (3) Qualified HUBZone small business concern.--The term \n     ``qualified HUBZone small business concern'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 632(p)).\n       (4) Covered procurement.--The term ``covered procurement'' \n     means a contract for the procurement or processing of a \n     commodity furnished under title II or III of the Agricultural \n     Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1721 \n     et seq.), section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1431(b)), the Food for Progress Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. \n     1736o), or any other commodity procurement or acquisition by \n     the Commodity Credit Corporation under any other law.\n       (b) Prohibition of Use of Funds.--None of the funds made \n     available by this Act may be used to award a HUBZone sole \n     source contract or a contract awarded through full and open \n     competition in combination with a HUBZone price evaluation \n     preference to any qualified HUBZone small business concern in \n     any covered procurement if performance of the contract by the \n     business concern would exceed the production capacity of the \n     business concern or would require the business concern to \n     subcontract to any other company or enterprise for the \n     purchase of the commodity being procured through the covered \n     procurement.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to prevent a \npotentially harmful conflict that has come to our attention as we \nimplement the new HUBZone program adopted in the Small Business \nReauthorization Act. It appears this program doesn't quite mesh \nproperly with the procurement of grain products in the Food for Peace \nprogram funded in this bill, and I offer this amendment to prevent the \nmajor economic disruption that could occur between now and the time we \nare able to correct this glitch in authorizing legislation.\n  The HUBZone program is a valuable new tool I was able to put together \nas Chairman of the Small Business Committee. It provides competitive \nadvantages for small businesses located in economically distressed \nareas as they seek to obtain government contracts. If these small \nbusinesses agree to hire 35 percent of their employees from these \ndistressed areas, they become eligible for a 10 percent price \nevaluation preference in bidding on contracts awarded through free and \nopen competition. The law also provides for certain contracts to be set \naside exclusively for competition among HUBZone small business \nconcerns, as well as sole source contracts.\n  As we implement this program this year, we are occasionally running \ninto situations where the program doesn't quite fit with existing law \nand other programs. We are working to resolve these issues in a manner \nthat we hope will be as consistent as possible with both the intent of \nthe HUBZone law and those other programs.\n  When the government purchases agriculture products for the Food for \nPeace program, those purchases are a procurement within the meaning of \nthe government's's small business procurement policies, including the \nHUBZone program. Some products like corn soy blend are procured with a \nmix of both small business set-asides and full and open procedures. In \nthis particular case, 10% of the corn soy blend is purchased as a set \naside for small business and 90% is purchased through full and open \ncompetition.\n  Corn soy blend has only a handful of about five vendors, only two of \nwhich are small businesses. They would be the only ones allowed to \ncompete for the small business set-aside. Only one of those two small \nbusinesses is a HUBZone small business, however. That HUBZone vendor \nwould also be eligible for the 10 percent price evaluation preference \nin full and open competition. It could bid up to 10 percent more than \nthe other vendors and still be deemed the lowest bidder. For a product \nlike corn soy blend, operating on narrow price margins, this 10 percent \npreference is likely decisive.\n\n  This means that this one HUBZone small business could lock up 90 \npercent or even 100 percent of the entire market for corn soy blend.It \nwould do so as a matter of law, not simply because it produces the best \nproduct at the best price. We could accidentally create a monopoly by \ngovernment action, thanks to the way these various programs come \ntogether in this particular type of procurement.\n  I can say as Chairman of the Small Business Committee, this is not \nthe outcome we intended. We are not here to create monopolies, even if \nthe monopoly is currently a small business. The small business program \nseeks to expand small business opportunities and foster competition, \nnot stifle it.\n  That's why I have offered this amendment. This amendment does not \nalter any of the existing programs--Food for Peace or HUBZones. It just \nsays, let's not create a monopoly between now and the time we are able \nto adopt corrective legislation in the next\n\n[[Page S10199]]\n\nsmall business reauthorization bill, which is due next year. I'm sure \nwe can fix this problem appropriately. But in the meantime, contracts \nfor corn soy blend will continue to be awarded, and it is possible the \nmarket may have been converted into a monopoly in the short run.\n  My amendment says that no funds will be used in this bill to award \nHUBZone contracts for Food for Peace commodities if the award would \nexceed the actual production capacity of the successful HUBZone small \nbusiness. The amendment places a similar limitation on Food for \nProgress procurements of commodities, which are procured in a similar \nfashion. CCC procurements of non-commodity items--such as desks, \ncomputers, office supplies, and the other apparatus needed by any \nGovernment agency--would not be covered by this amendment.\n  This means that a HUBZone small business would not be allowed to lock \nup the entire market, collect the HUBZone benefits, and then \nsubcontract the actual contract performance to another firm. The \nbusiness would be limited by the amount of commodity it could deliver \non its own. This prevents an abuse of the program that could create a \nmonopoly position for a HUBZone small business, unfairly threaten the \nlivelihoods of its competitors, and unnecessarily drive up costs for \nthe taxpayers.\n  I should note also that this doesn't lock out anybody, including \nsmall businesses that I hope will in fact take advantage of the HUBZone \nprogram. It just prevents an abuse of the HUBZone program while we put \ntogether a long-term fix that reflects the particular circumstances \nthat prevail in commodities procurement.\n  I would note also that I anticipate this will be necessary only for \nthis year. I know the managers of the Agriculture Appropriations bill \nsometimes get a little frustrated at the number of general provisions \nthat get inserted into this bill, and many times these provisions tend \nto be carried over from year to year. In this particular case, we seek \nonly to prevent market disruption in the interim until we tackle this \nin the small business reauthorization that will be due next year. Thus, \nI think this provision will be only for the Fiscal 2000 bill that is in \nfront of us.\n  This should be a non-controversial amendment, and I hope it can be \ncleared by unanimous consent. My staff and I are available to answer \nquestions for anyone needing clarification on this.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1528\n\n       On Page 76, after Line 6 insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, West Virginia State College in Institute, \nWest Virginia, was designated by Congress as one of the original 1890 \nland-grant schools under the Second Morrill Act. The college was the \nfirst 1890 land-grant school to be accredited and has been accredited \nlonger than any other public college or university in West Virginia.\n  West Virginia was one of six states to establish a new land-grant \ncollege under State control. West Virginia State College faithfully met \nits duties to the citizens of West Virginia as a land-grant college in \nan outstanding manner.\n  However, on October 23, 1956, the State Board of Education voted to \nsurrender the land-grant status of State College (effective July 1, \n1957). Historical data suggests that this action was taken in an effort \nto enhance State College's ability to accommodate veterans returning \nhome with GI benefits. In addition, the decision to surrender the land-\ngrant status preceded explicit funding by Congress for land-grant \ninstitutions.\n  For thirty-three years, West Virginia State College has sought to \nregain its land-grant status. On February 12, 1991, Governor Gaston \nCaperton signed a bill into law that provided redesignation authority \nfor land-grant status from the State of West Virginia. On March 28, \n1994, then U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy informed \nWest Virginia Governor Caperton that State College would receive a \npartial land-grant designation that would entitle the college to \n$50,000 annually under the Second Morrill Act.\n  It has become clear that funding, rather than merit, is the issue \nthat must be addressed to reinstate West Virginia State College's land-\ngrant status. I have authored an amendment that would provide $2 \nmillion in additional funds for 1890 Institution entitlements to be \nused for base line funding for West Virginia State College. This \namendment does not grant full 1890 land-grant funding privileges to \nState College, but provides a $2 million entitlement. The amendment \ndoes not cut into the current 1890 entitlement accounts. It adds \nadditional funding with an offset from the National Research Initiative \naccount.\n  My amendment provides fair treatment to West Virginia State College, \nan original 1890 land-grant school, and I thank my colleagues for \nsupporting this provision.\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10199-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, AUGUST 5, 1999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, this Saturday, August 7 will mark the \ntenth anniversary of the death of Congressman Mickey Leland, who was an \nextraordinarily effective advocate for the hungry people here at home \nand throughout the world. In remembering his tireless work for the \nhungry, I think it is fitting to redouble our own efforts to fight \nhunger and malnutrition.\n  The United States recently released its plan to reduce hunger. I am \noffering an amendment today to ask that the President include in his \nbudget request next year specific proposals to implement the U.S. plan.\n  In November 1996 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization \nconvened a World Food Summit in Rome. The goal of the conference was to \n``renew the commitment of world leaders at the highest level to the \neradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food \nsecurity for all, through the adoption of concerted policies and \nactions at global, regional, and national levels.'' Summit participants \npledged to cut the number of undernourished people in half by 2015. \nEach participating country was to decide independently how it could \ncontribute to the goal of food security for all.\n  This March of this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture published \nthe U.S. government's plan to meet the goals of the 1996 World Food \nSummit, entitled U.S. Action Plan on Food Security, Solutions to \nHunger. The plan outlines how the United States will fight hunger both \nat home and abroad. The plan is broad and involves a number of U.S. \nagencies and policies. It aims to reduce both U.S. and world hunger by \naddressing the ``policy environment,'' promoting trade and investment, \nstrengthening food security research and educational capacity, \nintegrating environmental concerns into food security efforts, \nimproving the ``safety net,'' better identifying ``food insecure'' \nindividuals and populations, and addressing food and water safety \nissues.\n  The USDA report was issued after the President had already submitted \nhis budget. Many of the recommendations in the report are policies \nalready in place and so already addressed in the President's budget. \nThe report has some specific recommendations, but many are broad \nprinciples that need to be fleshed out to lead to specific actions.\n  I want to be sure that this report does not become one of the many \ngovernment reports that leads nowhere, that fulfills the requirements \nof an international conference with lofty goals but little follow-\nthrough.\n  I am offering this amendment today, which simply says that it is the \nsense of the Senate that the President should include in the fiscal \nyear 2001 budget request funding to implement this plan, to encourage \nthe Administration to submit specific proposals and budget requests to \nfollow through on our fight against hunger.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1537\n\n (Purpose: To require the Farm Service Agency to review programs that \n      provide assistance to apple farmers and report to Congress)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7__.

This research \nprogram has provided much needed support to Michigan's fruit producers, \nand I thank the managers for allowing it to continue. It is my \nunderstanding that the full amount of the cost of this program will \ncome from the ``Markets, trade, and policy'' section of the CSREES \nresearch grants, which currently is undersubscribed. It is also my hope \nthat the additional research funds that I sought for another ongoing \nCSREES research project to help farmers reduce their use of fertilizer \nand pesticide inputs can be secured in conference.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1541\n\n       At the end of the bill insert:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, and I have offered \non behalf of the Florida Center for Climate Prediction.\n  The Center is a consortium between the University of Florida, Florida \nState University and the University of Miami to study climate \nvariability in the Southeast region. The objective of this unique \npartnership is to explore the potential value and practical application \nfor long-term climate data and science to the agricultural community in \nmy state and throughout the Southeast.\n  The consortium's purpose is to develop and evaluate a useful set of \ntools and methodologies for assessing the regional agricultural \nconsequences of the El Nino/La Nina phenomenons and applying these \nforecasts to agricultural decision-making. This is a truly innovative \nproject and I am pleased this partnership is making good progress on \nthese important agricultural issues.\n  Our amendment will provide $300,000 in funding for the Center in the \nFederal administration section of the Cooperative State Research and \nEducation, and extension Service [CSREES]--Research and Education \nActivities section of the bill before us today.

Mr. President, this amendment, cosponsored by my \ncolleague from Oregon and others from cranberry producing states, \namends the Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, giving \ncranberry producers the tools they need to meet the challenges of a \nrapidly changing marketplace. Cranberry growers in my state produce a \nfruit that is an important portion of our state's agriculture economy. \nDespite their economic significance, cranberry marshes or bogs are \noften small and multi-generational family farms. In fact, it is not \nuncommon to find a grower who is a third, or fourth generation farmer, \nworking the same ten-acre\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\nbog that is or her grandparents or great-grandparents worked in the \ntwenties or thirties. They have a strong tradition of independence and \nstewardship and have been marvels of ingenuity and productivity for a \nlong time.\n  However, today they are suffering. Prices are down by forty to sixty \npercent over the levels of only a year ago. In some cases the cost of \nproduction exceeds the current value of the harvest crop. While \ncranberry growers tend to be resilient, many are having difficulties \ndealing with these extreme market conditions.\n  Our amendment will not solve all of the problems this industry faces \nin the near-term, but we believe it will help the industry in the long-\nterm. It does not provide any money or increase the regulatory controls \non industry. However, the amendment before us today addresses the \nproblems in the cranberry industry in two ways:\n  First, our amendment would expand the information-gathering authority \nof the Cranberry Marketing Committee beyond the traditional production \nstates outlined in the original Cranberry Marketing Order. When the \norder was first conceived, cranberries were largely used only as fresh \nfruit for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. As I am sure many of \nmy colleagues are aware, decades of innovation and creative marketing \nby the cranberry industry has led to a tremendous expansion of this \ncommodity--mainly through its use in juices and other products that are \nconsumed year-round. Unfortunately, the commodity reporting mechanisms \nprovided under the current Cranberry Marketing Order have not kept up \nwith the growth and evolution of the industry. Today, vast amounts of \ncranberry supplies are imported and processed outside of production \nstates that are subject to the Cranberry Marketing Order. This \nhandicaps our cranberry growers, who are unable to obtain accurate \ninformation about the available supply, and therefore cannot make the \noptimum planting decisions. Our legislation would correct this by \nexpanding the Cranberry marketing Committee authority, ultimately \nenabling growers to make better production decisions.\n  A second component of our amendment would add cranberries to the list \nof commodities eligible to use funds raised from domestic procedures \nfor overseas advertising as part of a generic marketing promotion \nprogram. Like all other agriculture producers, cranberry growers know \nthe ability to effectively market products in the global marketplace is \ncritical to maintaining growth and increasing price stability. Although \nit is my understanding that the Cranberry Marketing Committee does not \ncurrently plan to initiate such a campaign at this time, our \nlegislation gives them the flexibility to do so.\n  Much has been said in recent months on this floor about the plight of \nagriculture and an ongoing farm crisis brought about by record low \ncommodity prices. This problem is real and cranberry producers in small \nOregon coastal towns like Bandon and Coos Bay have felt it as well. I \nwould like to urge the Secretary of Agriculture to get directly \ninvolved with the leadership of the industry to try and find meaningful \ninitiatives that can help them weather this difficult time and ensure a \nhealthy industry for a healthy product.\n  Mr. President, cranberry growers know global competition will become \nincreasingly fierce in the next century, yet they also know that their \nfuture prosperity will be built upon effective marketing and production \ninnovation--not expensive safety nets or reactive trade barriers. I \nthank my colleagues for joining me in support of this amendment to give \ncranberry growers in my state and throughout the nation the freedom to \naddress the current farm crisis and pro-actively meet the challenges of \nthe new century.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1549\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize Alaska Native tribes for payment of certain \n            administrative costs for the Food Stamp Program)\n\n       On page 76, line 6, please add the following:\n       ``Beginning in fiscal year 2001 and thereafter:\n       ``Sec.   .

Mr. President, I would like to make a brief statement \nconcerning my amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill regarding the Women, Infants, and Children \nnutrition program. My reading of the regulations implementing this \nprogram indicate that they provide women and their children with a very \nlimited range of food options. For example, the only non-dried \nvegetable they may chose from is carrots. They may eat canned carrots, \nraw carrots, and frozen carrots, but no other non-dried vegetable is \npermitted. Likewise the only meat or fish they allow is tuna. Salmon, \nthe most heart-healthy protein source available, is essentially banned \nalong with beef, poultry, pork, and other protein sources.\n  My amendment directs the Secretary to review the WIC food packages \ncurrently available to pregnant and lactating women and their children \nand consider adding new, but nutritious foods to the list. It is \nridiculous to expect children to eat foods from such a limited list. \nAnyone with a picky toddler knows that a varied diet is critical to \ndeveloping healthy eating habits.\n  Several years ago there was a controversy concerning Congress \ndeciding which foods should be included in the WIC package, \nsubstituting its judgment for that of nutrition experts at USDA. This \namendment does not mandate that salmon or any other food be included on \nthe list. It gives complete and full discretion to the Secretary to \ndetermine which foods should be included. It simply directs him to \nperiodically update the list.\n  I have worked for years with Dr. William Castelli at the Framington \nHeart Study in Massachusetts and know firsthand the health benefits of \nsalmon. The omega 3 oils within salmon actually reduce cholesterol \nlevels, I eat salmon at least twice a week. I am confident that salmon \nwill meet any standard that USDA applies without any additional help \nfrom me. When the nutrition experts see what a wonderful protein source \nsalmon is, they will wonder why they didn't put it on the list in the \nfirst place.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1551\n\n (Purpose: To amend S. 1233 to provide for education grants to Alaska \n Native serving institutions and Native Hawaiian serving institutions)\n\n       Amend Title VII--GENERAL PROVISIONS by inserting a new \n     section as follows:\n\n     ``SEC.  .

Mr. President, I rise to elaborate on my amendment that \nwould provide $200,000 in funding under the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service (CSREES) to a research project in \nNorth Carolina to improve early detection of crop diseases. This \nfunding boost is accomplished through an offset in NRI.\n  This funding would go to North Carolina State which will work in \nconjunction with the University of North Carolina at Greensboro to \ncreate an innovative early warning system for crop failure.\n  Mr. President, more than 30% of crop failures could be prevented if \nfarmers had an early warning of disease or insect damage. However, by \nthe time most diseases and insect infestations are visible to the naked \neye, they are too far advanced for effective treatment.\n  The University of North Carolina at Greensboro has been conducting a \nseries of experiments that would introduce a color-change gene into \ncrops such as soybeans and cranberries. These crops could be \ngenetically engineered to change color when under stress, insect attack \nor diseased. A farmer could then shine a black light on the leaves and \nsee the damage long before it is visible to the naked eye. Armed with \nthis early warning, he could begin dealing with the problem long before \nit becomes fatal to the crop.\n  This is an important project to support. The research will help bring \ncrop management into the 21st century and could help farmers avert \nneedless disasters. And it could yield enormous benefits soon.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1557\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure timely testing of imports under the President's \n                        Food Safety Initiative)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec.  .

Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nSenators Daschle, Wellstone, and myself to provide an additional $2 \nmillion for the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards \nAdministration, known as GIPSA. This agency performs a critical role in \nensuring open markets and fair trade practices for the livestock \nmarket. These are issues of great concern to livestock producers, \nespecially in recent years as low prices have raised questions about \ndecreasing competition, inadequate price information and possible \nabuses of market power.\n  The Packers and Stockyards Program at GIPSA already has large demands \nplaced on its investigative, analytical and legal resources. Congress \nand others are putting pressure on GIPSA to conduct more and more \nsophisticated investigations under significant time pressure.\n  One of the strongest needs is for rapid response teams which are sent \nout to specific areas where serious complaints are occurring to quickly \ndetermine what is happening and to quickly resolve the problems that \nare occurring so farmers can get real relief in a timely manner.\n  GIPSA continues to oversee contracting practices, which are the \nsubject of increasing concern, scrutiny and debate.\n  In an ever-faster paced market, GIPSA must have the resources to meet \nits responsibilities. These additional funds are essential to ensuring \nthat the nation's livestock markets remain fair and open to all \nproducers.\n  The amendment is paid for by reducing the funding for the Economic \nResearch Service. The reduction will be from academic research \ncontracted out by that agency.\n\n\n                        chile as specialty crop\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to address the \ndistinguished chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee on \nan issue associated with the emergency agriculture disaster aid \npackage.\n  The amendment adopted by the Senate to provide emergency agriculture \ndisaster aid includes a provision to assist the producers of specialty \ncrops. May I enquire of the distinguished Senator from Mississippi if \nchile crops in New Mexico would be eligible for emergency aid under the \nspecialty crop provision?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I respond to my friend from New Mexico that he has \nrequested the assistance of the appropriations subcommittee in \naddressing the serious situation of New Mexico's chile farmers, and it \nis the intention of the subcommittee that the chile crop would be \neligible for assistance under the specialty crop provision of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Subcommittee Chairman for \nclarifying his understanding and mine that New Mexico's chile producers \nwould be eligible for assistance through the specialty crop provisions \nof the pending Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  I appreciate his assistance on this important matter.\n\n\n                  cold war aquaculture research center\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi is aware, at the present time, the United States has no \ncapability for the culture of cold-water, marine finfish, and the \nindustry continues to need a consistent supply of high quality eggs or \njuvenile organisms. At the same time, I am especially aware as Chair of \nthe Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, that many important wild fish \nstocks in the United States, including the Gulf of Maine, as well as \naround the world, are suffering from overharvesting. This has the \npotential to greatly diminish the food supply of many nations whose \ngreatest source of protein is from the fish they catch. The opportunity \nfor cold water aquaculture research is immense and the rewards great \nfor U.S. salmon farming in particular, which is a strategic industry in \nmy State of Maine, especially in the rural area of Downeast Maine.\n  It is important for the committee to know that representatives of the \nMaine Atlantic salmon industry and the University of Maine have been \nworking with USDA's Agricultural Research Service and have defined the \nneed to study the feasibility of a research center concept, program \ncriteria and site criteria, site identification and evaluation. Once \nthis has been completed, I hope we can look forward to the committee's \nfuture consideration for establishing a cold-water, marine aquaculture \nresearch center in an appropriate State such as Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there is no question that cold-water \nmarine aquaculture holds enormous exciting potential that remains \nuntapped by the Federal Government. Despite its cryptic name, cold-\nwater marine aquaculture is the lifeblood of a very tangible important \nindustry. Each year millions of Atlantic salmon are raised in the cold \nquick-moving coastal water off the coast of Downeast Maine. The strong \ntides and rocky coast combined with many sheltering islands provide the \nperfect environment for a commercially viable finfish aquaculture \nindustry. My discussions with the Agricultural Resources Service, \nexperienced aquaculturalists, and researchers at the University of \nMaine have confirmed that the coast of Maine would, indeed, be an \nexcellent location for Federal research into marine aquaculture.\n  I understand that language included in the Agricultural \nappropriations bill requires ARS to study all of its current \naquacultural activities. Is it the chairman's understanding that the \nstudy referenced in this bill will focus on, among other things, the \nfeasibility of marine cold-water research program?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand that my colleagues from Maine have a deep \ninterest in furthering cold-water aquaculture research on marine \nspecies, especially since cold water aquaculture is an important \nindustry in their State. In marking up the FY2000 appropriations, the \ncommittee considered the need for the Agricultural Research Service to \nupdate warmwater aquaculture research activities and in our report \nlanguage, directed the ARS to submit to the committee by January 31, \n2000, a report that will not only update warmwater aquaculture research\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\nactivities but also to include all aquaculture research currently being \nconducted by the agency. The report language also requires the agency \nto address the agency's current capacity and requirements for \nadditional resources to meet future needs and issues confronting the \nNation's aquaculture farmers, including opportunities in rural America. \nI agree that cold water aquaculture research needs are included in the \noverall mandate of the report language. I also believe the ARS report \nwill be helpful in establishing the need for coldwater aquaculture \nresearch for marine species.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate the further clarification and would like to \nask one additional question if I may. Could the study called for in the \nreport address the feasibility and desirability of establishing a cold-\nwater aquaculture research program in the State of Maine?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, that will be added to the report mandate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. My colleague and friend from Mississippi is clearly \ndedicated to the well-being of rural citizens from across the Nation. I \nthank him for his clarification of this matter of great importance to \nrural, coastal Maine and look forward to enacting this important \nlegislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank my colleague from Mississippi not only for \nrecognizing the importance of cold water aquaculture research for \nmarine species but also for his continued fine work as Chair of the \nSenate agricultural appropriations process where he continues to be a \nstrong advocate for numerous facets of agricultural research throughout \nthe country.\n\n\n                        human nutrition research\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Chairman for his \nlongstanding support of agricultural research and, more specifically, \nof the human nutrition research programs of the Agricultural Research \nService.\n  Emphasis in human nutrition research at the USDA is designed to \nmaintain a healthy populace and avoid the problems and substantial \ncosts of diseases linked to poor dietary choices. Many diseases such as \ndiabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, cataracts, and others, could be nearly \neliminated with improved nutrition research and education.\n  The President's budget requested $20.25 million for the Human \nNutrition Initiative, but because of significant constraints resulting \nfrom the allocation, the bill provides only $1.5 million. Of the $53 \nmillion originally requested for the program, $48.5 million is still \nneeded.\n  These funds would reconcile production agriculture, which provides \nAmerica the most abundant and safest food supply in the world, with \nconsumer demands for a wholesome diet to enhance health, reduce \nillness, and improve the quality of life.\n  Does the Chairman agree that because of the critical nature of \nfunding for the program the Human Nutrition Initiative is a subject \nthat should be evaluated in greater detail during conference on this \nbill?\n  Mr. KOHL. I concur in my colleague's comments that funding for this \nprogram should be an item of discussion and greater support during \nconference with the House on this bill, and will work with him to that \nend.\n\n\n                      gmo access in southeast asia\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I and the several members of this \nSubcommittee have spent a considerable amount of time working to ensure \nthat other nations do not unfairly discriminate against genetically \nmodified crops grown by American farmers. These crops hold great \npromise for eliminating hunger in the developing nations of the world. \nIn addition, advances in biotechnology will lead to a reduction in the \nuse of pesticides, improvements in soil quality and many GMO \n(Genetically Modified Organisms) crops have documented health benefits. \nIt would truly be a disaster for the people of those nations--as well \nas for farm families in this country--if the benefits of these products \nare lost because of unsound science or straight up protectionism.\n  We are all aware of the problems that we face in opening markets for \nthese products in Europe and many of my colleagues are aware that we \nface new labeling requirements in Japan. What many of my colleagues may \nnot realize is that the same groups that are fighting these products in \nEurope are funding similar efforts to stop the introduction and \nconsumption of GMO products in developing countries around the world--\nsome of the very countries that stand to benefit the most from these \nproducts. The opponents are now turning their attention to a key U.S. \nmarket--Southeast Asia. This area of the world is home to a half \nbillion consumers and the income levels are well above those in \ncountries such as India or China. Unfortunately, the GMO opponents are \nbusy at work to keep us from competing fairly in the markets of \nSoutheast Asia.\n  In Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and other countries in the \nregion, American producers are facing a real threat of closed markets \ndue to the efforts of non-governmental groups based mostly in Europe. \nThis is a very important time in the region as a number of governments \nare studying how to and whether to regulate genetically modified \norganisms. As governments are reviewing the issues, it would be a \ntremendous mistake to allow the GMO opponents to go unanswered. As a \ngovernment, we should be making every effort to assist our farmers and \nproducers in educating government officials in these countries as to \nthe sound scientific reviews that have been conducted on these products \nand the extensive regulatory approval process that the products are \nsubjected to in the United States. Unfortunately, it appears that our \nfederal government resources are completely tied up in fighting what \nsome consider to be more pressing battles around the globe.\n  My staff and I have been in contact with the Administrator of the \nForeign Agriculture Service, Tim Galvin, several times in the past few \nmonths urging him to dedicate a relatively modest amount of funding--\n$80,000--for the FAS to take internationally-respected scientists to \ncountries throughout Southeast Asia so that they may meet with \ngovernment officials and scientists who are working to address the GMO \nregulation issue. It is essential that we move forward with such \neducation efforts to counter the rhetoric and the scare tactics of the \nNGOs. Several of the countries in this region are proceeding towards \nimplementing regulatory schemes; if we do not take affirmative action \non this front we stand to lose valuable markets. Despite the critical \nneed for moving forward with such a program now, I have been unable to \nget Mr. Galvin to agree to this important program.\n  I also understand that there is a plan to eliminate the regional FAS \nposition in Singapore, which is dedicated to working for biotechnology \nacceptance throughout Southeast Asia. Such a move would be a terrible \nmistake. Singapore is in many ways the gateway to the ASEAN region--\nwhich will overtake Japan as the second largest market for U.S. \nproducts and services by the year 2005. The Agricultural Trade Office's \nwork with the ASEAN Secretariat towards establishing an ASEAN regional \ntrade regime based on sound science and its work with the Singapore \nregional traders must continue if U.S. agriculture is successfully to \nrealize this region's market potential. We should be focusing on \nimproving and bolstering this office rather than eliminating it at a \ntime when these countries are beginning to work on these important \nissues.\n  I know that the chairman of the Subcommittee shares my concern about \nthese issues. I urge him to join me in calling on Mr. Galvin and other \nofficials at USDA to move to address the need for the U.S. to become \nengaged on this issue in Southeast Asia and to fund these important \nprograms.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator for his comments and I assure him \nthat I share his concern that we must fight to ensure that our \ncommodities are not unfairly discriminated against in markets around \nthe world. We cannot allow our soybean farmers, cotton farmers, corn \nfarmers and others to have their exports put at risk by unfair \nregulation. We cannot cede any markets to GMO opponents. I share his \ndesire to see USDA put the necessary resources into ensuring our \ninterests are adequately represented as the nations of Southeast Asia \nconsider regulation. I assure him that I will look into the status of \nthese activities and seek to have them adequately funded.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the chairman for his remarks, and I look forward to \nworking with him to address this issue.\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\n                       animal welfare enforcement\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nmake a few points about the increase included in this bill for \nenforcement of the Animal Welfare Act and certain language which \nappears in the Senate Report to accompany the appropriations bill now \nbefore the Senate.\n  Under the Animal Welfare Act, the Secretary of Agriculture is \nauthorized to promulgate standards and other requirements governing the \nhumane handling, housing, care, treatment, and transportation of \ncertain animals by dealers and other regulated businesses. The \nSecretary has delegated the authority for enforcing this Act to the \nAdministrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) \nwhose budget is included in the pending appropriations bill.\n  For a number of years, the appropriated level for APHIS's enforcement \nactivities of the Animal Welfare Act has held stagnant in the area of \n$9 million annually. The level of funding has allowed for employment of \napproximately 69 field inspectors to monitor activities in all fifty \nstates plus the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. \nObviously, this number of inspectors, responsible for such a vast \ngeographical area, is totally insufficient to investigate and control \nall inappropriate and illegal mistreatment of animals where it occurs \nwithin the regulated community. For many people, their pets are \nessentially members of their families and too often we learn of \ntragedies that occur during commercial transportation where pets are \ninjured or killed. In other instances, we learn of inhumane treatment \nof animals in settings often referred to as ``puppy mills'' where \nconditions include disease, pests, poor feeding, and other forms of \nmistreatment that should and must be stopped.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for raising the issue \nof enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act and for pointing out many of \nthe terrible conditions for which this Act is designed to halt and \nefforts by USDA and this Congress to put an end to them. The Senator is \ncorrect that funding for this activity has remained constant over the \npast several years. The President included in his budget request for \nfiscal year 2000 an increase of $515,000 for these activities.\n  The President's request would provide additional funds for \nenforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, but only to maintain current \nactivities such as inspections at regulated facilities to ensure \ncompliance with the Act. In addition, inspectors would receive much \nneeded training to ensure uniform enforcement of the regulations and to \nstay current with industry advancements in methodologies of research \nand caring for animals. APHIS would continue to replace outdated and \nold equipment including vehicles and continue modernizing its computer \ndatabases program. In view of the needs outlined in the budget request, \nand the overall problems outlined by the Senator from Wisconsin, this \nbill includes an increase of $2 million above last years level, nearly \nfour times the amount of increase requested by the President.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his explanation of \nthe activities included in the President's request for enforcement of \nthe Animal Welfare Act and for the generous increase he was able to \nprovide in this bill. I want to stress to all Senators that the \nincrease in this bill is designed to allow better enforcement of \ncurrently regulated activities. I am aware that the President's budget \nexplanation also included concern that pending litigation and \npotentially expanded jurisdiction for enforcement of the Animal Welfare \nAct would further strain the limited resources of the agency. It was, \nin part, for that reason that language is included in Senate Report to \nmake clear that the increase in this bill is to improve ongoing \nactivities of the agency and not for expansion of regulated activities.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KOHL. The Senate report language expresses our concern, as does \nthe President's budget justification, that a strain on existing \nresources could potentially negate the efforts taken in our bill to \nincrease the number of inspections at regulated facilities by \ninadvertently increasing the caseload of inspectors. I have heard from \nnumerous animal care advocates in Wisconsin who have told me we need \nmore inspectors to make sure the work now going undone is taken care \nof. For that reason, and not for expansion of authorities, the increase \nis included in this bill.\n  However, I also want to note that while the language in the Senate \nreport expressly limits the increased funding to currently authorized \nactivities and also expresses our concern that expansion of agency \nprograms at this time may strain resources past the breaking point, it \nis not intended to chill the efforts by advocacy groups to pursue their \ninterests through either the rulemaking process or through the courts. \nIt is not our intention for the Senate report language to sway, in one \nway or the other, upcoming decisions of the courts or to infringe on \nthe Department's proper exercise of rulemaking authority. For those who \nmay read the report language and be concerned that we are stepping too \nfar into the realm of agency or court activities, we may wish to \nconsider some modifications to this language for purposes of inclusion \nin the statement of managers to accompany the conference report to this \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator for his concerns and I will work \nwith him in the conference to consider whether modifications to this \nlanguage are in order.\n\n\n         greater yellowstone interagency brucellosis committee\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first I would like to thank Chairman \nCochran and Senator Kohl for the hard work they have put into the \nFiscal Year 2000 Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill. It is a challenging process, and they have done an \nexcellent job balancing competing interests within the confines of a \nbalanced budget.\n  I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the \nSubcommittee regarding funding for the Greater Yellowstone Interagency \nBrucellosis Committee (GYIBC). There is currently a Cooperative State \nFederal Brucellosis Eradication Program to eliminate the brucellosis \nfrom the country. States are designated brucellosis free when none of \ntheir cattle or bison are found to be infected for 12 consecutive \nmonths. As of March 31, 1998, 42 States, plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. \nVirgin Islands, are free of brucellosis. The presence of brucellosis in \nfree-ranging bison in Yellowstone National Park threatens the \nbrucellosis status of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana, as well as the \nhealth of their livestock herds, which are free of the disease. \nReintroduction of the disease into a brucellosis-free State could have \na serious economic impact on domestic livestock markets and potentially \nthreaten export markets.\n  The Committee saw fit to allocate $610,000 for the coordination of \nFederal, state and private actions aimed at eliminating brucellosis \nfrom wildlife in the Greater Yellowstone Area. I would like to clarify \nhow this money is to be allocated. Of the funds appropriated for the \nGYIBC, $400,000 is for the States of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana to \nparticipate in the GYIBC, with the understanding that 50 percent goes \nto the state that chairs the committee and 25 percent goes to each of \nthe other states. The remaining $210,000 is for the State of Idaho to \nprotect the State's brucellosis-free status and implement the Idaho \nWildlife Brucellosis plan. Is it the intent of the Committee to use \nthese funds as I have described?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, it is the intent of the Committee to use the \nallocated funds as the Senator from Idaho stated.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                    aphis plant protection colloquy\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first I would like to thank Chairman \nCochran and Senator Kohl for the hard work they have put into the \nFiscal Year 2000 Agriculture, Rural Development, and related Agencies \nAppropriations bill. It is a challenging process, and they have done an \nexcellent job balancing competing interests within the confines of a \nbalanced budget.\n  I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee regarding the appropriation for the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nplant protection programs and regulations.\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\nThe funds this bill makes available for plant protection are critical \nto protecting American agriculture from diseases, pests, and invasive \nplants. My own state of Idaho struggles greatly with noxious weeds, \nsuch as leafy spurge, which compete with the native grasses so \nessential for the raising of cattle.\n  Researchers at the University of Idaho and around the country are \nworking diligently to develop mechanisms to use biological controls for \nweeds and to manage diseases of important agriculture plants. It is my \nunderstanding that current APHIS regulations require a permit for \ninterstate transfer of a pathogen or plant infected with a pathogen \nfrom one research location to another. However, research and education \nfacilities routinely transfer plant materials from one research \nlocation to another using good management practices.\n  To facilitate researchers' work on behalf of American agriculture, I \nask that the Committee clarify its intent that the appropriations \ncontained in this bill for the Department of Agriculture's Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service should be used to carry out plant \nprotection programs and regulations that take into account the levels \nof risk presented by pathogens and to establish mechanisms to expedite \nor provide exemptions from any formal permit or certification processes \nfor research and education facilities established under implementing \nregulations as the Secretary deems appropriate. Is it the intent of the \nCommittee to use these funds as I have described?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, it is the intent of the Committee to use the \nallocated funds as the Senator from Idaho stated. Use of these \nappropriations for plant protection purposes will indeed benefit \nAmerican agriculture, including producers in Mississippi.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is also the Committee's belief that the routine \nhandling of a variety of pathogens by many research and education \nfacilities, using good management practices, has occurred widely \nwithout their untoward release and establishment in the environment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes. The Secretary of Agriculture should take this into \naccount when establishing any regulatory processes for the movement and \nhandling of pathogens. The Secretary should establish, to the extent \npossible, processes under which the facilities and their management \npractices are reviewed periodically, rather than requiring case-by-case \napproval for each us of a pathogen regardless of risk.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I understand from researchers in my state that pathogens \nthat might be considered for exemption or expedited processes include: \nendemic and naturalized pathogens for which there is extensive \ninformation and handling experience and for which management strategies \nhave been developed; pathogens intended for educational, research, or \nreference use that are not to be released into the environment; or \npathogens that present low risk because of their mode of survival, \ndissemination, or some other aspect of their biology. Is that the \nCommittee's understanding?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, the committee understands that certain types of \npathogens present low risks and research education facilities should \nface minimal regulatory burden as deemed appropriate by the Secretary \nof Agriculture. The Committee would also urge APHIS to develop \nlaboratory standards for facilities and management practices that will \nenable research and education facilities to handle higher-risk \npathogens as well. These laboratory standards will help APHIS use its \nresources more efficiently and allow efficient use of research \nresources to combat plant diseases more effectively.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, is it the intent of the Committee that APHIS \nconsult with relevant scientific societies as well as state regulators \nof plan pathogens and on-site reviewers of facilities where possible in \nmodifying current regulations or developing future regulations \nregarding the movement of pathogens between research and education \nfacilities?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, that is the Committee's intent.\n  Mr. KOHL. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. In \nmy home state of Wisconsin, a number of plant pathogens cause \nproduction losses for our producers. APHIS' implementation of plant \nprotection programs using the appropriations in this bill, consistent \nwith the Committee's intent, will assist researchers at many \nuniversities including the University of Wisconsin in their research \nefforts to combat plant disease and pests.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding the APHIS is moving in this \ndirection already. APHIS recently requested that the National Plant \nBoard review its Plant Protection and Quarantine program to make \nrecommendations for changes and improvements in the framework for \nregulations. This review, which included representatives of \nuniversities and industry as well as the state regulators, resulted in \nrecommendations that will soon be presented in a report called \n``Safeguarding American Plant Resources: A Review of APHIS' Plant \nProtection and Quarantine's Pest Safeguarding System.'' This report \nwill also recommend risk-based management of plant permits, including \ndevelopment of mechanisms to exempt from permitting or expedite \npermitting in certain low-risk cases. Thank you for your continued \ninterest in this matter.\n\n\n        CLARIFICATIONS TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE REPORT NO. 106-80\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I note for the record the following technical \nclarifications to the Senate committee report (Senate Report 106-80) on \nS. 1233, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2000:\n  On page 96 of the report, the chart regarding the rural economic \ndevelopment loans program account should not footnote the Committee \nrecommendation. The Committee's recommendation for the direct loan \nsubsidy is not offset by a rescission from interest on the cushion of \ncredit payments, as authorized by section 313 of the Rural \nElectrification Act of 1936.\n  On page 133 of the report, Bill Emerson and Mickey Leland Hunger \nFellowships should be added to the list of programs which currently \nlack authorization for fiscal year 2000.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this agriculture appropriations bill \nprovides annual funding for our nation's farmers, producers and the \nagency supporting our agricultural industry, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. The chairman and his colleagues on the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee deserve much credit for their work on this \nbill, which ensures funding for fundamental programs to support \nagricultural, rural development and nutrition programs. Unfortunately, \nthe process by which appropriators continue to add wasteful and \nunnecessary spending to this important funding measure is unacceptable.\n  Each year, I am amazed by arbitrary fashion in which the \nappropriations committees choose to allocate the strict federal dollars \nthat we should reserve for important and necessary federal programs. At \nthe expense of our American taxpayers, this bill and its accompanying \nreport are riddled with unrequested, low-priority earmarks, \nrepresenting $170 million in additional spending.\n  The agriculture appropriations bill is a haven for members to tack on \nunrequested and unauthorized funding for special interest projects, \nparticularly in sections of the accompanying Senate report dealing with \nthe Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. For \nexample, 114 out of a total 118 projects funded under the section for \nspecial research grants are either unrequested or received additional \nfunding above the budget request. Over 90 projects under the \nAgriculture Research Service were targeted for termination by the \nadministration, yet a majority of these projects continue to receive \nfunding in this bill.\n  These actions lead me to ask a fundamental question. What is the \npurpose of conducting a formal budget process when the Appropriations \nCommittee exhibits such carte blanche authority to fund projects which \nhave not been considered in our established authorization and funding \nprocess? I review all of the annual appropriations bills, yet I have \nrarely seen such flagrant examples of egregious spending as those \nincluded in this bill.\n  In the Senate report, the appropriations committee state their \ncommitment to only fund priority projects,\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\nyet earmarks are approved for such projects as $300,000 for cereal rust \nresearch in St. Paul, MN. No information is provided for members to \ndetermine what kind of project deals with ``cereal rust'' and why this \nproject deserves a specific earmark of nearly a third of a million \ndollars.\n  Other earmarks include $500,000 for swine waste management in North \nCarolina, $100,000 to reduce damages and manage populations of fish-\neating birds which prey on farm-raised cattle in the Mid-south area, \nand an increase of $452,000 to support the sterile fly release in San \nJoaquin Valley. It is incredible to me, and no doubt to the American \npeople, that we speak of fiscal responsibility and budget constraints \nin one manner, and yet act in a diametrically opposite manner wasting \nenormous amounts of funding for projects that appear to have little \nrelationship to improving the agricultural economy.\n  Some projects may be meritorious, such as potato research and weed \ncontrol, but are these problems specific only to certain states like \nWashington and North Dakota? Enough to receive not only an earmark, but \nan increase above the requested levels? I am certain that my \nconstituents in Arizona can attest to the need for funding to monitor \ncertain crops and deal with problems of weed control, yet they are \nunable to compete for funding to address these issues when decisions \nare based more on parochial interests rather than national priority.\n  This bill goes beyond the traditional earmarking process by selecting \nparticular sites across the country to receive additional spending for \nextra staff and personnel. Why are these facilities receiving direct \nfunding for additional staff at a time when each agency is required to \nabide by the mandate of the Government Performance and Results Act to \noperate more efficiently with less bureaucracy? Even if these positions \nare critical, why are they not prioritized in the normal administrative \nprocess?\n  In various parts of the bill and report, the committee includes \nexpress language which all but provides direct earmarks for certain \nprojects and grantees and effectively intervenes in what is supposed to \nbe a competitive grant process outside the realm of political \ninfluences. For example, in the Senate report, language is included \nwhich states the committee's expectation that the Administration give \nfull consideration to an application for funds to construct a new \nfacility for the St. Paul Island Health Clinic in Alaska and other \nlanguage which urges the Administration to consider applications from \nthe State of Alabama for projects benefitting Montgomery, State \nFarmer's Market and other farmers in the State.\n  We are invested with the responsibility to fully consider and debate \nthe appropriate expenditure of federal funds. I commend Senator \nCochran, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Agriculture \nAppropriations, for his floor statement in which he stated that the \ncommittee sought to apply funding in a ``reasonable and thoughtful \nway.'' Unfortunately, the pork in this bill and report prove that the \nAppropriations Committee is still unable to curb its appetite for \nunnecessary and wasteful spending.\n  I have compiled a list of objectionable provisions, totalling $170 \nmillion, to S. 1233 and its accompanying Senate report, which, due to \nits length, cannot be printed in the Record. The list of objectionable \nprovisions will be available on my Senate web page.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to indicate my strong support \nfor two related research and technology initiatives in the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's FY2000 budget--initiatives that were in the \nPresident's request, but which have not received any increases in this \nbudget being debated today. The USDA Global Change Research Program and \nthe Climate Change Technology Initiative are two very important \nprograms that deserve additional attention and funding. I recognize \nthat this Congress is faced with many competing funding needs, \nparticularly with the dire situation faced by much of the agriculture \ncommunity today, but I submit also that we cannot ignore the needs of \npotential future disasters, especially when the means to avoiding such \ndisaster will benefit U.S. farmers and U.S. agriculture while also \nbenefiting the entire nation.\n  I am referring to the potential effects of global climate change, and \nthe potential for the agriculture sector to cost-effectively and \nefficiently help us to mitigate against increased concentrations of \natmospheric greenhouse gases.\n  Like many policymakers and many of my colleagues, I am convinced by \nthe data international scientists have amassed that indicates climate \nchange is a phenomenon to be dealt with in order to avoid calamitous \neffects. I agree with the assessment of the scientific community that \nwe must insure against potentially devastating effects of climate \nchange by taking action now. We are certain that greenhouse gas \nconcentrations have been substantially increasing in the atmosphere, \nand as those concentrations have increased, global surface temperatures \nhave risen. While we are not sure of the exact nature or extent of the \nresulting climatic and weather-related disruptions that may occur as \nthe greenhouse effect is intensified, we do know that we should act \nnow. Acting now will benefit the global climate, and the health of our \ncitizens.\n  A significant body of research indicates that there is great \npotential for U.S. agriculture--for cropland, rangeland, and \npastureland, as well as for forests--to sequester carbon at \nparticularly low costs to society. Scientists have shown that with \nselected management practices, agricultural soils can effectively \nabsorb a large proportion of the annual increases in atmospheric CO2 \nthat are attributed to the greenhouse effect of global climate change.\n  What this means for the U.S. is that we have a cheap, effective \nsink--a means to sequester a large amount of the carbon dioxide and \nother greenhouse gases that are being emitted from fossil fuel \nemissions. The sequestration of carbon in soils is a benefit to \nagriculture, in addition to society. Increased carbon in soils leads to \nreduced soil erosion, increased soil tilth and fertility, increased \nwater absorption and retention, and most notably for agriculture, \nincreased productivity. As noted recently by Dr. Rattan Lal, an \ninternational soil carbon research scientist--carbon is the basis for \nall life--including in agricultural soils. Carbon absorption by soils \nhelps agriculture, and helps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  While we understand a great deal about the means by which carbon is \nabsorbed and retained in soils--for instance through minimal or no-till \npractices--there is still much that needs to be learned about the \nentire carbon cycle in nature, and how it moves from one pool, such as \nsoils, to others, such as the atmosphere. We need to better understand \nthe balance of land management and tillage techniques that sequester \nand retain carbon in soils, and to insure that agricultural policies \nare supportive of and encourage these activities. Additionally, \nresearch is needed to more accurately identify how carbon is lost from \nsoils, either to the atmosphere or elsewhere--and to then identify how \nbest to preserve and retain carbon in the soil sink.\n  What we are looking at is a win-win-win situation--a win for society, \na win for the climate, and a win for agriculture. But we must invest \nnow in this future, not only because it will help us to bridge the gap, \nas we move in the direction of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels \nand practices that emit greenhouse gases, but it will help us to soften \nthe blow on all other impacted sectors. Using agriculture as a carbon \nsink helps not only agriculture--it gives all other sectors breathing \nroom to technologically or otherwise adapt to reduced fossil fuel \ndependence. It will help this country to reduce our greenhouse gas \nemissions sooner, cheaper, and without the disruptions to businesses \nand the economy that some sectors have forecast.\n  Mr. President, that is why I want to voice my support for funding the \nUSDA Carbon Cycle Research Program and the Climate Change Technology \nInitiative. Funding for these important programs is essential to \noptimize the potential for agriculture and for the climate. I urge that \nthe Senate consider additional funding for these programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my full statement be included in the record \nduring the debate on the Agriculture Appropriations Bill.\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I'm proud to represent a state that \nproduces a wide variety of the highest quality agricultural products, \nfrom dairy products to cranberries, ginseng, corn, wheat--the list goes \non, and it is as varied as Wisconsin itself.\n  Agriculture is the lifeblood of my state, so when a bill like \nAgriculture Appropriations comes to the floor, I feel it's vitally \nimportant that every aspect of the legislation--including the interests \nattempting to influence this debate--be discussed and examined.\n  Earlier this year when I gave remarks on this floor, I promised that \nfrom time to time when I participate in debates on legislation I would \npoint out the role of special interest money in our legislative \nprocess, an effort I am calling The Calling of the Bankroll.\n  That's why today I want to briefly highlight some of the political \ncontributions that have been made by the agriculture industry--money \nspent to influence the way we approach agriculture appropriations on \nthis floor, in the other body, and at the White House.\n  Agriculture interests have donated nearly $3 million in soft money \nduring the last election cycle, and $15.6 million in PAC money. That's \nwell over $18 million overall--and again that's during just a two-year \nperiod.\n  The soft money numbers are particularly interesting, Mr. President, \nbecause they reflect a pattern that a number of special interests \nfollow, known as ``double giving'' or ``switch hitting.'' It means that \na donor doesn't just give soft money to one party, the party whose \npolitical views the donor might favor. Instead double givers amass \npolitical clout by donating generously to both parties.\n  Examples of these soft money double givers in the agriculture \nindustry during the last cycle include the Archer Daniels Midland \nCompany, which donated $263,000 to the Democrats and $255,000 to the \nRepublicans; United States Sugar Corp, which donated $157,500 to the \nDemocrats and almost $250,000 to the Republicans; and Ocean Spray \nCranberries Incorporated, which donated $156,060 to the Democrats and \n$117,600 to the Republicans.\n  Those are just a handful of examples, Mr. President, but I think they \ngive my colleagues an idea of how the double-giving game is played.\n  Of course not everyone is a double giver. The top agribusiness soft \nmoney donor to the Democratic party, crop producer Connell Company, \ngave $435,000, all to the Democratic party committees. Dole Food \nCompany gave more than $200,000 in soft money in 1997 and 1998, all to \nRepublican party committees.\n  And in the interest of fairness, Mr. President, I also should mention \nan agribusiness donor that shares my position against the extension of \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact: The International Dairy Foods Association, \nwhich gave more than $71,000 in soft money during 1997 and 1998 all to \nthe Republican party committees.\n  There are many interests that will be affected by what we do here on \nthis floor with regard to agriculture appropriations, Mr. President, \nand some have more resources to influence this debate than others. It \nis in the spirit of providing a fuller picture of the debate over \nagricultural issues--and the wealthy interests that seek to influence \nthe debate's outcome--that I have presented this information, both for \nthe benefit of the public and my colleagues.\n  I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, like many in the Nation, Washington's \nagriculture communities have fallen on extremely tough times. For \nexample, a combination of adverse economic circumstances has caused \napple prices to fall to their lowest level in over a decade, while the \nprice for soft winter wheat has plummeted to below $2.50 a bushel.\n  During the debate on the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations \nbill, we have been discussing what to most growers is in the forefront \nof their mind--their bankbook and their bottom line. Without question, \nthis issue deserves our time and attention.\n  While crumbling commodity prices have taken their toll on far too \nmany proud and previously profitable agricultural producers and their \nfamilies, they also are eroding the very foundation upon which much of \nmy State's rural economy is built. Simply put, many of my state's \nfarmers and their communities are suffering.\n  Washington State produces half the Nation's apples from orchards that \nstart at the base of the Cascade mountains and stretch from the \nCanadian border in the north, to the Columbia River in the south. Aided \nby volcanic soil rich in nutrients, irrigation, cool nights and warm \nsunny days, Washington's apples are the envy of the world's other apple \nproducing countries.\n  Where my State's apple orchards end, Washington's lush fields of \nwheat begin. Spanning the eastern third of my State, Washington's wheat \nfarms produce the most sought after wheat in Asia. And yet, being the \nbest and producing such high quality products does not always equate to \nsuccess.\n  The Asian financial crisis and world wide overproduction have taken \ntheir toll on Washington's wheat farmers. At the same time, a record \ncrop coupled with a decline in export opportunities and a flood of \ncheap apple-juice concentrate imports from China have imperiled many of \nmy State's apple growers.\n  Still, Washington's agricultural producers are fiercely independent \nand not ones to look for a handout from the Federal Government. Rather, \nin all my discussions with members Washington's agricultural community \nand its leaders, what I am told my State's farmers need and want most \nfrom the Federal Government is a fair shake. Specifically, their list \nof demands includes trade, access to the tools necessary for quality \nproduction, regulatory relief, tax relief a dependable labor force, and \nFederal participation in agriculture research.\n  Growers have rightfully insisted upon fair and unfettered access to \nthe world's consumers, which can only be achieved by insisting that \nthere will be no trade deals until an acceptable agricultural agreement \nis reached during the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations \nslated to commence this fall in Seattle. I thoroughly support this \ndemand, recognizing that Washington's producers export more than 25 \npercent of their harvest, with at least one third of the apples grown \nin Washington being shipped, and nine in ten bushels of wheat being \nexported.\n  Unfortunately, far too many countries still restrict or prohibit the \nimportation of Washington's cornucopia of commodities. That is why I \nhave expressed to administration trade officials the importance and \nsignificance of agriculture negotiations during the Ministerial. We \nmust work to pry open these markets and, if need be, deny another \ncountry's goods access to our market until the doors of trade swing \nfreely in both directions.\n  For example, just recently the Government of Taiwan agreed to delay \nimplementation of pesticide tolerance tests that would have seriously \nhampered the U.S. apple and cherry trade with that country. Recognizing \nTaiwan is the apple industry's largest export market, I took the lead \namong my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that these tests would not \nbe implemented until further scientific discovery had occurred.\n  Farmers face not only bogus phytosanitary trade barriers, but unfair \ntrade practices by other countries. In early June, I sent a letter of \nsupport to the International Trade Commission regarding the dumping \ncase brought by the U.S. apple industry against China. The ITC recently \nunanimously agreed that dumping had occurred and will announce \npotential duties in the near future. The case brought by the industry \nwas terribly justified, recognizing the price paid for U.S. apples for \njuice concentrate plummeted to nearly a penny a pound.\n  Unilateral trade sanctions, as a result of the convincing messages \nsent by Washington farmers, have been at the center of nearly every \nagriculture discussion in the U.S. Senate. In response to the cries for \nrelief from farmers, I have supported nearly every agriculture trade \nsanctions relief bill that has been introduced in the Senate. With \nnearly 60% of the world's population under U.S. sanction, the time to \ndiscuss the impact of these sanctions on the American family farm could \nnot be more timely. It is without question that these sanctions do more \nharm to our agriculture communities than to the regimes on which they \nare imposed.\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\n  In addition to all the various trade conditions facing the producer, \nfarmers in Washington have also demanded access to affordable and \neffective crop protection tools, which can only be achieved through \nscience-based implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act. That's \nwhy I am an original cosponsor of the Regulatory Openness and Fairness \nAct to ensure that decisions regarding health risks are informed and \nnot hasty, that the intent of the FQPA is carried out with the use of \nsound science and practical application, that a dose of common sense is \napplied, and that adequate time is available to make certain all \ndecisions and tolerance standards are healthy and equitable.\n  Continued availability of water for irrigation, electrical generation \nand the transportation of bulk commodities from field to port, which \ncan only be achieved through a balanced and scientifically-sound salmon \nrecovery effort in the Pacific Northwest is a demand that resinates \nthroughout Washington's orchards and fields. This is a demand I not \nonly respect, but as most producers will know, continues to be one of \nmy most important priorities as a U.S. Senator. I have gone to great \nlengths to ensure the solvency of the Snake and Columbia River \nhydroelectric systems with one key user in mind--farmers.\n  Washington produces a wide array of minor crops, many that are very \nlabor intensive and require special attention during harvest. \nWashington's agriculture community demands a dependable and legal \nworkforce to harvest and process their crops, which can only be \nachieved by reforming the H2A labor program to provide agricultural \nemployers with an affordable and workable system for securing temporary \nforeign labor. I have testified with my colleagues and introduced bills \nin the Senate that would provide such reforms.\n  Farmers in Washington demand meaningful tax relief. Just last week, \nthe tax bill passed in the Senate included the much sought after Farm \nand Ranch Risk Management accounts. These set-aside accounts will \nprovide the savings mechanism growers have requested in order to secure \nfinancial longevity. In addition, I am a strong proponent for the \nelimination of the estate tax, one the most onerous financial burdens \nplaced on a livelihood that is passed from generation to generation.\n  And finally, with passage of the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill, growers \ndemanded federal participation in agriculture research. My role as a \nmember of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee provides \nthe mechanism necessary to ensure that the Pacific Northwest is \nadequately represented, and that science based research is utilized to \nassist growers in producing some of the most demanded, nutritional, and \nsafest food supplies in the world.\n  All of the aforementioned demands are intended to provide \nWashington's agricultural producers the tools they need to cultivate a \nprofitable future. I remain convinced of their merit and committed to \nthe task of securing their achievement. Unfortunately, this \nadministration has yet to recognize their importance and, in most \ncases, actually opposes their adoption.\n  And now the Senate is in the midst of a debate not only over the \nlivelihood and longevity of the American farm, but to some extent, the \npolicy that drives our nation's combines and tractors. I am unwilling \nto condone the approach being advocated by some of my colleagues, who \nare seeking to turn back the hands of time and to undermine the free-\nmarket principles embodies in the Freedom to Farm Act. Instead, I \nsupport an approach that provides the resources to those programs \nalready in place to assist producers to overcome these difficult times.\n  Meanwhile, as the Senate debates the issue of farm economy and \nfinancial assistance, the White House remains silent. Recognizing the \nbottom line for many in the agriculture sector is slowly dropping, my \ncolleagues and I sent a letter to the President, requesting his active \nparticipation in the establishment of a financial relief package for \nfarmers. This letter was in addition to a request included in the \nfiscal year 1999 supplemental appropriations bill for administration \ninvolvement. As we debate this sensitive issue today, the \nAdministration's inactivity and silence is deafening.\n  Recognizing the bleak financial future facing Washington's minor \ncrops, I have during the past few days fought tirelessly to ensure that \nfunding is provided in the Republican farm assistance package for \nfruits and vegetables. I have undertaken this endeavor very seriously \nand have engaged in extremely frank discussions with my colleagues over \nmy support for an amendment that includes such a provision.\n  During the debate on the original Cochran financial relief package, I \nwas successful in negotiating the inclusion of $50 million for the \nfruit and vegetable industries. Because of my desire to provide \nadditional funds for fruits and vegetables, I worked with Senator \nRoberts to include in his amendment $300 million for specialty crops. \nWhile the entire Roberts amendment failed in the Senate, I am pleased \nthat our tree fruit and vegetable industries have a $50 million \nstarting point. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I will have the opportunity to work to increase this \nfunding during conference on the bill.\n  I also responded to the calls for assistance from those in orchard \ncountry by including an amendment in the bill directing the Farm \nService Agency to review all programs that assist apple growers in time \nof need. Specifically, I requested that FSA review the limits placed on \noperating loans utilized by apple farmers, and report back to Congress \nwhat the agency perceives is a workable remedy.\n  Rest assured, whatever the final outcome of the Fiscal Year 2000 \nAgriculture Appropriations bill, I will send two important messages to \nmy agriculture constituency back home. First, I will continue working \ntirelessly to make certain all commodities produced from Washington's \nfertile soil will have a fair shake at receiving some form of \nassistance. I am poised and prepared to continue this challenge. And \nsecond, I will continue working on agriculture's list of demands, \npushing to ensure that from trade to labor, and from taxes to \nenvironment, the livelihood that has made agriculture the career choice \nfor so many will remain just that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern that S. \n1233, the Agriculture Appropriations bill for FY2000 does not include \nadequate funding for carbon cycle or carbon sequestration research. The \nAdministration has proposed approximately $22 million for these \nprograms at the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and the \nAgriculture Research Service (ARS). With that money, scientists can \ndevelop a better understanding of the potential for agricultural lands \nto serve as carbon sinks. These programs are priorities in the U.S. \nGlobal Change Research Program and the Administration's Climate Change \nTechnology Initiative.\n  Once we more thoroughly understand how our soils capture and store \ncarbon, we can use that knowledge to improve our management practices \nand yields. We can also cost-effectively use soils to offset carbon \nemissions that might lead to global warming. Failure to provide these \nfunds is short-sighted and may prevent farmers and ranchers from \nreaping profits through storing carbon on their land in the near \nfuture.\n  Agricultural lands in the U.S. have a huge potential to store carbon \nthat would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Each year, the \nU.S. emits about 1.5 billion metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTC) or \ngases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. According to USDA \nexperts, properly managed U.S. croplands could be major sinks or \nreservoirs of carbon. They could sequester, or store, 85-200 MMTC more \nper year than the agriculture sector does now. If a coordinated program \nto manage carbon in agricultural soils were implemented worldwide, some \nexperts project that carbon sequestration could increase to the rate of \n3000 MMTC per year. This rate is equal to the world's net annual \nincreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n  Mr. President, about 25-30% of our nation's farmers, growers and \nranchers are already employing best management practices which will \neffectively store carbon, so farmers and ranchers would not need to \nadopt radically new production techniques to store carbon. Most find \nthese practices very cost-effective for their bottom-line because\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\nthe land rewards them for their attention. There are higher yields with \nincreased carbon storage, less erosion, and improved soil and water \nquality. As an example, adoption of conservation tillage and residue \nmanagement practices could lock up about .2 metric tons of carbon per \nacre every year.\n  Eventually, as actions by some of our major trading partners are now \ndemonstrating, there is likely to be a worldwide market in carbon \ncredit trading, regardless of what happens to the Kyoto Treaty in this \ncountry. This is a terrific economic opportunity. As we discuss the \nsorry state of American agriculture and the family farm in the context \nof this bill, we should keep in mind that soil carbon storage could \nbecome a very lucrative opportunity to maintain income levels. Experts \nare projecting that carbon credits will sell for somewhere between $10-\n$50 per ton and maybe higher. So, a farmer using best management \npractices on his 1000 acres could possibly get payments of $2,000-\n$10,000 or more per year for storing carbon.\n  Mr. President, the very modest sums that the Administration is \nseeking for these programs are not to implement Kyoto through some \nback-door method. There are legitimate scientific questions that need \nto be answered whether or not one believes Kyoto is necessary. \nUnderstanding soil science better will improve crop yields, make range \nmanagement more efficient, and provide a host of environmental quality \nbenefits. This knowledge will benefit all those who produce food and \nfiber.\n  I should note for my colleagues that there will be a national \nconference to explore opportunities for carbon sequestration in \nMissoula, Montana, from October 26-28. The purpose of this conference \nis to provide information and education on carbon sequestration \nactivities to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions through market-based \nconservation.\n  Many of the experts that will speak at this conference are scientists \nwhose work would be furthered if Congress funds the Administration's \nrequest. The efforts of the Montana Carbon Offset Coalition to \nestablish a pilot carbon trading program would also be helped along by \nfunding these programs.\n  Mr. President, there are many pressing needs facing Congress and, in \nparticular, the managers of the Agriculture Appropriations bill. I just \nthink that we should make investing in our future a priority. Soils \nseem to be a great low-cost way for us to reduce the impact our country \nhas on the global climate. Even for those who do not believe climate \nchange is happening due to mankind's emissions, increasing soil carbon \ncontent has huge side benefits for the economy and the environment. I \nhope the managers will find a way to fund these important programs in \nconference.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Cochran \namendment to the agriculture appropriations bill that provides \nemergency relief to the nation's rural communities. I voted for the \nCochran plan and the assistance it will bring to suffering Minnesota \nfarm families.\n  Earlier in the discussion of agriculture relief, I participated in \nefforts to find a compromise that could provide more relief than the \nCochran proposal. Specifically, I believe Minnesota farmers would have \nbeen better served by the Grassley-Conrad amendment, which failed by a \nclose margin. The Grassley-Conrad package provided some additional \nelements, such as flood and crop loss payments, as well as increased \naid for dairy producers. It was an $8.8 billion proposal that would \nhave been particularly beneficial to our state's farmers.\n  The Cochran bill preserves the use of increased Agricultural Market \nTransition Act (AMTA) payments for income assistance to farmers, which \nis good for Minnesota producers. The Daschle-Harkin alternative \npackage, while providing a higher amount of relief, tied income \nassistance to production levels. I am concerned that their proposal \nwould have shortchanged some farmers, like wheat farmers in \nNorthwestern Minnesota, who were unable to plant a crop this year due \nto severe weather. In one Northwestern county, only 10 percent of the \nnormal acreage was planted. The Cochran proposal also provides needed \nrelief to oilseed, livestock, dairy, and sugar producers. It also \nreduces the cost of crop insurance and increases the LDP payment limit \nto $150,000. And it exempts food and medicine sales from unilateral \nsanctions which will help Minnesota farmers sell to Cuba and other \ncountries.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate resisted the attempt to extend the \nlife of the Northeast Compact and prevent enactment of the federal milk \nmarketing order reforms during consideration of the emergency farm \nrelief package. Considering the hardships that the rural areas are \nsuffering, now is certainly not the time to be taking up controversial \nproposals which discriminate against Midwest dairy farmers. Dairy \nfarmers in the Midwest are struggling to make a decent living for their \nfamilies, and they should not have to shoulder the additional burden of \ndairy policies that prevent them from receiving a fair price. I urge \nthe conferees on the agriculture appropriations bill to likewise reject \nextension of the dairy compacts, and restore market fairness for \nAmerica's dairy producers.\n  There is a great deal of apprehension in the rural community over the \nfuture of farming, and I am certainly glad that we passed essential \nrelief for farmers now, instead of waiting until after the August \nrecess. I remain committed to Freedom to Farm and the opportunity that \nit promises. However, Freedom to Farm can only help our farmers if the \npolitical courage can be mustered to enact reforms in the areas of \ntaxation, sanctions and regulations, and if we can continue to expand \nour markets. In the short-term the nation's farmers need assistance to \ntide them over in these difficult times, and I'm pleased that the \nSenate took the necessary steps to get aid to them quickly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nAgriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2000.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $60.4 billion in new budget \nauthority (BA) and $40.2 billion in new outlays to fund most of the \nprograms of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. \nAll of the discretionary funding in this bill is nondefense spending.\n  When outlays from prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $64.3 billion in BA \nand $47.3 billion in outlays for FY 2000. Including mandatory savings, \nthe Subcommittee is at its 302(b) allocation in both BA and outlays.\n  The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) allocation \ntotals $64.3 billion in BA and $47.3 billion in outlays. Within this \namount, $14.0 billion in BA and $14.3 billion in outlays is for \nnondefense discretionary spending.\n  For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all \nthe mandatory savings in the bill, the Senate-reported bill is at the \nSubcommittee's 302(b) allocation in BA and outlays. It is $22 million \nin BA below and $161 million in outlays above the 1999 level for \ndiscretionary spending, and $537 million in BA and $577 million in \noutlays below the President's request for these programs.\n  I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its \n302(b) allocation. I appreciate the Committee's support for a number of \nongoing projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico \nas it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 1906, AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS, 2000; SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                      (Fiscal Year 2000 $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority..............   13,983   ........   50,295    64,278\n  Outlays.......................   14,254   ........   33,088    47,342\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..............   13,983   ........   50,295    64,278\n  Outlays.......................   14,254   ........   33,088    47,342\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority..............   14,005   ........   41,460    55,465\n  Outlays.......................   14,093   ........   33,429    47,522\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority..............   14,520   ........   50,295    64,815\n  Outlays.......................   14,831   ........   33,088    47,919\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority..............   13,882   ........   50,295    64,177\n  Outlays.......................   14,508   ........   33,088    47,596\n \n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\n \n  SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n               TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..............  ........  ........  ........  ........\n  Outlays.......................  ........  ........  ........  ........\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority..............

Mr. President, stacks of spiral-bound notebooks and reams \nof paper, boxes of pencils and pens, lunch boxes and backpacks, are all \nmaking their way onto store shelves across the Nation as summer limps \ntoward its hot, dry conclusion and the warm, crisp promise of autumn \ndays, yellow school buses, and children walking to school closes in on \nus. A new school year is upon us, with all its bright potential for \nlearning. Most students welcome the chance to see their friends again, \nand to again immerse themselves in the business of learning and \ngrowing. But sadly, some children are afraid to go to school. Some \nchildren must face and conquer the memories of sudden, violent death \nthat have visited their schools in recent years.\n  Mr. President, in the wake of the senseless atrocities that have \nripped at the traditional calm of schools across the country, it has \nbecome increasingly evident that we must work together here in \nCongress, and with our state governments, to prevent this kind of \nterrible tragedy from striking yet another American schoolyard. I am \npleased to have recently joined with Senators Lieberman and McCain in \nauthoring legislation to create a National Commission on Youth \nViolence, which has been included in the Senate-passed juvenile justice \nlegislation.\n  With the new school year just around the corner, it seems an \nopportune time to refocus our energies on the work underway in each of \nour respective states, and to help the states craft even more effective \nprevention strategies for the upcoming academic year. And similarly, \nthe states will serve as an invaluable resource for helping us to \nbetter strategize on federal solutions necessary for restoring peace \nand tranquility to our nation's schools. If we hope to have a school \nyear free from the violence and emotional grief that rocked our nation \nlast year, an equal exchange and dialogue is truly in order.\n  Given the most serious nature of the challenge we face, it is \nimportant that we bring together a wide range of experts to seek \nsolutions to school violence. In this vein, I am pleased, today, to \nannounce my cosponsorship with West Virginia University of a day-long \nsymposium on safe schools and communities. From representatives of the \nWest Virginia State Police, to parents, students, and the church \ncommunity, the symposium participants will focus on efforts already \nunderway throughout the state to combat school violence, and what more \nneeds to be done to better protect our teachers and students from \nclassroom violence. I hope that this event will give participants the \nopportunity to highlight the progress that has already been made in \nschool safety, while also helping to create a guide for what still \nneeds to be accomplished. West Virginia University, with its wealth of \nresearch and expertise, is the ideal forum for this event, and I feel \nconfident that its contribution in behalf of the higher education \ncommunity will further strengthen this ongoing dialogue throughout the \nstate.\n  A school ought to be a place where students thrive on learning for \nlearning's sake alone, and where teachers find true pleasure in \nexplaining the details of the battle at Antietam or the Pythagorean \ntheorem. It ought to be a place where students can frolic in the school \nplayground with classmates during recess without a worry in the world. \nMr. President, the events of the recent past work against this vision.\n  It is my hope that this symposium will provide West Virginians with \nan opportunity to look for ways to prevent such violence from occurring \nin West Virginia schools. By bringing together West Virginia parents, \neducators, students, law enforcement officials, policy makers, and a \nvariety of other experts to examine school- and community-based \nstrategies to reduce youth violence, we, collectively, will bring \ngreater clarity and wisdom to this troubling issue, both at the state \nand federal levels.\n  As students and teachers prepare for another school year, we need to \nreflect on the violence that has taken place in so many other \ncommunities, and look for ways to prevent such violence from occurring \nin West Virginia schools. Through this symposium, it is my hope that we \nwill take the time to find the strength to reach across the lines that \nserve to divide us and touch the common spirit that the Creator \ninstilled in each of us. It is long past time for us to work together \non common ground to achieve common dreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10215-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10215-S10216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TIME TO SUPPORT CTBT RATIFICATION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to urge Senate consideration of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT. As Ranking Member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation and Federal Services, I believe that ratification of the \nCTBT would enhance our nation's security for several reasons.\n  It imposes a verifiable ban on all nuclear weapons testing, conducted \nanywhere, at any time; it takes a pro-active step towards ending the \nthreat of nuclear tests conducted by rogue nations attempting to \ndevelop nuclear weapons; and it demonstrates the United States' \ncommitment to a safer and more secure future free from radioactive \nfallout produced by nuclear explosions. Implementing the CTBT does not \npreclude improving our nuclear weapons. The United States will be able \nto maintain a sophisticated and viable arsenal without conducting \ndangerous nuclear tests.\n  In the last decade, the most frequently cited argument against a test \nban has been the claim that continued testing is necessary to ensure \nthat stockpiled weapons are reliable; that is, they will detonate as \nplanned and that the yield and effects will meet design specifications. \nEven test ban critics acknowledge that reliability stockpile testing \nhas been mainly nonnuclear.\n  In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Robert \nBaker, former Deputy Assistant Director for Verification and \nIntelligence at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, ACDA, said, \n``[they] do not routinely go out and take nuclear weapons out of the \nstockpile and test them.'' Other weapons designers have testified that \nnuclear tests simulations on high-performance computers are adequate \nsubstitutes for nuclear explosions and can provide accurate data on \nwarhead viability.\n  The purpose of testing existing weapons has not been to detect \nunforeseen problems but rather to check on particular problems \nidentified through the non-nuclear inspection and simulation program. \nWith very rare exceptions, the tested weapons performed in the desired \nmanner. In fact, only one stockpile confidence test performed between \n1979 and 1986 revealed a problem needing correction. The reason that \nany nuclear reliability testing of stockpiled weapons has been \nnecessary in the past is that some older types of nuclear designs were \noriginally put into the stockpile without the stringent production \nverification tests now standard. Our stockpile stewardship program \nenables the United States to meet the requirements for a treaty banning \nall types of nuclear testing while simultaneously maintaining a viable \nnuclear arsenal.\n  This is not a new effort. It was not invented by the Clinton \nAdministration. American presidents have sought for nearly forty years \nto negotiate a treaty that prohibits nuclear testing.\n  President Eisenhower initially noted its importance in his State of \nthe Union address in January of 1960 when he said that ``looking to a \ncontrolled ban on nuclear testing'' could be the means of ending the \n``calamitous cycle . . . which, if unchecked, could spiral into nuclear \ndisaster.''\n  President Kennedy later reaffirmed the United States' commitment to \nsuch a treaty in a 1963 commencement address at American University, \nstating that ``the conclusion of such a treaty [that ended nuclear \ntesting] would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most \ndangerous areas. . . . [Furthermore,] it would increase our security \n[and] it would decrease the prospects of war.'' Today, this treaty has \nthe strong support of members from both parties.\n  If the Senate does not consent to the ratification of this treaty \nbefore the September 24, 1999, deadline, the United States will not be \nable to participate in decisions regarding the future of the treaty. \nUnder the terms of Article XIV of the CTBT, a conference of the \ncountries that have ratified can\n\n[[Page S10216]]\n\nbe convened on the third anniversary of the treaty's opening for \nsignature to determine how to ``accelerate the ratification process in \norder to facilitate the [treaty's] early entry into force.'' Although \nboth countries that have and have not ratified the treaty before the \ndate of this conference may attend, the non-member countries of the \ntreaty are only invited as observers and may not participate.\n  The United States is one of the 44 named countries that is required \nto sign and ratify the treaty before it can ``enter into force''. If \nthe United States does not ratify this treaty, we are preventing the \nCTBT's implementation. The United States must ratify this treaty so \nthat it can continue its leadership role in arms control. We should not \nbe the holdout country that threatens the CTBT's entry into force. By \ndemonstrating our commitment to halting nuclear testing, the United \nStates creates an environment that encourages other countries to ratify \nthe treaty.\n  The threat of rogue nations developing nuclear weapons is real and \nurgent. The July 1999 Deutch Commission's Report, entitled ``Combating \nProliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,'' cites several examples: \nin the spring of 1998, India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests, \nworsening instability on the subcontinent; during the recent crisis in \nKashmir, a nuclear war in South Asia looked possible for the first \ntime; and countries in the Middle East and East Asia attempted to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction. The CTBT prevents other nations \nwho ratify it from conducting nuclear tests. It helps rein in rogue \nnations now and in the future that attempt to acquire and develop \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Finally, this is a treaty that the American people want. Recent polls \nshow that 82 percent of Americans support ratification of the CTBT. \nThey know that ending nuclear explosions is a better way to protect the \nUnited States against nuclear weapons threats.\n  I urge the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to hold hearings on the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty so that we may take action on this \nagreement before it is too late. We cannot allow the United States to \nbe locked out of its rightful leadership role at the September review \nconference on this treaty. This treaty is the most effective step that \nwe can take to enhance international security and to maintain nuclear \nsafety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10216-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SPECIALIST T. BRUCE CLUFF\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, a memorial service was held on Monday in \nFt. Bliss, Texas, to honor five American men and women who lost their \nlives last week in the service of this country. On July 23, an Army \nairplane was reported missing over Colombia with five U.S. military \npersonnel and two Colombians on board. The wreckage was located later \nin the week and days later, the Department of Defense confirmed the \ndeaths of those on board.\n  Coffins draped with the Stars and Stripes left Bogota, and were flown \nto Ft. Bliss Texas, a wreching reminder of the continued sacrifice made \nby American men and women in the Armed Forces and of course their \nfamilies.\n  One of the soldiers killed in the crash was Private First Class T. \nBruce Cluff, a former resident of the city of Washington in my home \nstate of Utah. Private Cluff served as one of 300 soldiers in a \nBattalion whose uniforms bear a crest that states ``Silently We \nDefend.''\n  Mr. President, because we cannot, and should not, allow the untimely \nloss of those in uniform to go unnoticed, I rise today to pay tribute \nto Private T. Bruce Cluff, a soldier killed in the line of duty; a \nsoldier who received the Army Good Conduct Medal; a soldier who \nvolunteered to risk his life for the protection of our nation and its \ndefense against aggressors.\n  T. Bruce Cluff was born in Mesa, Arizona, and as a member of the Boy \nScouts of America, attained the rank of Eagle Scout at the age of 13. \nHe graduated from Whitehorse High School in 1992, and served a two year \nmission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the \nstate of Montana. Private Cluff attended Dixie College in Utah and \nworked as a Computer Aided Draftsman before enlisting in the Army in \n1997. He completed basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri and \nAdvanced Individual Training (AIT) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.\n  In mourning Cluff's death and announcing his posthumous promotion to \nthe rank of specialist, a statement from the Army read, ``His commander \nand NCO supervisors regarded his skills--as superlative. His can-do \nattitude and enthusiasm embodied the motto of his platoon, which reads, \n`Excellence--Nothing Else is Acceptable.' ''\n  As a reminder to those of use who didn't know any of the soldiers \npersonally, I share writings from George Washington which I believe \nshed light on a soldier's quiet commitment, and perhaps a tendency to \nforget what is asked of our men and women in uniform. The winter of \n1777 was a bleak time in our nation's military history. George \nWashington, after his defeat at the Brandywine, established Winter \nHeadquarters at Valley Forge. The soldiers were in rags, were sick and \nstarving. Criticism of Washington from the Congress was loud, and \nspreading to the public.\n  On December 23, General Washington wrote to the Continental Congress, \nexplaining that ``no less than 2,898 men now in camp are unfit for \nduty, because they are barefoot and otherwise naked.\n  He then addresses the criticism, ``But what makes this matter still \nmore extraordinary in my eye is, that these very gentlemen--who were \nwell apprised of the nakedness of our troops--should think a winter's \ncampaign, and the covering of these States [New Jersey and \nPennsylvania] from the invasion of an enemy, so easy and practicable a \nbusiness. I can assure those gentlemen, that it is a much easier and \nless distressing thing to draw remonstrances in a comfortable room by a \ngood fireside, than to occupy a cold, bleak hill, and sleep under frost \nand snow, without clothes or blankets.\n  Those of us who are in a `comfortable room by a good fireside,' \nshould be reminded that the missions of the military are not \ncomfortable nor are they easy. Even in peacetime, America has troops \nstationed all over the world, engaged in all manner of missions, and \nregrettably, none without threat.\n  There will be few who know about the Cluff's loss. Specialist Cluff, \nto use his new rank, has not had his picture on the cover of any \nmagazine. His life hasn't been the subject of wide media attention. \nHowever, his young wife who is expecting their third child, and his \nremaining two children, have lost a husband and young father. His \nsiblings have lost a brother and his parents have lost a son. This \ncountry has lost a good soldier. It mourns with his family and honors \nhis memory.\n  May the Cluffs be comforted in their time of grief. As we remember \nthem and ask God to watch over them and bring them solace, may we also \nremember the family members of the other military personnel who, with \nSpecialist Cluff, made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me say I was very moved by the \nremarks of the Senator from Utah. I am sure every Member of the Senate \nshares in expressing our sympathy for the men who were killed in that \nair crash. Certainly the Senator has done the Specialist and other \nMembers very proud in his comments before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10216-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10216-S10217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HOLD ON THE NOMINATION OF RICHARD HOLBROOKE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on June 24 I announced that I had placed \na hold on the nomination of Mr. Richard Holbrooke to be the new U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations. At that time, I had indicated that it \nwas not a personal dispute with Mr. Holbrooke, but that it was a signal \nto the State Department. The Department has been mistreating a whistle \nblower, Ms. Linda Shenwick. She had made protected financial \nmismanagement disclosures to Congress. Her disclosures led to the \ncreation of an Inspector General at the U.N., as well as other \nmanagement reforms and statutory requirements.\n  My interest in this matter is simple. Congress cannot function as an \ninstitution if government employees cannot\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\ncommunicate with Congress about wrongdoing. And the executive branch \nshould not be allowed to shoot the messenger with impunity. I am simply \ntrying to get the two parties to return to the negotiating table, where \nthey had been up to as recently as two months ago, and arrive at a \nmutually agreed-upon new job for Ms. Shenwick.\n  Accordingly, I have placed a hold on three new nominees from the \nState Department. They are the following: A. Peter Burleigh as \nAmbassador to the Philippines; Carl Spielvogel as Ambassador to the \nSlovak Republic; and, J. Richard Fredericks as Ambassador to \nSwitzerland.\n  In addition to these new holds, I have taken additional steps which I \nchoose not to disclose at this time. They are designed to increase my \nand other interested colleagues' ability to insist that Ms. Shenwick be \ntreated fairly. Several of my colleagues have indicated a desire to \nassist me on my further endeavors.\n  My interest, as I said, was not with Mr. Holbrooke. I intend to vote \nfor him. My interest is, and has been from the beginning, in making \nsure the process for Ms. Shenwick remains fair. It became evident to me \nthat the Secretary of State was not out of sorts with the hold-up of \nthe Holbrooke nomination. Yet the hold accomplished some progress.\n  In the first place, the Department had long ignored a letter signed \nby nine United States Senators in October of last year, raising our \nconcerns about its mistreatment of Ms. Shenwick. The Department did not \neven respond until June 30 of this year--eight months later. Since \nthen, we have corresponded again, and I met with State Department \nattorneys through the good offices of my friend from Virginia, Senator \nWarner.\n  I also met with Administration officials and have engaged in useful \ndialogue. It has resulted in a more highly sensitized Administration as \nto the need for effective communications with the State Department to \nensure fair treatment for Ms. Shenwick. These communications have \nproduced one small yet positive step toward ensuring the fairest \npossible process.\n  In the meantime, I have chosen to increase my leverage by putting the \nholds on these three nominees. At the same time, I will release my hold \non Mr. Holbrooke, satisfied that I have greater leverage, and the \nAdministration's heightened awareness and assurances of a fair process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10217-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMBASSADOR RICHARD HOLBROOKE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have lost track of how long it has been \nsince the President nominated Ambassador Richard Holbrooke to be the \nUnited States Permanent Representative to the United Nations.\n  What I do know is that in the intervening months we have fought a war \nin Kosovo that I supported, but which harmed our relations with Russia \nand China.\n  We have watched as tens of thousands of students demonstrated in the \nstreets of Tehran; seen further signs that North Korea is preparing to \ntest a long-range missile that could reach our shores; entered a new \nand hopeful period in the Middle East peace process; watched the \nNorthern Ireland peace process reach a dead end once again; and seen \nIndia and Pakistan, armed with nuclear weapons and the missiles to \ndeliver them, clash over Kashmir. All of this has occurred while \nAmbassador Holbrooke has been waiting to be confirmed.\n  So, Mr. President, it is possible for the United States to carry on \nwithout a UN ambassador. We have managed to do that. The world has not \ncome to an end, although not a day has passed without a crisis that we \nhave an interest in. But does anyone here think it is a sensible way \nfor the world's only superpower to conduct itself?\n  Every day, we face threats to our security interests, our economic \ninterest, that affect the health and welfare of the American people, \nand which require the intensive attention and intervention of skilled \ndiplomats. Aside from the Secretary of State, there is no diplomatic \nposition more important than our UN Ambassador.\n  Yet month after month after month, we have seen this nomination \ndelayed by the Majority party. First it was due to allegations of \nfinancial irregularities, which Ambassador Holbrooke resolved months \nago. Months had already been lost waiting for a hearing.\n  Then, shortly after the Majority Leader said the Senate would vote on \nhis nomination, a hold was placed on it and more weeks have passed \nwithout a vote being scheduled--a vote that is certain to confirm \nAmbassador Holbrooke overwhelmingly. In fact, he would have been \nconfirmed easily months ago, if the Senate had been permitted to vote.\n  This is the last week before the August recess. There is absolutely \nno justification whatsoever for delaying this further. There are no \npolitical points to be made here. On the contrary, we hurt ourselves \neach day that we are without a UN Ambassador. It is, frankly, \nridiculous to be acting as if this position can remain vacant for month \nafter month, without weakening our influence around the world.\n  So let us hope this is the week that Ambassador Holbrooke will be \nconfirmed, and that he can get started on the difficult job that we, \nthe American people and the President, need him to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10217-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the appellate \n     jurisdiction of federal courts regarding partial-birth \n     abortions; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 257\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana is one of twenty-five states which has \n     recently prohibited the specific medical procedure termed \n     ``partial-birth abortions''; and\n       Whereas, numerous other states are working this legislative \n     session to enact the same ban; and\n       Whereas, federal district courts have thus far struck down \n     laws in seventeen different states, effectively declaring \n     that partial-birth abortions cannot be banned; and\n       Whereas, this intrusion of the Federal courts in these \n     states decisions concerning this medical procedure can be \n     remedied only by federal congressional action to limit the \n     jurisdiction of these federal courts; and\n       Whereas, the United States Constitution does not create or \n     regulate these inferior federal courts, but instead \n     explicitly gives congress the power to do so; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Constitution makes the jurisdiction of \n     the federal courts subject to congressional proscription \n     through Article III, Section 2, Para. 2, by declaring that \n     federal courts ``shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to \n     law and fact with such exceptions and under such regulations \n     as congress shall make''; and\n       Whereas, the intent of the framers of our documents was \n     clear on this power of congress, such as when Samuel Chase (a \n     signer of the Declaration of Independence and a U.S. Supreme \n     Court Justice appointed by President George Washington) \n     declared, ``The notion has frequently been entertained that \n     the federal courts derive their judicial power immediately \n     from the constitution; but the political truth is that the \n     disposal of the judicial power (except in a few specified \n     instances) belongs to Congress. If Congress has given the \n     power to this court, we possess it, not otherwise''; and\n       Whereas, Justice Joseph Story, in his authoritative \n     Commentaries on the Constitution, similarly declares, ``In \n     all cases where the judicial power of the United States is to \n     be exercised, it is for Congress along to furnish the rules \n     of proceeding, to direct the process, to declare the nature \n     and effect of the process, and the mode, in which the \n     judgment, consequent thereon, shall be executed . . . And if \n     Congress may confer power, they may repeal it . . . [The \n     power of Congress [is] complete to make exceptions'']; and\n       Whereas, this position is confirmed not only by the signers \n     of the Constitution themselves, such as George Washington and \n     James Madison, but also by other leading constitutional \n     experts and jurists of the day, including Chief Justice John \n     Rutledge, Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth, Chief Justice John \n     Marshall, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Yates, George Mason, and \n     John Randolph; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has long \n     recognized and affirmed this power of congress to limit the \n     appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, as in 1847 when \n     the court declared that the ``court possesses no appellate \n     power in any case unless conferred upon it by act of \n     Congress'' and in 1865 when it declared ``it is for Congress \n     to determine how far . . . appellate jurisdiction shall be \n     given; and when conferred, it can be exercised only to the \n     extent and in the manner prescribed by law''; and\n       Whereas, congress has on numerous occasions exercised this \n     power to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts, and the \n     Supreme Court has consistently upheld this power of congress \n     in rulings over the last two centuries, including cases in \n     1847, 1866, 1868, 1876, 1878, 1882, 1893, 1898, 1901, 1904, \n     1906, 1908, 1910, 1922, 1948, 1966, 1973, 1977, etc; and\n       Whereas, it is congress alone which can remedy this current \n     crisis and return to the states the power to make their own \n     decisions on partial-birth abortions by excepting this issue \n     from the appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n       Therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of \n     Louisiana respectfully appeals to the Congress of these \n     United States to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the \n     federal courts regarding the specific medical practice of \n     partial-birth abortions.\n       Be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     sent to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and the Chief Clerical Officers of the United States House of \n     Representatives and the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-288. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Alaska relative to the division of the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 25\n\n       Be it resolved by the legislature of the State of Alaska:\n       Whereas the State of Alaska is within the jurisdiction of \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; and\n       Whereas the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit consists \n     of the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, \n     Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, and Guam, and the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands; and\n       Whereas United States Senators Murkowski of Alaska and \n     Gorton of Washington have introduced S. 253, a bill that \n     would amend Title 28 of the United States Code to divide the \n     Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit into three regional \n     divisions and a fourth circuit division, and that has the \n     short title of the ``Federal Ninth Circuit Reorganization Act \n     of 1999''; and\n       Whereas S. 253 proposes to place the states of Alaska, \n     Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington within one regional \n     division of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and to \n     place the other states and territories, possessions, and \n     protectorates into two other regional divisions; and\n       Whereas S. 253 proposes to adopt the recommendations of a \n     Congressionally mandated commission, chaired by retired \n     Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White, that studied the \n     realignment of the federal courts of appeal; the \n     recommendations were made in a report issued in December \n     1998; and\n       Whereas the membership of the Court of Appeals for the \n     Ninth Circuit is heavily weighted toward the State of \n     California and the court seems to concern itself \n     predominately with issues arising out of California and the \n     Southwestern United States; and\n       Whereas the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's case \n     filings are consistently either greater than any other \n     federal circuit or among the greatest; and\n       Whereas the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is the \n     largest of the 13 circuit courts of appeal, spanning \n     1,400,000 square miles, and is larger than the First, Second, \n     Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits \n     combined; and\n       Whereas the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit serves a \n     population of more than 49,000,000 people, almost 60 percent \n     more than any other federal circuit; and\n       Whereas members of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit have shown a surprising lack of understanding of \n     Alaska's people and geography; and\n       Whereas, in the so-called ``Katie John'' subsistence case, \n     which is of tremendous importance to the people of the State \n     of Alaska, even though the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit granted expedited consideration of that case, the \n     court did not issue its decision for over 13 months; and\n       Whereas the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \n     consistently ranks at or near the bottom of the circuits in \n     time from the filing of a case in the district court to final \n     disposition in the court appeals; and\n       Whereas Attorney General Bruce Botelho has estimated that \n     there are more than 200 Alaska cases currently pending before \n     the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; and\n       Whereas, previously, the Attorneys General of the States of \n     Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington have also found that \n     similar issues of unnecessary delay concerning, lack of \n     understanding of, and lack of consideration for cases and \n     issues by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit exist in \n     regard to those states; and\n       Whereas the division of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit into regions would benefit the States of Alaska, \n     Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington by providing speedier \n     and more consistent rulings\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\n     by jurists who have a greater familiarity with the social, \n     geographical, political, and economic life of the region, \n     especially if those jurists were required to be residents of \n     that region;\n       Be it, Resolved That the Alaska State Legislature strongly \n     supports S. 253 and the division of the Court of Appeals for \n     the Ninth Circuit into three regional divisions with one \n     region consisting of the States of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, \n     Oregon, and Washington headquartered in the Pacific \n     Northwest; and be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     questions the need for a fourth circuit division and urges \n     the sponsors of S. 253 and the United States Congress to \n     inquire into the need for a fourth circuit division; and be \n     it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges \n     the sponsors of S. 253 to consider including a requirement \n     that judges assigned to one of the three regional divisions \n     must reside in that regional division and urges the United \n     States Congress to amend S. 253 to address this concern; and \n     be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     believes that a reorganization of the Court of Appeals for \n     the Ninth Circuit is long overdue and urges the United States \n     Congress to expeditiously consider and enact S. 253.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable Al \n     Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and President \n     of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Strom Thurmond, President \n     Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable J.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Alaska relative to the year 2000 census; to the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 22\n\n       Be it resolved by the legislature of the State of Alaska:\n       Whereas the Constitution of the United States requires an \n     enumeration of the population every 10 years and entrusts the \n     Congress with overseeing each decennial enumeration; and\n       Whereas the sole constitutional purpose of the decennial \n     census is to apportion the seats in the United States House \n     of Representatives among the several states; and\n       Whereas an accurate and legal decennial census is necessary \n     to properly apportion the seats in the United States House of \n     Representatives among the states and to create legislative \n     districts within the states; and\n       Whereas 13 U.S.C. 141(c) mandates that the Bureau of the \n     Census provide each state with basic tabulations of \n     population (P.L. 94-171 data) within one year after the \n     decennial census date; and\n       Whereas the Alaska State Legislature believes that Article \n     I, Section 2, Constitution of the United States, in order to \n     ensure an accurate count and to minimize the potential for \n     political manipulation, mandates an ``actual enumeration,'' \n     meaning a physical headcount of the population, and prohibits \n     reliance on estimates of the population for purposes of \n     apportioning seats in the United States House of \n     Representatives among the several states; and\n       Whereas legislative redistricting conducted by the states \n     is a critical subfunction of the constitutional requirement \n     to apportion representatives among the states; and\n       Whereas the United States Supreme Court, in Department of \n     Commerce v. United States House, slip. op. no. 98-404, 1999 \n     WL 24616, 67 U.S.L.W. 4090, ruled on January 25, 1999, that \n     13 U.S.C. 195 prohibits the proposed use by the Bureau of \n     Census of statistical sampling in the determination of \n     population for purposes of apportioning seats in the United \n     States House of Representatives among the several state; and\n       Whereas the appellees in Department of Commerce v. United \n     States House established standing partly on the basis of a \n     claim of expected intrastate vote dilution due to the \n     proposed use by the Bureau of the Census of statistical \n     sampling; and\n       Whereas the use of census data adjusted by means of \n     sampling or other statistical methodologies in redistricting \n     by the State of Alaska could raise serious issues of vote \n     dilution and violate ``one-person, one-vote'' legal \n     protections, expose the state to protracted and costly \n     litigation over redistricting, and ultimately result in a \n     court ruling invalidating the redistricting plan; and\n       Whereas the Alaska State Legislature believes that a \n     person, once enumerated, should not be counted by sampling or \n     other statistical methodologies for purposes of \n     redistricting; and\n       Whereas every reasonable and practical effort should be \n     made to obtain the fullest and most accurate count of the \n     population possible, including appropriate funding for state \n     and local census outreach and education programs and post-\n     census local review;\n       Be it Resolved That the Alaska State Legislature calls on \n     the Bureau of the Census to conduct the 2000 decennial census \n     consistent with the ruling in Department of Commerce v. \n     United States House and with the Constitution of the United \n     States; and be it\n       Further Resolved That the Alaska State Legislature calls on \n     the Bureau of the Census to conduct a physical headcount of \n     the population and not to use random sampling techniques or \n     other statistical methodologies that add persons to or \n     subtract persons from the census count in developing \n     redistricting data under P.L. 94-171 for use by the states in \n     intrastate redistricting; and be it\n       Further Resolved That the Alaska State Legislature opposes \n     the use of P.L. 94-171 data for state legislative \n     redistricting based on census numbers that have been \n     determined in whole or in part by the use of statistical \n     inferences derived by means of random sampling techniques or \n     other statistical methodologies that add or subtract persons; \n     and be it\n       Further Resolved That the Alaska State Legislature requests \n     that Alaska be given P.L. 94-171 data for legislative \n     redistricting identical to the census tabulation date used to \n     apportion seats in the United States House of \n     Representatives, derived from a physical headcount of the \n     population, and not adjusted using random sampling techniques \n     or other statistical methodologies that add persons to or \n     subtract persons from the census count; and be it\n       Further Resolved That the Alaska State Legislature urges \n     the Congress, as the branch of government assigned the \n     responsibility of overseeing the decennial enumeration of the \n     population, to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure \n     that the 2000 decennial census is conducted fairly and \n     legally.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Bill Clinton, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Al Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and \n     President of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable William M.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act of \nassure access of Medicare beneficiaries to prescription drug coverage \nthrough the SPICE drug benefit program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   seniors prescription insurance coverage equity (spice) act of 1999\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Seniors \nPrescription Insurance Coverage Equity (SPICE) Act along with my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden. The purpose of this bill is to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with access to prescription drug \ncoverage. The program is voluntary and federal assistance will be \nprovided to help pay for the premiums. Senator Wyden and I believe that \nthis bill is one solution to the lack of prescription drug coverage for \nAmerica's seniors and we believe that it is a bill we could and should \nenact this year.\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\n  Lack of prescription drug coverage is a serious problem facing our \nseniors. When Medicare was created in 1965 it was based on the \ninpatient care system that was prevalent at that time. Today, thirty \nfour years later, drug therapy often allows individuals to stay out of \nthe hospital--but Medicare does not cover drugs. And the lack of \ncoverage means that those over 65 years of age end up paying for half \nthe costs associated with their prescriptions, while the average person \nunder age 65 pays only a third. It also means that seniors are forgoing \nmedication because they cannot afford it.\n  The SPICE Act creates a voluntary supplemental drug insurance policy \nthat all Medicare eligible individuals can purchase. These policies \nwill be guaranteed issue--no one can be turned down. SPICE eligibility \nwill begin when Medicare eligibility begins. There will be a penalty \nfor late entry, just as there is for those who make a late entry into \nthe Medicare Part B program. The penalty fee for late entry will be \nwaived if the late entry is based on the loss of prior drug coverage \nfrom a Medicare + Choice plan or a retiree group health plan.\n  All seniors will receive some premium support assistance on a sliding \nscale based on income. Every senior will receive at least 25% premium \nsupport. Those below 150% of the federal poverty line will receive 100% \npremium support. A sliding scale will phase down the premium support \nfrom 100% to 25% for those between 150% and 175% of the federal poverty \nline.\n  The federal premium support will be used to allow seniors to purchase \nSPICE policies from private providers, similar to the Medigap program. \nThe policies will all meet a threshold standard developed by the SPICE \nBoard, which includes consumers, state insurance commissioners, and \ninsurance representatives, and will be designed with seniors needs in \nmind. Medicare+Choice and group health plans which provide drug \ncoverage for Medicare eligible individuals will be able to receive the \nactuarial value of the drug benefit if their plans meet or exceed the \nSPICE Board threshold benefit plan.\n  Seniors will be given a choice of plans. This will ensure competition \nand help keep the costs down and will allow seniors to choose the plan \nthat best meets their needs. To provide an idea of the types of \nchoices, plans may offer coverage for different drugs (formularies), \ncopays, deductibles, and caps. The SPICE Board will disseminate \ninformation about these choices, much like the Federal Employee Benefit \nHealth Program (FEHBP) does.\n  Funding sources for the benefit will come from the on-budget surplus, \nwhich the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates show to be $505 \nbillion after the $792 billion tax cut legislation that is currently in \nconference. Additional funding may come from implementing the \nPresident's FY2000 budget proposal to raise the tobacco tax by 55 cents \nper pack in addition to enacting the 15 cent tobacco increase already \nin law one year earlier than originally planned.\n  America's seniors need help in obtaining prescription drug coverage. \nSPICE is a doable proposal that can be passed whether or not we are \nable to move forward on Medicare reform this year.\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Snowe and I are \nintroducing legislation to provide seniors with insurance coverage for \nprescription drugs. This legislation, the Seniors Prescription \nInsurance Coverage Equity Act, SPICE, is the only bipartisan, market-\nbased approach to provide seniors with choice and access to coverage \nthat is actually paid for. It will give seniors the same kind of \ncoverage that their member of Congress has.\n  The key issue for seniors around our nation, when it comes to the \nissue of prescription drugs, is affordability. Our proposal will assure \nthat each and every senior who voluntarily chooses to enroll in a SPICE \nplan will have the bargaining power of HMOs and of the large insurers \nwhose job it is to get the best price they can. At least 13 million \nseniors have no prescription drug coverage at all. Those seniors get \npenalized twice: they have to pay all their costs, and they pay more \nbecause they can't get the negotiated rate that the insurers and HMOs \ncan. This bill will level the playing field for those seniors giving \nthem affordability and access.\n  We know the kinds of drugs that are coming on the market now can help \nsave lives, better the health status of an older person and, in many \ninstances, save dollars because seniors taking their prescription drugs \nas they are told to by their doctor will prevent costly \nhospitalizations and the progression of disease. If we were to create \nMedicare today from scratch, there would be no questions about \nincluding prescription drug coverage. If we want to assure that \nMedicare beneficiaries stay healthy longer we must provide prescription \ndrug coverage. If we want to be thoughtful, prudent purchasers of \nhealth care, we must find a way to assure seniors access to the drugs.\n  I believe the Snowe-Wyden proposal is that thoughtful, prudent and \nreasonable way. It assures a variety of options for coverage, and it \nassures that we bring real dollars to the table to pay for the program. \nThere is no smoke and mirrors, no IOUs or other budget gimmicks in this \nplan.\n  The Snowe-Wyden proposal will be funded by funding from the non-\nSocial Security on-budget surplus and a 55-cent increase in the tobacco \ntax. During this body's deliberations of the budget resolution, an \namendment that Sen. Snowe and I offered received 54 votes, including 12 \nRepublican votes to do just this--fund a prescription drug benefit for \nseniors with an increase in the tobacco tax.\n  The SPICE legislation creates a senior-oriented program using the \nFederal Employees Benefit Program (FEHBP) as a model to provide \nbenefits that include prescription drugs and other non-Medicare covered \nbenefits. This benefit would be open to every beneficiary and be \nvoluntary. However, if the senior elected coverage later rather when \nthey were first eligible, the individual would pay incrementally more \nthe longer he or she waited to choose a comprehensive coverage option.\n  The individual senior would be able to select from an array of drug \npolicies and Medicare+Choice plans with prescription drugs coverage. \nThis would be voluntary. No senior would have to change what their \ncurrent coverage is if they do not choose to do so. All plans would be \noffered by private sector companies. For beneficiaries under 150 \npercent of the poverty level--$12,075 for a single senior and $16,275 \nfor a couple, the federal government would pay the entire premium. For \nthose between 150 percent and 175 percent of the federal poverty level, \nthe amount the federal government would pay phases down from 100 \npercent of premium to 25 percent of the premium amount. For \nbeneficiaries at 175 percent of poverty and over, the federal \ngovernment would pay 25 percent of the premium amount.\n  Our SPICE benefit will be administered by a new Board that would be \nseparate from the Health Care Financing Administration but report to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Board would approve \nplan designs and premium submissions, approve and distribute consumer \neducation materials, develop enrollment procedures and make \nrecommendations concerning additional funding, further ability to pay \nmechanisms and other steps needed to assure continuing availability of \ncomprehensive coverage as seniors' health needs change over time.\n  Many of us would prefer to do an overhaul of Medicare and modernize \nit to include benefits like prescription drugs. However, the thirteen \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries who need coverage and the millions who \nhave coverage that does not truly help them, need a way to get \nmeaningful coverage today. This proposal will do that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, \n        and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1482. A bill to amend the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n         THE NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nMarine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator \nKerry, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, \nSenator McCain, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, \nRanking\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\nMember of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Breaux are joining me as \ncosponsors on this legislation. This bill will protect our nation's \nvaluable marine resources while facilitating their sustainable use.\n  One hundred years after the first national park was created, the \nUnited States made a similar commitment to preserving its valuable \nmarine resources by establishing the National Marine Sanctuary Program \nin 1972. Since then, twelve areas covering a wide range of marine \nhabitats have been designated as national marine sanctuaries. Half of \nthese designations have occurred in the last decade.\n  Today, our marine sanctuaries encompass everything from kelp forests \nand marine mammal nursery grounds, to underwater archeological sites. \nTogether these sanctuaries protect nearly 18,000 square miles of ocean \nwaters, an area nearly the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined.\n  Acting as a platform for better ocean stewardship, these sanctuaries \noffer an opportunity for research, outreach, and educational \nactivities. The national sanctuaries are also a model for multiple use \nmanagement in the marine environment.\n  Obviously, balancing the protection of public resources with \nfostering economic activities requires the cooperative efforts of the \nfederal, state, and local governments, as well as nongovernmental \norganizations and the public. There are many of these partnerships \nworking together within the national marine sanctuary program. Most of \nthe successes of the program can be attributed to these partnerships.\n  One of these sanctuaries is located in the Gulf of Maine. The \nStellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary provides feeding and nursery \ngrounds for more than a dozen types of whales, including the endangered \nhumpback, northern right, sei, and fin whales. This has led to the \ndevelopment of a thriving whale watching tourist trade in the \nsanctuary. The area also supports diverse seabird species and other \nfish and shellfish such as bluefin tuna, herring, cod, flounder, \nlobster, and scallops. Consequently, important commercial fisheries for \nlobster, bluefin tuna, cod and others exist in and around the \nsanctuary.\n  Historic data strongly suggest the presence of several shipwreck \nsites within the sanctuary, including the recently discovered wreck of \nthe steamship Portland which sunk in 1898. Seven historic shipwrecks \nhave been identified within or adjacent to the boundaries. However, a \ncomplete inventory of historical resources has not been conducted. \nThese traditional shipping lanes are still active today. A heavily-used \nvessel traffic separation lane in the sanctuary facilitates the passage \nof more than 2,700 commercial vessels in and out of regional ports each \nyear.\n  Through careful management and cooperation, all of these diverse uses \nco-exist in a marine sanctuary while providing protection to the marine \nresources. This is just one example of the diverse management \nstrategies being utilized by the national program.\n  The goal of the national marine sanctuary program is quite ambitious. \nUnfortunately, lack of funding has hampered their success. To date, \ninsufficient funds have been provided to keep up with the pace of \nexpansion of the sanctuary system. As a result, the 12 existing \nsanctuaries are not fully operational. Nationwide, individual \nsanctuaries are understaffed; unable to fully implement their \nmanagement plans; unable to review existing management plans every five \nyears as required by law; and lack educational and outreach materials \nand facilities. Consequently, management plans that were written twenty \nyears ago have not been updated to adapt to the changing needs of the \narea nor for advances in science and resource management.\n  Congress identified the need for these sanctuaries when we passed the \noriginal Act in 1972. It is time now to provide the funds necessary to \nachieve what we set out to do. This will require an increase in the \nauthorization level. The bill we are introducing today provides $30 \nmillion in FY 2000 and increases the annual authorization level by $2 \nmillion a year to $38 million in FY 2004.\n  It is time to move beyond fundamental planning and reach full \nimplementation of the national program. This bill focuses the sanctuary \nprogram on making the existing sanctuaries fully operational before the \nformal designation process can begin for additional sanctuaries. It is \nour intention that management plans be developed in an open and \nparticipatory process so that partnerships between resource protection \nand compatible uses are given every chance to succeed. Further, \nmanagement plans must be reviewed and updated in a timely manner so \nthat we can prioritize our objectives and respond to the changing needs \nof the resources and the people who utilize them.\n  A large part of the implementation process is the development of \nenforcement capabilities. It is one thing to plan resource protection, \nit is another thing to actually provide it. At the Subcommittee on \nOceans and Fisheries hearing on reauthorization of the National Marine \nSanctuaries Act, it was disappointing to hear about the overwhelming \nlack of enforcement in our marine sanctuaries. This bill encourages the \ndevelopment and implementation of meaningful enforcement plans, \nincluding partnerships with the states and other authorized entities. \nThis will now become a part of the management plan review process. \nFurther, the Administration will need to demonstrate that effective \nenforcement plans exist for the current sanctuaries before beginning \nthe formal designation process for additional sanctuaries.\n  The National Marine Sanctuaries Act expires at the end of Fiscal Year \n1999. This bill gives us the opportunity to realize the goals first \nlaid out by Congress in 1972. There can be no doubt that this \nrevitalization of the sanctuary program is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, this is a strong and much-needed bill that enjoys \nbipartisan support on the Commerce Committee. I look forward to moving \nthis bill at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1482\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal Year 1998 with respect to export controls on high performance \ncomputers; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n    ADJUSTMENT OF COMPOSITE THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE LEVELS OF HIGH \n                         PERFORMANCE COMPUTERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on July 1, 1999, President Clinton announced \nthat the Commerce Department would implement changes to the United \nStates export controls on high performance computers. By changing the \nlimits on high performance computers, we will be increasing our \nnational security and easing outdated regulations that are currently \nimposed on the thriving high tech industry and on government itself.\n  Mr. President, as you may know, I have followed this issue closely \nfor the last eight months since the inception of the high-tech working \ngroup that I chair. I have met with many company leaders, both large \nand small, to discuss the issue of export controls on computers. I am \nconvinced that if we don't immediately act to ease export controls, \nmany American jobs may be at risk. Each day that our nations's \ncompanies can't compete in foreign markets, we are losing market share \nand eventually will be giving up our world dominance in the high-tech \nsector.\n  The bill that I am offering today reduces the review period from 180 \ndays to 30 days to complement the Administration's easing of export \nrestrictions by amending the National Defense Authorization Act of \n1998.\n  Mr. President. In closing, I would like to share with you an example \nof how outdated today's restrictions are. I was recently at a meeting \nwhere Michael Dell, President of Dell Computers, stood up and pulled \nhis pager from his hip holster. He held it up and said that under \ncurrent export controls, his little pager that is smaller than a \ncomputer mouse, cannot be exported to many countries because it is \nconsidered a ``super computer.''\n  Mr. President. These controls need to be changed as the \nAdministration has made clear, but it needs to be done sooner rather \nthan later. In short, these controls need to be eased yesterday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF COMPOSITE THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE \n                   LEVELS OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTERS.\n\n       Section 1211(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1998 (50 U.S.C. App. 2404 note) is amended in \n     the second sentence by striking ``180'' and inserting ``30''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1484. A bill entitled ``Random Selection of Judges Act of 1999''; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 Random Selection of Judges Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly on the \nintroduction of legislation for the random selection of judges. I had \nthought when cases were assigned in the Federal courts they were \nassigned in a random fashion, unless they were related to some other \ncase where a specific judge had jurisdiction and that judge would have \nthe case by a related case assignment.\n  During the course of the past week there has come to light a \nsituation in the District of Columbia where the chief judge assigned \nspecific judges to two very high-profile cases, one involving Mr. \nWebster Hubbell as a defendant and the other involving Mr. Charlie Trie \nas a defendant.\n  My understanding of the practice has been that cases would be \nassigned on a random basis. In checking the specifics, I have found \nthat the Judicial Conference, which is the policy-making body for the \nFederal Judiciary, only recommends that Federal courts randomly assign \ncases. It has not become a mandate to do so. I believe that public \npolicy warrants having it as a mandate.\n  It is customary for the Congress to legislate on matters of \nadministration. For example, Congress has set a time limit under the \nspeedy trial rule in the criminal courts. For another example, Congress \nhas established time limits on Federal court habeas corpus cases where \ndeath penalty cases are appealed into the Federal courts.\n  This is not a matter where we are talking about the discretion or \njudgment of an individual judge on how to decide a case, where judicial \nindependence mandates that nobody make any suggestion to the judge as \nto how an individual case is to be decided. But as a matter of \nadministrative policy it is entirely appropriate for the Congress to \nset the rules, one of which I think should be the random assignment of \njudges.\n  In March of this year the Judicial Conference even rescinded its 28-\nyear-old policy that recommended giving the chief judges, the assigning \njudge, latitude to make special assignments of ``protracted, difficult, \nor wildly publicized cases,'' so such latitude is no longer recommended \nby the Judicial Conference.\n  The chief judge of the District of Columbia has responded to the \nAssociated Press article in a letter to the Washington Times dated \nAugust 2. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy \nof the newspaper article from the Washington Times, together with a \ncopy of the response by the chief judge to the newspaper article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Judges Fret Over Assigning of Cases\n\n\nFellow jurists are concerned that trials of Clinton friends went to his \n                               appointees\n\n                             (By Pete Yost)\n\n       The chief judge of the U.S. District Court bypassed the \n     traditional random assignment system to send criminal cases \n     against presidential friends Webster Hubbell and Charlie Trie \n     to judges President Clinton appointed, court officials said.\n       U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson's decision to \n     abandon the longtime random computer assignment for high-\n     profile cases has raised concerns among several other judges, \n     the officials said in interviews.\n       The judges also raised concerns about an appearance of \n     possible conflicts of interest, because judges assigned the \n     cases were friendly with key players--presidential confidant \n     Vernon Jordan and defense lawyer Reid Weingarten--and made \n     rulings that handicapped prosecutors.\n       Half a dozen judges, Republicans and Democrats, said they \n     have high regard for the ethics they have high regard for the \n     ethics and work of the two judges involved, Paul L. Friedman \n     and James Robertson, and do not believe they were improperly \n     influenced.\n       But the judges, who spoke on condition for anonymity, said \n     they have discussed among themselves the public perception of \n     ignoring the random draw--used in almost all cases--and \n     passing over more experienced judges appointed by presidents \n     of both parties.\n       One judge said his colleagues have discussed whether \n     assigning cases directly rather than using the random lottery \n     raises ``an appearance problem at least'' and ``whether there \n     has been impartial administration of justice.''\n       The airing of the behind-the-scenes controversy provides a \n     rare window into a court process sealed from public view.\n       Judges Johnson, Friedman and Robertson all declined \n     repeated requests for interviews.\n       Judge Johnson, an appointee of President Carter, assigned:\n       Judge Friedman to the Trie case, the first major \n     prosecution from the Justice Department probe of Democratic \n     fund raising. Mr. Clinton nominated Judge Friedman, a former \n     president of the local bar, in 1994.\n\n[[Page S10227]]\n\n       Judge Robertson was handed the Hubbell tax case, \n     independent counsel Kenneth Starr's first prosecution in \n     Washington. Judge Robertson is an ex-president of the local \n     bar and a former partner at the law firm of former White \n     House counsel Lloyd Cutler.\n       Mr. Clinton nominated him in the last days of Mr. Cutler's \n     tenure as counsel in 1994. Judge Robertson had donated $1,000 \n     to Mr. Clinton's 1992 presidential bid and has said he \n     ``worked on the periphery'' of that campaign.\n       Judge Robertson on two occasions dismissed felony charges \n     against Hubbell. He dismissed the tax case against Hubbell, \n     who eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor when an \n     appeals court reinstated the case.\n       Judge Johnson allowed a later indictment--charging Hubbell \n     with lying to federal regulators--be assigned at random by \n     computer. By coincidence, the computer picked Judge \n     Robertson, who threw out the central felony count in the \n     case. Judge Robertson, who threw out the central felony count \n     in the case. Hubbell pleaded guilty to that same felony count \n     June 30, after an appeals court reversed Judge Robertson.\n       One politically sensitive aspect of the Hubbell tax evasion \n     indictment was a reference to a $62,500 consulting \n     arrangement that Mr. Jordan helped obtain for Hubbell, making \n     Mr. Jordan a potential witness.\n       Judge Robertson and Mr. Jordan are friends from their days \n     in the civil rights movement. Mr. Jordan did not return \n     repeated calls seeking comment.\n       [Judge Robertson, who was highly critical of Mr. Starr's \n     tactics in the Hubbell case, also dealt major setbacks to \n     Donald Smaltz, the independent counsel who investigated \n     former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.\n       [In one instance, the judge granted a new trial to a Tyson \n     Foods Inc. executive, Jack L. Williams, who had been \n     convicted on two counts of making false statements to federal \n     investigators.\n       [Last September, Judge Robertson overturned the conviction \n     of Tyson lobbyist Archie Schaeffer III for giving illegal \n     gifts to Mr. Espy. A federal appeals court reinstated that \n     conviction July 23.]\n       Judge Johnson assigned the Trie case and two subsequent \n     cases against Democratic fund-raisers to Judge Friedman, who \n     tossed out various charges.\n       After one of Judge Friedman's rulings was overturned on \n     appeal, Trie agreed to plead guilty.\n       Judge Friedman and Mr. Weingarten, the defense lawyer in \n     two of three fund-raising cases before Judge Friedman, are \n     longtime friends.\n       ``He's a professional friend, but he's a judge now,'' Mr. \n     Weingarten said. ``These relationships change when somebody \n     goes to the bench.''\n       When Judge Johnson bypassed the random draw for these \n     cases, 12 full-time judges were on the federal court, seven \n     of them Clinton appointees. Four were Republican appointees. \n     The court also has a number of senior judges who work part-\n     time.\n       Judge Johnson garnered headlines for her rulings against \n     Mr. Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, rejecting \n     privilege claims by the president and ordering White House \n     lawyer Bruce Lindsey and Secret Service personnel to testify.\n       Experts said the assignments to Clinton-nominated judges \n     did not violate any rules but could shake public confidence.\n       ``As far as assigning a recently appointed judge of the \n     same party, it's dangerous, it's risky, it's hazardous \n     because the outcome might support the cynical view that the \n     judge did not decide the matter on the merits even though \n     that may be the furthest thing from the truth,'' Columbia \n     University law professor H. Richard Uviller said.\n       New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said, \n     ``If the case is high-profile, that should increase the \n     presumption in favor of random selection.''\n       The assignments were confirmed to AP by several court \n     officials with access to parts of the court computer system \n     not available to the public.\n       Local court rules give Judge Johnson the right to assign \n     ``protracted'' cases to specific judges, although nearly all \n     the cases in U.S. District Court here are assigned by \n     lottery, court officials said.\n       The Judicial Conference, the policy-making body for the \n     federal judiciary, recommends that federal courts randomly \n     assign cases. In March, the conference rescinded its 28-year-\n     old policy that recommended giving chief judges latitude to \n     make special assignments of ``protracted, difficult or widely \n     publicized cases.''\n       Actual practice varies from court to court.\n       In the Southern District of New York, which has more than \n     two dozen full-time judges, Court Executive Clifford P. \n     Kirsch said, ``It's all been by a blind draw . . . so it \n     doesn't appear anyone is preselecting or favoring one judge \n     over another judge.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                           U.S. District Court for\n\n\n                                     the District of Columbia,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1999.\n     Editor,\n     The Washington Times,\n     Washington, DC.\n       As I firmly believe that justice is best served in the \n     courts of law and not on the front page of a newspaper, it \n     has long been my policy not to discuss my judicial decision-\n     making with members of the press. However, I feel compelled \n     to make an exception to that policy in order to correct the \n     disturbing misimpression left by a recent story circulated by \n     the Associated Press and published in your paper as well as \n     several other news outlets. [This A.P. article alleges that I \n     ``bypassed the traditional random assignment system'' to \n     assign certain criminal cases to judges appointed by \n     President Clinton, singling out the criminal case against Yah \n     Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, which was assigned to Judge Paul L. \n     Friedman, and the criminal case against Webster Hubbell, \n     which was assigned to Judge James Robertson. The article \n     implies that these cases were assigned to these judges based \n     on political motivations. This unsubstantiated assertion \n     could not be further from the truth.] Moreover, it does a \n     significant disservice to the perception of impartial justice \n     that I believe all of the judges on our Court strive mightily \n     to maintain. Contrary to the false perception left by the \n     A.P. story, these cases were assigned to highly capable \n     federal judges. Politics was not and is never a factor in our \n     case assignments.\n       In order to set the record straight, the circumstances \n     leading to these routine ``special assignments'' are quite \n     simple. For years, Local Rule 403(g) of the Rules of the \n     District Court for the District of Columbia has authorized \n     the Chief Judge to specially assign protracted or complex \n     criminal cases to consenting judges when circumstances \n     warrant. My predecessors and I have used this assignment \n     system to enable our Court to expeditiously handle high \n     profile criminal cases with their unique demands on judicial \n     resources. For example, criminal cases arising from Watergate \n     and the Iran-Contra affair were handled through special \n     assignment. In both those instances of overwhelming media \n     scrutiny and complexity, the special assignment system well \n     served our needs. In addition to these highly publicized \n     criminal cases, special assignment has also been a valuable \n     tool in addressing multiple defendant narcotics conspiracy \n     cases. It is the responsibility of the Chief Judge to move \n     the docket as expeditiously as possible. That is all that was \n     intended by these assignments.\n       Finally, I must note that the A.P. article irresponsibly \n     impugns the reputation of two fine federal judges by \n     suggesting conflicts of interest in their handling of these \n     cases. Neither judge had any obligation to recuse himself \n     from the cases to which he was assigned, for neither faced a \n     conflict of any sort. A judge's prior affiliations and \n     acquaintances, alone, do not require recusal or \n     disqualification. Indeed, many judges on this Court know many \n     lawyers and public officials in Washington. If recusal were \n     required on the basis of these innocuous connections, it \n     would wreak havoc on case scheduling.\n       In the future, I suggest that before your newspaper prints \n     a story that impugns the integrity of two outstanding members \n     of the federal judiciary, you offer more evidence of an \n     actual conflict than the slender reed of innuendo which \n     supports these current allegations. Such an unsubstantiated \n     and unsupportable attack does your publication little credit \n     and the truth much harm.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Norma Holloway Johnson,\n                                                      Chief Judge.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. In the reply, the chief judge says this:\n\n       This A.P. article alleges that I ``bypassed the traditional \n     random assignment system'' to assign certain criminal cases \n     to judges appointed by President Clinton, singling out the \n     criminal case against Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, which was \n     assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman, and the criminal case \n     against Webster Hubbell, which was assigned to Judge James \n     Robertson. The article implies that these cases were assigned \n     to these judges based on political motivations. The \n     unsubstantiated assertion could not be further from the \n     truth.\n\n  Now, I do not question the statements made by the chief judge in \ndenying any portion of partiality or impropriety, but I do believe that \nwhen this case is called to widespread public attention the Congress \nought to act. That is why I am introducing this legislation today on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The reasons for this legislation are articulated by Columbia \nUniversity law professor H. Richard Uviller, who said:\n\n       As far as assigning a recently appointed judge of the same \n     party, it's dangerous, it's risky, it's hazardous because the \n     outcome might support the cynical view that the judge did not \n     decide the matter on the merits even though that may be the \n     furthest thing from the truth.\n\n  A similar statement was made by New York University law professor \nSteven Gillers, who said:\n\n       If the case is high-profile, that should increase the \n     presumption in favor of random selection.\n\n  This issue of random selection is one that I feel particularly \nstrongly about based on my experience as district attorney in the \nPhiladelphia criminal courts. When high-profile or politically-tinged \ncases were filed in the criminal courts of Philadelphia during my \ntenure as district attorney, I routinely asked for a jury trial because \nI\n\n[[Page S10228]]\n\nwanted the facts decided by an impartial fact finder. At the outset of \nthat tenure in January of 1966, the Commonwealth was a party to the \nproceeding and, like the defendant, had a right to demand a jury trial. \nI did demand jury trials because I found that the assignment to \nspecific judges was not random and did on some occasions have \ninappropriate motivations.\n  During the course of my tenure as district attorney, the State \nsupreme court made a change in the criminal rules and took away the \nright of the district attorney to demand a jury trial. That was \nrecently reinstated by a constitutional amendment so that the \nexperience I have seen requires a very heavy emphasis on the random \nselection.\n  During my tenure as district attorney, we reformed the entire minor \njudiciary of Philadelphia known as magistrates because of widespread \ncorruption and inappropriate practices in that judicial system. While \nthis in no way reflects upon the Federal courts of the United States, \nwhich I think are of uniformly high quality, I do believe that the \nprinciple of random selection of judges is a very important principle. \nI do believe there ought to be an exception if there is a related case; \nthat is, where a judge was assigned a case on a random basis and \nanother matter comes in where there are very similar, if not identical, \nquestions of fact and questions of the parties. But this legislation \nremoves at least the appearance and the question that there may be some \ncollateral motivation.\n  To reiterate, I seek recognition today to introduce the Random \nSelection of Judges Act of 1999, a bill which will require that cases \nin Federal court be assigned to judges randomly, by means of a computer \nprogram. I believe that only the random assignment of cases to judges \nwill ensure blind justice in our courts.\n  This power to assign cases creates the potential for abuse. An \nassigning judge who is so inclined could attempt to alter the outcome \nof a case by assigning it to a judge who, in the opinion of the chief \njudge, holds a ``correct'' view on the issue at hand.\n  A story recently in the news clearly demonstrates the potential for \nabuse under the current system. Over the weekend, the Associated Press \nreported that Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, Chief Judge of the District \nCourt for the District of Columbia, bypassed the traditional random \ncomputer assignment system in her court and instead directly assigned \ncriminal cases against certain presidential friends to judges appointed \nby President Clinton. Specifically, the campaign finance case against \nCharlie Trie was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman, and the tax cases \nagainst Webster Hubbell were assigned to Judge James Robertson. \nAccording to the news reports, Judge Johnson's decision to abandon \nrandom assignment in these high profile cases raised concerns among \nseveral other judges on her court. It was also reported that these \njudges raised concerns because Judge Robertson is friends with Vernon \nJordan, who played a role in the Hubbell affair, and Judge Friedman is \nfriends with Reid Weingarten, who represents the defendants in two \nfundraising cases before Friedman.\n  According to the Associated Press article, it has been asserted by \nsome that Judge Johnson assigned these cases to Clinton appointees \nbecause they would be more sympathetic to the President and his friends \nthan Republican appointees who may have gotten the cases through random \nassignment. Judge Johnson has denied any political or other improper \nmotive in a letter to the Washington Times. The fact is that Judge \nJohnson herself issued a number of rulings against President Clinton, \nincluding her rulings rejecting privilege claims by White House lawyer \nBruce Lindsey and the Secret Service. But no matter what Judge \nJohnson's motives, her actions make quite clear that, under the current \nsystem, the potential for abuse does exist.\n  Currently, the Judicial Conference, which is the policymaking body \nfor the federal judiciary, recommends that Federal courts randomly \nassign cases. In fact, in March the conference even rescinded its 28-\nyear-old policy that recommended giving chief judges latitude to make \nspecial assignments of ``protracted, difficult, or widely publicized \ncases.'' But there is still no requirement that Federal courts randomly \nassign cases. The problem with mere recommendations is that they can be \nignored. If we believe that cases should be randomly assigned, then we \nmust require that cases be randomly assigned.\n  My bill imposes such a requirement. Under my bill, the chief judges \nof the Federal district and circuit courts must assign cases by means \nof an automated random assignment program. Recognizing that there are \nsome instances in which it would serve the interests of efficiency to \nallow the chief judges to directly assign cases to specific judges, my \nbill includes two important exceptions to the random assignment \nrequirement. First, chief judges will be permitted to directly assign a \ncase to a judge who has already heard a related case. A related case is \ndefined as one which involves substantially the same facts, individuals \nand/or property as a case previously before the court. For instance, a \ncase against a defendant in a bank robbery could be directly assigned \nto a judge who already heard the case against another defendant in the \nsame bank robbery.\n  Secondly, chief judges will be permitted to directly assign a \ntechnical case to a judge who is already familiar with the subject \nmatter at issue. Technical cases are defined as those which involve \nspecialized, unusually complex facts or subject matter and which would \ndemand a great deal of time to master. For example, an asbestos \nliability case could be directly assigned to a judge who has already \ndeveloped an expertise in handling asbestos liability cases.\n  While Congress should not micro-manage the Courts, the legislation I \nintroduce today is reasonable, limited, and well within our power. \nArticle 1, Section 8, Clause 9 of the Constitution gives Congress the \npower to ``constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court.'' \nPursuant to this power, Congress established the Federal circuits and \noriginally assigned Supreme Court justices to ride these circuits. \nUnder this power, Congress eventually established the Federal district \ncourts and outlined their jurisdiction. The sections of the Federal \nCode I seek to amend today--which permit the assignment of judges in \naccordance with court rules--were themselves Congressional enactments. \nEven in recent years, Congress has imposed restrictions on the \nprocedures of the courts. For example, the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 1996 \ncontained a provision I authored to reform habeas corpus. This \nprovision imposes strict time limits on both the filing of habeas \ncorpus petitions and the response by the courts to such petitions. \nLikewise, many bills we pass include requirements that certain cases be \nheard by the Courts on an expedited basis.\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly that my bill should not become a \npartisan issue. As I mentioned before, one's opinion of Judge Johnson \nand her actions is entirely beside the point.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nconfer United States citizenship automatically and retroactively on \ncertain foreign-born children adopted by citizens of the United States; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    adopted orphans citizenship act\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Don Nickles, and a number of my colleagues, including \nSenators Ashcroft, Bond, Brownback, Chafee, Cochran, Craig, DeWine, \nEdwards, Grassley, Hollings, Inhofe, Kennedy, Levin, Lott, Rockefeller, \nand Gordon Smith in introducing a very important piece of legislation \ncalled the Adopted Orphans Citizenship Act.\n  As you can see from this long list of distinguished Members, the \nAdopted Orphans Citizenship Act is an important piece of legislation \nand one I hope, by introducing it today, we could actually have some \ncommittee and floor action on in the weeks and months ahead. I commend \nSenator Nickles for his leadership. We have presented this bill on \nbehalf of the 15,000 children who are adopted into our country each \nyear through the process of international adoption.\n  A few weeks ago, I had the great privilege to join Senator Levin and \nothers to travel to Romania and had the opportunity to see firsthand \nthe institutions and orphanages. Over 100,000 children of Romania call \nthese places home, but they in fact do not look much like homes, as you \ncan imagine. The staff at these homes try very hard to give the \nchildren in their care the love and support they need as they grow and \nmature, yet the fact is they are living in these institutions. Nothing \ncan really supplant or take the place of a family or home to call your \nown.\n  Not only in Romania but in many places in the world, American \nfamilies are building their families through the process of \ninternational adoption. Last year alone, 15,000 families opened their \nhomes and their hearts to adopt a child from another country, and \n85,000 families adopted children from within the United States. But \nthis bill is directed at the families who are bringing children from \nother parts of the world to come and be part of an American family and \nbecome American citizens. What people may not realize is that now, when \nthe adoption process is final, when all the paperwork has been done, \nafter all the time and energy and in some cases a considerable amount \nof financial expense that is associated with these particular \nadoptions, under our current law, these children and these families \nstill have to go through a citizenship process.\n  This bill will basically make that process automatic and would, as \nthe other parts of our law, recognize no difference between a child who \nis a biological child and a child who is an adopted child. It \nsimplifies our law, it reduces paperwork, it reduces heartaches, \nreduces headaches, and really is something we should have done years \nago. I am proud to join my colleagues today to introduce this \nlegislation that, if passed, will make it automatic that children who \nare adopted into families in the United States will receive, with their \nadoption finalization, automatic citizenship, to be citizens of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I think this change is long overdue. I can say, as the mother of two \nbeautiful adopted children, obviously there is no difference between \nbiological and adopted children. Both are wonderful ways to build \nfamilies. Through the adoption process, many families in the United \nStates are able to provide homes for children who were not fortunate \nenough to have them the first time around. So I am happy to join my \ncolleagues to introduce this bill.\n  I send it to the desk and ask it be referred to the proper committee, \nand I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Take Pride in America Program; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        take pride in america volunteer recognition act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am delighted to introduce the Take Pride \nin America Volunteer Recognition Act of 1999, legislation which will \nrevitalize and expand an important program created in the 1980's to \nenhance the legacy of the Great Outdoors.\n  Each American is part owner of an incredible asset--millions and \nmillions of acres of national parks, national forests, national \nwildlife refuges and other public lands. These wonderful places are \npart of the legacy each of us shares, whether we live in my state of \nWashington or on the other side of the nation. We visit these places \noften and for a variety of reasons. Together, federal lands attract \nnearly two billion visits annually. Americas' Great Outdoors is a place \nfor active fun--for skiing and fishing, camping and\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\nwhitewatersports--as well as for quite time away from our cities, jobs \nand commutes.\n  Years ago, an important initiative was launched to encourage \nAmericans to enjoy this legacy, and take responsibility for protecting \nit for future generations. The program was called Take Pride in America \nand had three components. The first portion was a public awareness \ncampaign, designed to emphasize the importance of caring for federal \nlands and water. The second portion was an environmental education \nprogram for school children and for visitors to public lands. The third \nportion was a volunteer recruitment and recognition effort.\n  The Take Pride in America program received the support of a great \nnumber of well-known Americans. Public Service Announcements and \nappearances were contributed by Clint Eastwood and Linda Evans, Lou \nGossett and Charles Bronson, Gerald McRainey and even ALF. The Oak \nRidge Boys wrote and recorded to Take Pride in America theme song, and \ndonated all royalties to the program. Forty-seven governors initiated \nTake Pride programs within their states, recognizing outstanding \nvolunteers ranging from young children to seniors. Volunteers from \nacross the nation came to Washington for an annual national recognition \nevent at the White House and similar prominent locations. The Ad \nCouncil obtained professional support for the program and donated \nplacements for PSA's--in fact, some of the elements of this campaign \ncontinue to run.\n  The results were good. Volunteerism for America's Great Outdoors \nsurged and vandalism decline. Agencies such as the National Park \nService, the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service and the \nCorps of Engineers were given a new tool to recruit and recognize \nAmericans who invested their time and energy into enhancing our shared \nwealth of parks and forests.\n  Other priorities have put the Take Pride in America Program on hold \nin recent years. It is time to take this tool out and put it to good \nuse once again.\n  Our public lands have maintenance and enhancement needs that exceed \nour ability to fund through general appropriations. We are now \nexperimenting with new recreation fees and other mechanisms to attack a \ndeferred maintenance backlog amounting to more than one billion \ndollars.\n  My legislation would restore and expand the program created by \nCongress in 1990, recommitting us to all three parts of the original \nprogram. It would also strengthen the program to reflect a special \nopportunity associated with the National Fee Demonstration Program \ncreated in 1996, which provides nearly $200 million annually in \nadditional resources to four key federal land systems. The legislation \nwould strengthen our volunteer programs in several ways, including the \nestablishment of a special pass to recognize volunteers who serve 50 \nhours or more on federal public lands.\n  In my state, the Forest Service has done a tremendous job of \norganizing and utilizing the skills and enthusiasm of volunteers \ncommitted to improving our forests. The volunteer programs in the \nNorthwest vary from forest to forest. Typically, groups like the \nStudent Conservation Association, Mountaineers, Mazamas, and \nBackcountry Horsemen of Washington contract with the National Forest \nService to complete specific projects designed to improve the health of \nthe forests and enhance recreational opportunities. Individuals within \nthese associations can earn passes for free access at national forest \ntrailheads in the Pacific Northwest. I think this program is \noutstanding, and I want the Forest Service to continue accommodating \nand encouraging the efforts of volunteers. This bill is designed to \nencore these types of volunteer programs in other regions of the \nNational Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition, I want \nto recognize the special efforts of volunteers who contribute over 50 \nhours of work on federal lands. The legislation directs the Department \nof Interior and Department of Agriculture to recognize these \nindividuals with a pass to recreation areas throughout the federal \nsystem.\n  I look forward to exploring appropriate means for recognition of \nvolunteers as this legislation is considered in the hearing process. We \nneed to consider carefully the relationship between the special Take \nPride in America Pass and other passes, including the Golden Eagle and \nGolden Age passes.\n  This legislation also will serve as a catalyst for expanding the \nscope of volunteer programs on federal lands. Too often in the past, \nour expectations for volunteer projects have focused on projects \nrequiring shovels or paint brushes and requiring high levels of \nphysical exertion. The truth is that important volunteer projects that \ncan protect and enhance America's Great Outdoors are far more diverse. \nWe need skills senior Americans have developed during a lifetime of \nliving and learning, from research in libraries to teaching. We need \nthose with special talents and gifts, from architects to web page \ndesigners, from attorneys--yes, even attorneys--to masons. We need to \nhave meaningful projects for those with just a few hours to contribute \nas well as for those who are prepared to make an ongoing commitment of \ntheir time. Some of the projects can even be undertaken off-site. We \nneed a good directory of needed volunteer undertakings that is widely \navailable long before a volunteer shows up at a forest or park \nheadquarters.\n  To the hundreds of thousands of Americans who already spend time \nprotecting and enhancing America's public lands--covering nearly one in \nthree acres of the nation--I give my thanks and ask for help in \ndevising a system that recognizes the wonderful contribution you make \nand inspires millions of others to join in your important work. I also \nask for the support of the Department of Interior and the Department of \nAgriculture for this legislation and its goal of taking better care of \nAmerica's Great Outdoors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Inouye, \n        and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 1487. A bill to provide for excellence in economic education, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n              Excellence in Economic Education Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Excellence in \nEconomic Education Act of 1999, a bill I am introducing today with my \nfriends, Senators Cochran, Murray, Inouye, and Kerrey.\n  With each passing day, the need for increased economic literacy \nbecomes more and more apparent. The rise of Internet commerce, market \nglobalization, advances in technology, growth of online investment \nservices, and the increase in the number of Americans who invest in the \nstock market serve to highlight the importance of economic literacy for \ncitizens of every age and professional background. I am convinced that \nmore education about basic economic concepts such as money, personal \nfinance, and inflation--starting from a young age--could help people \nmake decisions about their financial situation, so that they can better \nprepare for and endure our changing economy.\n  We need to help young people better understand economic implications \nof their actions: they can't always get what they want; they need to be \nmore responsible with money; and, they are learning fiscal habits now \nthat will stay with them for the rest of their lives.\n  In addition to teaching our youth how to make good financial \ndecisions, we must help them become productive and well-informed \ncitizens. It has been shown that a lack of knowledge about fundamental \neconomics can have negative effects on our economy and lead to \ndivisions and polarization in our communities. Economic education can \nhave profound long-term effects for all of us.\n  We must educate our country's future workforce about what effects the \nretirements of our ``baby boom generation'' will have on them. \nCurrently, Social Security reform is one of the biggest issues that is \nbefore us. We are working to ensure that Social Security will remain \nsolvent well into the next century.\n  As we know, the number of people receiving Social Security will surge \nfrom 44 million now to 75 million in 2020. Even if we achieve a truly \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S10231]]\n\nsolution on Social Security, our young people will still feel the \nimpact from this tremendous future demographic shift, and they should \nlearn how to prepare themselves for security in retirement. Economic \neducation can help them.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment on the results of a basic \neconomics test given nationally by the National Council on Economic \nEducation, which provides further evidence of the need for increased \neconomic education. Taken by 1,010 adults and 1,085 high school \nstudents, the test's findings are striking:\n  (1) half of adults and two-thirds of high school students failed, \nwhile only six percent of adults and three percent of high school \nstudents got an ``A'';\n  (2) on average, adults received a grade of 57 percent and high school \nstudents a grade of 48 percent;\n  (3) students and adults alike lacked a basic understanding about the \nconcepts of money, inflation and scarcity of resources--core economic \nconcepts;\n  (4) a sizeable number of students--35 percent--admitted that they \nsimply do not know what the effect of an increase in interest rates \nwould be; and\n  (5) only a little more than half of adults, 54 percent, and less than \none in four students, 23 percent, know that a budget deficit occurs \nwhen the Federal Government's expenditures exceed its revenues for that \nyear.\n  However, amid these disappointing results, the study found that 96 \npercent believe basic economics should be taught in high school. \nCurrently, 38 states have adopted guidelines for teaching economics in \ntheir schools, but only 13 states require that students take economics \nin order to graduate. Clearly, people see the need for improved \neconomic education, and this need exists in many States.\n  This brings me to a brief description of what the Excellence in \nEconomic Education Act would do. My bill would ensure that a majority \nof total funds appropriated under the Act would be distributed to state \ncouncils on economic education and economic education centers based at \nuniversities to support the work that these entities are performing. It \nwould support the National Council on Economic Education in economic \nliteracy activities that it conducts. It would also fund the creation \nof new councils and centers in states without a council or center.\n  The goals of the bill are to increase student knowledge of and \nachievement in economics; strengthen teachers' understanding of and \nability to teach economics; encourage related research and development, \ndissemination of instructional materials, and replication of best \npractices and programs; help States measure the impact of economic \neducation; ensure a strong presence of the nationwide network in every \nState; and leverage and increase private and public support for \neconomic education partnerships at all levels.\n  Support for economic education is in the Goals 2000: Educate America \nAct which lists economics as a national core subject area.\n  My bill encourages the National Council and state councils and \ncenters to work with local businesses and private industry as much as \npossible, particularly in obtaining matching funds.\n  Mr. President, we need to improve economic literacy for our children, \njust as we need to ensure reading literacy, writing aptitude, math and \nscience comprehension, and an understanding of history and the arts. \nEconomics is a fundamental, practical building block that should round \nout our children's education. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \ncosponsoring the Excellence in Economic Education Act.\n  For more specific details on the grants my bill creates, one-fourth \nof funds would be provided to the National Council, so that the council \nmay strengthen and expand its nationwide economic education network, \nsupport and promote teacher training in coordination with current \nEisenhower Professional Development activities, support related \nresearch, and develop and disseminate appropriate materials.\n\n  The remaining funds will be distributed by the National Council to \nstate councils or centers, which will work in partnership with the \nprivate sector, state educational agencies, local educational agencies, \ninstitutions of higher education or other organizations that promote \neconomic development or educational excellence. With this money, \ncouncils and centers will be able to fund teacher training programs, \nresources to school districts that want to incorporate economics into \ncurricula, evaluations of the impact of economic education on students, \nrelated research, school-based student activities to promote consumer \nand personal finance education and to encourage awareness and student \nachievement in economics, interstate and international student and \nteacher exchanges, and replication of best practices to promote \neconomic literacy.\n  The National Council runs an International Economics Exchange Program \nwhich is authorized in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This \nprogram assists with economic education in transition countries of the \nformer Soviet Union, and enjoys broad support. My bill would boost the \ndomestic component of the National Council's activities.\n  In addition, my bill puts increased emphasis on economics by adding \nit to the list of subject areas in Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct programs, such as National Teacher Training Project, Star Schools, \nMagnet Schools, Fund for the Improvement of Education, and Urban and \nRural Education Assistance.\n  We are looking for ways to better educate our young people on how to \nmanage their resources, be better workers, make wise investments, and \nprepare for a secure financial future. My bill provides the flexibility \nneeded so that this may happen through practical means and make \neconomics come alive for students. It is important to start working on \nthis now. Before we know it, current eighth graders will have gone \nthrough high school, possibly college, and entered the workforce.\n  One again, I thank Senators Cochran, Inouye, Murray, and Kerrey for \nbecoming original cosponsors of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in cosponsoring the Excellence in Economic Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1487\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCELLENCE IN ECONOMIC EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Amendment.--Title X of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n               ``PART L--EXCELLENCE IN ECONOMIC EDUCATION\n\n     ``SEC. 10995. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       ``(a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the \n     ``Excellence in Economic Education Act of 1999''.\n       ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) The need for economic literacy in the United States \n     has grown exponentially in the 1990's as a result of rapid \n     technological advancements and increasing globalization, \n     giving individuals in the United States more numerous and \n     complex economic and financial choices than ever before as \n     members of the workforce, managers of their families' \n     resources, and voting citizens.\n       ``(2) Individuals in the United States lack essential \n     economic knowledge, as demonstrated in a 1998-1999 test \n     conducted by the National Council on Economic Education, a \n     private nonprofit organization. The test results indicated \n     the following:\n       ``(A) Students and adults alike lack a basic understanding \n     of core economic concepts such as scarcity of resources and \n     inflation, with less than half of those tested demonstrating \n     knowledge of those basic concepts.\n       ``(B) A little more than \\1/3\\ of those tested realize that \n     society must make choices about how to use resources.\n       ``(C) Only \\1/3\\ of those tested understand that active \n     competition in the marketplace serves to lower prices and \n     improve product quality.\n       ``(D) Slightly more than \\1/2\\ of adults in the United \n     States and less than \\1/4\\ of students in the United States \n     know that a Federal budget deficit is created when the \n     Federal Government's expenditures exceed its revenues in a \n     year.\n       ``(E) Overall, adults received a grade of 57 percent on the \n     test and secondary school students received a grade of 48 \n     percent on the test.\n       ``(F) Despite those poor results, the test pointed out that \n     individuals in the United States realize the need for \n     understanding basic economic concepts, with 96 percent of \n     adults tested believing that basic economics should be taught \n     in secondary school.\n       ``(3) A range of trends points to the need for individuals \n     in the United States to receive a practical economics \n     education that\n\n[[Page S10232]]\n\n     will give the individuals tools to make responsible choices \n     about their limited financial resources, choices which face \n     all people regardless of their financial circumstances. \n     Examples of the trends are the following:\n       ``(A) The number of personal bankruptcies in the United \n     States continued to rise and set new records in the 1990's, \n     despite the longest peacetime economic expansion in United \n     States history.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe payment to States of pilot allowances for certain veterans eligible \nfor burial in a national cemetery who are buried in cemeteries of such \nStates.\n\n\n                    veterans' plot allowance equity\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwhich provides equity for a group of veterans at their final moment: \nthose veterans who are buried in State-owned veterans' cemeteries.\n  For a number of years, the amount of space in national veterans' \ncemeteries has been rapidly declining. With the strong encouragement of \nthe Federal government, the States have undertaken to develop their own \nveterans' cemeteries. When certain categories of veterans are buried \nwithout charge in these State veterans' cemeteries, the Federal \ngovernment pays the State a $150 ``plot allowance'' for the burial \nspace. However, only limited categories of veterans are covered by this \npayment: those who were discharged for disability or who were receiving \ndisability-related compensation; those who died in a veterans hospital; \nand those indigent veterans whose bodies were unclaimed after death.\n  For the many other veterans who don't fall into one of these few \ncategories, the federal government will pay nothing for their burial \nspace if they are buried in a State veterans' cemetery. By contrast, if \nany of these veterans were buried in a national veterans' cemetery, for \nwhich they are eligible, the federal government picks up the cost of \nthe burial space. This disparity seems inexplicable, a final insult to \nthe dedicated service of men and women who unselfishly served their \ncountry.\n  My bill removes this inequity by stating that, for any veteran who is \neligible for burial in a national veterans' cemetery but who is \ninterred in a State veterans' cemetery, the federal government will pay \nthe State a $150 plot allowance for the burial space. That's it. No \nifs, ands, or buts. No exceptions.\n  The government promised these veterans that they would be taken care \nof in their final passage, and it must live up to this vow. Regardless \nof whether veterans are buried in a State cemetery or in a national \ncemetery, their service in the armed forces benefitted all of us, and \nwe should stop quibbling about whether the location of the grave has \nanything to do with the dignity and selflessness of the service to the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I urge my fellow Senators to support this bill in the \nname of fairness and in recognition of the service to the country of \nall our veterans in their final hour.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 1490. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for State and local sales taxes in lieu of State and local \nincome taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   Deductibility of State Sales Taxes\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will address an inequity in the tax code that affects \nthe citizens of my state and citizens of the other states that do not \nhave a state income tax. Tennesseans are discriminated against under \nfederal tax laws simply because our state chooses to raise revenue \nprimarily through a sales tax instead of an income tax. My bill would \nend this inequity by allowing taxpayers to deduct either their state \nand local sales taxes or their state and local income taxes on their \nfederal tax forms, but not both. I am joined today by my colleague from \nTennessee, Senator Frist.\n  Under current law, individuals who itemize their deductions for \nfederal tax purposes are only permitted to deduct state and local \nincome taxes and property taxes paid. State and local sales\n\n[[Page S10234]]\n\ntaxes are not deductible. Therefore, residents of nine states are \ntreated differently from residents of states with an income tax. Seven \nstates--Texas, Florida, Alaska, Wyoming, Washington, South Dakota and \nNebraska--have no state income tax. Two states--Tennessee and New \nHampshire--only impose an income tax on interest and dividends, but not \nwages.\n  Prior to 1986, taxpayers were permitted to deduct all of their state \nand local taxes paid (including income, sales and property taxes) when \ncomputing their federal tax liability. The ability to deduct all state \nand local taxes is based on the principle that levying a tax on a tax \nis unfair.\n  In 1986, however, Congress made dramatic changes to the tax code. The \nTax Reform Act of 1986 significantly reduced federal tax rates on \nindividuals. In exchange for these lower rates, Congress broadened the \nbase of income that is taxed by eliminating many of the deductions and \ncredits that previously existed in the code, including the deduction \nfor state and local sales taxes.\n  Mr. President, I believe that our federal tax laws should be neutral \nwith respect to the treatment of state and local taxes. As I have said, \nthat is not the case now. The current tax code is biased in favor of \nstates that raise revenue through an income tax. I strongly support \ncomprehensive reform of the tax code that will address issues such as \nneutrality, fairness and simplicity. As we work to reform the overall \ntax code, restoring equality in this area should be a part of the \ndiscussion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bennett, \n        Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 1492.

FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) during periods of inflation, the United States has \n     experienced a deterioration in its potential economic growth;\n       (2) a decline in inflation has been a crucial factor in \n     encouraging recent robust economic growth;\n       (3) stable prices facilitate higher sustainable levels of \n     economic growth, investment, and job creation;\n       (4) the multiple policy goals of the Full Employment and \n     Balanced Growth Act of 1978 cause confusion and ambiguity \n     about the appropriate role and aims of monetary policy, which \n     can add to volatility in economic activity and financial \n     markets, harming economic growth and costing workers jobs;\n       (5) recognizing the dangers of inflation and the \n     appropriate role of monetary policy, political leaders in \n     countries throughout the world have directed the central \n     banks of those countries to institute reforms that focus \n     monetary policy on the single objective of price stability, \n     rather than on multiple policy goals;\n       (6) there is a need for the Congress to clarify the proper \n     role of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n     in economic policymaking, in order to achieve the best \n     environment for long-term economic growth and job creation; \n     and\n       (7) because price stability is a key condition for \n     maintaining the highest possible levels of productivity, real \n     incomes, living standards, employment, and global \n     competitiveness, price stability should be the primary long-\n     term goal of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States that--\n       (1) the principal economic responsibilities of the \n     Government are to establish and ensure an environment that is \n     conducive to both long-term economic growth and increases in \n     living standards, by establishing and maintaining free \n     markets, low taxes, respect for private property, and the \n     stable, long-term purchasing power of the United States \n     currency; and\n       (2) the primary long-term goal of the Board of Governors of \n     the Federal Reserve System (hereafter in this Act referred to \n     as the ``Board'') should be to promote price stability.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program \nto advance the development of public policy with respect to issues \naffecting senior citizens; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                the John Heinz senate fellowship program\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a \nbill reauthorizing the John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program. This \nCongressional fellowship program, created in 1992, is a fitting tribute \nto my late colleague and dear friend, United States Senator John Heinz. \nSenator Heinz dedicated his life and much of his Congressional career \nto improving the lives of senior citizens. He believed that Congress \nhas a special responsibility to serve as a guardian for those who \ncannot protect themselves. This fellowship program, which focuses on \naging issues, honors the life and continues the legacy of Senator John \nHeinz.\n  During his 20 years in the Congress, John Heinz compiled an enviable \nrecord of accomplishments. While he was successful in many areas, he \nbuilt a national reputation for his strong commitment to improving the \nquality of life of our nation's elderly. Pennsylvania, with nearly 2 \nmillion citizens aged 65 or older--over 15% of the population--houses \nthe second largest elderly population nationwide. As John traveled \nthroughout the state, he listened to the concerns of this important \nconstituency and came back to Washington to address their needs through \npolicy and legislation.\n  Senator Heinz led the fight against age discrimination by championing \nlegislation to eliminate the requirement that older Americans must \nretire at age 65, and by ensuring full retirement pay for older workers \nemployed by factories forced to close. During his Chairmanship of the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging from 1981-1986 and his tenure as \nRanking Minority Member from 1987-1991, Senator Heinz used his position \nto improve health care accessibility and affordability for senior \ncitizens and to reduce fraud and abuse within Federal health care \nprograms. Congress enacted his legislation to provide Medicare \nrecipients a lower cost alternative to fee-for-service medicine, as \nwell as his legislation to add a hospice benefit to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  John also recognized the great need for nursing home reforms. He was \nsuccessful in passing legislation mandating that safety measures be \nimplemented in nursing homes and ensuring that nursing home residents \ncannot be bound and tied to their beds or wheelchairs.\n  Mr. President, the John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program will help \ncontinue the efforts of Senator Heinz to give our nation's elderly the \nquality of life they deserve. The program encourages the identification \nand training of new leadership in aging policy by awarding fellowships \nto qualified candidates to serve in a Senate office or with a Senate \nCommittee staff. The goal of this program is to advance the development \nof the public policy in issues affecting senior citizens. Administered \nby the Heinz Family Foundation in conjunction with the Secretary of the \nSenate, the program allows fellows to bring their firsthand experience \nin aging issues to the work of Congress. Heinz fellows who are \nadvocates for aging issues spend a year to help us learn about the \neffects of Federal policies on our elderly citizens, those who are \nsocial workers help us find better ways to protect our nation's elderly \nfrom abuse and neglect, and those who are health care providers help us \nto build a strong health care system that addresses the unique needs of \nour seniors.\n  As fellows, senior citizen advocates and aging policy experts not \nonly have the opportunity to use their expertise to facilitate national \ndebate about issues concerning senior citizens, they also prepare \nthemselves to make future contributions to their local communities. The \nHeinz fellowship enables us to train new leaders in senior citizen \nadvocacy and aging policy. The fellows return to their respective \ncareers with a new understanding about how to work effectively with \ngovernment, so they may better fulfill their goals as senior citizen \nadvocates.\n  The John Heinz Fellowship Program has been a valuable tool for \nCongress and our communities since its establishment in 1992. The \ncontinuation of this vital program will signal a sustained commitment \nto our nation's elderly. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring this resolution, and urge its swift adoption. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``John Heinz Senate Fellowship \n     Program''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Senator John Heinz believed that Congress has a special \n     responsibility to serve as a guardian for those persons who \n     cannot protect themselves.\n       (2) Senator Heinz dedicated much of his career in Congress \n     to improving the lives of senior citizens.\n       (3) It is especially appropriate to honor the memory of \n     Senator Heinz through the creation of a Senate fellowship \n     program to encourage the identification and training of new \n     leadership in aging policy and to bring experts with \n     firsthand experience of aging issues to the assistance of the \n     Congress in order to advance the development of public policy \n     in issues that affect senior citizens.\n\n     SEC. 3. FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--In order to encourage the identification \n     and training of new leadership in issues affecting senior \n     citizens and to advance the development of public policy with \n     respect to such issues, there is established a John Heinz \n     Senate Fellowship Program.\n       (b) Senate Fellowships.--The Heinz Family Foundation, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of the Senate, is authorized \n     to select Senate fellowship participants.\n       (c) Selection Process.--The Heinz Family Foundation shall--\n       (1) publicize the availability of the fellowship program;\n       (2) develop and administer an application process for \n     Senate fellowships; and\n       (3) conduct a screening of applicants for the fellowship \n     program.\n\n     SEC. 4. COMPENSATION; NUMBER OF FELLOWSHIPS; PLACEMENT.\n\n       (a) Compensation.--The Secretary of the Senate is \n     authorized, from funds made available under section 5, to \n     appoint and fix the compensation of each eligible participant \n     selected under this Act for a period determined by the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Number of Fellowships.--No more than 2 fellowship \n     participants shall be so employed. Any individual appointed \n     pursuant to this Act shall be subject to all laws, \n     regulations and rules in the same manner and to the same \n     extent as any other employee of the Senate.\n       (c) Placement.--The Secretary of the Senate, after \n     consultation with the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of \n     the Senate, shall place eligible participants in positions in \n     the Senate that are, within practical considerations, \n     supportive of the fellowship participants' areas of \n     expertise.\n\n     SEC. 5. FUNDS.\n\n       The funds necessary to compensate eligible participants \n     under this Act for fiscal year 1999 shall be paid from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate. Such funds shall not exceed, \n     for fiscal year 1999, $71,000. There are authorized to be \n     appropriated $71,000 for each of the fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2004 to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 1494. A bill to ensure that small businesses throughout the United \nStates participate fully in the unfolding electronic commerce \nrevolution through the establishment of an electronic commerce \nextension program at the National Institutes of Standards and \nTechnology; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        ELECTRONIC COMMERCE EXTENSION ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I'm very pleased to be joined by \nSenators Rockefeller, Snowe, and Mikulski in introducing the \n``Electronic Commerce Extension Establishment Act of 1999.'' The \npurpose of this bill is\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\nsimple--to ensure that small businesses in every corner of our nation \nfully participate in the electronic commerce revolution unfolding \naround us by helping them find and adopt the right e-commerce \ntechnology and techniques. It does this by authorizing an ``electronic \ncommerce extension'' program at the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology modeled on NIST's existing, highly successful Manufacturing \nExtension Program.\n  Everywhere you look today, e-commerce--the buying, selling, and even \nthe delivery of goods and services via computer networks--is starting a \nrevolution in American business. Being so new, precise e-commerce \nnumbers are hard to come by, but by one estimate business to business \nand business to consumer e-commerce sales in 1998 were $100 billion. If \nyou add in the hardware, software, and services making those sales \npossible, the number rises to $300 billion. That's comparable to adding \nanother entire automobile industry to the economy in the last few \nyears. Another estimate has business to business e-commerce growing to \n$1.3 trillion by 2003. Whatever the exact numbers, an amazing change in \nour economy has begun.\n  But the shift to e-commerce is about more than new ways to sell \nthings; it's about new ways to do things. It promises to transform how \nwe do business--how we design products, manage supply chains and \ninventories, advertise and distribute goods, et cetera--and thereby \nboost productivity, the root of long term improvements in our standard \nof living. A recent Washington Post piece on Cisco Systems, a major \nsupplier of Internet hardware, notes that Cisco saved $500 million last \nyear by selling its products and buying its supplies online. On sales \nof $8.5 billion, that helped make for some nice profits. Imagine the \nproductivity and economic growth spurred when more firms get \nefficiencies like that. And that's the point of this bill, to make sure \nthat small businesses get those benefits too.\n  Electronic commerce is a new use of information technology and the \nInternet. Many people, including Alan Greenspan, suspect information \ntechnology is the major driver behind the productivity and economic \ngrowth we've been enjoying. The crucial verb here is ``use.'' It is the \nwidespread use of a more productive technology that sustains \naccelerated productivity growth. It was steam engine, not its sales, \nthat powered the industrial revolution. In 1899, only about 5 percent \nof factory horsepower came from electric motors, even though the \ntechnologies had been around for two decades. But by 1920, when \nelectric motors finally accounted for more than half of factory \nhorsepower, they created a surge in industrial productivity as more \nefficient factory designs became common.\n  Closer to today, in 1987, Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow \nquipped, ``We see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity \nstatistics.'' Well, it looks like the computer has started to show up \nbecause more people are using them in more ways, like e-commerce. \nInformation technology producers, companies like Cisco Systems who are, \nnotably, some of the most sophisticated users of IT, are 8 percent of \nour economy; from 1995 to 1998 they contributed 35 percent of our \neconomic growth. There are also some indications that IT is now \nimproving productivity among companies that only use IT, though \neconomists continue to debate that.\n  But here's the real point. If we are going to sustain this \nproductivity and economic growth, if this is to be more than a one time \nboost that dies out, we have to spread sophisticated uses of \ninformation technology like e-commerce beyond the high tech sector and \ncompanies like Cisco Systems and into every corner of the economy, \nincluding small businesses. Back in the 1980s we used to debate if it \nmattered if we made money selling ``potato chips or computer chips.'' \nBut here's the real difference: consuming a lot of potato chips isn't \ngood for you; consuming a lot of computer chips is.\n  I emphasize all this because too often our discussions of government \npolicy, technology, and economic growth dwell on the invention and sale \nof new technologies, which are crucial, but shortchange the all \nimportant, but not terribly glamorous topic of their adoption and use. \nExtension programs, like the electronic commerce extension program in \nthis bill, are policy aimed at precisely spreading the adoption and use \nof more productive technology by small businesses.\n\n  Now, with that in mind, the e-commerce revolution creates both \nopportunities and challenges for small businesses. On the one hand, it \nwill open new markets to them and help them be more efficient. Many of \nus have seen that cartoon with a dog in front of a computer saying, \n``On the Internet no one knows you're a dog.'' Well, on the web, the \ngarage shop can look as good as IBM or GM. On the other hand, the high \nfixed costs, low marginal costs, and technical sophistication that can \nsometimes characterize e-commerce, when coupled with a good brand name, \nmay allow larger, more established e-commerce firms to quickly move \nfrom market to market. Amazon.com, perhaps the archetype e-commerce \nfirm, has done such a wonderful job of making a huge variety of books \nwidely available that it's been able to expand to CDs, to toys, to \nelectronics, to auctions. Moreover, firms in more rural or isolated \nareas have suddenly found sophisticated, low cost, previously distant \nbusinesses entering their market, and competing with them. Thus, there \nis considerable risk that many small businesses be left behind in the \nshift to e-commerce. That would not be good for them, nor for the rest \nof us, because we all benefit when everyone is more productive and \neveryone competes.\n  The root of this problem is the fact that many small firms have a \nhard time identifying and adopting new technology. They're hard pressed \nand hard working, but they just don't have the time, people, or money \nto understand all the different technologies they might use. And, they \noften don't even know where to turn for help. Thus, while small firms \nare very flexible, they can be slow to adopt new technology, because \nthey don't know which to use or what to do about it. That's why we have \nextension programs. Extension programs give small businesses low cost, \nimpartial advice on what technologies are out there and how to use \nthem.\n  Extension programs have a long, solid pedigree. They started in 1914, \nwith the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service to \n``extend'' the benefits of agricultural research to the farmer. That \nextension service has played no small part in making the American \nfarmer the most productive in the world. More recently, the \ncompetitiveness crisis of the 1980's prompted the creation of the \nManufacturing Extension Program, or MEP, at NIST to help small \nmanufacturers find and use the technology they need. NIST has done a \ngood job building and managing MEP's network of more than 70 non-profit \ncenters, in all 50 states, with 2000 experts on call, that has helped \nover 60,000 manufacturers.\n  Today, the United States is the international leader in e-commerce, \nbut other nations are working to catch up, just like they did in \nmanufacturing. Thus, the time is ripe to solidify our lead in e-\ncommerce and extend it to every part of our economy in every corner of \nthe nation. An electronic commerce extension program will help us do \nthat.\n  So, what might such a program do? Imagine you're a small specialty \nfoods retailer in rural New Mexico and you see e-commerce as a way to \nreach more customers. But your specialty is chiles, not computers; \nimagine all the questions you'd have. How do I sell over the web? Can I \nbuy supplies that way too? How do I keep hackers out of my system? What \nprivacy policies should I follow? How do I use encryption to collect \ncredit card numbers and guarantee customers that I'm who I say I am? \nCan I electronically integrate my sales orders with instructions to \nshippers like Federal Express? How might I handle orders from Japan or \nHolland? Should I band together with other local producers to form a \nchile cybermall? What servers, software, and telecommunications will I \nneed and how much will it cost? Can I do this via satellite links? Your \nlocal e-commerce extension center would answer those questions for you. \nAnd, you could trust their advice, because you'd know they were \nimpartial and had no interest in selling you a particular product.\n  This bill will lead to the creation of a high quality, nationwide \nnetwork of non-profit organizations providing that kind of expert \nadvice, analogous to the MEP network NIST runs today, but\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\nwith a focus on e-commerce and on firms beyond manufacturers. NIST, as \npart of the Department of Commerce, is a logical choice to run an e-\ncommerce extension program because it's about promoting commerce via \ntechnology and standards; recall that the Internet is based on \nstandards for how computers can talk to each other. But the best reason \nfor NIST to do this is that MEP shows they can do it well; that \nexpertise will prove invaluable in getting this new network up and \nrunning.\n  Similarly, this bill is directly modeled on the MEP authorization. It \nretains the key features of MEP: a network of centers run by non-\nprofits; strict merit selection; cost sharing where the federal \ngovernment's share decreases from one half to one third over time; and \nperiodic independent review of each center. In addition, it emphasizes \nserving small businesses in rural or more isolated areas, so that those \nbusinesses can get a leg up on e-commerce too. In short, this \nlegislation takes an approach that has already been proven to work.\n  Practically speaking, if this bill becomes law, I assume NIST, \ntogether with its headquarters organization, the Technology \nAdministration, would begin by leveraging their MEP management \nexpertise to start a few e-commerce extension centers and then \ngradually build out a network separate from MEP. They could also use \nthe study of e-commerce extension resulting from my amendment to the \nCommerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill the other week. I also \nwant to note that this is a new, separate authorization for an e-\ncommerce extension program because it will have a different focus than \nMEP and because I do not want it to displace MEP in any way. MEP is a \ngreat program. Let's keep it going strong while we build this new e-\ncommerce extension system.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant, timely, and practical piece of legislation. Just as a strong \nagricultural sector called for an agricultural extension service, and a \nstrong industrial sector called for manufacturing extension, our shift \nto an information economy calls for electronic commerce extension.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no obection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Commerce \n     Extension Establishment Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States economy is in the early stages of a \n     revolution in electronic commerce--the ability to buy, sell, \n     and even deliver goods and services through computer \n     networks. Estimates are that electronic commerce sales in \n     1998 were around $100,000,000,000 and could rise to \n     $1,300,000,000,000 by 2003.\n       (2) Electronic commerce promises to spur tremendously \n     United States productivity and economic growth--repeating a \n     historical pattern where the greatest impetus toward economic \n     growth lies not in the sale of new technologies but in their \n     widespread adoption and use.\n       (3) Electronic commerce presents an enormous opportunity \n     and challenge for small businesses. Such commerce will give \n     such businesses new markets and new ways of doing businesses. \n     However, many such business will have difficulty in adopting \n     appropriate electronic commerce technologies and practices. \n     Moreover, such businesses in more rural areas will find \n     distant businesses entering their markets and competing with \n     them. Thus, there is considerable risk many small businesses \n     will be left behind in the shift to electronic commerce.\n       (4) The United States has an interest in ensuring that \n     small businesses in all parts of the United States \n     participate fully in the electronic commerce revolution, both \n     for the sake of such businesses and in order to promote \n     productivity and economic growth throughout the entire United \n     States economy.\n       (5) The Federal Government has a long history of \n     successfully helping small farmers with new agricultural \n     technologies through the Cooperative Extension System at the \n     Department of Agriculture, founded in 1914. More recently, \n     the National Institute of Standards and Technology has \n     successfully helped small manufacturers with manufacturing \n     technologies though its Manufacturing Extension Program, \n     established in 1988.\n       (6) Similarly, now is the time to establish an electronic \n     commerce extension program to help small businesses \n     throughout the United States identify, adapt, and adopt \n     electronic commerce technologies and business practices, \n     thereby ensuring that such businesses fully participate in \n     the electronic commerce revolution.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish an electronic \n     commerce extension program focused on small businesses at the \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to establish, wherever feasible, guidelines, \nrecommendations, and regulations that promote the regulatory acceptance \nof new and revised toxicological tests that protect human and animal \nhealth and the environment while reducing, refining, or replacing \nanimal tests and ensuring human safety and product effectiveness; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat would authorize the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the \nValidation of Alternative Methods, otherwise known as ``ICCVAM.'' This \nbill would permanently establish ICCVAM, which currently only exists as \na ``standing'' committee--so, it could be dismantled at any time. This \nbill would make it more permanent, thus giving companies and Federal \nagencies a sense of certainty, and encourage them to make the long term \nresearch investments that are required to develop alternative animal \ntoxicology test methods for ICCVAM to review. This will decrease, and \nmay ultimately lead to the end of, the use of animals in testing \ncosmetics, shampoos, detergents, and other products.\n  ICCVAM was created pursuant to the 1993 National Institutes of Health \nRevitalization Act's mandate that the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) recommend new processes for \nFederal agencies' acceptance of alternative toxicology tests using \nanimals. ICCVAM is composed of representatives of 13 Federal agencies \nthat use animals in toxicology research.\n  ICCVAM evaluates and recommends improved testing methods and makes it \npossible for more uniform testing to be adopted across Federal \nagencies. This legislation maintains the current practice of leaving \nthe ultimate decision of whether or not to adopt the new test method up \nto each individual Federal agency. For example, a new lab test using a \nskin substitute has been evaluated and accepted by ICCVAM so that \npotentially toxic substances can first be tested on this ``substitute \nskin'' rather than on an animal. The test is a measure of the ability \nof a chemical to burn the skin. If the substance tests positive (i.e., \nburns or irritates the ``substitute skin''), then it could be \nconsidered to produce skin burns and no animal would be used in further \ntesting. If the substance does not irritate the ``artificial skin,'' \nthen the substance might then be tested on an animal. Ultimately, \nICCVAM streamlines the test method validation and approval process by \nevaluating methods of interest to multiple agencies. By having the same \nmethod in place in multiple agencies, it aids in reducing the need to \nperform multiple animal tests to meet the requirements of various \nfederal agencies. This bill and ICCVAM do not apply to regulations \nrelated to medical research. This bill is supported by the Humane \nSociety of the United States, the Doris Day Animal League, Procter & \nGamble, the American Humane Association, Colgate-Palmolive Company, the \nGillette Company, and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 1497. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to take \nsteps to control the growing international problem of tuberculosis; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n             international tuberculosis control act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Smith of Oregon, \nand by Senator Lautenberg in introducing the International Tuberculosis \nControl Act.\n  This bill speaks to the growing international problem of \ntuberculosis. That is a disease we thought we had eliminated--and in \nfact, in the Western World, we largely did with the development of \nantibiotics in the 1950s. But the disease is making a comeback. As the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) notes on the back cover of its most \nrecent report on TB, ``The tuberculosis epidemic is growing larger and \nmore dangerous each year.''\n  According to the WHO, last year, nearly 2 million people died of \ntuberculosis-related conditions. And--get this--the WHO estimates that \none-third of the entire world's population is infected with TB.\n  Like so many other diseases, it impacts women disproportionately. TB \nis the world's leading killer of women between the ages of 15 and 44. \nFor women in the primes of their lives, more than twice as many die of \ntuberculosis than because of war. TB kills three times as many women \naged 15-44 as HIV/AIDS, and three times as many as heart disease.\n  And it is a leading cause of children becoming orphans.\n  But this is not just a growing international problem. Because of its \npersistence abroad, it is having a tremendous impact here at home.\n  TB is an airborne disease. You can get it when someone coughs or \nsneezes.\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\n And with the increased immigration and travel to the United States--as \nwell as the homeless population, the rate of incarceration, and HIV/\nAIDS--we are seeing it re-emerge in many of our communities. Nearly 40 \npercent of the TB cases in the United States are attributable to \nforeign-born individuals.\n  We have seen it in my state of California, where local public health \nofficials never thought they would have to worry about TB again. But \nthey are. In 1997, nearly 20,000 TB cases were reported to the Centers \nfor Disease Control. And over 4000 of them--20 percent of all TB cases \nin the United States--were in California.\n  The headline on the March 25 editorial in ``The Oakland Tribune'' \nsaid it best: ``We ignore TB at our peril.'' Public health officials \nacknowledge that the key to controlling TB at home is to control TB \nabroad.\n  Fortunately, the experts know what to do--and it works. TB can be \ntreated and cured. We have seen that in this country.\n  But in many other countries where this disease persists, there are \nnumerous barriers that are facing public health officials. For example, \nthe process for screening, detecting, and treating tuberculosis is very \nlengthy and labor intensive. Also, there is a lack of trained personnel \nand medicine in those nations with a high incidence of TB.\n  The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and \nthe World Health Organization have begun implementing a program to \neliminate these barriers and to treat and control tuberculosis. So far, \nthey have had some success. But the resources are, quite frankly, \ninadequate.\n  And they may become even more inadequate in the near future. The WHO \nis currently developing a global action plan to combat tuberculosis. \nThat plan should be finalized and ready for implementation early in the \nyear 2001. But unless there is a greater global investment of \nresources, we may have an action plan that does not see much action.\n  So the purpose of our bill is two-fold. First, we must raise \nawareness that TB is still a problem. I suspect that few Americans \nrealize that the disease persists--not only in other countries, but \nalso right here in the United States. And fewer still realize how \neasily it can be transmitted.\n  Second, we must increase the resources available to fight this \ndisease in foreign countries.\n  This year, USAID will spend about $12 million on fighting \ntuberculosis abroad. Under the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, \nas passed by the Senate, there should be enough funding for USAID to \nincrease that to about $14 million next year.\n  I wanted to increase that even more, and I offered an amendment to \nthe Foreign Operations bill. My amendment, which was accepted, says \nthat if more money overall is provided for foreign aid programs before \nthe appropriations bill becomes law, a top priority should be to \nprovide more money for the infectious disease control program, \nespecially tuberculosis.\n  But, Mr. President, I am not sure that will happen, and even if it \ndoes, I do not believe it will be enough. So our bill would authorize \n$60 million for fiscal year 2001--a five-fold increase over current \nfunding levels--so that USAID can expand the work it has begun.\n  Make no mistake, we cannot do this alone. That is why this \nlegislation calls on USAID to coordinate its efforts with the WHO and \nother organizations and why the bill adopts detection- and cure-rate \ngoals based on the goals established by WHO. This must be a global \neffort with contributions and participation from nations around the \nworld. But it is also an opportunity for the United States to provide \nglobal leadership.\n  Mr. President, this bill is supported by the American Lung \nAssociation, Results, the Global Health Council, and Princeton Project \n55, an organization formed specifically to fight the international TB \nproblem. I ask unanimous consent that the statements of support from \nthese groups be included in the Record.\n  I am pleased to have their support, and I am pleased to have the \ncosponsorship of my colleagues from Oregon and New Jersey. I hope \nothers will join us in this important bipartisan effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Tuberculosis \n     Control Act of 1999''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950s, \n     tuberculosis has been largely controlled in the United States \n     and the Western World.\n       (2) Due to societal factors, including growing urban decay, \n     inadequate health care systems, persistent poverty, \n     overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, \n     including the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-\n     drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis has \n     again become a leading and growing cause of adult deaths in \n     the developing world.\n       (3) According to the World Health Organization--\n       (A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of \n     tuberculosis-related illnesses;\n       (B) one-third of the world's total population is infected \n     with tuberculosis; and\n       (C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women \n     between 15 and 44 years old and is a leading cause of \n     children becoming orphans.\n       (4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, \n     its international persistence and growth pose a direct public \n     health threat to those nations that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United \n     States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of \n     incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/\n     AIDS.\n       (5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States attributable to foreign-born persons, \n     tuberculosis will never be controlled in the United States \n     until it is controlled abroad.\n       (6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through \n     screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, \n     monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.\n       (7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by \n     several barriers, including--\n       (A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in \n     screening, detecting, and treating the disease;\n       (B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in \n     virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease;\n       (C) the unique circumstances in each country, which \n     requires the development and implementation of country-\n     specific programs; and\n       (D) the risk of having a bad tuberculosis program, which is \n     worse than having no tuberculosis program because it would \n     significantly increase the risk of the development of more \n     widespread drug-resistant strains of the disease.\n       (8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control \n     of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and \n     coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in \n     dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by \n     the disease.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION, TREATMENT, \n                   CONTROL, AND ELIMINATION.\n\n       Section 104(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151b(c)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(4)(A) Congress recognizes the growing international \n     problem of tuberculosis and the impact its continued \n     existence has on those nations that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. Congress further recognizes that the \n     means exist to control and treat tuberculosis, and that it is \n     therefore a major objective of the foreign assistance program \n     to control the disease. To this end, Congress expects the \n     agency primarily responsible for administering this part--\n       ``(i) to coordinate with the World Health Organization, the \n     Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of \n     Health, and other organizations toward the development and \n     implementation of a comprehensive tuberculosis control \n     program; and\n       ``(ii) to set as a goal the detection of at least 70 \n     percent of the cases of infectious tuberculosis, and the cure \n     of at least 85 percent of the cases detected, in those \n     countries in which the agency has established development \n     programs, by December 31, 2010.\n       ``(B) There are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     President, $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 to be used to \n     carry out this paragraph. Funds appropriated under this \n     subparagraph are authorized to remain available until \n     expended.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Thoracic Society,\n\n                                                   August 4, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the American Lung \n     Association and its medical section, the American Thoracic \n     Society, I want to express our strong support for your \n     legislation, the International Tuberculosis Control Act 1999. \n     This bill will provide needed resources to combat the threat \n     that tuberculosis poses the world and to the United States.\n       The American Lung Association was founded in 1904 as the \n     National Association for the Study of Prevention of \n     Tuberculosis.\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\n     While the American Lung Associations and its medical section, \n     the American Thoracic Society has made steady progress over \n     the past 90 years, much has changed in the area of U.S. \n     tuberculosis control. The two biggest changes have been the \n     development of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and the \n     growth of foreign-born cases of TB in the U.S.\n       Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of \n     tuberculosis that is resistant to two or more of the primary \n     drugs used to treat TB. A strain of MDR-TB develops when a \n     case of a drug susceptible TB is improperly treated. MDR-TB \n     is more expensive to treat and more likely to kill. MDR-TB is \n     on the rise, both in the U.S., and throughout the world. \n     Unless we quickly develop and implement an effective global \n     response to TB, deadly strains of MDR-TB will continue to \n     spread.\n       Tuberculosis will kill almost two million people this year. \n     Eight million people will become sick with the disease. Today \n     nearly 40% of TB cases in the U.S. are in foreign-born \n     individuals. We can't stop TB from entering the country. But \n     through our continued support of global TB programs we can \n     reduce the impact of the disease around the world and at \n     home.\n       The U.S. Agency for International Development has taken \n     initial steps towards coordinating an international response \n     to the global TB epidemic. Your legislation will provide the \n     U.S. Agency for International Development the resources \n     needed to plan and implement a cooperative global TB control \n     strategy. With direction from Congress and your leadership we \n     are confident that U.S. can lead the way to controlling TB \n     globally.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Fran DuMelle,\n     Deputy Managing Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Princeton Project 55 Inc.,\n\n                                      Tuberculosis Initiative,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1999.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, The Princeton Project 55 Tuberculosis \n     Initiative (TBI) would like to express its support for your \n     sponsorship of the ``International Tuberculosis Control Act \n     of 1999,'' aimed at increasing funding for international TB \n     control. At a time when funding for tuberculosis is severely \n     inadequate, it is important that additional monies be \n     allocated to fight the world's second leading infectious \n     disease killer.\n       The TBI commends your leadership in calling attention to \n     the TB threat and your work to increase funding for the \n     international fight against tuberculosis. In order to control \n     TB within the United States, it is crucial that we control TB \n     internationally.\n       As you know, although TB is an easily preventable and 100% \n     curable disease, over one third of the world's population is \n     infected with TB and many international TB control programs \n     are poorly managed and underfunded. It has been proven that \n     TB treatment is cost-effective and saves both money and \n     lives. Yet only 16% of TB patients receive the recommended \n     Directly Observed Therapy (DOTS) regimen. The risk of multi-\n     drug resistant TB, a strain of TB that is often incurable, \n     has become more widespread as a result of the poorly \n     organized TB control programs.\n       Your bill's proposed $60 million for U.S. Agency for \n     International Development (USAID) to support tuberculosis \n     control would expand funding to develop country-specific \n     plans for TB control programs for nations with the highest \n     prevalence of TB. Many of these nations face major barriers \n     to effective TB control programs, including lack of funds, \n     trained personnel, and drug supply. The $60 million would \n     also increase support to develop an integrated global \n     tuberculosis control program in coordination with Centers for \n     Disease Control (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), \n     World Health Organization (WHO), and private voluntary \n     organizations.\n       The Princeton Project 55 Tuberculosis Initiative has worked \n     tirelessly with you and other health organizations to \n     increase awareness of the need for increased international \n     tuberculosis funding. Your bill aims to control TB \n     internationally now, before the problem is uncontrollable. \n     The bill also brings needed attention to an often forgotten \n     disease.\n       The TBI congratulates your efforts to fight TB and looks \n     forward to working with you in the future, to ensure the \n     passage of your TB bill in the coming legislative session.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gordon Douglas,\n                                                  Project Manager.\n                                                      Ralph Nader,\n     Steering Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Global Health Council,\n\n                                                   August 4, 1999.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     112 Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Boxer. On behalf of the Global Health Council, \n     a private, not-for-profit membership organization consisting \n     of over 2000 individual and organizational members world-\n     wide, I would like to thank you for your support and \n     leadership on the issue of tuberculosis control. Your bill, \n     the ``International Tuberculosis Control Act of 1999,'' is an \n     important step in the prevention of and fight against \n     tuberculosis.\n       I would especially like to commend you on your recognition \n     of the increase of tuberculosis internationally and the \n     problem of the development of multiple drug resistant strains \n     of the disease. World wide, more people die of tuberculosis \n     than at any other time in our history--between two to three \n     million deaths per year. Projections indicate that left \n     unchecked, the death toll for this disease could reach as \n     high as 30 million in the next decade.\n       The problem of Multiple Drug Resistant Tuberculosis--100 \n     times more expensive to treat--is emerging in communities \n     around the world. Inappropriate treatment regimens, self-\n     medication, the proliferation of inferior drugs, and \n     interruptions in patient treatment all give TB the \n     opportunity to become resistant to one or more drugs over \n     times, making the disease more expensive and difficult to \n     cure.\n       As we move towards a global economy--economic trade policy, \n     improved transportation and tourism, voluntary and forced \n     migration have collectively changed the pattern and spread of \n     infectious diseases. Last year, more than 19,000 people came \n     down with this disease in the U.S.--more than 4,000 in \n     California.\n       A 1998 General Accounting report highlights the new \n     reality: the world now has tools and the know-how to vastly \n     improve the health of the four billion humans living in \n     poverty in the developing world. It also makes clear that \n     there are enormous benefits to the American people, both in \n     terms of health and of economics that will come from \n     improving the health of others.\n       Your legislation is another step towards achieving this new \n     reality. It sets achievable goals that will work to control \n     the threat of tuberculosis in our nation and in our world. \n     Thank you again for your commitment to this cause. we look \n     forward to working with you to assure global health for all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Nils Daulaire, MD, MPH,\n     President & CEO\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n     RESULTS hails Senator Boxer's Efforts to Control TB's Spread: \n  Tuberculosis is on the rise around the world--killing as many as 2 \n                       million people each year.\n\n       Washington, D.C.--Senator Boxer (D-CA), along with Senator \n     Smith (R-OR) and Senator Lautenberg (D-NJ) introduced \n     legislation today which would control the growing problem of \n     tuberculosis internationally. The bill calls for the \n     investment of $60 million next year to jump-start \n     tuberculosis control programs in some of the countries of the \n     world with the highest TB rates.\n       Senator Barbara Boxer, a leading health advocate in \n     Congress, is also a member of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee. Her bill sets out to address the fact that despite \n     the existence of an extremely cost-effective TB treatment \n     (according to the World Bank, an investment of between $20-\n     $100 can save a life), only 16 percent of those with active \n     TB, actually have access to it.\n       The fact that millions of victims are not being treated for \n     TB, combined with its highly infectious nature, has resulted \n     in two million people dying every year from this disease. TB \n     kills more women than any cause of maternal mortality and is \n     the biggest killer of people with AIDS. In addition, with the \n     rise in global travel and with forty percent of TB cases here \n     in the United States attributable to foreign born persons, \n     tuberculosis will never be eliminated in this country until \n     it is controlled worldwide. Multi drug resistant TB, the \n     result of poor treatment programs, threaten to render this \n     disease incurable unless we act now.\n       RESULTS Executive Director, Lynn McMullen, praised Boxer \n     for her leadership. ``Thanks to the efforts of Senator Boxer \n     and her colleagues, TB will not be allowed to spread \n     unchecked around the world. Her commitment to controlling \n     this plague will mean millions of lives saved.''\n       RESULTS is a citizens grassroots advocacy organization \n     which works to end hunger and the worst aspects of poverty.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Boxer in introducing this legislation to help control a deadly \nand easily communicable disease--tuberculosis (TB). I, like many of \nyou, thought we had this scourge under control since the development of \nantibiotics more than 40 years ago.\n  However, TB is a real problem here and abroad. It is a disease that \nknows no borders--because of the ease of transmission of TB, its growth \nabroad poses a real public health threat to nations like the United \nStates that had previously controlled TB.\n  Our bill will authorize $60 million in FY 2001 to help control this \ndeadly disease. This bill calls for a coordinated effort to wipe out \nthis disease and sets goals for the detection and cure.\n  The statistics surrounding tuberculosis are terrifying. TB kills \nalmost 2 million people abroad every year. The rate of infection abroad \nis increasing each year and TB is transmitted as easily as the common \ncold. Every second someone is infected with TB. Further, TB is the \nleading killer of women, more than any single cause of maternal\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\nmortality. This has an enormous impact on families and the very social \nfabric of a society. TB is the leading cause of death among HIV-\npositive individuals. It accounts for almost one-third of AIDS deaths \nworldwide.\n  Many TB cases are easily treatable by a six-month antibiotic regimen. \nTragically, this regimen is only used in 15% of TB cases worldwide. An \nuntreated person with active TB will infect 10-15 people per year. TB \ncontrol programs are underfunded and poorly organized in many \ncountries. Since millions of people travel between the U.S. and other \nnations daily, we must develop stable country-specific programs that \nwill control this disease.\n  I believe that our bill is a good strong step towards ending TB here \nand abroad and I look forward to working with my colleague from \nCalifornia on this legislation. I ask all my colleagues in the Senate \nto support his important legislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise as a proud cosponsor of \nlegislation the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, is introducing \ntoday, the ``International Tuberculosis Act of 1999.'' This bill seeks \nto control the growing international problem of tuberculosis.\n  Mr. President, we cannot stand idly by while tuberculosis kills more \npeople worldwide than AIDS and malaria combined, and yet still receives \nsubstantially less attention and aid dollars.\n  Although the introduction of antibiotics in the 1950's led to the \nnear eradication of tuberculosis, it still plagues many nations \nthroughout the world. In 1993 the World Health Organization declared \ntuberculosis to be a public health emergency, with an estimated 1,700 \nmillion people, or nearly one third of the world's population, infected \nwith the tubercle bacillus. The World Health Organization estimates \nthat eight million people get TB every year, and an estimated 3 million \ndie from the disease annually.\n  Mr. President, the registered number of new cases of TB worldwide \nroughly correlates with economic conditions: the highest incidences are \nseen in those countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America with the \nlowest gross national products. We must now face the realization that \nwithout much needed aid, most of the countries with a high burden of TB \nwill not be able to reach the targets for TB control established by the \nWorld Health Assembly for the year 2000. In human terms, this means \nthat each year millions of lives could be lost due to a preventable and \ncurable disease.\n  Thankfully, Mr. President, efforts to combat this terrible disease \nhave been largely successful inside U.S. borders. In my own State of \nNew Jersey, the number of people with active tuberculosis has declined \neach year for the past six years. But the problem still persists. Each \nyear over 25,000 people in the United States contract TB. The treat of \ninfection here in America still looms large for anyone who travels \nabroad or comes into contact with those who have recently traveled \noutside the United States. This disease does not discriminate: People \nof all ages, all nationalities and all incomes can get tuberculosis.\n  An airborne disease that can be spread through a simple cough, TB can \nbe carried around the world in a matter of hours on a transcontinental \nflight. Nearly 40 percent of TB cases in the U.S. are attributable to \nforeign-born persons. Until TB is eradicated worldwide, no person--no \nAmerican--will ever be safe from its affliction.\n  Only small steps have been taken to eradicate TB outside the United \nStates. Medical experts estimate that over $1 billion is necessary to \ncontrol TB. This money will allow scientists and doctors to take the \nnecessary steps to wipe out this disease, much like the world community \nhas already done with malaria and small pox. The longer we wait, the \nlarger the TB population will be. This translates into higher costs to \neradicate this debilitating disease. International organizations note \nthat for every dollar spent on prevention, a nation saves between three \nand four dollars in treatment.\n  Mr. President, TB control efforts have received approximately $12 \nmillion a year for the last two fiscal years under USAID's Infectious \nDisease Initiative to create a TB Global Action Plan. However, this is \nnot enough; an increase in funding is critical if tuberculosis is to be \nvanquished. The U.S. must do its part.\n  An increase in funding to $60 million for TB would help expedite \nglobal action, and give aid officials the necessary resources to \ndevelop and implement country specific plans for control programs for \nnations with a high prevalence of TB. Once a plan is implemented, it is \nnecessary to formulate a systematic program to avoid increases of drug \nresistant strains of TB.\n  A plan, coordinated with the World Health Organization, the Centers \nfor Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and other \norganizations, will expand and provide a framework for enhanced \ndirection and coordination of worldwide tuberculosis research \nactivities, translate research results into efficient and effective TB \ncontrol practices which are applicable to all environments, and engage \nsociety and government control programs more quickly and widely.\n  The American Lung Association, American Thoracic Society and \nInternational Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and other \nrenowed organizations support an increase in funding for TB prevention.\n  Mr. President, a global TB prevention effort makes sense. The \nbenefits outweigh the costs. Given the importance of a global plan to \neradicate TB, and its potential in saving lives, I urge the Senate to \napprove this bill.\n  Mr. President, tuberculosis is a global problem. We will never \ncontrol TB in this country until we control it worldwide, since \ninfectious diseases do not stop at the border. I commend the Senator \nfrom California for introducing this important and timely legislation \nto address tuberculosis effectively now. I hope and believe this bill \nwill gain the support of the full Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url":

(for Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lott, Mr. Helms, Mr. Graham, \nMr. Mack, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 50\n\n       Whereas freedom of expression and assembly, individual \n     human rights, and pursuit of democratic ideals have been \n     systematically repressed by the government of Iran;\n       Whereas in recent months several members of the press and \n     other individuals who peacefully criticized the policies of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran were assassinated by elements \n     that are now known to have belonged to the Iranian \n     government's security forces;\n       Whereas this continuous repression of freedom has been once \n     more exemplified by the vicious and unjustifiable assault by \n     the government of Iran and its vigilantes on students who \n     marched peacefully and within the law on July 8, 1999, to \n     protest, on the grounds of democracy, freedom of the press, \n     and individual and civil rights, the closure of a reformist \n     newspaper, Salaam;\n       Whereas the Iranian government forces and vigilantes \n     killed, wounded, and incarcerated students and destroyed \n     their dormitories, rooms, and belongings;\n       Whereas the Iranian government now has accused falsely and \n     unjustifiably a number of students and other seekers of \n     democracy and human rights of high crimes, theoretically \n     punishable by death under Iranian law; and\n       Whereas freedom of expression and assembly are fundamental \n     human rights which are recognized as such under the United \n     Nations Declaration of Human Rights: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE REPRESSION OF THE \n                   DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Condemnation.--Congress hereby condemns the repressive \n     actions taken by the Iranian government against the \n     democratic movement of Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Iranian government should respect the fundamental \n     principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights and, thereby, to cease its repression of peaceful \n     dissent and to release unharmed the student leaders and the \n     other pro democracy activists the government continues to \n     detain;\n       (2) the President of the United States should give clear \n     voice to--\n       (A) the abhorrence of the American people for the violence \n     used against the Iranian students and pro-democracy \n     activists; and\n\n[[Page S10243]]\n\n       (B) the solidarity of the United States with the values and \n     objectives that the students and activists have espoused;\n       (3) the European allies of the United States, who maintain \n     political and economic relations with Iran, should convey \n     their own concerns and objections to the Iranian authorities;\n       (4) the Secretary of State should urge the Secretary \n     General of the United Nations to exercise his influence with \n     the Iranian government to secure the release of the student \n     leaders and other pro-democracy activists who are now being \n     detained and whose lives are threatened;\n       (5) the Secretary of State should urge the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Human Rights to convey her concern for \n     the safety of the Iranian student leaders and other pro-\n     democracy activists to the Iranian government and should \n     assist in securing their prompt release; and\n       (6) the United States delegate to the United Nations Sub-\n     Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of \n     Minorities, at its upcoming meeting, should introduce a \n     resolution calling for the release of the Iranian student \n     leaders and other pro-democracy activists and the termination \n     of repressive actions against the nonviolent and democratic \n     student movement of Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10243-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 172--TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE \n             TO ADDRESS THE CULTURAL CRISIS FACING AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Lott, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \nCraig) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works should review the findings of \n     the EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on MTBE and other relevant \n     scientific studies, hold comprehensive hearings, and report \n     to the senate at the earliest possible date any legislation \n     necessary to address the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon \n     Panel.''\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.  . (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) The Clean Air Act requires that federal reformulated \n     gasoline contain oxygen as a means of achieving air quality \n     benefits.\n       (2) While both renewable ethanol and MTBE may be used to \n     meet this Clean Air Act requirement, MTBE is in substantially \n     greater use than ethanol.\n       (3) MTBE is classified as a possible human carcinogen, and \n     when leaked into water causes water to take on the taste and \n     smell of turpentine, rendering it undrinkable.\n       (4) MTBE leaking from underground fuel storage tanks, \n     recreational watercraft and abandoned automobiles has led to \n     growing detections of MTBE in drinking water, and has \n     contaminated groundwater and drinking water throughout the \n     United States.\n       (5) Approximately five to ten percent of drinking water \n     supplies in areas using reformulated gasoline now show \n     detectable levels of MTBE.\n       (6) MTBE poses a more pervasive threat to drinking water \n     than the other harmful constituents of gasoline because MTBE \n     is more soluble, more mobile and slower to degrade than those \n     other constituents.\n       (7) Renewable ethanol provides air quality and energy \n     security benefits without raising drinking water concerns.\n       (8) A substantial increase in renewable ethanol production \n     would enhance the energy security of the United States by \n     reducing dependence upon foreign oil.\n       (9) A substantial increase in renewable ethanol production \n     would help alleviate the financial crisis facing farmers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should--\n       (1) phase out MTBE in order to address the threats MTBE \n     poses to public health and the environment;\n       (2) promote renewable ethanol to replace MTBE as a means of \n     enhancing energy security and supporting the farm economy;\n       (3) provide assistance to state and local governments to \n     treat drinking water supplies contaminated with MTBE;\n       (4) provide assistance to state and local governments to \n     protect lakes and reservoirs from MTBE contamination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      THURMOND AMENDMENT NO. 1523\n\n  Mr. THURMOND proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1233, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 51, line 13, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``, or alcoholic beverages, including wine''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ABRAHAM AMENDMENTS NOS. 1524-1525\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN (for Mr. Abraham) proposed two amendments to the bill, S. \n1233, supra as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 1524\n\n       On page 13, line 13, strike ``$54,276,000'' and insert \n     ``$54,476,000''.

Mr. President, during the week of August 30-\nSeptember 3 we will celebrate Occupational and Environmental Health and \nSafety Week. As a strong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives \nto strengthen our safety and environmental laws and protect our workers \nand citizens, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few \nmoments to reflect on and bring greater awareness of workplace and \ncommunity health and safety issues to the public.\n  Occupational and Environmental Health and Safety Week is sponsored by \nthe American Industrial Hygiene Association. This is the first annual \ncelebration of this event and the goal is to highlight workplace and \ncommunity health issues. This year's theme, ``Protecting Your Future . \n. . Today,'' shows the far-reaching nature of occupational and \nenvironmental safety's impact on the public.\n  One of the major issues concerning workplace safety is Ergonomics. \nErgonomics is the science of fitting the job to the worker. It is the \nsolution to a host of physical problems brought about by over-exertion \nor repetitive stress. More than 650,000 Americans suffer serious \ninjuries and illnesses due to work-related musculoskeletal disorders \neach year, accounting for more than 34 percent of all lost-workday \ninjuries and illnesses, and costing employers $15-20 billion annually \nin direct workers' compensation costs.\n  There is sound scientific evidence linking musculoskeletal disorders \n(MSDs) to work. Last summer, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) \nfound ``compelling evidence'' that workplace modifications can reduce \nthe risk of injury. A 1997 review of 600 studies by the National \nInstitute of Occupational Safety and Health drew similar conclusions. \nFor the average worker, the back takes the brunt of the injuries. About \n4 out of 10 injuries involve strains and sprains, most of them back-\nrelated. The Department of Labor recently reported that injuries and \nillnesses for construction laborers, carpenters, welders and cutters \nincreased by a total of 8,000 cases. Additionally, truck drivers suffer \nmore than their share of injuries, including approximately 145,000 \nwork-related injuries or illnesses each year.\n  Although many injuries occur in the workplace, our concern does not \nend there. OEHS Week's second important emphasis is safety in the \ncommunity and home. Protecting and improving our environment, our parks \nand wildlife refuges, and natural resources have been among my highest \npriorities since I was first elected to the Congress. I have fought \nfor, and helped enact, every major piece of legislation to enhance \nenvironmental quality--the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, and Superfund, to name a few. OEHS Week is \ndesigned to heighten awareness about several vital community health \nconcerns including carbon monoxide poisoning, indoor air quality, and \nnoise exposure.\n  In my view, a clean environment is a legacy we leave for future \ngenerations. After all, our natural resources--our farmlands and \nforests, water, air, and our wildlife--are the foundation of our \ncountry's present and future well-being and quality of life. We are \nmaking progress in the effort to clean up the Chesapeake Bay--our \nnation's largest and most productive estuary. But much more work needs \nto be done to revitalize this national treasure and I have introduced \nlegislation to amend the Federal Water Pollution Act to assist in the \nrestoration of the Chesapeake Bay. Additionally, I have introduced a \nbill to implement pilot projects in Maryland, Virginia, and North \nCarolina to address problems associated with toxic microorganisms in \ntidal and non-tidal wetlands and waters.\n  As we approach over 100 years of celebrating Labor Day, it is \nappropriate that we focus our attention on the safety of workers while \nin a workplace environment and on their safety and environmental \nconcerns while away from the job site. This 1st annual Occupational and \nEnvironmental Health and Safety Week truly represents a\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\nspotlight on the total quality of life of working Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10261-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VERMONT HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am honored to congratulate the \nVermont Housing Finance Agency on its 25th Anniversary of providing \nVermonters with access to safe, decent and affordable housing.\n  In 1974, the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, VHFA, was established to \nensure that Vermonters of a variety of different backgrounds have \naccess to affordable housing. Over many years of finding innovative \nways to finance and stimulate the preservation and development of \naffordable housing, VHFA has multiplied the number of home ownership \nopportunities in Vermont many times over. This dedication to \naggressively and compassionately provide affordable housing \nopportunities ensures that today's neediest Vermont families need not \ngo without shelter.\n  As a Senator one of my highest priorities is to help secure for \nVermont's low and moderate income families a home they can afford. We \nall know that having a home is a critical foundation to achieving \nsuccess. Every year VHFA helps Vermonters build this foundation by \nmaking financing possible for thousands of Vermonters to purchase \nhundreds of dwellings. Over the years, VHFA has worked with private \nlenders, real estate professionals, builders, developers and nonprofit \norganizations throughout the state to get the job done. This dynamic \napproach to home financing has brought about dozens of healthy and safe \nVermont communities where residents thrive and communities grow. The \nprofessionalism, reliability, and accomplishments of the staff at VHFA \nare unsurpassed.\n  I commend the Vermont Housing Finance Agency for its outstanding \ncontribution and dedication to improving the quality of life for so \nmany Vermonters. VHFA has my sincerest thanks and unending respect for \nits 25 years of commitment to Vermont and her people. I am both proud \nand honored to represent such an accomplished group of individuals in \nWashington as they are a national model for how to provide affordable, \nquality housing opportunities for those in need. As they celebrate \ntheir 25th anniversary at the end of this month in Vermont, the VHFA \nstaff, past and present, should be proud that their leadership and \ncontinued perseverance will help ensure that every Vermonter has a \nplace to call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10261-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THE EMTER FAMILY\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to take note of the \nsuperb performances given yesterday by the Emter family of Glen Ullin, \nNorth Dakota, on the Capitol lawn and later at the Kennedy Center. The \nEmters were here in Washington as part of the Millennium Series being \nsponsored by the Kennedy Center. When the Kennedy Center asked me to \nmake a recommendation of a group from North Dakota that might exhibit \nsome of the cultural heritage of my state, the Emter family was a \nnatural and immediate choice.\n  One obvious reason was their outstanding musical accomplishment. The \nEmters are button accordionists. Mr. President, the button accordion is \na unique instrument, brought to America by settlers from Austria at the \nturn of the 20th century. Button accordions have been in this country \nfor nearly 100 years, and have helped make polka one of America's most \nloved traditional dances. In North Dakota even today you'd be hard \npressed to find a wedding reception or barn dance where a polka wasn't \nplayed and the entire room doesn't pour onto the dance floor. Accordion \nmusic may not have the popular following that it did before the advent \nof rock and roll, but its lyrical and nostalgic flavor still tugs at \nthe heartstrings of this Senator and many other folks of my generation \nwho grew up watching our parents polka the night away across the \nAmerican Legion Hall dance floor, at Ted Strand's barn or at Hardmeyer \nHall.\n  The Emter Family--parents Renae and Roger (who met at a polka dance), \n18 year old son Adam, and three daughters Angelina, 16; Alida, 15; and \nAbigail, 13--has performed all over North America, from county fairs, \nchurch functions and Oktoberfests to national television and radio \nappearances. They have taken top honors at a number of international \nbutton accordion competitions. They are truly accomplished.\n  I have to tell you though, Mr. President, that it isn't just for \ntheir musical achievement that the Emter Family deserves our \nrecognition and honor today. That's because this is a great family. \nTheir presence on stage tells you this, the way they interact with one \nanother and everyone around them tells you this, the message in their \nmusic tell you this. They are good people that exemplify the steadfast, \npositive attitude of the vast majority of rural America's families. \nThey live in Glen Ullin, in southwestern North Dakota, a part of the \nstate that has seen one of the most significant decrease in population. \nTimes are desperate for many families in this region of my state, along \nwith rural areas in most of our farm states. These people have every \nreason in the world to lose faith, to have negative attitudes, to let \nfrustration get the best of them and give up. None of us could fault \nthem for that. But, Mr. President, most of these families don't \ndespair. They look forward, they continue to work incredibly hard, they \nstill pack the American Legion Hall to dance the polka once and awhile. \nThe Emters are a symbol of hope in these areas of our country, Mr. \nPresident, and I want to thank them for sharing that hope with us \nyesterday through their music and their presence in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10261-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10261-S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JIM BATTIN COURTHOUSE\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one \nof Montana's greatest citizens, the Honorable James F. Battin, Sr. Jim \nBattin was born in Wichita, Kansas, and at the age of four, moved to \nBillings, Montana, where he was raised. After graduating from high \nschool, he served for three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II, \nspending most of that time in the Pacific theater. Following the war, \nJim returned home to continue his education, graduating first from \nEastern Montana College in Billings and later receiving his J.D. from \nGeorge Washington University. He continued his career in public service \nas a city attorney in Billings, and in 1958, he was elected to the \nMontana state legislature. Only two years later, he successfully ran \nfor a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he was quickly \nassigned seats on the House Committee on Committees, as well as Ways \nand Means, two very prestigious seats for a freshman member of \nCongress. Jim later served on the House Foreign Relations and Judiciary \nCommittees, and was ultimately elected five times by the people of his \ndistrict, which then covered the eastern half of the state of Montana. \nDuring his congressional career, which lasted from 1961 to 1969, \nCongressman Battin played an instrumental role in a good deal of \nlegislation, including the bill which created Montana's Bob Marshall \nWilderness Area, at the time the largest wildlife area in the United \nStates. Jim also served as one of two U.S. Congressional \nRepresentatives to the Inter-Governmental Committee on European \nMigration, which met in Geneva. This group helped individuals who were \nexpelled from behind the Iron Curtain to re-establish businesses in \nother countries, or to find work in other occupations. In 1968, \nCongressman Battin was President Nixon's representative to the Platform \nCommittee at the Republican National Committee, and shortly thereafter, \nin early 1969, he became President Nixon's first judicial appointment. \nHe served as a U.S. district judge for the district of Montana for 27 \nyears, becoming its Chief Judge in 1978. During his time on the bench, \nJudge Battin issued key rulings affecting the lives of Montana \ncitizens, among them his ruling which preserved access to the Bighorn \nRiver for people throughout the state, and his creation of the \nprecedent for the now universally accepted six-man federal jury in \ncivil cases. A dedicated and hard working man, James F. Battin Sr. \nremained on the bench until his passing in the autumn of 1996.\n  It was with these facts in mind, Mr. President, that led to my \nsupport of H.R. 158, a bill which would designate the United States \ncourthouse located at 316 North 26th Street in Billings,\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\nMontana, as the ``James F. Battin United States Courthouse''. Congress \npassed H.R. 158 earlier this year, and it was signed into law by the \nPresident on April 5th, 1999, as Public Law 106-11. I believe that the \nrenaming of this courthouse, which Judge Battin presided over for so \nlong, is the most fitting tribute that the United States Congress and \nthe people of Montana can pay to this great man, whose outstanding \ncareer in public service spanned over 40 years. Come next Monday, when \nthis building is officially rechristened with its new name, I think all \nof us should take a moment to tip our hats in thanks to Judge Battin \nfor a job well-done. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10262-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT TOBIAS\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Robert \nTobias, a man who has shown untiring commitment to the concerns of \nFederal employees. Recently I had the opportunity to attend one of the \nreceptions in his honor hosted by the many Federal employees he has \nrepresented and led so effectively.\n  Mr. Tobias, who is retiring after four terms as president of the \nNational Treasury Employees Union, NTEU, has proven his dedication to \nthe fair treatment, professional development and quality of life for \nFederal workers time and time again. During his 31 years of service, \nthe organization has grown to the point that it now represents over \n155,000 men and women who serve our Federal Government. For the past 16 \nyears, Mr. Tobias led the NTEU, spearheading initiatives to ensure fair \nworkplace policies for Federal workers and pursuing effective labor-\nmanagement policies for more efficient service from Federal agencies. \nBut perhaps most importantly, he's championed family friendly policies \nto help our outstanding Federal workers continue to meet demands and \nincrease productivity. These innovations include implementing \nalternative work schedules and negotiating child care facilities for \nbusy Federal families.\n  Because of his outstanding reputation, he's won many awards and \nappointments, most notably his appointment to the National Partnership \nCouncil and the Commission to Restructure the IRS among them. Under his \nleadership, he's ensured that Federal employees are included in the \nmany decisions to help Federal agencies run more efficiently and that \nthey are publicly recognized for all the hard work they perform.\n  Robert Tobias leaves an indelible mark on the Federal workplace by \nthe hard work he has done on behalf of NTEU--indeed, the nation--and we \nare indebted to him for his service. I wish him continued success as he \nmoves on to teaching and writing, knowing we can still rely on his \nvoice and experience when it comes to the critical needs of Federal \nemployees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10262-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF THE FEDERAL WAY SCHOOL DISTRICT'S INTERNET ACADEMY\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, when I began my Innovation in \nEducation Award Program earlier this year, I endeavored to find and \nrecognize programs, schools, and individuals whose work in improving \neducation deserves recognition. The Federal Way School District's \nInternet Academy is just such a program and one which I am proud to \npresent with my Innovation in Education Award.\n  The Internet Academy is the brain child of recently departed \nSuperintendent Tom Vander Ark, who is widely credited with injecting \nnew life into the Federal Way District. The Academy has a standards-\nbased curriculum that provides a comprehensive course of study designed \nto meet state guidelines and instructional objectives. What is \ninnovative, however, is the way in which the Academy engages students \nunder the continuous guidance of state accredited teachers. The Academy \noffers a full range of courses for school credit, via the Internet, for \ngrades K-12. The program was created only 3 years ago as a pilot K-8 \nprogram and has expanded significantly since then. In June of 1998 it \nhad 65 enrollees--by June of 1999 it had expanded to over 800.\n  As our society's use of technology has increased, it is important \nthat our public education system keep abreast of such transformation \nand provide opportunities using technology to encourage student \nlearning. By offering an interactive curriculum that is accessible 24 \nhours a day, 365 days a year, the district's Academy is ensuring that \nstudents are given maximum opportunity to access a good education.\n  Today's best instructional technologies can enhance the learning \nenvironment by eliminating the time and space boundaries present with \nthe traditional classroom. This alternative learning environment also \nallows for an increasingly active role for families in the education of \nour children. It is a common-sense proposition that increased parental \ninvolvement promotes a richer educational process. This aspect of \nlearning is especially critical for home-schoolers in search of \ninstruction for specific topics or seeking to tap into the resources of \nthe public education system.\n  The parent of one home-schooled child noted: ``Home-school can be \nreally challenging sometimes. It is great to have a resource like the \nInternet Academy for my son.''\n  Meanwhile, a 10th grade student said: ``I like the Internet Academy \nbecause I can work at my own pace. The on-line curriculum gives me a \nbetter understanding than what I can get in a classroom with 30 other \nstudents. The approach allows me to explore areas that interest me \nwhile completing the course work.''\n  I have heard from many educators that they sometimes struggle to \nmaintain the interest and energy of their students. The Federal Way \nSchool District, through its Internet Academy, has shown that creative \nmeans to keep students engaged in today's multi-media environment are \nnot only possible but, can be highly successful.\n  Our economy, powered in large part by a strong hi-tech sector, has \nachieved an impressive record of growth in recent months and it stands \nto reason that creatively injecting hi-tech tools into our education \nsystem can have equally rewarding results. I applaud the Federal Way \nSchool District's vision in establishing the Internet Academy, I \nendorse their efforts to ensure that students are given every possible \nopportunity to access and learn from our public education system. I \nhope my colleagues will join in my recognizing the Internet Academy's \ninnovative work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10262-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10262-S10263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAT THOMAS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Vermonter, Patricia Thomas, formerly the President and \nChief Executive Officer of the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) of \nChittenden and Grand Isle Counties. Pat's commitment to improving the \nhealth status of Vermonters serves as a model to us all. She is, and \nwill remain, a stunning example of how one person can positively affect \nso many.\n  Pat has served Vermont in a variety of capacities. As a teacher and \ncollege administrator, as a government official and director of \nVermont's largest United Way, and on various boards and commissions, \nPat always strived to improve the quality of life here in Vermont. Most \nrecently, she served the people of Vermont at the helm of our State's \nlargest VNA. It is this role that I wish to elaborate upon today before \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Throughout Pat's 7-year tenure at the VNA, her leadership was \ninstrumental in sustaining Vermont's unique, nonprofit home health care \nsystem, while maintaining its high-quality, cost-effective service. \nIronically, when this nationally renowned system was severely \nchallenged by an unintended consequence of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, Pat's advocacy easily convinced me and other lawmakers that \ncorrective action was essential. With such an impressive track record \nand with so many Vermonters relying on her agency's care, it was an \neasy argument to both make and adopt. Certainly, being a key member of \nmy Health Care Advisory Board, there have been numerous occasions when \nI have relied on Pat's wise counsel, but none was more critical than \nduring the last year's debate. Vermonters were fortunate to have such \nan advocate and leader in Pat Thomas.\n  In addition to being an effective advocate on the Federal level, Pat \nled her VNA through a dynamic and critical\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\ntime in its history. During Pat's tenure, her agency more than doubled \nin size, successfully completed a massive capital campaign, purchased \nand renovated its current headquarters, and significantly diversified \nits services. Vermont Respite House, home psychiatric care, specialized \nhome therapies, home infusion, palliative care and wellness programs \nwere all added to the plethora of VNA services on Pat's watch. Other \nmajor services include their Adult Day and Hospice Programs and \nMaternal Child Health Services. Pat knew that these changes were \nnecessary if her agency was to adequately reflect and meet the evolving \nneeds of Vermonters. Her vision and leadership helped her agency do \nexactly that, with resounding success.\n  Vermont has much to be grateful for when it comes to Pat's steadfast \ncommitment to improving the quality of life in our small state. \nAlthough her tenure at the VNA has ended, we will forever remain the \nbeneficiaries of her expertise, vision and leadership on those issues \nshe has been so ably, and passionately committed to. In her own words, \n``our house is in order and the agency is incredibly sound, despite an \never changing and challenging health care environment''. Vermont has \nPat Thomas to thank for this. We wish her well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10263-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, an individual has filed two pro se civil \nactions in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia against two Senate Committees. In the first suit, against the \nSenate Committee on Armed Services, the plaintiff alleges that he was \nwrongfully denied a commission in the Navy and documentation of a prior \nhonorable discharge from the Army Reserve. He has sued the Armed \nServices Committee because, in his view, the Committee failed to take \nsufficient steps to rectify these errors after he brought them to the \nCommittee's attention.\n  The second complaint alleges that the Judiciary Committee failed to \ntake appropriate action when the plaintiff, in correspondence with the \nCommittee, accused a federal judge and state and federal law \nenforcement officers of malfeasance.\n  These resolutions authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the \nCommittees in these suits to move for their dismissal.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent the resolutions be agreed to, \nthe preambles be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, any statements relating to the resolutions appear in the Record, \nwith the preceding all occurring en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 173) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 173\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Philip Tinsley III v, Senate \n     Committee on Armed Services, Civil Action No. 99-951-A, \n     pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern \n     District of Virginia, the plaintiff has been used the United \n     States Senate Committee on Armed Services;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C.

Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is directed to \n     represent the Senate Committee on Armed Services in the case \n     of Philip Tinsley III v.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur in the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today approved \nlegislation that gives a Congressional ``stamp of approval'' to a \nsettlement that the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin has long \nawaited. In my opinion, in the opinion of the U.S. Court of Claims that \napproved this settlement last year, and in the opinion of Wisconsin \nleaders like Governor Tommy Thompson and former Congressman Melvin \nLaird, this is a settlement that is long overdue.\n  As part of S. 606, the Menominee Tribal Fairness Act is the final \nstep in a ``Legislative Reference'' that settles a 45-year-old case \nbetween the Tribe and the Federal Government once and for all. In the \n1950s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs mismanaged the Tribe's assets such \nas their forests and mills, leaving them ill-prepared to be self-\nsufficient. However, in the 1960s, Congress terminated the Tribe's \nfederal trust status, and the Tribe plunged into years of service \nimpoverishment and community turmoil.\n  Then in the 1970s, the Government recognized its mistake in these \nactions and restored the Menominee Tribe's federal trust status. \nClearly, though, the decades of damage could threaten the Tribe for \ngenerations to come, so the Tribe went to court seeking compensation \nfor the devastation it had endured.\n  After winning at trial court, this case was dismissed on technical \ngrounds at the appellate court in 1984. The Tribe then came to Congress \nfor help, and we passed a ``Legislative Reference'' asking the Courts \nto decide the merits of this case and determine what, if any, \ncompensation was due. Before this case again headed to trial, the \nDepartment of Justice settled with the Tribe, agreeing to a sum of \n$32,052,547. The U.S. Court of Claims endorsed this settlement last \nsummer. Now, as the final step in this process, Congress has approved \nthe payment of this settlement--and from the Treasury Department's \nalready existing ``judgment fund,'' not through a new appropriation--to \nfinally resolve this case after 45 years.\n  This decades-old case is a perfect example of how the ``Legislative \nReference'' procedure should be used: the court examines claims against \nthe United States based on negligence or fault, or based on less than \nfair and honorable dealings, regardless of ``technical'' defenses that \nthe United States may otherwise assert, especially the statute of \nlimitations.\n  In other words, this procedure is to be used for precisely the types \nof circumstances surrounding the Menominee Tribe. The tribe and its \nmembers suffered grievous economic loss through legislative termination \nof its rights and from BIA mismanagement of its resources. Indeed, the \nFederal governments' actions brought the Menominee Tribe to the brink \nof economic, social, and cultural disaster. Although the Tribe was \nrestored to Federal recognition and tribal status by action of the \nCongress, the Tribe and its members have yet to be compensated for the \ndamages they suffered. But thanks to the Senate's actions today, that \nwill change.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this vitally important \n``Legislative Reference'' that will bring closure, once and for all, to \na settlement that is long overdue. I especially want to thank our House \nsponsor, Mark Green, as well as Congressman Sensenbrenner, Congressman \nMcCollum, and Senator Nickles, for all their hard work.\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10263-4", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10263-S10265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RELIEF OF GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, KERR-McGEE \n               CORPORATION, AND KERR-McGEE CHEMICAL, LLC\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

I especially want to thank our House \nsponsor, Mark Green, as well as Congressman Sensenbrenner, Congressman \nMcCollum, and Senator Nickles, for all their hard work.\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10265-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10265-S10266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CEMETERY FOR VETERANS IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to talk about the Senate passage of a bill I introduced that will \nextend the useful life of the Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico. \nI also want to thank Senator Specter for his assistance that helped to \nmake passage of this bill possible.\n  The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces \nhave made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of freedom and \nliberty that make this Nation unique throughout civilization. The \nservice of veterans has been vital to the history of the Nation, and \nthe sacrifices made by veterans and their families should not be \nforgotten.\n  These veterans at the very least deserve every opportunity to be \nburied at a National Cemetery of their choosing. Unfortunately, \nprojections show the Santa Fe National Cemetery will run out of space \nto provide casketed burials for our veterans at the conclusion of 2000. \nHowever, with Senate passage of this bill we have taken an important \nstep to ensure the continued viability of the Santa Fe National \nCemetery.\n  I believe all New Mexicans can be proud of the Santa Fe National \nCemetery that has grown from 39/100 of an acre to its current 77 acres. \nThe cemetery first opened in 1868 and within several years was \ndesignated a National Cemetery in April of 1875.\n  Men and women who have fought in all of our nation's wars hold an \nhonored spot within the hallowed ground of the cemetery. Today the \nSanta Fe National Cemetery contains almost 27,000 graves that are \nmostly marked by upright headstones.\n  The Senate's action today brings us another step closer to ensuring \nthe Santa Fe National Cemetery will not be forced to close. The bill \npassed today allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for \nthe use of flat grave markers that will extend the useful life of the \ncemetery until 2008.\n  While I wish the practice of utilizing headstones could continue \nindefinitely if a veteran chose, my wishes are outweighed by my desire \nto extend the useful life of the cemetery. I would note that my desire \nis shared by the New Mexico Chapter of the American Legion, the \nAlbuquerque Chapter of the Retired Officers' Association, and the New \nMexico Chapter of the VFW who have all endorsed the use of flat grave \nmarkers.\n  Finally, this is not without precedent because exceptions to the law \nhave been granted on six prior occasions with the most recent action \noccurring in 1994 when Congress authorized the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to provide for the flat grave markers at the Willamette \nNational Cemetery in Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator Specter for his \nassistance and state how pleased I am with the Senate passage of this \nimportant bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/04/senate-section/article/S10266-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Executive nominations received by the Senate August 4, 1999:\n\n\n                Export-Import Bank of the United States\n\n       Dan Herman Renberg, of Maryland, to be a Member of the \n     Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United \n     States for a term expiring January 20, 2003, vice Julie D. \n     Belaga, term expired.\n\n\n                              In the NAVY\n\n       THE FOLLOWING NAMED OFFICERS FOR REGULAR APPOINTMENT IN THE \n     GRADES INDICATED IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY UNDER TITLE 10, \n     U.S.C., SECTION 531:\n\n                             To be captain\n\nDAVID M.
