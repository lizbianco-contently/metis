Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Warner, as well as my colleagues \non the committee, Senator Levin, our ranking member, and especially \nSenator Snowe, for their efforts in doing the right thing for our \nMedicare-eligible military retirees.\n  Today, there was introduced in the Senate, on behalf of Senator \nWarner, legislation that will have an extremely positive impact on our \nmilitary retirees and their ability to acquire prescription drugs. This \nis enormously important for our retirees and will be strongly supported \nin this body. Hopefully, it will be a part of the defense authorization \nbill that will come to the floor in the next few weeks.\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\n  This initiative gives all military retirees over 65 the same pharmacy \nbenefit that one-third of them already have under the Base Realignment \nand Closure pharmacy program, a mail order and a retail pharmacy \nbenefit. It makes sense, and is only fair that all military retirees \nover 65 have one consistent pharmacy benefit.\n  This pharmacy benefit is a significant and affordable first step in \nhealing the growing rift with the military retiree community caused by \nthe Government's failure to deliver on the promise of health care for \nlife. The pharmacy benefit is the number one issue and priority of \nmilitary retirees, since pharmacy needs are the biggest drain on the \npensions of military retirees. Expanding the BRAC pharmacy benefit to \nall Medicare-eligible military retirees is the right thing to do for \nservice members who have dedicated their lives to protect and serve our \ncountry.\n  Approximately 450,000 of the 1.3 million Medicare-eligible military \nretirees already have access to a retail and mail order pharmacy \nbenefit. This was the result of DOD base closures. When the Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission recommended the closure of several \nmilitary bases, part of what was lost was access to pharmaceutical \nbenefits for many retired military personnel who were receiving their \nprescription drugs benefits at those facilities. To address their \nneeds, Congress created the BRAC pharmacy benefit which was a mail \norder, as well as a retail benefit, for needed prescriptions.\n  Unfortunately, that benefit only covered about a third of all of \nthose who have retired, so we had a dual system where, by accident of \nwhere you had retired and by the results of the Base Closure \nCommission, some retirees received the benefit and others did not. This \nlegislation would treat military retirees across the country the same.\n  Basically this bill makes prescription drugs accessible and available \nto military retirees over the age of 65, at a very reasonable cost--a \n20 percent co-pay when they acquire the prescription drugs in retail \npharmacy and an $8 co-pay if they buy them through mail order. There is \nno deductible and no enrollment fee. This is recognition that there are \nincredibly important and significant health needs for our retirees. \nThis pharmacy benefit is one that our military retirees richly deserve.\n  The BRAC pharmacy benefit was initiated by the Congress in the Fiscal \nYear 1994 Defense Authorization Act to ensure that Medicare-eligible \nretirees, who depended on the base's medical treatment facilities for \ntheir pharmacy needs, would be taken care of after the base was closed. \nThis benefit includes the mail order pharmacy program for the co-\npayment of $8 for up to a 90-day supply and use of the Tricare retail \nnetwork pharmacies for a 20-percent co-pay for up to a 30-day supply.\n  We ask our armed forces to leave their families, risk their lives, \nfight our wars, help countries ravaged by disasters, and enforce peace \nall over the world. Americans who devote their lives to serving our \ncountry deserve this benefit. It is wrong for pharmacy benefits to be \ntaken away for the sole reason that a retiree has reached the age of \n65.\n  That is what happens at the present time. Once they turn 65, they go \nunder the Medicare system. Under the Medicare system, there are no \nprescription drug benefits, which they had otherwise been receiving, so \nthey are left out in the cold. This initiative lets all military \nretirees know that we have not forgotten them. It lets all of the \nservice members know that if they dedicate their lives to the service \nof our country, we will take care of their health care needs from the \npharmaceutical point of view.\n\n  Again, I express great appreciation to Senator Warner and the \nothers--Senator Thurmond and a number of our colleagues on the \ncommittee--particularly Senator Snowe, who has taken great interest in \nthis prescription drug issue. I think all of us know that the issue of \nprescription drugs is something of enormous concern to the elderly in \nthis country. It was a benefit that was basically excluded from the \ncoverage of Medicare when Medicare was passed in 1965.\n  In 1965, the private companies were trying to make Medicare \neffectively the same kind of benefit package that existed in the \nprivate sector. At that time, very few in the private sector had a \nprescription drug benefit. Today, we see that progress has been made in \nthe private sector. Now, more than 95 percent of the private sector \nplans provide prescription drug coverage, but Medicare doesn't. That is \npart of the great debate that, hopefully, we will have in this body \nbefore we adjourn; that is, are we going to provide prescription drug \nbenefits for our senior citizens?\n  What the Armed Services Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nWarner, has said is that eligible retirees are going to have those \nhealth care needs met, and they do it in a way that makes prescription \ndrugs accessible to them through a mail order and a direct retail \nsystem through Tricare. This is basically a nationwide system with only \na 20-percent co-payment, no enrollment fee, and no deductible, which \nwill make these prescription drugs accessible and affordable for people \nwho are living in retirement in the armed services community.\n  I think this is enormously important. I think it is a great step \nforward. It is in response to the health care needs of men and women \nwho have served this country, and I think it bodes very well for \nCongress as we try to work together to try to find ways of meeting the \nneeds of others who are retired and need these prescription drugs \ndesperately.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank Senator Warner and others for their \nleadership and for this extremely important and significant step. It \nbodes well for this institution, and it is an expression of great \nappreciation to the men and women who have served in the Armed Forces \nof our country. I hope that we can follow this precedent and come to \ngrips with the challenges that exist for the elderly in our Nation, and \nthat we are able to develop a prescription drug benefit for them, too, \nthe way we have been able to do it for military retirees. I think that \nwould be great work by this Congress, and there is very little reason \nthat we cannot do it. We should do it. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to make sure that it is done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CHEN\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Stephen S.F. \nChen, who serves as the head of the Taipei Cultural and Economic \nRepresentative Office in Washington, DC.\n  Ambassador Chen will be retiring from diplomatic service and \nreturning to his home in Taiwan soon. I have come to know Ambassador \nChen well since his appointment in October of 1997, as have many of my \ncolleagues, and hold him in high regard for his unquestioned \nprofessionalism and personal integrity.\n  Ambassador Chen has, for forty years, ably represented his government \nin posts throughout the world. His experience in the United States is \nextensive. During the past twenty-five years Ambassador Chen has served \nin Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Over the years, \nAmbassador Chen has become a friend to numerous Americans, myself \nincluded. It is fitting in many ways that he closes his diplomatic \ncareer here in Washington, among friends.\n  Mr. President, representing the people of Taiwan abroad is a \nchallenge of great magnitude. The people of Taiwan live in an admirably \ndemocratic, free and dynamic community at home. They are significantly \nmore constrained in the international community. Effectively \ncommunicating the interests of Taiwan abroad requires considerable \ndiplomatic skill, patience and resolve. Stephen Chen embodies all these \ntraits.\n  The people of Taiwan could not have had a better Ambassador in \nWashington, D.C., than Stephen Chen. I will certainly miss my good \nfriend when he leaves and know my colleagues will join me in extending \nto him our best wishes and great appreciation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1968 the Congress of the United \nStates passed the Wholesome Poultry Product Act of 1968.\n  A former Congressman from Iowa by the name of Neal Smith--Members of \nthe present Congress will remember--was a person who served the people \nof Iowa very well and spent a considerable amount of time during his \nyears in Congress trying to build consumer confidence in poultry and \nother meats American consumers buy.\n  In 1960, there were 1.8 billion chickens produced in the United \nStates and consumed by the public. In 1998, it was up to 8 billion \nchickens. There has been a very dramatic rise in the consumption of \nchicken by the American consumer, all the more reason to make sure the \nWholesome Poultry Products Act of 1968 is followed.\n\n  There is a dismal picture painted about the inspection of poultry \nslaughterhouses in the United States and some question about whether \nthe meat consumed by the American public is as wholesome as the 1968 \nact intended. This question arises because of a proposal in the \nDepartment of Agriculture to shift some routine Federal inspection from \nFederal inspectors to inspectors hired by the poultry slaughtering \ncompanies. An article was in yesterday's Des Moines Register, by \nRegister Washington reporter George Anthan, who has been reporting on \nthe subject of wholesome inspection of meat by the Department of \nAgriculture for almost his entire journalistic career. George Anthan is \nvery much an authority on both what was intended and the enforcement of \nthat law.\n  Rather than summarizing, I will read what was reported yesterday in \nthe Des Moines Register by George Anthan.\n\n       The Agriculture Department admits consumers may detest \n     chicken or turkey that contains pus from a pneumonia-like \n     disease called air sacculitis.\n       But the condition fails to threaten human health, federal \n     officials say, and the issue of dealing with it can be left \n     largely to the employees of meat processing companies, rather \n     than to federal inspectors.\n       The poultry condition is at the center of a dispute between \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the union that \n     represents federal inspectors over how best to safeguard \n     America's meat.\n\n  A former Iowa Congressman, Neal Smith, says, ``I suppose you could \nsterilize pus and maybe it would not hurt you . . . but the fact is, we \nshould not be eating that kind of stuff.''\n  Continuing the article:\n\n       The Department of Agriculture is implementing a new \n     inspection system that assigns many of the more routine \n     duties now handled by federal inspectors to the companies \n     they regulate. The inspectors, in turn, are supposed to look \n     for systemic problems to prevent disease outbreaks before \n     they happen.\n       But the union maintains the change breaks a sacred trust \n     with American consumers, who see the Department of \n     Agriculture approval as proof that an independent inspector \n     has signed off on the meat they put on their dining room \n     tables.\n       The controversy revolves around the Wholesome Poultry \n     Products Act of 1968.\n       Smith said he ``carefully and deliberately'' included the \n     word ``wholesome'' in the law's title because ``people don't \n     want to eat pus, and scabs, sores and malignant tumors.''\n       Officials at the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety \n     and Inspection Service said that even though inspecting birds \n     for air sacculitis will be the responsibility of the poultry \n     companies, federal inspectors will monitor the process.\n\n  Parenthetically, the question for the consumers in America is whether \nor not they can be satisfied that their food is safe because there is \nsome Federal inspector monitoring it as opposed to Federal inspectors \nactually inspecting it.\n  Continuing the article:\n       They said if the inspectors determine birds with air \n     sacculitis and other defects that don't affect human health \n     are being passed for human consumption, they will notify \n     companies, who are supposed to take corrective actions. ``The \n     only thing an inspector could do under the new system is \n     inform the plant that something is going wrong,'' said \n     Felicia Nestor, a food safety specialist at the Government \n     Accountability Project, a group that supports government \n     whistle-blowers.\n       ``They have no club, especially over the products that \n     already have gone out the door,'' Nestor said. The Department \n     of Agriculture's office of the Inspector General recently \n     interviewed federal inspectors at a Gold Kist, Inc., chicken \n     processing plant at Guntersville, Ala., where the inspection \n     system is being tested.\n       According to the inspector general's March 3 report, \n     federal inspectors at the plant said that before the system \n     was installed ``the inspectors were removing bad products \n     from the lines.''\n       After the new system was implemented, government food \n     inspectors ``were told to stop removing products from the \n     lines,'' according to the report.\n       Spot checks of the Guntersville plant found nine of 60 \n     birds with air sacculitis on Feb. 5 and 20 of 70 birds on \n     Feb. 7. The bad birds had not been removed by company \n     employes ``who had taken the place of (Department of \n     Agriculture) line inspectors,'' the report said.\n       Air sacculitis can fill a bird's respiratory system, body \n     cavity and hollow avian bones with pus and bacteria.\n       While the controversy over air sacculitis involves mainly \n     questions about the wholesomeness of pus-filled chickens and \n     turkeys, the disease also was linked to human health problems \n     at a recent meeting of a Department of Agriculture advisory \n     committee on implementing the new inspection system.\n       Daniel Lafontaine of Columbia, S.C., a veterinarian \n     representing the American Veterinary Medicine Association, \n     said he told agriculture officials at the meeting that \n     ``birds that have air sacculitis may be a wholesomeness issue \n     today and a day or two later these birds may be septicemic.''\n       After the blood stream has been invaded by virulent \n     microorganisms, a chicken or turkey ``is not safe for human \n     consumption,'' said the South Carolina state meat and poultry \n     inspection system.\n       Even if cooked properly, he said, ``pus can get pretty \n     gross. You sure don't want to eat it.''\n       Kenneth Petersen, senior program manager in the Department \n     of Agriculture's food inspection service, said birds with \n     severe air sacculitis are supposed to be condemned by company \n     employees.\n       If monitoring federal inspectors determine through twice \n     daily checks that they aren't, the firms involved can be \n     cited for failing to meet food safety standards, he said.\n       Under the new inspection system, as under traditional \n     systems in which federal inspectors examine each carcass, \n     birds with less serious cases of air sacculitis can be \n     ``reworked'' by either cutting away pus-filled air sacs and \n     other tissues or by using a vacuum device to remove the \n     material, Petersen said.\n       ``We recognize that wholesomeness issues are also important \n     and we check for them,'' Petersen said. ``But our emphasis is \n     on those things that may cause an ailment. So, we are seeking \n     an appropriate balance.''\n\n  I ask the consumers of America to be aware, as they buy chicken and \nturkey, of whether or not the wholesomeness act of 1968 is being \nfollowed by the Congress of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I inquire where we are. Are we in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3045-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3045-S3051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA ON EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about \neducation. It appears that we will spend most of our time this week \ntalking about the importance of our public education system to \nAmerica's children and to our Nation's future.\n  Long ago, the United States recognized the value of an educational \nsystem that is available and accessible to everyone. We knew the \ntremendous sophistication of a democracy or a representative republic, \nand that to sustain it we would have to have a well-educated populace--\nnot only to understand it and to believe in it but to further it. That \nwas part of the genesis of the public school system in our country, \nalong with the tremendous value to our citizenry, to be able to say \nthey were educated. That was our goal.\n  As we start a debate on the Educational Opportunities Act this week, \nthat will continue to be the ultimate goal of the Republicans--the \nassurance of a strong, growing, reliable, and capable public school \nsystem to provide the very best education and the very best educational \nsystem to all of our citizens and to all of their children. Though it \nappears this is the number\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\none issue in the minds of the American people--and everywhere you poll, \nyou find education is--I am saddened that at least here on the floor \nthis week it will become a decidedly partisan issue.\n  Accusations will fly from the Democrats' side; they will claim that \nthe Clinton-Gore administration has done its job in the promotion of \nits policies, and that they care more about children than we do. But I \nthink the debate this week, if listened to, will become very clear. \nEvery Senator, either Democrat or Republican, should have the same goal \nin mind, and that is to provide to our children the very best education \npossible. The very foundation for that is our public education system. \nWhat this debate this week is really about, though, if you listen \nclosely is a difference in philosophies about how we get to the best \nsystem in the world. Or how do we improve what is already good and make \nit better?\n  The Democrats are going to tell you they want more of your tax \ndollars to stay in Washington to pay for another Federal bureaucrat to \ndo another study, to construct a one-size-fits-all national policy, or \nto ensure that only 65 cents out of every dollar actually gets to the \nclassroom in America. That is what this debate is going to be about, in \npart. They will defend the status quo in an ever-increasing Washington, \nDC, involvement in our children's education. They will defend the \nincreasingly intrusive Federal involvement in State and local \neducational systems.\n  We, at the Federal level, have always believed the responsibility of \neducating was at the State level. That is why every State has a \ndepartment of education or an educational system. It has only been in \nthe last few years that we have increasingly begun to put more Federal \ndollars into the public school system. Even as we have done that by the \nbillions of dollars over the last decade, still only about 7.5 cents to \n8 cents out of every Federal dollar are spent in the classroom. So even \nwith our increased involvement, we still historically have erred on the \nside of the local community and the State government to be the primary \nproviders of public education.\n  The same system I talk about now, is the system in which the Clinton-\nGore regime has denied many students the basic education they deserve \nby stifling some of our creativity.\n  Republicans say it is time for a change, and we are taking action.\n  This week, on the floor of the Senate, we will be considering S. 2, \nthe Educational Opportunity Act, which does just that. It offers a \nfundamental change in the way the Federal Government involves itself in \npublic education. Republicans say it is time to put decisions back in \nthe hands of parents and back in the hands of teachers. Our bill \nincludes provisions that give States and school districts more \nflexibility in how they spend their Federal tax dollars. If you go to a \nprincipal's office or superintendent's office today and ask what the \nFederal tax dollar means to them, while they say it is important, they \nwill say: Look around you; 45 to 50 percent of our staff is here to \nfill out the Federal forms to get the 7.5 cents out of every dollar we \nget.\n\n  That is part of the bureaucracy that has been allowed to build, that \nthe Clinton-Gore administration has aggressively perpetuated over the \nlast eight years.\n  Republicans say every school is different and has different needs, \nand Washington, DC, should not decide how to spend the money in \nMidvale, Idaho. I happened to pick Midvale because that is the small \nrural school from which I graduated. While I graduated 37 years ago, \nand there were only 10 in my high school graduating class, there aren't \nmany more than that today. In fact, the public school I grew up in has \nfewer students in the whole school than in one grade level at one \nWashington, DC, school. It is a small, rural school. That school does \nnot need money to reduce its class sizes. That school needs money to \nconnect itself to the Internet or to buy books, to improve its library, \nto improve the ability of students to research in a much broader arena \nthan modern technology allows today. We don't need more teachers, and \nwe don't need smaller class sizes. Yet that is the single loudest \nmantra you have heard coming from the lips of Al Gore or Bill Clinton.\n  Our bill doesn't do that. Our bill allows school districts with fewer \nthan 600 students to combine funds to improve student achievement. \nRepublicans believe it is wrong to let even one child slip through the \ncracks, be it an urban crack or a rural countryside crack. That is why \nour bill gives schools and teachers increased authority to meet the \nneeds of the disadvantaged students while requiring accountability.\n  Republicans believe our children deserve the best qualified teachers \navailable. Our bill helps school districts hire and retain the best \nqualified teachers and empower those teachers to continue to learn and \nimprove so they can increasingly become better educators.\n  Republicans believe schools should be among the most safe places in \nthe United States. Our bill strengthens the Safe and Drug Free School \nProgram. Why should our schools not be a sanctuary and a haven in which \nall students can feel safety and trust? I think they will not learn \nwell unless they see their schools in that light.\n  Republicans recognize the value of speaking multiple languages and \nthe importance of being fluent in English. Our bill gives a helping \nhand to those whose first language is not English. Republicans \nrecognize the presence of the Federal Government is a drain on the \nlocal infrastructure. Our bill fortifies programs designed to meet part \nof the Federal Government's responsibility to local communities.\n  Republicans believe we have a special commitment to native students, \nwhether they are in the lower 48 or Alaska or Hawaii. Our bill gives \nthese students a helping hand to help them compete in our modern world.\n  Again, the real debate this week is not who cares most about \neducating our children. It is a fundamental, philosophical debate about \nthe best ways to allow our children to achieve. It talks about the \nstark contrast of a large Federal bureaucracy and new Federal ideas \nbeing thrust upon the States and local communities because Washington \nknows every child, and Washington knows better. I am afraid Democrats \nare going to continue to preach about the failed policies of the \nClinton-Gore administration by keeping tax dollars within the beltway, \nsaying that is the way you educate a child in Midvale, Idaho.\n  This week we will say enough is enough. It will be a debate about a \ndifferent approach: returning the money to the local school districts \nand to the States and empowering them to make those choices.\n  Let's get that hard-earned tax dollar out of the beltway, out of the \nhands of the bureaucrat, and into the hands of the well-meaning \nteachers and parents. Let's tie the money to the child so the parent \nand the child can seek out and find the very best education that child \ndeserves.\n  Those are the differences I think will be a part of the baseline of \nthe debate this week on the floor of the Senate.\n  I hope America listens, because we need the best public school system \nin the world. It is a good one, but it is not the best. To make \nsomething good better or best is to empower people at local levels to \nmake decisions for their children--the kinds of decisions that parents \ninstinctively know, but bureaucrats in Washington somehow have never \nunderstood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, later today the Senate will officially begin \nthe debate on S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act. I am pleased we \nwill finally have the opportunity to discuss our ideas for improving \nelementary and secondary education. Of course, one of the reasons we \nare discussing elementary and secondary education this year is that the \nESEA, the statute authorizing most of the Federal Government's \neducation programs in this area, is expiring. I should assure everyone \nthat even though there is no reauthorization bill, it is possible to \ncontinue the ESEA programs through the annual appropriations process.\n  The time has come to act. The American people have been sending us a \nmessage to do something to improve America's schools. I agree with the \nAmerican people about the importance of this issue. If we can get \neducation\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\nright in this country, almost everything else should follow. A better \neducated citizenry will give us an advantage in technology and national \ndefense, better trade and economic opportunities, better citizenship \nand stronger values, a reduction in crime, and, of course, more \npersonal fulfillment for our citizens. This is an important debate, one \nof great significance for our Nation.\n  The bad news is that in the coming days there will be so much \npolitics and partisan acrimony emanating from the floor and that many \npeople who watch us might wonder whether it is worth the trouble. The \ngood news is that if concerned Americans listen closely to this debate \nand have the patience to endure the political sound and furry, I \nbelieve they will see their concerns are taken seriously by the \nmajority.\n  It is important to keep in mind that the Federal Government's share \nof America's total education expenditures is quite small, about 7 \npercent. As a result, Federal attention has been focused on a few \nspecific objectives:\n\n  First, providing a quality education that can help offset the effects \nof poverty and social distress that many of our students experience. It \nis wrong to expect less of minority and poor students. They can do very \nwell.\n  Second, improving teacher quality and accountability is critical--\nteaching the English language to students who do not know it well, \nparticularly in my State and other States in which we have had a real \nupswing in immigration with students coming to this country who are not \nas fluent in English as the others.\n  Third, promoting familiarity with technology, which is the future.\n  And, of course, providing a safe school environment.\n  These are the things on which we will focus.\n  Unfortunately, after some 35 years, the record of progress toward \nthese objectives at the Federal level is not impressive. I believe this \nrecord of failure stands as an indictment of the traditional ESEA \nstrategy, which is to establish a new division of the Federal \nGovernment in Washington, DC, and put a small army of people to work \nwriting regulations and processing paperwork from the States.\n  A promising alternative approach has emerged, and this new \nalternative is known as Straight A's. The idea behind the Straight A's \nphrase is very similar to the idea that led to our success with welfare \nreform. It is a concept of a Federal-State performance partnership as \nin welfare. We do not measure the success in welfare by how many people \nwe have on welfare or how much money we spend on welfare. We decided to \nbegin measuring success on how few people we had to have on welfare and \nhow little we had to spend.\n  We have to get to the same kind of performance-based criteria with \nrespect to education, not how many kids we have in some remedial \nprogram but how few we have in those kinds of programs because our \neducation system is working to educate our young people. This is the \nconcept of accountability at the State and local level.\n  When Congress took on welfare in 1995 and 1996, the prerequisite for \nour success in passing significant reforms was a recognition that very \npromising ideas were being developed by leaders at the State and local \ngovernment level. We rejected the old premise that ``Washington knows \nbest,'' and we allowed these innovators outside of what we call the \nWashington beltway to actually pursue some bold, innovative ideas \nwithout a lot of strings attached from Washington.\n  We have all seen what the result can be. We all understand how \nwelfare reform has been working now to get people off welfare and into \na productive capacity in our society. It is time to consider the same \npossibilities with respect to education.\n  The HELP Committee's bill permits as many as 15 States to enter into \nStraight A's performance contracts if they choose to. These contracts \nwill allow significant flexibility for innovation by these States. My \nguess is, as we saw with education flexibility, the bill we passed \nearlier--the Ed-Flex bill--the other States will want to participate in \nthis, so it will quickly move from a 15-State demonstration project to \none in which all 50 States want the right to participate.\n  I am sure we will hear objections from the same folks who posited \nobjections to welfare reform. They will say it is a risky scheme: you \ncannot trust the States and local leaders to do this; Washington knows \nbest. Given the Federal Government's record over the last 35 years, \nthis reactionary posture is impossible to sustain. We cannot keep doing \nthings the same old way and expect different results.\n\n  I expect, just as with welfare reform, the American people will come \nto agree with the majority and at least some members of the minority \nwho have now concluded that flexibility, combined with accountability, \ncan bring needed change to education, where control by the bureaucrats \nin Washington has failed.\n  I also look forward to debating proposals aimed at enhancing parents' \ninfluence over the decisions affecting their children, especially when \na student must overcome poverty or a language barrier. The stakes are \nvery high, and we should not tolerate a system that ignores the views \nof the people with the keenest appreciation of that fact--parents.\n  The committee-passed bill recognizes that choice must be available to \nchildren in failing or unsafe schools, and I welcome this recognition \nand urge the greatest possible expansion of choice and competition.\n  In fact, I am proud that my own State of Arizona has provided \nleadership in this area by establishing an open enrollment policy that \nallows parents to enroll a child in any public school of their choice, \nundeterred by artificial geographic boundaries, and that this latitude \nhas led to the creation of hundreds of new charter schools in Arizona. \nThat has, in turn, improved the traditional public schools with which \nthese charter schools compete.\n  In fact, I was buoyed to see in the big newspaper at home in August a \ncouple of years ago one of our better public school districts put a \nfull-page ad in the newspaper saying to the parents: We are having to \ncompete with these charter schools. We were losing enrollment to these \nschools. We figured out what we were doing wrong, and we have improved. \nCome back to our public school system and see what a great program we \nhave.\n  That kind of competition and innovation has caused improvement, and \nwe have seen it in our own State of Arizona.\n  As the author of the Dollars Follow the Students Act, which is the \nfirst piece of Federal legislation to advance this idea of making these \naid dollars portable, I am heartened the bill we are going to consider \nwill provide unprecedented portability for students aided by title I, \nwhich is our largest Federal education program.\n  There are those who will resist the idea of choice and competition in \neducation. But I am looking forward to this debate.\n  No American child should be trapped in a school that cannot guarantee \na quality education and a safe education. We have an obligation to \nprovide a lifeline for families whose schools are failing, particularly \nthose families who live in our country's most disadvantaged areas.\n  So once again, I urge the American people to follow this debate \nclosely. If they do, I think they will find that we have been listening \nto their calls for change and for real reform. That is what the \nlegislation we will be bringing to the floor today will provide. I am \nlooking forward to this debate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am excited that we are launching ourselves into what \nmay be a week or more of debate and discussion and, hopefully, success \nin the area of education and educational funding.\n  Looking back over time, I think there is probably no other issue we \nhave talked more about than education. I think polls and discussions in\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\ntown meetings would indicate that education is probably the highest \npriority issue in the country.\n  Everybody knows the future of our children--and of the country--\ndepends on education. We will be talking about that during debate of \nthis bill, and I hope we can agree on some positive results.\n  Unfortunately, I think it is fair to say that when we enter into a \nyear of this kind, particularly with the Presidential election, we find \nourselves faced with more emphasis on creating issues than creating \nsolutions. I hope that is not the case during this education debate.\n  I am sure there is nothing to which we have more commitment or in \nwhich we have more intense beliefs than our schools--by ``we'' I mean \nall of us: Parents, communities, people all over the country. We are \nall involved in educating our children. It is a most important part of \nour lives.\n  This weekend, I met with the alumni association of the University of \nWyoming. It caused me to reflect on the things that were basic to my \nlife and reminded me of changes that need to be made.\n  I think most of us are proud of our schools. I am especially proud of \nthe schools in my State of Wyoming. They are rural schools, generally, \nthat are relatively small. The population in our State is low. But when \nthose kids come here to visit, through programs such as Close Up or \nothers, when they come here to serve as interns or come here to serve \nin the Senate, I am very proud. Our education system must be doing well \nfor these young people to be here.\n  Can we make it better? Of course. That is what we are challenged to \ndo, to make an even better opportunity for our children. We need to be \nable to help our schools to be flexible enough to change, as the world \nchanges, as our economy changes.\n  Again, going back to this weekend, we were talking about the \nrelatively small number of young people who have graduated from the \nUniversity, or even from our high schools, who are equipped with the \nkind of technological expertise they'll need as we enter this new \neconomy. We need to make sure they're ready to answer the call.\n  As the Presiding Officer has said so eloquently, we are coming forth \nthis week with an educational agenda. I think it is a very strong \nagenda. It is the product of much work on the part of the committee \nthat is bringing it forth. It tends to emphasize moving controls to \nparents. After all, that has really been the controversial issue we \nhave addressed in all of our conversations; that is: Where should the \ndecisions be made? Who really should fit the educational program to the \ncommunity and their needs?\n  By all means, we need to reflect on it and measure it against the \nrest of the country, especially since our population is becoming much \nmore transient. For example, a person living in Cody, WY, as I did, may \nnot live there forever. We have to have some relative comparison \nbetween schools, which we do have. But we need to tailor those \nprograms, particularly Federal assistance, to fit our specific needs.\n\n  Educational needs in Meeteetse, WY, are much different from those in \nPittsburgh, PA. We need to make sure the Federal dollars--and it has \nalready been pointed out it is a relatively small amount, about 7 or 8 \npercent of the total--are used in the classroom and not set aside for \nthe bureaucracy.\n  We need to give families more of a role in education with greater \neducational choice.\n  This morning, we had a visit from a RespectTeen group. I brought them \nonto the floor. There was one student from each State. A young man who \nhad been chosen to come here had done a study and a paper on education. \nHis paper focused on the importance of family involvement in schools. I \nwas very impressed with the ideas about ways to get parents more \ndirectly involved with the education of their children.\n  We need, of course, to support exceptional teachers. We need to help \nteachers be prepared to teach. We need to encourage people to come into \nthat profession. We need to provide attractive opportunities for them \nto stay in that profession. I guess I am especially interested in that \nsince my wife is a teacher.\n  But it is very important to focus on basic academics.\n  That is what we aim to do. We have an opportunity to make some \nchanges, to set some goals and some objectives. I am afraid that, too \noften perhaps, individually, and certainly institutionally, we become \nwrapped up in doing the things we are doing and, as a result, do not \nsit down regularly and ask ourselves: Where are we? Where do we want to \ngo? What are our objectives? What do we need to do to get there?\n  I think we can fairly easily define the goals we want to accomplish \nin education. But I am not sure we define very well how to make the \nprocess of achieving them more effective.\n  We also need to address the issue of accountability. We spend a great \ndeal of money in education, which we need to do. However, frankly, \nmoney alone does not ensure a good education for our children. We have \nseen the results of simply throwing out money and not having some \nsystem of accountability.\n  What we have had in this administration is a commitment to a whole \nseries of Federal mandates and programs--for example, 100,000 Federally \nfunded teachers. It has already been pointed out this morning that \nthere are school districts in which providing additional teachers to \nreduce class size is unnecessary. The needs are in other places. That \nis why priorities need to be decided locally. Sometimes the mandate is \nfor Federal construction. Again, that need may exist in one place but \nnot in another.\n  So what we are really talking about is having some accountability, \nhaving some local flexibility, helping disadvantaged children meet \nhigher standards, improving teacher quality, enriching the incentives \nfor students to be prepared for a life of success, having safe and \ndrug-free schools--we can do more in these areas.\n  Increasing educational opportunities is what this bill is all about. \nThis is not a proposal for private school vouchers, but it does give an \nopportunity for mobility. If these kids are in a school that is not \nadequate, they can go to another public school and possibly improve.\n\n  I think it is exciting that we are moving ahead. I hope we can do so \nwith the objective of passing a bill that will strengthen education in \nthis country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since we have a few more minutes before we \nhave to end this morning's session, I will take a moment to comment on \na few things the Presiding Officer said a little while ago. There are \ntwo points I will make.\n  The first has to do with the percentage of funds the Federal \nGovernment spends on primary and secondary education. The second is \nmore general.\n  The Senator from Wyoming made the point that about 7 percent of the \nmoney spent in local schools comes from the Federal Government. It is \nalso true that the average proportion of paperwork imposed on State and \nlocal schools by Federal mandates is about 50 percent. In my State of \nArizona, it is about 45 percent. Why is that and what is the effect of \nthat? That goes to the heart of what we are proposing to change.\n  We understand it is not a good economic bargain to give the States $7 \nfor education and to make them spend $3.50 of that on administration. \nYet that is exactly what is happening.\n  Why is this so? States and school districts see pots of Federal \nmoney. There are over 100 different Federal programs for which States \nand local school districts can qualify. Sometimes they have to have \nmatching funds. In most cases, they have to submit a lot of paperwork \nin order to get this money from the Federal Government. So even if it \nis only $20,000 or $30,000, a school district will hire an \nadministrator to apply for the money, to fill out the forms, to provide \nthe follow-up information, and then to administer that money when it \nfinally comes. The net result is that about half of the money in \nadministration is spent to get this 7 percent.\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\n  There is no surprise, therefore, that so many of the people the \nschool districts hire are not teachers. That has an impact on \neducation. It is one of the reasons why over the last many years, as \nthe Federal Government has dangled these relatively small chunks of \nfunding out to the schools, the schools, in order to get that funding, \nhave jumped through more and more hoops, have spent more and more time \nand effort and more and more dollars chasing after that relatively \nsmall amount of Federal money.\n  This is inefficient. It is uneconomical. That is not to say the \noriginal ideas for the Federal programs were bad ideas. We are smart \npeople in Washington. We come up with all kinds of great ideas. \nTherefore, we provide funding to implement those ideas. We say: If you \nwill only jump through these various hoops, you can get some Federal \nfunding for this particular great idea. The problem is, that is a very \ninefficient way to use taxpayer dollars.\n  It makes a lot more sense to say to the States: We have about 7 \npercent of the funding for your schools. If you will figure out how you \ncan best spend that money on your own, let us know, set your own goals \nand make sure you meet those goals at the end of the year--in other \nwords, there still has to be accountability--we will send the money to \nyou without having to have these armies of bureaucrats filling out the \nforms and administering the Federal programs based upon the ideas we \nthink are great.\n  It will probably turn out that a lot of those great ideas are \nimplemented by the local schools but they won't always be implemented \nin every place. As the Presiding Officer noted, one school may need \nthat money to decrease class sizes, to hire more teachers. Another may \nneed that money to hook everybody up to the Internet. Another may want \nto focus on some kinds of remedial programs in math or reading, for \nexample, tutorial kinds of programs. There are all different kinds of \nspecific needs in specific school districts.\n\n  We, in Washington, should not suppose we know best what each school \nneeds, nor should we assume that if we just throw money at the \nproblems, we will get better education.\n  It turns out that the States that spend the least amount on education \nare among those with best test scores. There are a lot of different \nreasons for that. It is also true that where we spend the most money, \nwe have the worst test scores--right here in Washington, DC. So there \nis no direct correlation between the expenditure of money and a good \neducation. It is where you put your funds, how you make use of those \nfunds, how you prioritize.\n  That is what we want to address with this change in policy. No longer \nwill everybody have to apply for these little grants and go through all \nof the hoops that it takes, fill out all of the paperwork, and then \nfollow that paperwork throughout the years. Rather, we are hoping, at \nleast for some States, we are going to create a contract whereby they \ncan apply for the funds at the beginning on the basis of a very general \nset of goals that they establish, without all of the paperwork required \nto meet the Federal goals. They can set their own goals and, at the end \nof the year, demonstrate to us by a good accountability of how they \nhave done whether or not the expenditure of those funds has worked to \nachieve their goals. If it has, then they can continue to apply for \nthese funds in the future. If not, then they have to be relegated to \nthe same old program they are under today, where they have to continue \nto apply for each individual program, spend all of the money to do \nthat, and be relegated to this very inefficient way of getting the \nFederal dollars to them.\n  That is the essence of what we are trying to do--free up those \ndollars so people at the local level who know best what to do with them \ncan put the money toward the goals they establish and not have to spend \nhalf of the money on administering the programs so that none of that \nmoney gets down to the kids we are trying to teach.\n  The second point is--I mentioned this earlier--if we get education \nright in our country, almost everything else will follow. Let me \nillustrate.\n  First of all, we will have an advantage in national defense. Why did \nI mention that first? We are the only superpower in the world right \nnow, and we have the technology in our defense to beat anybody in the \nworld should they challenge us. That technology is not static. It is \ndynamic. If we don't train the young people to continue to innovate, to \ncontinue to invent new things which will enable us not only to progress \nas a civilian society but also to have the capability to defend \nourselves with new types of defense technology, we will not stay on \ntop. The history of the world is littered with countries that at one \ntime were on top but did not maintain their edge.\n  I was talking to some astronauts one day. I said: ``What is the \ndifference between you and your Russian counterparts who go up in space \nwith you?'' They said: ``There isn't any difference; they are just like \nwe are.'' I said: ``Well, surely there has to be something.'' One of \nthem said: ``Well, I can tell you a story. When something goes wrong up \nthere, we immediately get on our computers and try to figure out how to \nfix it.''\n  ``Our Russian friends get out their tablet of paper and pencil and \nthey start doing the math, the algorithms, long division, calculus, \nwhatever it takes, to figure out what to do.''\n  I think there are two lessons in that. First of all, it is wonderful \nthat, as a society, we are all trained in the use of computers, and we \nhave everything so computer-literate that we can quickly figure out the \nanswer. But the second lesson is that we also have to have people who \nunderstand what the Russian scientists do--the long math, the \ncalculus--to be able to figure all of this out, because it is only by \nknowing that that you can program the computers to do the things we can \ndo with computers.\n  Somebody has to understand the fundamental science. People in other \ncountries are still being educated the old-fashioned way, using the \nfundamentals. We have to have enough people in this country who are \neducated in the fundamentals to maintain our technological superiority, \nwhile at the same time making the calculations from computers available \nto all of society to enable us to rapidly advance in all the different \nareas in which we have advanced.\n  But if we lose this technological edge because we are no longer \neducating our citizenry--at least the best and brightest--in the \nfundamentals of math and science, we will lose this edge. That is why I \nsaid we can maintain an edge in defense only if we continue to have the \nbest educated citizenry in the world. Today, we have to import many \nscientists and computer specialists from other countries, and it \ndemonstrates to us that we are not doing a good enough job of educating \nour own citizenry.\n  The same thing applies to better trade and economic opportunities. If \nwe continue to be the inventors of the world and to take those \ninventions and create applications that make our lives better, we will \ncontinue to have the best products in the world that others want to \nbuy, and we will maintain our general superiority in trade. But if we \ndon't provide the education to our students to be able to continue to \nput out these kinds of products, if we become mostly a service-oriented \nsociety, other societies will take up the slack and will gain the \nadvantage in trade and economic opportunities. As I said, we would have \na better citizenry.\n  We have to continue not only to train people in science and math, but \nalso in history, in learning the lessons of life from other subjects \nthat enable us to work better as a society as we become more and more \ndiverse, and to remember the key lessons of our Founding Fathers who \nunderstood that our democratic-republican form of government could not \ncontinue in perpetuity without a well-educated citizenry--a citizenry \nunderstanding the issues of the day because they had to make the \ndecisions.\n  This is a do-it-yourself government, America. Our people vote on \nthings; they have to be well enough informed to elect good \nrepresentatives to represent them in the places of our representative \ngovernment--the legislative branches of government, for example. If \nthey are not engaged enough in the issues of the day to make \nintelligent decisions, then obviously the people they send here will \nlikewise not be so educated. The quality of decisionmaking and public \npolicy will falter.\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\nMoreover, the understanding of their role in our government will \ngradually diminish.\n  Abraham Lincoln was very concerned about this. He said often that one \nof his big fears was that, little by little, each generation would lose \nsome understanding of the ideas of the Founding Fathers and why the \nperpetuation of those ideas was so critical to the continuation of our \ndemocratic-republican form of government--the notion of citizen \nparticipation, the understanding of the checks and balances of our \ngovernment, why we set the government up the way we did.\n  Frankly, I was distressed during the time of the impeachment trial of \nthe President--whatever you think of the outcome of that trial--about \nthe lack of understanding of a lot of my fellow citizens about what \nthat was all about, why we had such a procedure, why it was important \nto maintain the rule of law, and so on. These are subjects that our \ngreat-great-grandparents were well versed in from their education. They \nstudied them long and hard. I am distressed that today our kids and \ngrandkids don't take the humanities courses in college that we took, \nwhich brought us a real knowledge of the underpinnings of the \nphilosophy of our government, our society, our civilization.\n\n  Our students today are caught up in all kinds of studies of \nminorities of one kind or another and in other fads of the day. They \nare not as well educated about the traditional concepts. In fact, some \neven assault these concepts as inapplicable to today's world, when in \npoint of fact, the lessons of the great philosophers are totally \napplicable. You will find philosophers on every side of every issue. If \nyou study them well, you will appreciate and understand the problems of \ntoday, the kinds of choices we should be making in our society today.\n  History is relevant and, as has been noted many times, those who \nignore history are bound to repeat it. That was said in the context of \nthe bad times of history--primarily the wars that have to be fought--\nbecause we don't understand that history. So a better education \nprovides better citizenship.\n  It can provide stronger values because we study the great books and \nthe philosophers who wrestled with the questions of what is the meaning \nof life and how we should conduct ourselves. There is a difference \nbetween right and wrong. There are truths and there are values. Young \npeople today are not reminded that in the Declaration of Independence, \nour founders said there are ``inalienable rights,'' and ``we hold these \ntruths to be self-evident.'' There were some things that are so true \nand we understand that. They were self-evident. But today, relativism \nhas begun to teach our kids that there is no real truth, there is no \ndefinite right and wrong; there are only shades of gray.\n  If society comes to believe that and bases decisions upon that \nmisunderstanding, then we cannot long survive as a free society, as a \nsociety founded on the principle that there are certain truths, and \nthat part of those truths are that there are inalienable rights that \nare given to us by our Creator--not by some government. We then begin \nto rely upon government to do things because it is the benevolence of \ngovernment that is the basis for our rights. Wrong. Government doesn't \ngive us any rights. The best we can expect from government is the \nprotection of our God-given rights. But if generations are not taught \nthat, then we won't be able to make public decisions on the same \nfoundation that our Founding Fathers understood were so important to \nfuture generations.\n  A reduction in crime. If we have a well-educated citizenry, we are \ngoing to have less crime. I think it is absolutely wrong to believe \nthat people from disadvantaged backgrounds have to be relegated to a \nlife of crime, that they somehow aren't as capable as everybody else at \nlearning and improving their lives and staying free from a life of \ncrime. It is so at odds with the fundamental precepts of our country \nthat I can't believe people would still expect less of students in \nthese kinds of communities.\n  Our proposal, as the Presiding Officer noted, is to recognize that \neverybody is entitled to an equal opportunity for education, and we \ncannot expect less of those in our most distressed areas. But if we \ndon't give them the same opportunity to go to areas where they can get \na good education and have safe schools that provide a quality \neducation, then we are, in effect, saying: You are second class, you \njust can't make it, and we are not going to bother to give you the \ntools to make it. That is fundamentally wrong and un-American.\n  Finally, a good education--if we get it right--will allow for more \npersonal fulfillment. We all want to make the very best of our God-\ngiven talents, to do the very best we can in life, because most of us, \ntoward the end of our lives, begin reflecting on why we are here and \nwhat was so important about our life and what we want to leave behind.\n  We speak in terms of legacies. The reality is that most of us begin \nsaying, well, did we make the most of what we had? We all have \nwonderful talents given to us, and we feel very good about ourselves \nand our lives if we have been able to take advantage of those talents, \nif we have fulfilled our expectations. Yet we know today we are not \nchallenging our young students as much as we could be. It is a crime to \nme that we don't challenge them to the ultimate, the maximum, so they \ncan make the most of what God has given them. We fail them if we don't \ndo that. If we are so lazy and so wrong about the way we provide an \neducational opportunity that we don't challenge them to be the very \nbest they can be, that is the worst thing we can do for our young \npeople today. That is why I said if we get education right, everything \nelse will follow in our society, and that is why I think it is the most \nimportant thing we can do.\n\n  I was asked by a journalist: If you could do one thing in public \npolicy as a member of the Federal Government, what would it be? I said: \nWell, other than ensuring our national security, which we have to put \nthat first because that is the difference between life and death for \nall of our people, I would allow real choice in education so that \npeople would be able to go to the place where they thought they could \nget the best education for their kids wherever that might be, and that \nthe Federal Government not stand in the way of the exercise of that \nchoice. And the very exercise of that choice would ensure a quality \neducation and a safe education because the people who provide the \neducation would have to rise to the challenge. They would have to \nunderstand that they would no longer be in business if people didn't \ncome to them. If students didn't come, they wouldn't be able to \neducate. But if they did a good job, the students would come. It can be \ndone.\n  I visited a school district in Arizona not long ago--the Alhambra \nSchool District--not a wealthy school district. There are a lot of \nminorities there. Carol Peck is the superintendent. She told me there \nare 39 different languages and dialects spoken at that school. Yet they \nhave achievement at that school because they have innovative \nadministrators and teachers and the kids learn.\n  We can learn lessons from that if we will allow innovation at the \nlocal level--if we will not bind them by all of these Federal rules and \nregulations. If we will lay those aside and at least let the small \namount of Federal money that goes to local schools be used in an \ninnovative way, we will begin to remove the barriers to innovation, and \nwe will provide quality education for our kids.\n  As I said in the beginning, just like welfare reform, we can succeed \nif we will just throw off the old ideas and allow innovation to prosper \nat the local level and at the parental level--and among our teachers, \nwho, after all, are on the front lines of this wonderful opportunity we \nhave.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I thought since we had a \nlittle extra time I would embellish a little bit on the remarks I made.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for setting aside this time for us to \nfocus on this particular subject, and for the great job he has done \nover the many months in which he has been in charge in the effort to \ntake some morning business time like this so we can all express \nourselves on subjects that we are about to debate. I think the upcoming \neducation debate is the most important debate we can engage in as a \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3045-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3045-S3051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA ON EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about \neducation. It appears that we will spend most of our time this week \ntalking about the importance of our public education system to \nAmerica's children and to our Nation's future.\n  Long ago, the United States recognized the value of an educational \nsystem that is available and accessible to everyone. We knew the \ntremendous sophistication of a democracy or a representative republic, \nand that to sustain it we would have to have a well-educated populace--\nnot only to understand it and to believe in it but to further it. That \nwas part of the genesis of the public school system in our country, \nalong with the tremendous value to our citizenry, to be able to say \nthey were educated. That was our goal.\n  As we start a debate on the Educational Opportunities Act this week, \nthat will continue to be the ultimate goal of the Republicans--the \nassurance of a strong, growing, reliable, and capable public school \nsystem to provide the very best education and the very best educational \nsystem to all of our citizens and to all of their children. Though it \nappears this is the number\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\none issue in the minds of the American people--and everywhere you poll, \nyou find education is--I am saddened that at least here on the floor \nthis week it will become a decidedly partisan issue.\n  Accusations will fly from the Democrats' side; they will claim that \nthe Clinton-Gore administration has done its job in the promotion of \nits policies, and that they care more about children than we do. But I \nthink the debate this week, if listened to, will become very clear. \nEvery Senator, either Democrat or Republican, should have the same goal \nin mind, and that is to provide to our children the very best education \npossible. The very foundation for that is our public education system. \nWhat this debate this week is really about, though, if you listen \nclosely is a difference in philosophies about how we get to the best \nsystem in the world. Or how do we improve what is already good and make \nit better?\n  The Democrats are going to tell you they want more of your tax \ndollars to stay in Washington to pay for another Federal bureaucrat to \ndo another study, to construct a one-size-fits-all national policy, or \nto ensure that only 65 cents out of every dollar actually gets to the \nclassroom in America. That is what this debate is going to be about, in \npart. They will defend the status quo in an ever-increasing Washington, \nDC, involvement in our children's education. They will defend the \nincreasingly intrusive Federal involvement in State and local \neducational systems.\n  We, at the Federal level, have always believed the responsibility of \neducating was at the State level. That is why every State has a \ndepartment of education or an educational system. It has only been in \nthe last few years that we have increasingly begun to put more Federal \ndollars into the public school system. Even as we have done that by the \nbillions of dollars over the last decade, still only about 7.5 cents to \n8 cents out of every Federal dollar are spent in the classroom. So even \nwith our increased involvement, we still historically have erred on the \nside of the local community and the State government to be the primary \nproviders of public education.\n  The same system I talk about now, is the system in which the Clinton-\nGore regime has denied many students the basic education they deserve \nby stifling some of our creativity.\n  Republicans say it is time for a change, and we are taking action.\n  This week, on the floor of the Senate, we will be considering S. 2, \nthe Educational Opportunity Act, which does just that. It offers a \nfundamental change in the way the Federal Government involves itself in \npublic education. Republicans say it is time to put decisions back in \nthe hands of parents and back in the hands of teachers. Our bill \nincludes provisions that give States and school districts more \nflexibility in how they spend their Federal tax dollars. If you go to a \nprincipal's office or superintendent's office today and ask what the \nFederal tax dollar means to them, while they say it is important, they \nwill say: Look around you; 45 to 50 percent of our staff is here to \nfill out the Federal forms to get the 7.5 cents out of every dollar we \nget.\n\n  That is part of the bureaucracy that has been allowed to build, that \nthe Clinton-Gore administration has aggressively perpetuated over the \nlast eight years.\n  Republicans say every school is different and has different needs, \nand Washington, DC, should not decide how to spend the money in \nMidvale, Idaho. I happened to pick Midvale because that is the small \nrural school from which I graduated. While I graduated 37 years ago, \nand there were only 10 in my high school graduating class, there aren't \nmany more than that today. In fact, the public school I grew up in has \nfewer students in the whole school than in one grade level at one \nWashington, DC, school. It is a small, rural school. That school does \nnot need money to reduce its class sizes. That school needs money to \nconnect itself to the Internet or to buy books, to improve its library, \nto improve the ability of students to research in a much broader arena \nthan modern technology allows today. We don't need more teachers, and \nwe don't need smaller class sizes. Yet that is the single loudest \nmantra you have heard coming from the lips of Al Gore or Bill Clinton.\n  Our bill doesn't do that. Our bill allows school districts with fewer \nthan 600 students to combine funds to improve student achievement. \nRepublicans believe it is wrong to let even one child slip through the \ncracks, be it an urban crack or a rural countryside crack. That is why \nour bill gives schools and teachers increased authority to meet the \nneeds of the disadvantaged students while requiring accountability.\n  Republicans believe our children deserve the best qualified teachers \navailable. Our bill helps school districts hire and retain the best \nqualified teachers and empower those teachers to continue to learn and \nimprove so they can increasingly become better educators.\n  Republicans believe schools should be among the most safe places in \nthe United States. Our bill strengthens the Safe and Drug Free School \nProgram. Why should our schools not be a sanctuary and a haven in which \nall students can feel safety and trust? I think they will not learn \nwell unless they see their schools in that light.\n  Republicans recognize the value of speaking multiple languages and \nthe importance of being fluent in English. Our bill gives a helping \nhand to those whose first language is not English. Republicans \nrecognize the presence of the Federal Government is a drain on the \nlocal infrastructure. Our bill fortifies programs designed to meet part \nof the Federal Government's responsibility to local communities.\n  Republicans believe we have a special commitment to native students, \nwhether they are in the lower 48 or Alaska or Hawaii. Our bill gives \nthese students a helping hand to help them compete in our modern world.\n  Again, the real debate this week is not who cares most about \neducating our children. It is a fundamental, philosophical debate about \nthe best ways to allow our children to achieve. It talks about the \nstark contrast of a large Federal bureaucracy and new Federal ideas \nbeing thrust upon the States and local communities because Washington \nknows every child, and Washington knows better. I am afraid Democrats \nare going to continue to preach about the failed policies of the \nClinton-Gore administration by keeping tax dollars within the beltway, \nsaying that is the way you educate a child in Midvale, Idaho.\n  This week we will say enough is enough. It will be a debate about a \ndifferent approach: returning the money to the local school districts \nand to the States and empowering them to make those choices.\n  Let's get that hard-earned tax dollar out of the beltway, out of the \nhands of the bureaucrat, and into the hands of the well-meaning \nteachers and parents. Let's tie the money to the child so the parent \nand the child can seek out and find the very best education that child \ndeserves.\n  Those are the differences I think will be a part of the baseline of \nthe debate this week on the floor of the Senate.\n  I hope America listens, because we need the best public school system \nin the world. It is a good one, but it is not the best. To make \nsomething good better or best is to empower people at local levels to \nmake decisions for their children--the kinds of decisions that parents \ninstinctively know, but bureaucrats in Washington somehow have never \nunderstood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, later today the Senate will officially begin \nthe debate on S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act. I am pleased we \nwill finally have the opportunity to discuss our ideas for improving \nelementary and secondary education. Of course, one of the reasons we \nare discussing elementary and secondary education this year is that the \nESEA, the statute authorizing most of the Federal Government's \neducation programs in this area, is expiring. I should assure everyone \nthat even though there is no reauthorization bill, it is possible to \ncontinue the ESEA programs through the annual appropriations process.\n  The time has come to act. The American people have been sending us a \nmessage to do something to improve America's schools. I agree with the \nAmerican people about the importance of this issue. If we can get \neducation\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\nright in this country, almost everything else should follow. A better \neducated citizenry will give us an advantage in technology and national \ndefense, better trade and economic opportunities, better citizenship \nand stronger values, a reduction in crime, and, of course, more \npersonal fulfillment for our citizens. This is an important debate, one \nof great significance for our Nation.\n  The bad news is that in the coming days there will be so much \npolitics and partisan acrimony emanating from the floor and that many \npeople who watch us might wonder whether it is worth the trouble. The \ngood news is that if concerned Americans listen closely to this debate \nand have the patience to endure the political sound and furry, I \nbelieve they will see their concerns are taken seriously by the \nmajority.\n  It is important to keep in mind that the Federal Government's share \nof America's total education expenditures is quite small, about 7 \npercent. As a result, Federal attention has been focused on a few \nspecific objectives:\n\n  First, providing a quality education that can help offset the effects \nof poverty and social distress that many of our students experience. It \nis wrong to expect less of minority and poor students. They can do very \nwell.\n  Second, improving teacher quality and accountability is critical--\nteaching the English language to students who do not know it well, \nparticularly in my State and other States in which we have had a real \nupswing in immigration with students coming to this country who are not \nas fluent in English as the others.\n  Third, promoting familiarity with technology, which is the future.\n  And, of course, providing a safe school environment.\n  These are the things on which we will focus.\n  Unfortunately, after some 35 years, the record of progress toward \nthese objectives at the Federal level is not impressive. I believe this \nrecord of failure stands as an indictment of the traditional ESEA \nstrategy, which is to establish a new division of the Federal \nGovernment in Washington, DC, and put a small army of people to work \nwriting regulations and processing paperwork from the States.\n  A promising alternative approach has emerged, and this new \nalternative is known as Straight A's. The idea behind the Straight A's \nphrase is very similar to the idea that led to our success with welfare \nreform. It is a concept of a Federal-State performance partnership as \nin welfare. We do not measure the success in welfare by how many people \nwe have on welfare or how much money we spend on welfare. We decided to \nbegin measuring success on how few people we had to have on welfare and \nhow little we had to spend.\n  We have to get to the same kind of performance-based criteria with \nrespect to education, not how many kids we have in some remedial \nprogram but how few we have in those kinds of programs because our \neducation system is working to educate our young people. This is the \nconcept of accountability at the State and local level.\n  When Congress took on welfare in 1995 and 1996, the prerequisite for \nour success in passing significant reforms was a recognition that very \npromising ideas were being developed by leaders at the State and local \ngovernment level. We rejected the old premise that ``Washington knows \nbest,'' and we allowed these innovators outside of what we call the \nWashington beltway to actually pursue some bold, innovative ideas \nwithout a lot of strings attached from Washington.\n  We have all seen what the result can be. We all understand how \nwelfare reform has been working now to get people off welfare and into \na productive capacity in our society. It is time to consider the same \npossibilities with respect to education.\n  The HELP Committee's bill permits as many as 15 States to enter into \nStraight A's performance contracts if they choose to. These contracts \nwill allow significant flexibility for innovation by these States. My \nguess is, as we saw with education flexibility, the bill we passed \nearlier--the Ed-Flex bill--the other States will want to participate in \nthis, so it will quickly move from a 15-State demonstration project to \none in which all 50 States want the right to participate.\n  I am sure we will hear objections from the same folks who posited \nobjections to welfare reform. They will say it is a risky scheme: you \ncannot trust the States and local leaders to do this; Washington knows \nbest. Given the Federal Government's record over the last 35 years, \nthis reactionary posture is impossible to sustain. We cannot keep doing \nthings the same old way and expect different results.\n\n  I expect, just as with welfare reform, the American people will come \nto agree with the majority and at least some members of the minority \nwho have now concluded that flexibility, combined with accountability, \ncan bring needed change to education, where control by the bureaucrats \nin Washington has failed.\n  I also look forward to debating proposals aimed at enhancing parents' \ninfluence over the decisions affecting their children, especially when \na student must overcome poverty or a language barrier. The stakes are \nvery high, and we should not tolerate a system that ignores the views \nof the people with the keenest appreciation of that fact--parents.\n  The committee-passed bill recognizes that choice must be available to \nchildren in failing or unsafe schools, and I welcome this recognition \nand urge the greatest possible expansion of choice and competition.\n  In fact, I am proud that my own State of Arizona has provided \nleadership in this area by establishing an open enrollment policy that \nallows parents to enroll a child in any public school of their choice, \nundeterred by artificial geographic boundaries, and that this latitude \nhas led to the creation of hundreds of new charter schools in Arizona. \nThat has, in turn, improved the traditional public schools with which \nthese charter schools compete.\n  In fact, I was buoyed to see in the big newspaper at home in August a \ncouple of years ago one of our better public school districts put a \nfull-page ad in the newspaper saying to the parents: We are having to \ncompete with these charter schools. We were losing enrollment to these \nschools. We figured out what we were doing wrong, and we have improved. \nCome back to our public school system and see what a great program we \nhave.\n  That kind of competition and innovation has caused improvement, and \nwe have seen it in our own State of Arizona.\n  As the author of the Dollars Follow the Students Act, which is the \nfirst piece of Federal legislation to advance this idea of making these \naid dollars portable, I am heartened the bill we are going to consider \nwill provide unprecedented portability for students aided by title I, \nwhich is our largest Federal education program.\n  There are those who will resist the idea of choice and competition in \neducation. But I am looking forward to this debate.\n  No American child should be trapped in a school that cannot guarantee \na quality education and a safe education. We have an obligation to \nprovide a lifeline for families whose schools are failing, particularly \nthose families who live in our country's most disadvantaged areas.\n  So once again, I urge the American people to follow this debate \nclosely. If they do, I think they will find that we have been listening \nto their calls for change and for real reform. That is what the \nlegislation we will be bringing to the floor today will provide. I am \nlooking forward to this debate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am excited that we are launching ourselves into what \nmay be a week or more of debate and discussion and, hopefully, success \nin the area of education and educational funding.\n  Looking back over time, I think there is probably no other issue we \nhave talked more about than education. I think polls and discussions in\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\ntown meetings would indicate that education is probably the highest \npriority issue in the country.\n  Everybody knows the future of our children--and of the country--\ndepends on education. We will be talking about that during debate of \nthis bill, and I hope we can agree on some positive results.\n  Unfortunately, I think it is fair to say that when we enter into a \nyear of this kind, particularly with the Presidential election, we find \nourselves faced with more emphasis on creating issues than creating \nsolutions. I hope that is not the case during this education debate.\n  I am sure there is nothing to which we have more commitment or in \nwhich we have more intense beliefs than our schools--by ``we'' I mean \nall of us: Parents, communities, people all over the country. We are \nall involved in educating our children. It is a most important part of \nour lives.\n  This weekend, I met with the alumni association of the University of \nWyoming. It caused me to reflect on the things that were basic to my \nlife and reminded me of changes that need to be made.\n  I think most of us are proud of our schools. I am especially proud of \nthe schools in my State of Wyoming. They are rural schools, generally, \nthat are relatively small. The population in our State is low. But when \nthose kids come here to visit, through programs such as Close Up or \nothers, when they come here to serve as interns or come here to serve \nin the Senate, I am very proud. Our education system must be doing well \nfor these young people to be here.\n  Can we make it better? Of course. That is what we are challenged to \ndo, to make an even better opportunity for our children. We need to be \nable to help our schools to be flexible enough to change, as the world \nchanges, as our economy changes.\n  Again, going back to this weekend, we were talking about the \nrelatively small number of young people who have graduated from the \nUniversity, or even from our high schools, who are equipped with the \nkind of technological expertise they'll need as we enter this new \neconomy. We need to make sure they're ready to answer the call.\n  As the Presiding Officer has said so eloquently, we are coming forth \nthis week with an educational agenda. I think it is a very strong \nagenda. It is the product of much work on the part of the committee \nthat is bringing it forth. It tends to emphasize moving controls to \nparents. After all, that has really been the controversial issue we \nhave addressed in all of our conversations; that is: Where should the \ndecisions be made? Who really should fit the educational program to the \ncommunity and their needs?\n  By all means, we need to reflect on it and measure it against the \nrest of the country, especially since our population is becoming much \nmore transient. For example, a person living in Cody, WY, as I did, may \nnot live there forever. We have to have some relative comparison \nbetween schools, which we do have. But we need to tailor those \nprograms, particularly Federal assistance, to fit our specific needs.\n\n  Educational needs in Meeteetse, WY, are much different from those in \nPittsburgh, PA. We need to make sure the Federal dollars--and it has \nalready been pointed out it is a relatively small amount, about 7 or 8 \npercent of the total--are used in the classroom and not set aside for \nthe bureaucracy.\n  We need to give families more of a role in education with greater \neducational choice.\n  This morning, we had a visit from a RespectTeen group. I brought them \nonto the floor. There was one student from each State. A young man who \nhad been chosen to come here had done a study and a paper on education. \nHis paper focused on the importance of family involvement in schools. I \nwas very impressed with the ideas about ways to get parents more \ndirectly involved with the education of their children.\n  We need, of course, to support exceptional teachers. We need to help \nteachers be prepared to teach. We need to encourage people to come into \nthat profession. We need to provide attractive opportunities for them \nto stay in that profession. I guess I am especially interested in that \nsince my wife is a teacher.\n  But it is very important to focus on basic academics.\n  That is what we aim to do. We have an opportunity to make some \nchanges, to set some goals and some objectives. I am afraid that, too \noften perhaps, individually, and certainly institutionally, we become \nwrapped up in doing the things we are doing and, as a result, do not \nsit down regularly and ask ourselves: Where are we? Where do we want to \ngo? What are our objectives? What do we need to do to get there?\n  I think we can fairly easily define the goals we want to accomplish \nin education. But I am not sure we define very well how to make the \nprocess of achieving them more effective.\n  We also need to address the issue of accountability. We spend a great \ndeal of money in education, which we need to do. However, frankly, \nmoney alone does not ensure a good education for our children. We have \nseen the results of simply throwing out money and not having some \nsystem of accountability.\n  What we have had in this administration is a commitment to a whole \nseries of Federal mandates and programs--for example, 100,000 Federally \nfunded teachers. It has already been pointed out this morning that \nthere are school districts in which providing additional teachers to \nreduce class size is unnecessary. The needs are in other places. That \nis why priorities need to be decided locally. Sometimes the mandate is \nfor Federal construction. Again, that need may exist in one place but \nnot in another.\n  So what we are really talking about is having some accountability, \nhaving some local flexibility, helping disadvantaged children meet \nhigher standards, improving teacher quality, enriching the incentives \nfor students to be prepared for a life of success, having safe and \ndrug-free schools--we can do more in these areas.\n  Increasing educational opportunities is what this bill is all about. \nThis is not a proposal for private school vouchers, but it does give an \nopportunity for mobility. If these kids are in a school that is not \nadequate, they can go to another public school and possibly improve.\n\n  I think it is exciting that we are moving ahead. I hope we can do so \nwith the objective of passing a bill that will strengthen education in \nthis country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since we have a few more minutes before we \nhave to end this morning's session, I will take a moment to comment on \na few things the Presiding Officer said a little while ago. There are \ntwo points I will make.\n  The first has to do with the percentage of funds the Federal \nGovernment spends on primary and secondary education. The second is \nmore general.\n  The Senator from Wyoming made the point that about 7 percent of the \nmoney spent in local schools comes from the Federal Government. It is \nalso true that the average proportion of paperwork imposed on State and \nlocal schools by Federal mandates is about 50 percent. In my State of \nArizona, it is about 45 percent. Why is that and what is the effect of \nthat? That goes to the heart of what we are proposing to change.\n  We understand it is not a good economic bargain to give the States $7 \nfor education and to make them spend $3.50 of that on administration. \nYet that is exactly what is happening.\n  Why is this so? States and school districts see pots of Federal \nmoney. There are over 100 different Federal programs for which States \nand local school districts can qualify. Sometimes they have to have \nmatching funds. In most cases, they have to submit a lot of paperwork \nin order to get this money from the Federal Government. So even if it \nis only $20,000 or $30,000, a school district will hire an \nadministrator to apply for the money, to fill out the forms, to provide \nthe follow-up information, and then to administer that money when it \nfinally comes. The net result is that about half of the money in \nadministration is spent to get this 7 percent.\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\n  There is no surprise, therefore, that so many of the people the \nschool districts hire are not teachers. That has an impact on \neducation. It is one of the reasons why over the last many years, as \nthe Federal Government has dangled these relatively small chunks of \nfunding out to the schools, the schools, in order to get that funding, \nhave jumped through more and more hoops, have spent more and more time \nand effort and more and more dollars chasing after that relatively \nsmall amount of Federal money.\n  This is inefficient. It is uneconomical. That is not to say the \noriginal ideas for the Federal programs were bad ideas. We are smart \npeople in Washington. We come up with all kinds of great ideas. \nTherefore, we provide funding to implement those ideas. We say: If you \nwill only jump through these various hoops, you can get some Federal \nfunding for this particular great idea. The problem is, that is a very \ninefficient way to use taxpayer dollars.\n  It makes a lot more sense to say to the States: We have about 7 \npercent of the funding for your schools. If you will figure out how you \ncan best spend that money on your own, let us know, set your own goals \nand make sure you meet those goals at the end of the year--in other \nwords, there still has to be accountability--we will send the money to \nyou without having to have these armies of bureaucrats filling out the \nforms and administering the Federal programs based upon the ideas we \nthink are great.\n  It will probably turn out that a lot of those great ideas are \nimplemented by the local schools but they won't always be implemented \nin every place. As the Presiding Officer noted, one school may need \nthat money to decrease class sizes, to hire more teachers. Another may \nneed that money to hook everybody up to the Internet. Another may want \nto focus on some kinds of remedial programs in math or reading, for \nexample, tutorial kinds of programs. There are all different kinds of \nspecific needs in specific school districts.\n\n  We, in Washington, should not suppose we know best what each school \nneeds, nor should we assume that if we just throw money at the \nproblems, we will get better education.\n  It turns out that the States that spend the least amount on education \nare among those with best test scores. There are a lot of different \nreasons for that. It is also true that where we spend the most money, \nwe have the worst test scores--right here in Washington, DC. So there \nis no direct correlation between the expenditure of money and a good \neducation. It is where you put your funds, how you make use of those \nfunds, how you prioritize.\n  That is what we want to address with this change in policy. No longer \nwill everybody have to apply for these little grants and go through all \nof the hoops that it takes, fill out all of the paperwork, and then \nfollow that paperwork throughout the years. Rather, we are hoping, at \nleast for some States, we are going to create a contract whereby they \ncan apply for the funds at the beginning on the basis of a very general \nset of goals that they establish, without all of the paperwork required \nto meet the Federal goals. They can set their own goals and, at the end \nof the year, demonstrate to us by a good accountability of how they \nhave done whether or not the expenditure of those funds has worked to \nachieve their goals. If it has, then they can continue to apply for \nthese funds in the future. If not, then they have to be relegated to \nthe same old program they are under today, where they have to continue \nto apply for each individual program, spend all of the money to do \nthat, and be relegated to this very inefficient way of getting the \nFederal dollars to them.\n  That is the essence of what we are trying to do--free up those \ndollars so people at the local level who know best what to do with them \ncan put the money toward the goals they establish and not have to spend \nhalf of the money on administering the programs so that none of that \nmoney gets down to the kids we are trying to teach.\n  The second point is--I mentioned this earlier--if we get education \nright in our country, almost everything else will follow. Let me \nillustrate.\n  First of all, we will have an advantage in national defense. Why did \nI mention that first? We are the only superpower in the world right \nnow, and we have the technology in our defense to beat anybody in the \nworld should they challenge us. That technology is not static. It is \ndynamic. If we don't train the young people to continue to innovate, to \ncontinue to invent new things which will enable us not only to progress \nas a civilian society but also to have the capability to defend \nourselves with new types of defense technology, we will not stay on \ntop. The history of the world is littered with countries that at one \ntime were on top but did not maintain their edge.\n  I was talking to some astronauts one day. I said: ``What is the \ndifference between you and your Russian counterparts who go up in space \nwith you?'' They said: ``There isn't any difference; they are just like \nwe are.'' I said: ``Well, surely there has to be something.'' One of \nthem said: ``Well, I can tell you a story. When something goes wrong up \nthere, we immediately get on our computers and try to figure out how to \nfix it.''\n  ``Our Russian friends get out their tablet of paper and pencil and \nthey start doing the math, the algorithms, long division, calculus, \nwhatever it takes, to figure out what to do.''\n  I think there are two lessons in that. First of all, it is wonderful \nthat, as a society, we are all trained in the use of computers, and we \nhave everything so computer-literate that we can quickly figure out the \nanswer. But the second lesson is that we also have to have people who \nunderstand what the Russian scientists do--the long math, the \ncalculus--to be able to figure all of this out, because it is only by \nknowing that that you can program the computers to do the things we can \ndo with computers.\n  Somebody has to understand the fundamental science. People in other \ncountries are still being educated the old-fashioned way, using the \nfundamentals. We have to have enough people in this country who are \neducated in the fundamentals to maintain our technological superiority, \nwhile at the same time making the calculations from computers available \nto all of society to enable us to rapidly advance in all the different \nareas in which we have advanced.\n  But if we lose this technological edge because we are no longer \neducating our citizenry--at least the best and brightest--in the \nfundamentals of math and science, we will lose this edge. That is why I \nsaid we can maintain an edge in defense only if we continue to have the \nbest educated citizenry in the world. Today, we have to import many \nscientists and computer specialists from other countries, and it \ndemonstrates to us that we are not doing a good enough job of educating \nour own citizenry.\n  The same thing applies to better trade and economic opportunities. If \nwe continue to be the inventors of the world and to take those \ninventions and create applications that make our lives better, we will \ncontinue to have the best products in the world that others want to \nbuy, and we will maintain our general superiority in trade. But if we \ndon't provide the education to our students to be able to continue to \nput out these kinds of products, if we become mostly a service-oriented \nsociety, other societies will take up the slack and will gain the \nadvantage in trade and economic opportunities. As I said, we would have \na better citizenry.\n  We have to continue not only to train people in science and math, but \nalso in history, in learning the lessons of life from other subjects \nthat enable us to work better as a society as we become more and more \ndiverse, and to remember the key lessons of our Founding Fathers who \nunderstood that our democratic-republican form of government could not \ncontinue in perpetuity without a well-educated citizenry--a citizenry \nunderstanding the issues of the day because they had to make the \ndecisions.\n  This is a do-it-yourself government, America. Our people vote on \nthings; they have to be well enough informed to elect good \nrepresentatives to represent them in the places of our representative \ngovernment--the legislative branches of government, for example. If \nthey are not engaged enough in the issues of the day to make \nintelligent decisions, then obviously the people they send here will \nlikewise not be so educated. The quality of decisionmaking and public \npolicy will falter.\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\nMoreover, the understanding of their role in our government will \ngradually diminish.\n  Abraham Lincoln was very concerned about this. He said often that one \nof his big fears was that, little by little, each generation would lose \nsome understanding of the ideas of the Founding Fathers and why the \nperpetuation of those ideas was so critical to the continuation of our \ndemocratic-republican form of government--the notion of citizen \nparticipation, the understanding of the checks and balances of our \ngovernment, why we set the government up the way we did.\n  Frankly, I was distressed during the time of the impeachment trial of \nthe President--whatever you think of the outcome of that trial--about \nthe lack of understanding of a lot of my fellow citizens about what \nthat was all about, why we had such a procedure, why it was important \nto maintain the rule of law, and so on. These are subjects that our \ngreat-great-grandparents were well versed in from their education. They \nstudied them long and hard. I am distressed that today our kids and \ngrandkids don't take the humanities courses in college that we took, \nwhich brought us a real knowledge of the underpinnings of the \nphilosophy of our government, our society, our civilization.\n\n  Our students today are caught up in all kinds of studies of \nminorities of one kind or another and in other fads of the day. They \nare not as well educated about the traditional concepts. In fact, some \neven assault these concepts as inapplicable to today's world, when in \npoint of fact, the lessons of the great philosophers are totally \napplicable. You will find philosophers on every side of every issue. If \nyou study them well, you will appreciate and understand the problems of \ntoday, the kinds of choices we should be making in our society today.\n  History is relevant and, as has been noted many times, those who \nignore history are bound to repeat it. That was said in the context of \nthe bad times of history--primarily the wars that have to be fought--\nbecause we don't understand that history. So a better education \nprovides better citizenship.\n  It can provide stronger values because we study the great books and \nthe philosophers who wrestled with the questions of what is the meaning \nof life and how we should conduct ourselves. There is a difference \nbetween right and wrong. There are truths and there are values. Young \npeople today are not reminded that in the Declaration of Independence, \nour founders said there are ``inalienable rights,'' and ``we hold these \ntruths to be self-evident.'' There were some things that are so true \nand we understand that. They were self-evident. But today, relativism \nhas begun to teach our kids that there is no real truth, there is no \ndefinite right and wrong; there are only shades of gray.\n  If society comes to believe that and bases decisions upon that \nmisunderstanding, then we cannot long survive as a free society, as a \nsociety founded on the principle that there are certain truths, and \nthat part of those truths are that there are inalienable rights that \nare given to us by our Creator--not by some government. We then begin \nto rely upon government to do things because it is the benevolence of \ngovernment that is the basis for our rights. Wrong. Government doesn't \ngive us any rights. The best we can expect from government is the \nprotection of our God-given rights. But if generations are not taught \nthat, then we won't be able to make public decisions on the same \nfoundation that our Founding Fathers understood were so important to \nfuture generations.\n  A reduction in crime. If we have a well-educated citizenry, we are \ngoing to have less crime. I think it is absolutely wrong to believe \nthat people from disadvantaged backgrounds have to be relegated to a \nlife of crime, that they somehow aren't as capable as everybody else at \nlearning and improving their lives and staying free from a life of \ncrime. It is so at odds with the fundamental precepts of our country \nthat I can't believe people would still expect less of students in \nthese kinds of communities.\n  Our proposal, as the Presiding Officer noted, is to recognize that \neverybody is entitled to an equal opportunity for education, and we \ncannot expect less of those in our most distressed areas. But if we \ndon't give them the same opportunity to go to areas where they can get \na good education and have safe schools that provide a quality \neducation, then we are, in effect, saying: You are second class, you \njust can't make it, and we are not going to bother to give you the \ntools to make it. That is fundamentally wrong and un-American.\n  Finally, a good education--if we get it right--will allow for more \npersonal fulfillment. We all want to make the very best of our God-\ngiven talents, to do the very best we can in life, because most of us, \ntoward the end of our lives, begin reflecting on why we are here and \nwhat was so important about our life and what we want to leave behind.\n  We speak in terms of legacies. The reality is that most of us begin \nsaying, well, did we make the most of what we had? We all have \nwonderful talents given to us, and we feel very good about ourselves \nand our lives if we have been able to take advantage of those talents, \nif we have fulfilled our expectations. Yet we know today we are not \nchallenging our young students as much as we could be. It is a crime to \nme that we don't challenge them to the ultimate, the maximum, so they \ncan make the most of what God has given them. We fail them if we don't \ndo that. If we are so lazy and so wrong about the way we provide an \neducational opportunity that we don't challenge them to be the very \nbest they can be, that is the worst thing we can do for our young \npeople today. That is why I said if we get education right, everything \nelse will follow in our society, and that is why I think it is the most \nimportant thing we can do.\n\n  I was asked by a journalist: If you could do one thing in public \npolicy as a member of the Federal Government, what would it be? I said: \nWell, other than ensuring our national security, which we have to put \nthat first because that is the difference between life and death for \nall of our people, I would allow real choice in education so that \npeople would be able to go to the place where they thought they could \nget the best education for their kids wherever that might be, and that \nthe Federal Government not stand in the way of the exercise of that \nchoice. And the very exercise of that choice would ensure a quality \neducation and a safe education because the people who provide the \neducation would have to rise to the challenge. They would have to \nunderstand that they would no longer be in business if people didn't \ncome to them. If students didn't come, they wouldn't be able to \neducate. But if they did a good job, the students would come. It can be \ndone.\n  I visited a school district in Arizona not long ago--the Alhambra \nSchool District--not a wealthy school district. There are a lot of \nminorities there. Carol Peck is the superintendent. She told me there \nare 39 different languages and dialects spoken at that school. Yet they \nhave achievement at that school because they have innovative \nadministrators and teachers and the kids learn.\n  We can learn lessons from that if we will allow innovation at the \nlocal level--if we will not bind them by all of these Federal rules and \nregulations. If we will lay those aside and at least let the small \namount of Federal money that goes to local schools be used in an \ninnovative way, we will begin to remove the barriers to innovation, and \nwe will provide quality education for our kids.\n  As I said in the beginning, just like welfare reform, we can succeed \nif we will just throw off the old ideas and allow innovation to prosper \nat the local level and at the parental level--and among our teachers, \nwho, after all, are on the front lines of this wonderful opportunity we \nhave.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I thought since we had a \nlittle extra time I would embellish a little bit on the remarks I made.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for setting aside this time for us to \nfocus on this particular subject, and for the great job he has done \nover the many months in which he has been in charge in the effort to \ntake some morning business time like this so we can all express \nourselves on subjects that we are about to debate. I think the upcoming \neducation debate is the most important debate we can engage in as a \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3051-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous \n     people with a historical continuity to the original \n     inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was \n     organized as a nation and internationally recognized as a \n     nation by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as \n     evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and \n     navigation.\n       ``(2) At the time of the arrival of the first non-\n     indigenous people in Hawai'i in 1778, the Native Hawaiian \n     people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient \n     subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure \n     system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.\n       ``(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian \n     Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first \n     King of Hawai`i.\n       ``(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized \n     the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, \n     which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended \n     full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawai`i, and entered into treaties and conventions with the \n     Kingdom of Hawai`i to govern friendship, commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       ``(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally \n     recognized, and indigenous government of Hawai`i, the Kingdom \n     of Hawai`i, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, \n     including United States citizens, who were assisted in their \n     efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval \n     representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. \n     Because of the participation of United States agents and \n     citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, in 1993 \n     the United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the \n     overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native \n     Hawaiians to self-determination through Public Law 103-150 \n     (107 Stat. 1510).\n       ``(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled `Joint \n     Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to \n     the United States', approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), \n     ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of \n     Hawai`i, including the government and crown lands of the \n     former Kingdom of Hawai`i, to the United States, but mandated \n     that revenue generated from the lands be used `solely for the \n     benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for \n     educational and other public purposes'.\n       ``(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined \n     from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, \n     and in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted \n     the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which \n     designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands \n     for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special \n     relationship between the United States and the Native \n     Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the \n     Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: `One thing that \n     impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the \n     island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a \n     sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and \n     many of them are in poverty.'.\n       ``(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique \n     status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June \n     20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b-1, \n     392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the \n     National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit \n     fishing in the area `only by native Hawaiian residents of \n     said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their \n     guidance.'.\n       ``(10) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands to the State of Hawai`i but reaffirmed the trust \n     relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian \n     people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, \n     including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments \n     to such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such \n     Act.\n       ``(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled `An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', \n     the United States also ceded to the State of Hawai`i title to \n     the public lands formerly held by the United States, but \n     mandated that such lands be held by the State `in public \n     trust' and reaffirmed the special relationship that existed \n     between the United States and the Hawaiian people by \n     retaining the legal responsibility to enforce the public \n     trust responsibility of the State of Hawai`i for the \n     betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined \n     in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.\n       ``(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed \n     that--\n       ``(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty \n     over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never \n     relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign \n     lands;\n       ``(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their race, but because of their unique status as \n     the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom \n     the United States has established a trust relationship;\n       ``(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawai`i;\n       ``(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is \n     comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; \n     and\n       ``(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United \n     States have--\n       ``(i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal \n     affairs; and\n       ``(ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-\n     governance that has never been extinguished.\n       ``(13) The political relationship between the United States \n     and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and \n     reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the \n     inclusion of Native Hawaiians in--\n       ``(A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     2991 et seq.);\n       ``(B) the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1996);\n       ``(C) the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 80q et seq.);\n       ``(D) the Native American Graves Protection and \n     Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);\n       ``(E) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.);\n       ``(F) the Native American Languages Act (25 U.S.C. 2901 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(G) the American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n     Hawaiian Culture and Art Development Act (20 U.S.C. 4401 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(H) the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1501 et \n     seq.) and the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. \n     2801 et seq.); and\n       ``(I) the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et \n     seq.).\n       ``(14) In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Education \n     to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native \n     Hawaiian education. The report, entitled the `Native Hawaiian \n     Educational Assessment Project', was released in 1983 and \n     documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with \n     regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests, \n     were disproportionately represented in many negative social \n     and physical statistics indicative of special educational \n     needs, and had educational needs that were related to their \n     unique cultural situation, such as different learning styles \n     and low self-image.\n       ``(15) In recognition of the educational needs of Native \n     Hawaiians, in 1988, Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus \n     F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School \n     Improvement Amendments of 1988 (102 Stat. 130) to authorize \n     and develop supplemental educational programs to address the \n     unique conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(16) In 1993, the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate \n     released a 10-year update of findings of the Native Hawaiian \n     Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the \n     successes of the programs established under title IV of the \n     Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and \n     Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the \n     same educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians. \n     Subsequent reports by the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate \n     and other organizations have generally confirmed those \n     findings. For example--\n       ``(A) educational risk factors continue to start even \n     before birth for many Native Hawaiian children, including--\n       ``(i) late or no prenatal care;\n       ``(ii) high rates of births by Native Hawaiian women who \n     are unmarried; and\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\n       ``(iii) high rates of births to teenage parents;\n       ``(B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their \n     school experience lagging behind other students in terms of \n     readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores;\n       ``(C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score below \n     national norms on standardized education achievement tests at \n     all grade levels;\n       ``(D) both public and private schools continue to show a \n     pattern of lower percentages of Native Hawaiian students in \n     the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented \n     programs;\n       ``(E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be \n     overrepresented among students qualifying for special \n     education programs provided to students with learning \n     disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional impairment, \n     and other such disabilities;\n       ``(F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepresented in \n     institutions of higher education and among adults who have \n     completed 4 or more years of college;\n       ``(G) Native Hawaiians continue to be disproportionately \n     represented in many negative social and physical statistics \n     indicative of special educational needs, as demonstrated by \n     the fact that--\n       ``(i) Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be \n     retained in grade level and to be excessively absent in \n     secondary school;\n       ``(ii) Native Hawaiian students have the highest rates of \n     drug and alcohol use in the State of Hawai`i; and\n       ``(iii) Native Hawaiian children continue to be \n     disproportionately victimized by child abuse and neglect; and\n       ``(H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 percent of the \n     students served by the State of Hawai`i Department of \n     Education, and there are and will continue to be \n     geographically rural, isolated areas with a high Native \n     Hawaiian population density.\n       ``(17) In the 1998 National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress, Hawaiian fourth-graders ranked 39th among groups of \n     students from 39 States in reading. Given that Hawaiian \n     students rank among the lowest groups of students nationally \n     in reading, and that Native Hawaiian students rank the lowest \n     among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative that \n     greater focus be placed on beginning reading and early \n     education and literacy in Hawai`i.\n       ``(18) The findings described in paragraphs (16) and (17) \n     are inconsistent with the high rates of literacy and \n     integration of traditional culture and Western education \n     historically achieved by Native Hawaiians through a Hawaiian \n     language-based public school system established in 1840 by \n     Kamehameha III.\n       ``(19) Following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i in \n     1893, Hawaiian medium schools were banned. After annexation, \n     throughout the territorial and statehood period of Hawai`i, \n     and until 1986, use of the Hawaiian language as an \n     instructional medium in education in public schools was \n     declared unlawful. The declaration caused incalculable harm \n     to a culture that placed a very high value on the power of \n     language, as exemplified in the traditional saying: `I ka \n     `olelo no ke ola; I ka `olelo no ka make. In the language \n     rests life; In the language rests death.'.\n       ``(20) Despite the consequences of over 100 years of \n     nonindigenous influence, the Native Hawaiian people are \n     determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future \n     generations their ancestral territory and their cultural \n     identity in accordance with their own spiritual and \n     traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social \n     institutions.\n       ``(21) The State of Hawai`i, in the constitution and \n     statutes of the State of Hawai`i--\n       ``(A) reaffirms and protects the unique right of the Native \n     Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their culture and \n     religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language;\n       ``(B) recognizes the traditional language of the Native \n     Hawaiian people as an official language of the State of \n     Hawai`i, which may be used as the language of instruction for \n     all subjects and grades in the public school system; and\n       ``(C) promotes the study of the Hawaiian culture, language, \n     and history by providing a Hawaiian education program and \n     using community expertise as a suitable and essential means \n     to further the program.\n\n     ``SEC. 9203.

The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have asked the chairman and the ranking \nmember to allow me to go forward briefly as we get started on this very \nimportant legislation. They have been gracious enough to allow me to do \nso.\n  I first emphasize a point I think everybody understands: Elementary \nand secondary education is very important in America. People all over \nthis country, in every State nationwide, believe education is the area \nwhere we must concentrate; we have to show better results; we have to \nhave accountability; we have to have some results that show our \nchildren are actually learning.\n  First, I will emphasize my personal background in this area. My \nmother was a schoolteacher for 19 years. As many schoolteachers, \nunfortunately, she reached a point where she needed to have more \nincome. She wound up going into bookkeeping and radio broadcasting. I \nremember quite well her many years as a teacher in elementary schools \nin my own State.\n  I had the opportunity, in three different positions, to work for the \nUniversity of Mississippi. I worked with placement and financial aid \nprograms; I worked as a recruiter; I worked with a work-study program; \nand I worked with the alumni association. I know the importance of \nthese programs.\n  I have always been supportive of financial aid programs from the \nFederal level so our children will have access to good work-study \nprograms, to grants, to loans, so every American child has an \nopportunity to further their education, whether it is at a training \nschool, community college, or a university. We have done good work in \nthat area. I think we can truly tell students when they finish high \nschool there will be an opportunity to get additional training or \neducation.\n  In one area we are still falling behind. That is in the elementary \nand secondary levels, K through 12. The statistics show that in world \ncompetition we do quite well in higher education, but in K through 12 \nwe are way behind international standards in reading, and particularly \nin math and science. We must do more in that area. I feel strongly \nabout that.\n  I went to public schools all my life. My wife went to public schools. \nBoth of our children went to public schools, from the first grade all \nthe way through college. I want to make sure we have good, quality \neducation in America. We have to do something about the reports such as \nthe ones I have been reviewing this morning.\n  According to the National Assessment of Educational Programs, 77 \npercent of children in high-poverty urban schools are reading below \nbasic levels. Test scores of 12th graders in math, reading, and writing \nhave remained stagnant or declined over the last 30 years, and our 12th \ngraders scored near dead last in international comparisons.\n  At the same time, we have spent billions of dollars--I think this \nstatistic is $120 billion or more--over those past 30 years of Federal \nfunds, not to mention what has been spent at the local and State level. \nYet the scores are stagnant or have declined in critical areas \nincluding math, reading, and writing. Fourth-grade students in high-\npoverty schools remain two grade levels behind peers in low-poverty \nschools in math. In reading, they are three or four grade levels \nbehind.\n\n  Contrary to original projections, the ESEA was designed to address \nthe achievement gap that actually is widening. There are other \nunacceptable statistics if we are going to have our children in a \nposition to have learned enough to be able to compete in the world \neconomy or whether they can even be trained to be able to get a good-\npaying job.\n  A couple of years ago, I had a request from the leaders of the \nSilicon Valley high-tech companies to meet with me. They didn't specify \nwhat the subject matter was going to be. Of course, I thought we would \ntalk computers, talk Internet, what do we do about taxes on the \nInternet, what to do about their inability to get more workers to fill \nthe jobs they had available--basically, just a computer or high-tech \ndiscussion.\n  Twelve of them sat around the table in my conference room. They \ndidn't want to talk about any other subject but education. They said: \nWe cannot get high school graduates who have the basics so we can train \nthem in this critical high-tech industry.\n  That applies, of course, to Silicon Valley in California and to the \nhigh-tech jobs we have in Northern Virginia as well as all over the \ncountry.\n  In my home area of Jackson, MS, we have such companies as SkyTel, \nBell South, MCI WorldCom. These companies have created a lot of jobs \nand great opportunities for our young people. If they don't have the \nbasics to be trained to fill the jobs, the jobs will go unfilled or we \nwill have to go with an H-1B program to bring in people from other \ncountries to fill these jobs until we can improve our system of \neducation.\n  This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously \nand have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education. We may \nhave differences, and we will have differences, about how to improve \nthe system, but let's have that debate, let's have votes, and let's not \nget distracted by other irrelevant, extraneous matter. I believe \nAmericans want that. Whether it is in my State or nationwide, polls \nshow that American people rate their concern about the quality of \neducation No. 1.\n  This is a $15 billion reauthorization bill. Good work has been done \nby the committee. I commend Chairman Jeffords, who is on the floor, \nready to proceed, and the ranking member, Senator Kennedy. They had \nmany amendments, many of which were voted down, and some of them were \nadopted. Now we have the bill ready for action. Many Members have done \nexcellent work, and we will hear from a number of them later on.\n  I have always said that education is about learning. We need to \nremember that. Some people think it is about teaching, others think it \nis about freedom of expression, but in the end the question must be, \nDoes the child learn? Is he or she getting what they need to do better \non tests and be able to get and hold a job?\n  In order to learn, there are basic necessities in a schoolroom. \nFirst, you have to have discipline. That has become a problem in \nschools all across America. If kids are squirming around or if there is \ndisruption in class, if they are talking, if they are not behaving, if \nthere is not a system of discipline, there is a problem with the \nchildren being able to learn.\n  It does require good teachers. There are a lot of great teachers, a \nlot of teachers who should be rewarded for their good work. There are \nsome teachers who have deficiencies, but we should not condemn them or \ncomplain about them. We should find a way to give them the opportunity \nto get the training they need to do a better job.\n  In my own State, the private sector has given computers to a lot of \nour schools and libraries. Many of the computers are sitting in the \nback of classrooms or in halls in the crates they came in because the \nteachers have not had a training program to teach the students how to \nuse the computers. So we need to do something about that and we are \nbeginning to get programs developed that specifically train the \nteachers in what they need to know in\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\norder to make use of these computers. That is the kind of program on \nwhich we need to focus locally and in the private sector.\n\n  We have one individual and his wife, natives of my State, who gave \n$100 million of their own personal money to, improve reading at the \nfourth grade level--not as a part of a Federal program, not as a part \nof a State program. In fact, they specifically said they didn't want to \nbe tied to some sort of match. They wanted this money, every nickel of \nit, to be used for innovative efforts to train children in the fourth \ngrade to be able to read.\n  Certainly that is commendable. We need more of that sort of thing.\n  We need to make sure our schools are safe. It is hard for me to \nbelieve the dangers that now go along with going to school. The \njuvenile justice bill had provisions that would allow assistance in \ndealing with alcohol abuse among our children, and drug programs. It \nwould have authorized the use of funds to put metal detectors at \nschools where that might be needed.\n  We have to make sure our schools are safe and drug free. It is still \nhorrifying to me to think that is a problem in many schools, not just \nat the high school level or the middle school level but even in \nelementary school. What have we come to in our society that our \nchildren in the sixth grade, fifth grade, fourth grade, are tempted or \ninvolved in using drugs? We have to make sure we have programs that are \naimed at stopping that.\n  My colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, has been active in \nthe area of trying to promote and provide assistance for drug-free \nschools.\n  We must have accountability. It is not good enough any longer to put \nmore money into programs and hope for the best. We have to see the \nresults. There has to be a connection between the money, the teaching, \nwhat is happening in the school, and how the children are doing. It is \njust not acceptable any longer that our children are not getting what \nthey need in our educational system in America. So it has to be results \noriented. There has to be some way to determine if the children are \ngetting what they need in the third or fourth grade or in the tenth \ngrade. There must be a system of identifying what is being achieved in \nour educational process.\n  There are several provisions in this particular bill on which I think \nwe should focus and we should make sure are included in the final \nversion. We should encourage our States to take full advantage of \nthese. One is the so-called Teacher Empowerment Act. This gives \nflexibility to the States and to the local schools to use over $2 \nbillion annually to develop high-quality professional programs to \nreduce class size or to fund innovative teacher programs such as \nteacher testing, merit-based teacher performance systems, or \nalternative routes to certification.\n  In different States you have different needs. In different areas \nwithin States you have different needs. In my own State, along the gulf \ncoast, what is needed perhaps is a greater reward for excellent \nteachers, or more programs for the gifted and talented. In another part \nof the State better reading programs might be needed. In another part \nthere might be a need to repair the roofs. That kind of flexibility is \nneeded, though, where the administrators, the teachers, the parents, \nand the children can make those decisions without some \nnameless, faceless bureaucrat in Washington, or Senators, saying it \nmust be used the way they say it should be used. Give them some modicum \nof flexibility. That is what this teacher empowerment provision of the \nbill would do.\n\n  We have started moving in that area. A year ago, on a bipartisan \nbasis, we passed the first Flexibility in Education Act. Now it has \nbeen expanded. I think it is showing good results. I think this bill \nwould expand it to 15 States, and I would like that to very soon be \napplicable to every State. But under the Teacher Empowerment Act, \nStates and school districts can choose to spend their money to increase \nthe number of high-quality teachers. That seems to be such a good way \nto go. It is one of the provisions in this bill that I like the most.\n  Also, we have what is known as the Straight A's provision. This has \nbeen developed by a number of Senators, but Senator Slade Gorton has \nworked in particular on it. Under this Straight A's provision, States \nor interested school districts have to establish a 5-year performance \nagreement with the Secretary of Education. This gets to the results-\noriented and child-centered point I was making earlier. There has to be \nsome way to say we are going to give flexibility, we are going to give \nadditional money to use in different ways, but there have to be \nresults. You have to show it has an impact on the children. So I think \nthat is a very good part of this bill.\n  The child-centered funding allows interested States and schools to \nuse their title I dollars to establish per-pupil amounts for \nsupplemental services for each eligible child. After all, that gets \nback to what I said at the beginning-- education is about learning. If \nthat is your goal, it has to be aimed at finding ways to help the \nchild. Maybe the traditional way we have used title I funds is not the \nbest way for it to be used nationwide. As I said earlier, test scores \nwould indicate that. In spite of all this money, the scores are \nstagnant or declining in critical areas. So that is a very important \nprovision.\n  Then, public school choice. Well over 5,000 title I schools have been \nidentified as failing schools for over 2 years; over 1,000 for over 4 \nyears, and over 100 for 10 years. What if a school is just not doing \nthe job--it is getting the local money, getting the State money, and \ngetting the Federal money, but it continues to fail. The child must \nhave some choice. That is what public school choice is all about. Why \nshould a child have to attend a school that doesn't meet his or her \nneeds and there is a better public school right down the street in the \nsame town? Why shouldn't parents and children be able to make that \nchoice?\n  I think the money should go with the child; that is who we are really \ntrying to help. It should not be aimed at the school. If a family, for \ngood reason, decides they want to choose a school that produces results \nrather than a failing school in the public school system, clearly they \nshould have that choice.\n  So these are just a few of the critical provisions in this \nlegislation that I know will be discussed. There will be amendments \noffered. Hopefully, we will improve this bill. I understand--in fact I \nknow--there is a bipartisan effort to try to come up with a bill that \nwill have Republican and Democrat support. I will be very interested in \ndeveloping a bipartisan bill. That is how we got the education \nflexibility legislation done last year. That is how we got the \neducation savings account bill done this year. This is part of our \ncontinuing effort to focus on ways to improve education. We have to do \nit.\n\n  In my State that has a lot of very poor schools, we have to do more. \nWe have to do more locally, and our State legislature and our Governor \njust signed major education legislation making a 5-year commitment to \neducation and to raising the salaries of our teachers to the \nSoutheastern regional average. That is a major commitment of funds and \na major commitment to education that has been expressed by my own \nState. I know that story is being replicated in States all across the \nNation, whether it is Minnesota or Arizona, Massachusetts or Vermont, \nAlabama or Maine. That is as it should be. But we cannot do it with the \nstatus quo.\n  That is what many Democrats are saying: Look, we have this program. \nThis is the way it has been done. We have been putting billions of \ndollars into it, but what we need is more billions of dollars to do the \nsame thing.\n  I do not accept that. Education is about innovation. Technology is \nchanging the face of the world, the face of business in America, and it \nwill change the face of education if we will allow it to do so. So the \nstatus quo? Let's just go forward. The way it always has been in \neducation is not the way to go. We should make genuine changes. We \nshould give flexibility and innovation a chance in education. I believe \nin education we can improve our quality, and it will show results soon. \nWe need it. We need it so more students will be able to get good-paying \njobs, will be able to go into the high-tech area, or manufacturing, or \nthe professional schools. This bill is going to be the third major step \nin that direction: education flexibility last year, education savings \naccounts earlier this year, and now basic, child-centered programs in \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\n  I hope we will have a good debate. I hope we will stay focused on \neducation. I look forward to hearing the opening remarks of the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member.\n  Mr. President, I thank them for allowing me to go forward at this \ntime. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my leader for his very eloquent \nstatement on the status of education and the importance of this \nlegislation. I am hopeful we will all work together in a bipartisan \nmanner to come out with legislation on which we can all agree.\n  Today, the Senate begins debate of S. 2, the Educational \nOpportunities Act. This legislation deals with every aspect of federal \nassistance to our nation's elementary and secondary schools.\n  There is perhaps no subject more on the minds of the American public \nthan education. As a nation, we have long recognized that the quality \nof our future depends upon the quality of the education provided to our \nchildren. From our very earliest days, schoolhouses were among the \nfirst buildings to spring up in budding communities.\n  Federal involvement in elementary and secondary education can be \ntraced back to the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, one of \nthe first laws passed by the Continental Congress. The Northwest \nOrdinance required each township within the territory to reserve one \nsquare mile for the establishment of public schools. Under the \nNorthwest Ordinance law, 77 million acres of land were set aside for \npublic education.\n  Since 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, has \nprovided the foundation for Federal efforts to help children succeed in \nschool. Currently, we provide about $14.3 billion annually for ESEA \nprograms. This is a substantial investment which deserves the careful \nattention of all Members.\n  Over half, $7.9 billion, of these funds is used on behalf of \ndisadvantaged children under the title I program. Congress created the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act in order to serve these \nchildren, and they remain the primary focus of our efforts. Other \nactivities supported through ESEA include professional development, \nliteracy, safe and drug-free schools, bilingual education, impact aid, \naid to special populations, and technology.\n  In preparation for this legislation, the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions held 25 hearings on ESEA programs to \nexamine each aspect of the Act with a view toward keeping what works, \nrevising what does not, and adding what is necessary to meet emerging \nneeds.\n  In addition, I have devoted a great deal of time talking with \nstudents, parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, school board \nmembers, state-level school officials, and Governors. I have traveled \nall over the country doing this. In particular, I have listened to \nthose in my home state of Vermont who work every day to make elementary \nand secondary school the best it can be.\n  What I have heard from Vermonters and others around the country is \nthat schools need to be held accountable for the performance of all \ntheir students, that education programs must show positive results, and \nthat quality teachers and school leaders are essential to the success \nof any school. I have also been reminded that the 7-cents on the dollar \nprovided by the Federal government is not going to do the job \nsinglehandedly. To achieve these objectives, states and localities must \nhave sufficient flexibility to tailor solutions to meet their \nindividual circumstances.\n  The advice I received is reflected in the programs and themes \nincluded in the Educational Opportunities Act. The primary objectives \nof this bill are:\n  One, to maintain and strengthen the title I reform process initiated \nin 1994 which emphasizes the establishment of high standards and \nassessments designed to measure progress towards those standards;\n  Two, to promote the sustained professional development of teachers \nand school leaders;\n  Three, to help assure that students are provided a safe and drug-free \nlearning environment;\n  Four, to place an emphasis on getting results by insisting that \nactivities and programs supported with federal funds are based on \ntheory, research, and evaluation showing them to be effective in \nmeeting their objectives; and\n  Five, to increase State and local flexibility in the use of Federal \nfunds in exchange for greater accountability for improving student \nperformance.\n  We would all agree that our schools must be held accountable for \nensuring the academic success of all students. Like many others, I am \ndisappointed that our students are not performing at the levels they \nshould be and that Federal efforts to serve disadvantaged students have \nnot shown better results.\n  Congress has long recognized the need to raise standards. The alarm \nwas raised in the Nation at Risk report issued in 1983. The admonition \nwas given in these terse words: If a foreign government had imposed on \nus our educational system we would have declared it an act of war. In \n1989, then-President Bush called together the Nation's Governors to an \neducation summit from which national education goals for the year 2000 \nwere set.\n  In 1994, Congress substantially revised the title I program by \nfocusing on standards, assessment, and professional development. The \n1994 legislation set out a 7-year timetable for States to develop \nstudent content and performance standards and assessments aligned to \nthose standards. The idea was to determine what students should know \nand be able to do and then to hold schools accountable for results by \ntesting students against these standards.\n  In addition, States and local school districts are to identify \nfailing schools, known as schools in need of improvement, to offer \nextra assistance to those schools, and to take corrective action if the \nschools fail to improve over a 2-year period. Corrective action may \ninclude implementing a new curriculum, restructuring the school, \nimplementing a joint plan that addresses specific student performance \nproblems, reconstituting school staff, or decreasing decisionmaking \nauthority at the school level. If permitted under State or local law, \ncorrective action at the school district level may also include \nreducing or withholding funds from a school or abolishing the school. \nAt the State level, again subject to State and local law, corrective \naction may include reducing or withholding funds from a school \ndistrict, abolishing the district, removing particular schools from its \njurisdiction, or appointing a receiver or trustee.\n  We are now midstream in this reform process. To date, 48 States have \napproved content standards, 25 States have approved performance \nstandards, and no States have approved assessments. Assessments are not \nrequired under the law until the 2001-2002 school year.\n  The proposal approved by the committee ``stays the course'' with \nrespect to these fundamental reforms, while building upon them in ways \nwhich will not sidetrack the activities well underway at the State and \nlocal levels. The revisions made to title I are designed to demonstrate \nthat we are serious about holding children to high standards and \npressuring for reform of failing schools--without creating mandates \nthat force States and localities to start all over under a new set of \nrules and reporting requirements. Recognizing the expense of these \nendeavors, the measure also offers additional assistance for school \nimprovement and assessment activities so that schools will be able to \nkeep in stride with the 7-year reform schedule.\n  Other revisions in title I emphasize the importance of parental \ninvolvement, including the creation of a separate part in the Title \nwhich is exclusively devoted to this issue. Title I also contains a new \npart which highlights the Comprehensive School Reform program. This \nprogram provides support for schools to put in place schoolwide reform \nprograms which are backed up by research showing them to be effective.\n  Not just in title I, but throughout the bill, there is an emphasis on \ngetting results. Activities and programs supported with Federal funds \nare to be based on theory, research, and evaluation showing them to be \neffective in meeting their objectives, particularly as they relate to \nimproving student achievement and performance.\n  The bill also supports efforts to enhance teacher quality, which is \none of the most critical tasks facing us. Nothing will change in the \nclassroom until\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nthe teachers change. And the teachers can't be expected to change until \nthey have help in knowing what is expected of them.\n  We made a strong start in this regard during the last Congress by \ncompletely revamping federal support for teacher preparation activities \nas part of our work on the Higher Education Act. We now have the \nopportunity to focus on the professional development of teachers \nalready in the classroom.\n  This legislation is designed to step away from one-time, short-term \nactivities and, instead, promote the sustained professional development \nshown to be effective in improving teacher skills and content \nknowledge.\n  Recognizing that the need for professional development is not limited \nto teachers, the bill includes a new professional development \ninitiative directed toward principals and superintendents. As we all \nknow, a good school always has a first-rate principal, and a first-rate \nschool district always has an outstanding and innovative \nsuperintendent.\n  Funding for professional development activities is increased by \nincluding funds currently allocated for the class-size reduction \nprogram. Schools will still have the ability to hire teachers with \nFederal funds. If that is where their need lies, I am sure they will do \njust that. What I have heard in Vermont, however, is that the biggest \nneed is not for more teachers--but rather for better ones. That is a \nchoice that I believe Vermont and the other States across the country \nare in a better position to make than we are here in Congress. This \nbill leaves that choice squarely in their hands.\n  The goal of assuring a safe and drug-free learning environment is \npromoted in this legislation through a strengthening of the provisions \nof title IV, Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities. These \nimprovements are the result of the bipartisan efforts of several \nMembers, spearheaded by Senators DeWine, Dodd, and Murray. \nModifications are made to increase accountability, to ensure that \nresearched-based programs are funded, to provide States with greater \nflexibility in targeting violence and drug use, and to increase \ncommunity participation in prevention programs.\n  Finally, this legislation takes a number of significant steps to \nincrease flexibility in exchange for greater accountability. It does so \nin the recognition that national programs which offer assistance for \nspecific activities are limited in their ability to capture the \ndiversity of individual needs in States and localities throughout the \ncountry.\n  The bill substantially increases funding for the Innovative Education \nProgram Strategies provisions of title VI. This program is the most \nflexible of all current Federal education programs, permitting local \nschools to undertake the activities most likely to improve their \nschools and enhance the performance of their students. These funds are \nput to work where the need is greatest--be it technology or library \nbooks or teacher training.\n  The bill consolidates into title VI the waiver and related \nauthorities now located in various titles of current law, making it \neasier for States and localities to find and review their options for \nmaking Federal dollars work more effectively for them.\n  Title VI also includes several new options for flexible use of \nFederal funds. For example, a new rural flexibility initiative offers \nsmall rural districts the chance to combine the small amounts they \nmight receive under specific categorical grant programs to amass a \nchunk of funds large enough to really address a priority need.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act authorizes formula and \ncompetitive grants that allow many of our local school districts to \nimprove the education of their students. These federal grants support \nefforts to promote goals such as the professional development of \nteachers, the incorporation of technology into the classroom, gifted \nand talented programs, and making sure our schools provide safe \nlearning environments for our children. Schools receive several \ncategorical grants supporting these programs, each with its own \nauthorized activities.\n  As valuable as these programs are for thousands of predominantly \nurban and suburban school districts, they simply do not work well in \nrural areas. This is because the grants are based on school district \nenrollment. These individual grants confront smaller schools with a \ndilemma; namely, they simply may not receive enough funding from any \nsingle grant to carry out meaningful activities. The rural flexibility \ninitiative allows a district to combine the funds from four categorical \nprograms and use the funds to support projects that bring about \nimproved academic achievement.\n  If we are to ensure that our children have the skills and knowledge \nthey need to succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we must all \nwork together to lay a sound foundation at the elementary and secondary \nschool level. The Federal Government is just one among the many \npartners with a responsibility to assure that we succeed. Although the \ntotal Federal investment pales by comparison to the support offered by \nState and local taxpayers, the $14 billion to $15 billion we do provide \nrepresents a substantial sum by anyone's accounting.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to play a constructive role in helping \nto bring about the improvements we all want to see in elementary and \nsecondary education. I realize there are many ideas regarding how we \nmight achieve this goal. My hope is that, in debating our differences, \nwe will not lose sight of our mutual goal of supporting a system of \neducation which is second to none.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I express appreciation to \nthe majority leader for calling up this legislation.\n  As has been mentioned by the majority leader, and now by the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Jeffords, I think this is a matter of very \nsignificant importance to families all over this country. Hopefully, \nthe next several days will be a good opportunity for them to develop a \nbetter understanding and awareness as to exactly what we are trying to \ndo to enhance academic achievement in our public schools across the \nNation.\n  I pay tribute to the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, who \nhas had, over a long period of time, a distinguished career and who has \nplaced the whole issue of quality education as one of his top \npriorities. We have areas of differences, but I think all of us, \ncertainly on this side, have enormous respect for his continued \nleadership on the important areas of education. So it is always a \npleasure to work with him. We have some important differences on this \nparticular legislation, but all of us, at the start of this debate, \nacknowledge both the breadth of his understanding of this issue and his \nstrong commitment.\n  We look forward to this debate. I know today we will have general \ndebate and discussion. I think that is important. Hopefully, at the end \nof the day, Members of the Senate will have a much clearer idea and \nawareness as to the two very significant and dramatic differences of \nhow we want to use scarce Federal resources, the $14 billion or $15 \nbillion. It is a lot of money, but in a budget of $1.8 trillion it is \nstill a rather small amount. But, nonetheless, it does represent about \n7 cents out of every $1 that is spent at the local level. It is \nimportant that we try to appropriate it as well as we possibly can.\n  I think we have seen times in the past where we have had some \nimportant successes; we have also seen times in the past where we have \nnot. But I think as a result of those times, those failures, today we \nare in a position to make recommendations to this body as to how best \nwe can use the scarce resources.\n  There are two very dramatic differences in approach, which I think we \nwill try to spell out in the time we have available to us this \nafternoon.\n  First of all, I will make a brief comment with regard to the majority \nleader. He does not engage himself often in the debate and discussion \nof policy issues. He expresses his viewpoints, but he is not as active, \nin most policy matters, as he is on education. We appreciate that. We \nhave areas of difference, but, nonetheless, when we do debate the \nissues on education, he is engaged and involved. It is important that \nhis involvement in this be recognized at the outset.\n\n  I remind the Senate, however, of the two pieces of legislation he \nmentioned\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\nin terms of the achievements of the Congress. One was the Ed-Flex \nlegislation we passed over a year ago. We have had three States that \nhave taken advantage of that particular provision--only one State until \nfairly recently; two more States have come in. The most notable State \nto take advantage of it was North Carolina. There have been 12 States \nthat have effectively taken advantage of the 1994 Act, and there hasn't \nbeen a single State or an educational community that actually has been \nturned down under Ed-Flex. I am glad we passed the legislation.\n  Maybe during the course of the debate, we will find out that the \nprincipal hindrance, in terms of providing greater cooperation and the \ncommingling of funds at the local level, is the fact that the States \nthemselves have failed to match what we have done in providing Ed-Flex. \nIt is important to recognize that that has been the situation.\n  In the GAO report about what local communities want at the local \nlevel, they name as No. 1, resources; No. 2, programs that have \ndemonstrated effectiveness in local communities and enhance \nlegislation; No. 3, additional training for administrative skills. They \ndon't mention the flexibility issue. We are glad that there is \nflexibility, but in that report they also point out that the States \nthemselves are the ones that have been extremely reluctant to deal with \ntheir own problems.\n  The GAO report reviewed 15 States and found only 1 State that had \nreally taken action in order to knock down the hindrances for that \nState to be able to work most effectively with Federal funds in that \nlocal community.\n  Secondly, on the savings account legislation, that piece of \nlegislation was bid up from $1.2 billion over 10 years to $23 billion \nwhen it finally left the Senate floor, in a period of 3 days, without \nany corresponding offsets--just $23 billion. Many of us have been \ntrying to get a prescription drug benefit of some measure. Certainly \nthat $23 billion for the senior citizens would have gone a lot further \nthan the $23 billion which is mostly a tax break for wealthy \nindividuals. The way that it is constructed, it will not guarantee a \nsingle additional pencil for a schoolhouse in this nation. It will not \nguarantee a new teacher for any classroom. It will not guarantee an \nhour of afterschool programs.\n  What it will do is provide some generous tax breaks for very wealthy \npeople in order to, under the definitions, try to develop educational \nprograms devised by themselves to enhance the academic achievement for \neither members of their family or develop a voucher program.\n  The Joint Tax Committee pointed out, during the course of the debate, \nthat half of the money that would come under the education savings \naccounts would go to private schools. Half would go to public schools. \nWe know 90 percent of the children go to public schools. I think those \ntwo pieces of legislation are very marginal--a generous word--in terms \nof dealing with the serious problems about which parents are the most \nconcerned relative to the record of this Congress on education.\n  There is very little with which we might differ in terms of the \nmajority leader's desire and the statement made by my friend from \nVermont about enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment. The \nreal question is how that best can be done.\n  It is my opinion--and, I think, the opinion of many of those on this \nside of the aisle--that the proposition before the Senate this \nafternoon is a step back from what we have at the present time.\n  We know we have made some progress since 1994, when we put in place \nsome tough accountability standards at the local level and other kinds \nof requirements in the implementation and the utilization of title I. \nNow, under the proposal of the majority, they are moving back, \nsignificantly eliminating and reducing the requirements which had been \napplicable at the local level, that ensured Title I funds were used \neffectively to enhance academic achievement. They have effectively \nwiped those out, even though they say there is a hold harmless \nprovision on where the funds will go. The kinds of assurances for how \nthese funds can be used, and used effectively, have been wiped out. In \nplace, what they have done is given the prime responsibility to the \nGovernors. This is the major change.\n\n  With this proposal that has been advanced by Republicans, we are \nsaying that we are going to give the funds to the States and let the \nGovernors make the judgment and decision about how those funds are \ngoing to be spent.\n  We hear a great deal about the importance of local control. We hear a \ngreat deal about parental involvement. We hear a great deal about what \nis important in local communities. That is great rhetoric, but what we \nhave to do is look at what the legislation says. That ought to be the \npoint of the debate.\n  Let us refer to the legislation. On page 618, Determination of State \nParticipation:\n\n       The Governor of a State, in consultation with the \n     individual or body responsible for the education programs of \n     the State under State law, shall determine whether the State \n     shall participate in the performance agreement.\n       Now let's say the State makes its judgment about what they \n     are going to include in their application. Look on page 632, \n     Uses of Funds Under Agreement:\n       Funds made available to a State under this part shall be \n     used for educational purposes, including--(1) carrying out \n     activities focused on improved student learning; (2) \n     providing new books. . . .\n\n  We can ask ourselves, why not let them do that? The answer is very \nclear. We learned a lesson on why we should not do that. From 1965 to \n1969, that is exactly what we did do--let the States use the funds for \nany educational purpose.\n  Referring to the excellent report on title I of ESEA, Is It Helping \nPoor Children, the Washington Research Project points out that funds \nwere used for purchasing tape recorders (14 tape recorders in \nMilwaukee), purchasing three tubas in Alabama, purchasing football \nuniforms, band uniforms for $35,000, and the list goes on--in another \nState, 18 swimming pools in the summer shall be used for educational \npurposes without any limitation.\n  So the State moves ahead. They decide what they are going to use the \nfunds for; it is going to be decided by the State.\n  What kind of a review will we have to find out what they are doing? \nAll we have to do is look at page 637 to find out what the States are \ngoing to do, Performance Review:\n\n       At the end of the third year for which a performance \n     partnership agreement is in effect for a State, the Secretary \n     shall prepare a written performance review of the activities \n     carried out under the agreement.\n\n  Isn't that wonderful? Doesn't that really have teeth in it? After 3 \nyears, the State is going to have a review of the activities carried \nout under the agreement. Then if the Secretary determines in the \nperformance review that it isn't complete or it doesn't meet the \nagreements, there is, on 639, the real kick-in, the real tough action.\n  This is what it says:\n\n       The Secretary shall prepare a second written performance \n     review for the State of the activities [shall be developed].\n\n  This is the legislation, Mr. President.\n  Finally, on page 640, it says:\n\n       Renewal Requirements.--The Secretary shall renew the \n     agreement for an additional 5-year term, if (1) at the end of \n     the 5-year term described in subsection (a), or as soon after \n     the term as is practical, the State submits the data required \n     under the agreement; and (2) the Secretary determines, on the \n     basis of the data, that the State that has made substantial \n     progress--\n\n  What is substantial progress? If they have made, according to the \nSecretary of Education, substantial progress, there they go again for \nanother 5 years. Where is local control in here? Where is parental \ninvolvement in here? Tell me where are we going to get the guarantee \nfor teachers, smaller classes, or afterschool programs in there?\n  They say: Well, Senator, you have to understand that States know \nbest. Well, there have been some notable exceptions, so let's take a \nlook at what the States have done on this. First of all, the reason we \nhave Title I is because we decided in 1965 that the needs of \ndisadvantaged children were not being addressed. Then we took action in \n1965 with a block grant to the States. That was a disaster. So we came \nback with more targeted programs, some of which have been successful, \nsome of which, have not. What has happened along the way? We have seen \nan expansion of the title I program. We have reached out to take into\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\ncoverage the migratory children's programs, the homeless children, the \nimmigrant programs. Why? Because the States failed to meet those \npriorities.\n  In March of 1987, the Center for Law and Education sent out a \nquestionnaire regarding State practices of policies for homeless \nchildren to the chief State offices in the 50 States and the District \nof Columbia and received 23 responses. The majority of the respondents, \nhowever, had no statewide data on the number of homeless children \nwithin their jurisdiction, or whether those children were able to \nobtain an education. The majority of States had no uniform plan for \nensuring that homeless students received an education.\n  The same was true with how States were serving the needs of migrant \nchildren. We weren't properly addressing the needs of homeless \nchildren, migrant children, or immigrant children, and so they became \neligible for educational services in targeted programs because they \nwere determined to be disadvantaged children. Are we going to continue \naddressing the critical needs of these special populations under this \nproposed legislation? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. This legislation \neliminates those special programs. They aren't going to continue those \nprograms in spite of the fact that States historically have done little \nto address the needs of children in those areas. That has been true \nregarding programs that would help all three of those groups. \nNonetheless, we are going to wipe those out.\n  In 1986, let's look at what the States were going to do in terms of \ntrying to intervene in failing schools. This is 1986. Listen to the \nnational NGA report. It was chaired by Governors Alexander, Clinton, \nKing, and Riley. All four Governors had solid records in terms of \neducation. They spearheaded the efforts for the Governors' report. They \nrecommended that each Governor intervene in low-performing schools and \nschool districts --that is what title I is all about--and to take over \nor close down, academically bankrupt school districts.\n  Well, in 1987, nine States had the authority to take over and annex \neducationally deficient schools or school districts. In 1990, here go \nthe Governors again. Educating America; State strategies for achieving \nnational education goals. The task force was co-chaired by Governors \nClinton and Campbell. Rewards, sanctions, linkages to school, academic \nperformance, including providing assistance and support to low-\nperforming schools and State takeovers--these do not improve student \nachievement. In 1988, 18 States offered technical assistance or \nintervention. In 1998--12 years after the Governors quit caring about \npoor children as a top priority, we are about to send it all back to \nthem. That is what this legislation does--sends it back to them.\n\n  In 1998, NGA policy supports the State focus on schools. Reiterating \na position first taken in 1988, NGA policy says States should have the \nresponsibility on accountability and clear penalties for sustained \nfailure to improve student performance. In 1999, well, we have 19 \nStates that have procedures for intervening. In the year 2000, 20 \nStates provide some form of assistance to low-performing schools. \nIncluded in there are States applying some type of schoolwide sanctions \nto low-performing schools.\n  That is what the States have been doing in the last 12 years. Now we \nare having a recommendation by the Republicans--with that as a failed \ntrack record--let's send it all back to them.\n  That is absolutely crazy, Mr. President. It is absolutely crazy. We \nshould have learned something from the various actions of the States. \nStates report that school support teams are able to serve only half of \nthe schools in need of improvement.\n  Now, in 1999, here is the final report on the assessment of title I. \nIn this assessment, among the schools reported on in the 1998 survey \nthat have been identified as a need of improvement, less than half \nreported that they had received additional professional development or \ntechnical assistance as a result of being identified for improvement \nfrom the States. I mean, this is a year ago, when the local \ncommunities' title I were asked--the ones that have been in the most \ntroubled circumstances--what do the States provide, more than half of \nthem said they never heard from the States. That is an indication of \nthe States' interest.\n  We are turning all of this money over to the States and we naively \nthink they will take care of all disadvantaged children. We are giving \nthem a blank check, revenuesharing, a block grant when we are up \nagainst this kind of record. The list goes on. We could go through \nthis, but I don't think we will be all that surprised with the results.\n  We went through this a short time ago--our block grant to States in \nterms of tobacco funds. Many of us are trying to identify those funds \nthat ought to go to children, or children's health, or children's \neducation. We were rolled on that particular thing. Now we find out \nthey are laying more sidewalks in the State of California. That list \ngoes on. What happens? What priority do these children get in terms of \nthe States? They didn't get any priority when this bill was passed in \n1965, and they are being shortchanged today, even with requirements \nthat the funds go down to the local community. This legislation is \ngoing to effectively give it all to the States, as I mentioned. I think \nthat is basically and fundamentally in error. As I mentioned, what are \nwe trying to do?\n  Let me point out a couple of other items. If a State opts to \nparticipate in the Straight A's block grant, the accountability \nprovisions, which, as indicated, are insignificant, apply only at the \nState level. Therefore, a State could demonstrate statewide overall \nprogress based on progress being made by wealthier communities, while a \nlack of progress in disadvantaged communities remains statistically \nhidden. Do we understand that?\n  That means the State, in giving its progress requirement--which is a \nrather amorphous kind of definition--can use statewide figures and can \nalso be selective with the particular school districts they are going \nto include in their report. You can say that can't be so, that just \ncan't be so. It is so.\n  On pages 625 and 640, Straight A's contains general language \nsupporting efforts to close achievement gaps, but there is no real \nrequirement that the gaps are closed. The goals for student performance \nare set at the State level and there is little repercussion for \nfailure. In addition, the proposal would free participants from current \nlaw requiring inclusion of all students in State assessments. That is \none of the matters that is now going to be put aside.\n  Under the block grant proposal, ``all students'' is defined as ``all \nstudents attending public or charter schools that are participating in \nthe State's assessment system.'' There are no provisions requiring \nStates to include all students in that assessment system. Therefore, \nthe States could exclude students from assessment without any \naccountability for their performance.\n  Talk about a shell game--they have general language about what the \nStates have to do in order to get the next big chunk of money from \nUncle Sam.\n  Take a look at what the States have to do in terms of giving their \nreport where they can be selective about who is going to be in and who \nis going to be out to try to meet that requirement effectively. It is, \nas we have mentioned, an absolute blank check.\n  We have learned year in and year out that when you give a blank check \non education, it isn't the neediest and the poorest children who are \ngoing to get it. That is why we have all of the various GAO studies \nshowing that in targeting funds, Federal funds are targeted seven times \nmore to poorer children than State funds expended on education. At the \nFederal level, with scarce resources, we decided those are going to be \nthe priorities. They present an extraordinary challenge of what we can \ndo and what we can achieve. I think that is a very legitimate debate.\n  But on our side, we have attempted to say we are going to provide to \nparents some guarantees in the area of education, some guarantees on \nsmaller class size, some guarantees on teacher training, some \nguarantees on afterschool programs, some guarantees in terms of \naccountability, and hopefully to try to ensure that we were going to \nhave safe schools and safe and drug-free schools. We are also going to \ndo something about meeting the challenges which so many of our students \nface with buildings that are in a state of collapse, are antiquated, \nand should\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nnot be used for purposes of educating children. Those are guarantees.\n  The Senate has a choice: Are we going to, on the one hand, give the \nblank check to the States, or, on the other hand, are we going to \nfollow the tried and tested programs that have demonstrated results for \nchildren at the local level?\n  I want to mention what we have done on our side with regard to the \nissue of accountability.\n  First of all, our framework requires States to set goals for student \nperformance progress on the local level and school districts to set \ngoals for student progress for each school.\n  You will hear the rhetoric about how wonderfully we are doing with \nschools. Here it is. We will give the reference for the various pages. \nLet me go through them.\n  If the school or district fails to make progress within 2 years, \ndistricts and States must take action to assist the school or district, \nand supplemental resources are provided. Research-based school \nimprovement strategies must be implemented.\n  If they are going to implement from a range of different options, \nthey have to have demonstrated success in the past based upon solid \nresearch. Then they can be used in the local communities.\n\n  If the school or district continues to fail, the district or State \nmust impose sanctions. The governance structure of the district or \nschool must be changed, intensive professional development must be \nprovided to the school's faculty, and parents must be given the option \nto send their children to the higher performing public schools.\n  Effectively, if they are unable to be turned around at the end of the \n5-year period, they will be on probation after the 3 years. If they are \nunable to do that, the school is effectively closed. The children will \nhave to go to another school, or the States will come in and reverse \nthat situation.\n  Quite frankly, that has worked. In the State of North Carolina, they \nhave 14 schools which they have had to go into and close down. Of the \n14 schools they have closed, 12 of them are now above the State average \nin terms of performance.\n  We are building on programs that have been tried and have \ndemonstrated success. That is the way we are approaching the \nunderserved schools and school districts. Our bill strengthens the \ncurrent title I accountability system, and States are required to \ndemonstrate progress and student achievement in each school and each \ndistrict so that no community is left behind.\n  Our bill requires goals for student progress, not just in the \naggregate, but also for economically disadvantaged, racial and ethnic \ngroups, and limited-English-proficient students. This step is necessary \nto ensure that progress is made in narrowing existing achievement gaps. \nStates are also required to submit a report identifying students \nexcluded from assessments. If for some reason they are going to let \nstudents out of these assessments, they are going to have to be \nidentified. This is to guarantee that the system is not being gamed.\n  That is what is happening. We sort of know it in some places where \nthey have the various tests and the kids are being taught to take a \nparticular test. There is a great deal of gaming going on in the \nsystem. We have to do everything we can to make sure that is not the \ncase. This is to guarantee that the system is not being gamed by the \npractice of discarding the scores of certain students or outright \nexcluding them from the assessment in order to improve the aggregate \nresult.\n  It establishes significant consequences for failure--freezes \nadministrative funds and requires the Secretary to withhold an \nincreasing proportion of Federal funds for administrative expenses each \nsuccessive year the States fails to meet the deadlines.\n  It requires accountability at the district and school level, not just \nthe State level, by requiring LEAs to undertake corrective actions to \nreform specific failing schools and requiring States to undertake \ncorrective actions to reform failing school districts. Under these \nprovisions, the school district would be required to take action that \nwould change the governance structure of failing schools;\n  It establishes report cards to inform parents about the quality of \ntheir schools and their progress in meeting student achievement goals. \nOur plan also requires notification to parents when either the district \nor school that their child is enrolled in is undergoing corrective \nactions.\n  This body doesn't see the difference between what is in the \nRepublican proposal versus the kind of accountability we are talking \nabout in our proposal. There are light years in difference. If we are \ngoing to be serious about these funds, we need to move ahead to make \nsure we are going to have support for programs that will make a \ndifference for children.\n  With regard to the opening comments about accountability, I hope our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are going to spare us a lot of \ndiscussion about local control and parent involvement because it just \nisn't there, it just isn't there. It might be there in the minds of \npeople, but it isn't there in terms of legislation. It just isn't \nthere. We want to put it there. We know how to put it there. If we want \nto do that, that is all well and good. We welcome the opportunity. We \ntried to do that in the course of the program.\n  I will make a brief comment about some of the challenges that remain. \nWe still have a long way to go. We are strongly committed to deal with \nthose issues. Let me mention what happened in some areas and some \ncommunities.\n  In Connecticut, reading scores went up when the State had a major \ninvestment in attracting the Nation's best and brightest teachers. That \nhas been recognized generally by all those in education. They have done \nthe most effective job in ensuring a well trained teacher in every \nclassroom. Experts are reaching the conclusion that is an indicator as \nto how much the children have moved up. Important research has \nsupported that concept.\n  The bottom line is, with well trained teachers who are certified by \nthe States--which is the case in our bill, not in their bill--in every \nclassroom, the students' scores increase. Our legislation, that will be \nintroduced by Senator Daschle in the form of a substitute to the \nunderlying legislation, will have certification by the States within \nthe 5-year period.\n  In Boston, MA, at the Harriet Baldwin School, there is a program that \nserves 283 students; 93 percent are minorities, and 80 percent are \neligible for free or reduced-price lunches. From 1996 to 1998, their \nmath and reading improved substantially above the national median. In \n1996, 66 percent of third graders scored at math levels I and II with \nlittle or partial mastery of basic skills; in 1998, 100 percent scored \nat levels III and IV with solid performance, superior performance, \nbeyond grade level. In 1997, 75 percent of the fourth graders were at \nlevel I and II and with only 25 percent at high proficiency. In 1998, \nmore than 50 percent were at higher levels of proficiency.\n  We find programs with tough accountability, good teachers, and \nsmaller class, we are seeing superb results.\n  One of the underlying differences between the bill presented by our \nRepublican friends and our proposal is with regard to the professional \ndevelopment. That is a key element. Hopefully, we will have an \nopportunity to address that issue independently as the debate goes on. \nIt is of special importance as we consider the underlying legislation.\n  Our Republican colleagues argue that the block grants provide the \nneeded flexibility to improve teacher quality. The Republican Teacher \nEmpowerment Act gives so much flexibility that States do not have to do \nanything to change their current practices. They can continue hiring \nuncertified teachers and continue providing low-quality, ineffective \nprofessional development and mentoring. They can use most of the funds \nfor a large variety of purposes that dilute the focus and attention on \nimproving the recruitment and mentoring and professional development of \nteachers.\n  Why is this so? The proposed Teacher Empowerment Act does not \nguarantee any substantial funds for professional development. Page 210 \nsays, for professional development activities:\n\n       Each local educational agency that receives a subgrant to \n     carry out the subpart shall use a portion of the funds made \n     available through the subgrant for professional development. \n     . . .\n\n  They qualify with ``use a portion'' of the funds. We don't know what \nthat\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\n``portion'' of the funds is. It does not guarantee funds for mentoring \nprograms, one of the most effective teacher professional development \nactivities. Studies show, without mentoring programs, half of all the \nnew teachers in urban and poor areas drop out within the first 5 years. \nPut in effective mentoring programs, and 70 to 75 percent of the \nteachers are staying in the schools, according to studies.\n  Regarding mentoring, programs that provide mentoring to newly hired \nteachers, such as mentoring for master teachers, are merely allowed. \nMentoring is only ``allowed,'' not required, even though virtually all \nof the major studies show that mentoring programs work.\n  It does not guarantee funds for recruitment programs, it just allows \nthe use of the funds. It does not guarantee that teachers are trained \nto address the needs of children with disabilities. Our bill guarantees \nthat teachers are trained to meet the needs of children with \ndisabilities and limited English proficient children.\n  It does not hold States accountable for having a qualified teacher in \nevery classroom. It does not even require teachers to be certified. \nImagine that. I was listening to the majority leader talk about the \nimportance of having good teachers in every classroom. Their proposal \ndoes not even require that teachers be certified in Mississippi.\n  It also does not require a substantial priority for math and science \ntraining. No one can look at the challenges that underserved children \nare facing in our schools in urban and rural areas and not understand \nthat in math and science there are special needs. Talk to any educator \nwho has dealt with the problems of urban education, and they will say \nyou need someone who will be teaching math and science. We provide an \nallocation for the math and science teachers, giving them the first \npriority. They don't require any substantial priority for math and \nscience training.\n  Their proposal does not require accountability. Instead, it promotes \nineffective activities through the TOPS Program that are contrary to \npromising practices by supporting individually selected strategies for \nteachers. That means if you are a teacher in Chicopee and decide you \nwould find a program you think is pretty good for elsewhere in \nMassachusetts, be my guest, you can take it. It gives them all the \nflexibility on this to be able to go out there and take it, instead of \nusing what has been the recognized way of enhancing academic \nachievement and professional development; that is, having it school-\nrelated, tied to the curriculum, working with teachers, working with \nstudents. That is what all the studies, teachers, and scholars alike \nhave said.\n  Not under the Republican program; it is business as usual. They have \nused the programs in various communities around the country. I hope \nthose who are trying to defend the Republican program will be able to \ndemonstrate how and where their effectiveness has been. It hasn't been \nthere. It is not there. But they have accepted that. That, I think, \nreally fails to meet the basic thrust of the importance of a qualified \nteacher.\n\n  There are others who want to speak, but let me just spend a few \nminutes on what we have done on teachers. In our particular program \nwith regard to recruitment and professional development, to help \nschools and districts States can keep up to 6 percent for State \nactivities, including strategies to raise teacher salaries, improve \nalternate routes to State certification, and reduce the numbers of \nteachers placed out of field or who are emergency credentialed. It \nrequires the first $300 million will be used for professional \ndevelopment, mentoring, and recruitment in math and science, and it \nrequires 60 percent of State funds be used for high-quality \nprofessional development and mentoring activities. That is funds that \nwould go by formula to districts on the basis of 80-percent poverty and \n20-percent population.\n  It guarantees that 30 percent of the State funds go for State-run \ncompetitive local recruitment programs to high-need districts and to \nrecruit and train high-need candidates. It guarantees teachers are \ntrained to address the needs of children with disabilities, female \nstudents, and other students with special needs and bilingual programs. \nIt holds States accountable for having a qualified teacher within 4 \nyears of enactment of the law, otherwise their funds halt in this \nprogram. They are accountable for having a qualified teacher in every \nclassroom within 4 years of enactment of the law. It holds local \ndistricts accountable for results. They may not hire any teachers who \nare not qualified using title II funds.\n  If we needed something to say we need to give a high priority to \nwell-trained teachers, all we have to do is just look at the Wall \nStreet Journal of about a month ago. It is dated February 29, ``Schools \nTo Turn To Temp Agency For Substitute Teachers.''\n\n       Most school districts begin every day with a nerve-wracking \n     hunt for substitutes to fill in for absent teachers. With the \n     tight labor market making the task especially tough, a few \n     are starting to outsource the job. Kelly Temp Services \n     unveiled the first nationwide substitute teacher program, and \n     now handles screening and schedules for 120 schools in 10 \n     States.\n\n  This is a national indictment of our failure to deal with the \nproblems of development of qualified teachers for our schools. We have, \nI think, an effective program which really reflects the judgment on the \nmajor professional development programs. I will just mention what the \nvarious studies say they need to do. They say high-quality professional \ndevelopment must be connected with teachers' work with their students, \nlinked to concrete tasks of teaching, organized around problem solving, \nbe informed by research, and sustained over time by ongoing \nconversations and coaching.\n  There is a series of recommendations which we have worked on with \nregard to mentoring as well as the other aspects of it.\n  Let me just conclude with these observations. On the one hand, you \nhave what we are attempting to do, and what we will attempt to do with \nour substitute amendment, which is to guarantee to parents tough, \nstrong, effective, tried-and-tested programs that are going to result \nin enhanced academic achievement and accomplishment. There is a \nsignificant break with the past with our very tough-minded \naccountability standards. We owe a great deal to Senator Bingaman and \nothers who have done yeoman work in that area of accountability, and \nhave for a long period of time going back to the Governors' meetings. \nWe have that.\n  On the other hand, we have the contributions, a blank check to the \nStates. It is a blank check to the States for them to effectively use \nthat money in a State program, virtually free from the requirements \nthat are going to result in, first, the funding getting to where the \nneeds are, and, second, the effective and tough-minded programs that \ncan make a difference to those children in the underserved areas.\n\n  ``It isn't there.'' You will hear the conversations, you will hear \nthe speeches, you will hear the words, but ``it isn't there.'' You \ncan't show it. We will take every section of the bill and go through \nit--I have--and show it does not give the accountability that is \nrequired. It fails the parents in this country, giving assurance to \nthem for these programs.\n  I have not even gotten into the question of portability, the whole \nsense of block grants. What has happened historically when we have gone \nback to block granting is, on each and every occasion that we have \nblock granted, we have found out those funds have been dramatically \nreduced over a period of years. We can go back into that. I will at \nanother time. But just take that because the fact is the focus and \npurpose for which those funds are developed becomes blurred. That has \nbeen the record. That is what we are going to see with regard to the \nFederal participation, partnership. It ought to be a partnership with \nthe State and local communities.\n  There are many in this body who do not think we ought to be in there \nat all. I understand that and respect it. It was not that long ago when \nthey were advocating the elimination of the Department of Education. \nThat was the Republican position. I understand it. I believe every one \nof us on our side believes when the President meets with his Cabinet \nthere ought to be someone in there talking about education, education, \neducation. That has been their position.\n  Second, they have tried to cut back funding on education over the \nperiod\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\nsince 1994. I understand that. They don't want Federal involvement.\n  This must be the new way. Now we are getting vouchers, block grants, \nand give it to the States and let them make the judgment without tough-\nminded accountability.\n  It is the wrong way to go. We should know better. I hope in this \ndebate we will have the opportunity to demonstrate it further.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my good friend \nfrom Massachusetts, but I want to assure the American people that the \nmajority of his criticisms are directed not toward the main body of the \nbill but toward a demonstration project contained within the bill. I \nthink we have agreement on a great deal of the underlying bill.\n  I would like to point out, for instance, that the bill contains a \nbipartisan proposal put forward by the Governors. Our heavily relying \non the States is only appropriate, and it is the way to go. The \nGovernors and the States are primarily responsible for education in \nthis country.\n  I also point out that this bill does not abandon the needs of \nhomeless children and immigrants and other disadvantaged students. They \nare maintained about the same as they are now.\n  There are some important differences, there is no question about it, \nwith respect to parts of the bill. But the major of the criticisms \noffered by my colleague from Massachusetts were aimed at a \ndemonstration project that might be used by 15 States. I think there is \nagreement on so much of this bill, I hate to see the debate entirely \nfocused on those areas that were mentioned.\n  I note the majority has consumed about 15 minutes, and the minority \nhas consumed more than an hour. I have three of my people waiting who \nhave been here for pretty much that time. I will recognize those three \nand then we will return to alternating.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, I hope the majority leader's \neloquent and compelling support for your side would be included.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is in a special place.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see; a special place. OK. Senator Dodd and Senator \nBingaman were going to speak, so the next 45 minutes will be fine.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We will listen to the three here.\n  Senator Collins has been a leader in an effort to increase \nflexibility, particularly for our rural schools. I will yield her. I \nhave a feeling she probably has something interesting to say and look \nforward to hearing her statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nthe Senator from Vermont, for his leadership in bringing this important \nlegislation to the Senate floor. It is evident from the debate we have \nalready heard that we are going to have, this week, a very vigorous and \nproductive debate on the best way for the Federal Government to improve \nAmerica's public schools, to improve teaching and learning. I look \nforward to the adoption of this legislation which will strengthen our \nK-12 education.\n  No endeavor is more important to our Nation's future than ensuring \nthat all children reach high standards. That is exactly what the \nlegislation before us demands.\n\n  The Educational Opportunities Act will put children first. That \nshould be our goal as we consider this important legislation. We should \nput children first so that no child is left behind.\n  I recently had a schoolteacher in eastern Maine give me a pin that I \nam wearing today that says, ``Children First.'' If we keep that in \nmind, if that is our goal throughout this debate, then I am confident \nwe will pass this legislation which will make a difference in the \npublic schools of America and to the future of our children.\n  During the past 3 years, I have visited dozens of schools all over \nthe State of Maine, from Kittery at the southern tip, to Jackman in the \nwest, Rockland on the coast, and St. Agatha in the north. In fact, just \nlast Friday, I visited two excellent schools in Kittery, ME, the \nFrisbee Elementary School and the Shapleigh Middle School, where I \ntalked with students and they asked me wonderful questions for over an \nhour. It was a wonderful visit to these two schools.\n  I have seen firsthand the excellent jobs that Maine teachers and \nadministrators are doing in educating our children. The quality of \ninstruction taking place in Maine schools is, indeed, impressive, and \nit is producing results. Maine's scores on national tests and its rate \nof high school graduation proves that our State's public schools are \namong the best in the Nation. Moreover, Maine's public schools provide \na good education for all of our children regardless of their family \nincome or where they live in our State.\n  The recent report issued by the Council of Chief State School \nOfficers shows that low-income students are performing nearly as well \nas the average of all Maine public school students, and that, of \ncourse, is our goal.\n  An important factor in Maine's success has been its ability to obtain \nwaivers from Federal regulations. Let me repeat that. One reason that \nMaine schools have been successful is they have been able to get \nwaivers from Federal regulations. Federal regulations in some areas \nhave been an obstacle to their success. It is only because Maine's \ncommissioner of education has been vigilant in trying to get waivers \nfrom Federal regulations that he has been able to move forward on a \nnumber of fronts to improve Maine's schools.\n  The most recent of the waivers that the State received gave Maine's \nschools more flexibility to use class-size reduction funds for teacher \nprofessional development. This is an option that the bill before us, S. \n2, would give to all States.\n  Recently, I had a phone call from the chairman of a school board in a \nsmall community in Washington County. She conveyed the appreciation of \nthat school district for the flexibility to use Federal class-size \nmonies for teacher professional development. She put it well. She said: \nWe don't need to reduce class size; what we need is funds for \nprofessional development.\n  Indeed, this school system is so small that it only received about \n$6,000 under the Class Size Reduction Program, not enough to hire a \nteacher, but they were able to put that money to good use by investing \nin professional development, a high need in that particular school \nsystem.\n  On a larger scale, Maine sought and was granted a waiver from Federal \nregulations to allow it to use a grant from the Comprehensive School \nReform Demonstration Program to support the State's major reform \ninitiative focusing on improving high schools.\n\n  That was to implement this excellent report that the State produced \nthrough its Commission on Secondary Education. It is called ``Promising \nFutures: A Call for Improving Learning for Maine's Secondary Schools.'' \nAlthough Maine has almost eliminated the performance gap between \ndisadvantaged and advantaged students in the elementary schools, the \nFederal regulations require the State of Maine to use these funds only \nin the lower grades.\n  Fortunately, Maine was able to receive permission to move ahead on \ncarrying out the recommendations put forth in this report by the Maine \nCommission on Secondary Education and to go forward with comprehensive \nreform in title I-eligible high schools.\n  Why should the State of Maine have to go to Washington and get \nspecial permission to pursue these critical reforms? That does not make \nsense. It is the people in Maine who know best what their schools need. \nThe people in Maine, working hard on this commission, decided there \nneeded to be more focus on improving Maine's high schools, and yet \nFederal regulations were an impediment to achieving that goal.\n  We have what I think of as a ``Mother, may I?'' approach to Federal \nregulation of our schools. Our States have to beg for permission to \nmove forward. They have to seek waivers of regulations in order to \npursue worthwhile programs.\n  The Educational Opportunities Act will give the States this option \nwithout the time-consuming and costly administrative burden of seeking \nwaivers from all these Federal regulations. These Federal regulations \nare well meaning, they are well-intentioned, but too often they act as \nan impediment to reform.\n  Unfortunately, the performance in many other States' schools lags \nbehind\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\nMaine's with large gaps between the performance of children in high-\npoverty areas versus low-poverty schools. Our goal as a nation, and the \nintent of the Educational Opportunities Act, is to help every public \nschool succeed so that every student has the opportunity to achieve his \nor her full potential.\n  In many cases, education is the difference between prosperity and \npoverty, hope and despair, dreams fulfilled and lost opportunities. \nFueled by the remarkable success of the dot-com generation, many areas \nof the United States have experienced unparalleled economic growth. \nHowever, between Silicon Valley and Wall Street, many Americans still \nlive in the shadows of the new prosperity. Education is the best, \nperhaps the only way, to close the ever-widening economic gap in \nAmerica. Indeed, the economic gap in America is largely an education \ngap. Moreover, education is the best way for us to stoke the fire of \nour Nation's economic engine.\n  The question before us as we debate the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act is: What is the proper role of \nthe Federal Government in promoting excellence in every public school \nand helping every student succeed? We can all agree that our public \nschools must do a better job in teaching our children and that the \nFederal Government must also do a better job in supporting our public \nschools. The question is: How can we best accomplish that goal?\n  Seventeen years ago, the landmark study, ``A Nation at Risk,'' warned \nof declining performance in American schools and turned the Nation's \neyes toward reforming public education. Today, however, too many \nschools, particularly in our inner cities, continue to fail to provide \na solid education to their students. Although the United States spends \nmore than $660 billion a year on education, nearly 60 percent of our \nlow-income fourth graders cannot read at a basic level. Clearly, \nreforms are necessary to ensure that every child learns and achieves \nhis or her full potential.\n\n  Recent polls show that the American public thinks our public schools \nare in a state of crisis. More than two-thirds of the people surveyed \nsaid in a recent poll that they are dissatisfied with the way public \neducation is working, and nearly 50 percent gave our schools only a \ngrade of C.\n  On the bright side, Americans are committed to fixing our public \nschools and eliminating mediocrity. Nearly every person surveyed said \nthat improving our public schools should be a top priority.\n  The Federal Government clearly takes a back seat to States and \ncommunities in terms of funding and overseeing our public schools, and \nthat is how it should be. The Federal role is, nevertheless, important, \nparticularly for helping disadvantaged students. Unfortunately, \nWashington has not always been helpful, nor has it been successful in \nachieving that goal.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, first enacted in 1965 as \npart of President Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty, is the cornerstone \nof the Federal involvement in K-12 education. It is intended to provide \nfinancial assistance to States and school districts to improve \neducation for children from disadvantaged families.\n  Today, title I remains the largest Federal program, funded at nearly \n$8 billion annually. But, after 35 years, and $120 billion spent, the \nresults remain a disappointment.\n  The statistics are troubling and should give us pause:\n  Only 13 percent of low-income fourth graders score at or above the \nproficient level on national reading tests;\n  Two out of three African American and Hispanic fourth graders can \nbarely read;\n  Half of the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on \ntime; and\n  In math, fourth graders in high-poverty schools remain two grade \nlevels behind their peers in low-poverty schools; in reading, they are \nthree grade levels below their peers in schools in better \nneighborhoods.\n  We can no longer pretend that Federal programs have succeeded. We \nneed a new approach. As these sobering statistics highlight, little \nprogress has been made toward achieving the ESEA's fundamental goal of \nnarrowing the achievement gap between low-income and higher-income \nstudents. We know that the gap can be narrowed. We have largely \naccomplished that goal up to eighth grade in the State of Maine. But, \nclearly, we are not doing all we can to assist States and communities \nin reaching this goal. Clearly, the approach we have taken during the \npast 35 years simply has not worked.\n  The Educational Opportunities Act gives the Senate the potential to \ndo for education what it did for welfare a few years ago: end years of \ninflexible rules, provide new incentives, and focus Federal dollars on \nresults.\n\n  Under the current system, Washington requires schools to spend an \ninordinate amount of time filling out forms and complying with \nbureaucratic mandates. As a result, our public schools spend more than \n48 million hours each year on Federal paperwork. That is 48 million \nhours that could be spent on students; instead, it is spent on Federal \npaperwork.\n  The bill before us today will increase the authorization for Federal \neducation funding without adding burdensome restrictions. It will \ncreate an environment focused on increased achievement, on results, on \nstudent learning, not on more bureaucracy and paperwork, and it will \nimprove our public schools, not abandon them.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held many hours \nof hearings on how to improve the effectiveness of the ESEA. The \nmajority of the committee concluded that individual States, local \nschool boards, teachers, and parents are far better prepared than \nWashington to make decisions about what their students need. So the \ncommittee decided to give States more options.\n  This legislation allows States to choose among three options for how \nto receive Federal funds. First, a State could decide to continue under \nthe traditional ESEA approach of receiving formula grants for specific \nFederal programs for specific purposes as well as applying for \ncompetitive grants. In other words, if a State is content with the \nstatus quo, its schools can continue along that path. No one is forced \nto adopt a different approach.\n  The second option is for States to apply to the Secretary of \nEducation to enter into a performance partnership. This approach gives \nStates somewhat more flexibility in the use of Federal education \ndollars in return for an agreement to achieve specific results, in \nother words, in return for an agreement to show true improvement in \nstudent learning.\n  Under the third and what I believe to be the most promising and \ninnovative approach, a State could apply, under the Straight A's \nProgram, to be one of 15 States that will be given even more \nflexibility in spending Federal funds in return for strict \naccountability focused on student achievement. That is one of the major \nphilosophical differences we are seeing in this debate. Our bill says \nthat what is important is what students are learning. Showing \nachievement gains should be the bottom line.\n  Unfortunately, too many on the other side of the aisle are wedded to \nthe old approach which says what is important is having Federal strings \nattached to every dollar and making sure the paperwork is filled out \ncorrectly.\n  The premise underlying the performance partnership and the Straight \nA's approach is similar. Instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all \nFederal mandate, the Federal Government would recognize that one \ncommunity may need more math teachers while another may need to \nconcentrate on improving reading programs, and that still a third may \nneed to upgrade the science labs. The point is, it should be your \ncommunity's decision, not Washington's.\n  The Educational Opportunities Act frees States from Federal control \nand redtape but only in exchange for increased student performance, \nincreased student achievement gains.\n  Another important title of S. 2 includes the Teacher Empowerment Act. \nOther than involved parents, a well-qualified and dedicated teacher is \nthe single most important prerequisite for student success.\n\n  The lessons are clear. We must encourage talented people to choose \nteaching as a career and keep them in the classroom. The Teacher \nEmpowerment Act authorizes $2 billion for State and local efforts to \nimprove the quality of teaching. It gives States and communities the \nfreedom to use Federal dollars to provide effective professional \ndevelopment for our teachers; to\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\nprepare, recruit, and retain well-qualified teachers; or to reduce \nclass size--whatever the priority is in that community.\n  Some States are also exploring alternatives to traditional teacher \ncertification. I find it ironic that in public high schools in most \nStates Alan Greenspan could not teach a class on economics, and our \ndistinguished scholarly colleague, Senator Moynihan, could not teach a \nclass on American Government.\n  I am not saying that subject matter expertise alone qualifies someone \nto teach, but surely we should give incentives to States to be more \ncreative in pursuing alternate routes to certification. Our legislation \nwould do just that.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bipartisan legislation that I \nintroduced to help our Nation's rural schools has been included in this \nbill. I see my colleague, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, is on the \nfloor. He is one of the cosponsors of this legislation.\n  Although my commitment extends to every student in every school--\nwhether rural, suburban, or urban--I have a particular concern for the \nchallenges that are unique to small school districts, especially those \nin rural areas.\n  Smaller rural schools face at least two problems under the current \nFederal system. First, they often receive very small amounts to carry \nout federally mandated activities.\n  One Maine school district in Frenchboro, ME, received a whopping $28 \nto fund a district-wide Safe and Drug Free School program--clearly, not \nenough to accomplish the goal of that Federal law.\n  Another school district in northern Aroostook County with 400 \nstudents receives four separate Federal grants, ranging from $1,900 to \n$9,500. Not one of these grants is sufficient to implement the goals of \nthe Federal program, and each small amount comes with its own \npaperwork, redtape, and strings attached.\n  The second problem is that small school districts are essentially \nshut out of the competitive grant program. They lack the grant writers \nand other resources necessary to apply for and manage Federal grants \nthat larger school districts are able to seek.\n  My legislation addresses both problems by allowing small school \ndistricts to consolidate the Federal funds for local priorities and to \nreceive supplemental funds in lieu of applying for competitive grants.\n  These small rural districts could then use these funds to hire a new \nmath or reading teacher, fund professional development, offer a program \nfor gifted and talented students, purchase computers, or pay for any \nother activity that meets the community's priorities and needs. I thank \nthe chairman of the committee for including my rural education \ninitiative as part of his chairman's mark.\n\n  Education is more important now than ever before. A strong K through \n12 education prepares students for the postsecondary education they \nwill need to adapt to an increasingly dynamic marketplace and to have \nchoices and opportunities throughout their lives. As Plato said \ncenturies ago: The direction in which education starts a man will \ndetermine his future life.\n  I look forward to continuing the debate on the Educational \nOpportunities Act and to assuring that America's public education \nsystem starts all children, from all backgrounds, regions, and income \nlevels, toward a lifetime of learning, contributing to society, and \nachieving their dreams.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas \nsuch time as he may consume, hoping he will keep it at about 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and I \nthank him for his leadership on this bill we bring to the Senate floor \ntoday. I thank Senator Collins for her outstanding remarks, as well as \nher leadership, particularly in the area of our rural schools. She has \ndone a great job. I also am pleased that that is included in the \nchairman's mark. I look forward to the debate in which we engage today \nand throughout this week and perhaps next week as well.\n  I see Senator Coverdell from Georgia, who has led the way on \neducation savings accounts, and Senator Frist from Tennessee, who was \non the floor a moment ago, who led on education flexibility. We have a \nnumber of members of the committee who have worked hard, including \nSenator Sessions from Alabama, who has been very engaged and involved \nin this, and Senator Gorton from Washington, who has been very involved \nas well and is not a committee member.\n  This is the most important debate we will have in this session of the \nCongress. The debate on education and the Educational Opportunities Act \nis the most critical debate we could possibly have.\n  I sat here during the remarks of Senator Kennedy. I respect him \nimmensely; I regard him as a friend. Never could the philosophical \nchasm that exists between the Democratic approach and our Republican \napproach on education have been made more clear than during the \nstatement of Senator Kennedy. While I wish I could take longer to \nrefute some of the things he said, there was one particular comment to \nwhich I took greatest exception. That was his statement that \nRepublicans want to cut funding for education. That simply is not \naccurate.\n  As all who watched the budget process last year are well aware, we \nincreased education spending above what the President had requested and \nwhat he had recommended in his budget. This year, in this legislation, \nwe once again increase spending on education. The statement that \nRepublicans want to cut spending for education is simply inaccurate. \nSenator Kennedy is off base in making that allegation. Every school \ndistrict in Arkansas will see an increase in the Federal contribution \nto their budgets as a result of the Educational Opportunities Act.\n\n  There was another statement of which I took note. I wrote it down as \nSenator Kennedy was speaking. He said twice: We need to stick with the \ntried and the tested. At one point he said: We need to stay with the \ntried and the demonstrated successful programs. Another time he said: \nWe have an effective program.\n  I will debate on that ground all week long. I do not want to be the \nSenator standing on the floor of this Chamber defending the status quo \nand arguing that it is tried and tested. It was tried and it has \nfailed.\n  We don't have to look very far to realize that. In yesterday's \nWashington Post, in the Metro section, just the headline tells the \nstory: Test Shows Students Can't Do The Math; 64 Percent Fail Final \nExam After Montgomery Standardizes Grades. As we read the small print \nin the story, it becomes even sadder.\n  The whole purpose of the Federal role under title I was to lower the \ndisparity in scores between the disadvantaged and the advantaged, to \nnarrow the gap. What this story tells us is that while 64 percent of \nall students failed--almost two-thirds--80 percent of African American \nand Latino students flunked the test while only about 50 percent of \nwhites failed the test.\n  That is one of the great tragedies. That is the great failure of our \nexisting status quo approach to title I and trying to fund education \nfor the disadvantaged and trying to narrow the gap between those who \nare advantaged and those who are disadvantaged. I will repeat this over \nand over again this week. Stick with the tried and the tested. That is \nwhat Senator Kennedy said: Stick with the tried and the tested. That is \nwhat the Democratic side offers. That is what they offer this Chamber. \nThat is what they offer this country: Just stick with the status quo.\n  That is why we will win this debate this week and before the country, \nbecause we know the children of America deserve better. The tried and \nthe tested has not been good enough. To use an old phrase from \nScripture: It has been weighed in the balances, and it has been found \nwanting.\n  During the 34 years of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nCongress has increased funding dramatically. We have created programs \nexponentially, and we have added bureaucracy layer upon layer. As \nSenator Collins pointed out, 15 years ago the alarming report, ``A \nNation At Risk,'' recorded that the state of education in the United \nStates not only jeopardized a generation of young Americans but posed a \nreal threat to the future of our Nation.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\n  Since that time, many States have embraced standards and \naccountability; 26 have instituted exit exams for high school. With \nthese reforms, slight increases in student performance have occurred. \nBut by virtually every measure, we remain a nation at risk.\n  Unfortunately, while many States are responding to the crisis with \nbold, creative reforms, the approach of the Federal Government has \nremained unchanged. Each succeeding reauthorization of ESEA has \nresulted in preserving the top-down bureaucratic model of education. \nThis is the first time we as Republicans have been in control of the \nmajority, at least in the House and the Senate, the first time we have \nhad an opportunity to leave our imprint upon ESEA.\n\n  It should not be surprising, as we look at the history of this \nprogram, that the American Legislative Exchange Council, when they \nissued their bipartisan report on education 2 weeks ago--the American \nLegislative Exchange Council is the Nation's largest bipartisan \nassociation of State legislators; they released their report card on \nAmerican education about 2 weeks ago--concluded the current path is not \ngood enough.\n  Senator Kennedy may say let's stick with the tried and true, but the \nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council, as most Americans, has concluded \nthe current path is not good enough.\n  We heard the same dire, fearful predictions when we tried to do \nwelfare reform a few years ago, the same predictions exactly: The sky \nis falling. You can't trust the States. We heard the same kind of \nfearful, dire predictions when States began experimenting with charter \nschools, that it was going to destroy public education. Yet today, with \nthousands of charter schools throughout the country, no one would dare \nmake that claim.\n  Where has the current prescriptive regulatory approach led us? In \nstudent performance, America's 12th graders rank 19 out of 21 \nindustrialized countries in math achievement and 16 out of 21 countries \nin science. Where has the current prescriptive regulatory approach led \nus since 1983? Ten million young Americans have reached the 12th grade \nwithout having learned to read at a basic level; 20 million seniors \ncould not do basic math; 25 million are ignorant of the essentials of \nU.S. history.\n  In the fourth grade, over three-quarters of children in urban, high-\npoverty schools are reading below basic on the NAEP test--the National \nAssessment of Education Progress. Where has it gotten us? Throughout \nthe United States, per pupil expenditures have increased by more than \n23 percent over the past 20 years, the past two decades, after \nadjusting for inflation. Yet two-thirds of American eighth graders are \nstill performing below the proficiency level in reading. I suggest that \nreauthorizing a status quo ESEA should not be an option. America's \nchildren deserve better.\n  Not only does American education fail in regard to the most essential \ncriterion, student achievement, but it also fails in its allocation of \nresources. For example, in Florida it takes six times as many people to \nadminister a Federal education dollar as a State dollar. That is \namazing. In Florida, they have 297 State employees administering $1 \nbillion in Federal funds. They have 374 employees overseeing $7 billion \nin State funds. It takes six times as many people to administer a \nFederal education dollar as a State dollar. Unfortunately, Florida is \nnot an exception; it is all too typical.\n\n  The result from this bureaucratic model of education is that we fund \nsystems; we fund bureaucracies; we fund enormous overhead. In 1994, \nfewer than 50 percent of the personnel employed by U.S. public schools \nwere teachers. Something is wrong with that picture. Senator Kennedy \nmay say that it is tried and it is tested, but when more than 50 \npercent of our education personnel are not even in the classroom, I say \nit is tried, tested, and it has failed.\n  The Educational Opportunities Act pioneers a new direction for the \nFederal Government's role in education. When only 38 percent of U.S. \npublic school teachers majored in an academic subject in college and \nonly one in five teachers feels well prepared to teach to high academic \nstandards, my colleagues, I say we need a new approach to professional \ndevelopment and teacher empowerment. The Educational Opportunities Act \ngives us that new approach.\n  The New York Times ran a headline in its January 18, 1999, edition. \nIt read: ``Clinton to Urge More U.S. Control on Aid to Schools.''\n  Colleagues, more control is not what is needed. Better student \nperformance--better results--is what is needed.\n  The Educational Opportunities Act includes four initiatives that \npromote student achievement. These provisions focus on students rather \nthan school systems. They require results and student performance, help \ndevelop teachers of excellence, and promote choice and flexibility. \nThese four initiatives are: Straight A's, Teacher Empowerment Act, \nchild-centered funding, and public school choice.\n  The Straight A's provision is the heartbeat of this bill. In short, \nit allows up to 15 States to execute a 5-year performance agreement \nwith the Secretary. States then have the option to consolidate any of \ntheir formula grant programs, including the huge title I program, and \nmerge those funds with State and local dollars.\n  The 15-State demonstration project would allow States to use Federal \ndollars for any educational purpose permitted under State law. In \nreturn for this broad new flexibility, participating States will be \nheld accountable for improving student performance and narrowing the \ngap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. States will be \nrewarded with bonus funds for successfully reducing this achievement \ngap. By the way, no State is required to leave the current funding \nsystem; but the 15 lucky States--the 15 wise States--accepted into the \ndemonstration program may consolidate funding from any or all of 12 \ndifferent ESEA programs.\n  The idea is to let States mingle the dollars from these several \nprograms and spend the money on whatever their students need most--new \ntests, tutors, reading programs, bricks and mortar, computers, whatever \nis deemed most needed. States that prefer to keep their Federal dollars \nin redtape-wrapped categorical packages may, of course, be free to do \nso.\n  Straight A's will work because it is based on a solid premise: \nAccountability plus freedom equals academic achievement. Instead of \nfilling out form Y to get grant X, Straight A's would only require that \nStates boost academic performance and narrow the learning gap.\n\n  After 34 years and $118 billion, with no reduction in the achievement \ngap between advantaged and disadvantaged students, it is time to say: \nEnough.\n  Kentucky Democratic Governor Paul Patton expressed the Straight A's \nconcept well when he told the L.A. Times recently: ``We need the \nFederal Government as a limited partner and us as the general \npartner.''\n  Straight A's respects the tenth amendment and allows Uncle Sam to put \nfuel in the gas tank while leaving the States in the driver's seat.\n  Straight A's will reduce overhead and transaction costs for dozens of \nseparate fussy programs enabling more resources to go to direct \nservices to students.\n  The old Federal approach to education has failed. It is time to give \nthe States the opportunity to act as charter schools and option out of \nburdensome Federal regulations in return for unprecedented levels of \naccountability for student achievement.\n  Under the current model, accountability means this: Did you fill the \nforms out correctly? Did you cross your ``t's'' and dot your ``i's''? \nUnder the Educational Opportunities Act model, accountability relates \nonly to student performance.\n  The theory of Straight A's was clearly articulated by Democratic \nCalifornia Governor Gray Davis on the ``Meet the Press'' program in \nFebruary. He said, ``So if you say to the States, `we will hold you \naccountable. You just improve student performance and we will give you \nthe money,' that will give all the Governors the flexibility to get the \njob done.''\n  While there has long been lipservice to goals, standards and \naccountability associated with Federal programs, the reality has been \nthat the question we focused on was: Are you spending the money in the \nprescribed way? Under the new approach, the question is, and must be, \nAre the kids learning? If academic achievement rises, particularly\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nfor low-income children, why should Washington care whether the dollars \nthat produced the desirable result were spent on smaller classes or \nlarger classes, on computers or textbooks, on tutoring programs or \nstaff development? The important thing is that those children are \nmaking academic progress. The gap is narrowing.\n  Under Straight A's, Washington assumes the role of shareholder, not \nCEO of the Nation's education enterprise.\n  I have talked about--and I will talk about it later this week--the \nexample of one of the school districts I visited in Arkansas which has \nabout a 95-percent minority population. As I toured the school, the sad \nthing was the building was dilapidated, with paint peeling off of the \nwalls. I will show pictures later this week. The ceiling was collapsing \nand it had big waterstains where it flooded. I thought, these poor \nchildren have to be educated in such an environment. Then I walked into \na room which was full of state-of-the-art Nautilus equipment--\ntreadmills and all kinds of gymnastic equipment. I said to the \nprincipal: Sir, how did you get the money to do this? He mentioned a \nparticular grant program. I have since investigated, and they received \n$239,000 to buy treadmills and Nautilus equipment. That may be nice for \nthe community, but the principal told me he would like to have \nimproved, renovated, and made that school building into an atmosphere \nin which the children could better learn.\n  Under our bill, they will have the flexibility to take Federal \ndollars and use them where they--and they alone--know it is most needed \nand not what Washington says in some prescribed formula grant where the \nmoney has to be spent.\n  The second important provision in this bill is the Teacher \nEmpowerment Act. This initiative is included in title II and provides \nmaximum flexibility to States and to local education authorities to \ndevelop high-quality professional development programs by consolidating \nfunds from the Eisenhower Teacher Professional Development Program and \nthe Class Size Reduction Program. As a result, the bill provides more \nthan $2 billion annually over 5 years by consolidating these two \nprograms into one flexible funding stream.\n  Under the Teacher Empowerment Act, States and local governments would \nbe encouraged to fund innovative programs to promote teacher testing, \ntenure reform, merit-based teacher performance systems, alternative \nroutes to teacher certification, of which Senator Collins was speaking, \nand differential and bonus pay for teachers in high-need subject areas, \nteacher mentoring and in-service teacher academies.\n  Local school districts could use this money to hire new teachers to \nreduce class size or hire special education teachers. They would have \nthe option of issuing teacher opportunity payments directly to teachers \nto use toward a high-quality professional development program of their \nown choice. If a local school district fails to improve teacher \nquality, they are required to offer teacher opportunity payments \ndirectly to teachers, if they are failing to improve the professional \nquality of their staff.\n  In consolidating these two programs, we provide more money for \nteacher professional development. In my home State of Arkansas, the \ncombined fiscal year 2000 allocation for both programs is $14,970,900. \nThe estimated fiscal year 2001 allocation will be $16,337,800, an \nincrease of over $1.3 million. Under this bill, every school district \nin Arkansas will be authorized to receive additional money for teacher \nprofessional development. For example, the Jonesboro School District in \nnortheast Arkansas currently receives about $169,000, and they will be \nauthorized to receive $186,000, an increase of almost $17,000, for \nprofessional development. In Texarkana, the increase amounts to an \nadditional $24,000. The Fort Smith School District will see a $36,800 \nincrease. The teachers of the Little Rock School District will have \n$82,000 more for professional development activities under our program.\n  One of the other key changes made in the Educational Opportunities \nAct is to shift the child-centered funding. We do this through a title \nI portability demonstration program. Under this initiative, interested \nStates and school districts are allowed to use their title I dollars to \nestablish a per pupil amount for each eligible child, which would then \nfollow the child to the school they attend. The per pupil amount would \nbe used to provide title I's supplemental educational--``add on''--\nservices directly to eligible children. Eligible students will be able \nto use their per pupil amount for ``add on'' services at a public \nschool (including charter schools) or a tutorial assistance provider. \nThis funding is available for children between ages 5 and 17 whose \nfamily income is below the poverty line. A State may choose to expand \neligibility to any educational or economically disadvantaged child in \npreschool through high school. (These eligibility requirements are \nconsistent with title I.)\n\n  Each State participating in a portability program is required to \noperate a full public school choice program to ensure that low income \nfamilies have maximum flexibility as to where their child receives \ntitle I services.\n  States operating a ``child-centered'' program would continue to \nreceive their title I formula allocation as well as a new allocation \nauthorized in this program. The new allocation coupled with the States' \nformula dollars will permit States to serve all of their title I \neligible children. Only two-thirds of title I children are served by \nthe program.\n  That is very important. Currently, only two-thirds of title I \nchildren are served by the title I program. Under our program all \ndisadvantaged children are going to receive the educational \nopportunities they deserve.\n  States and school districts would be required to establish specific \ngoals for improving the academic performance of eligible children and a \nsystem to measure progress to ensure that student performance is \nimproving. States would be required to annually submit student \nperformance data, disaggregated by race, family income, gender, and \nlimited English proficiency, to the Secretary. The accountability \nsystem is similar to the strong accountability provisions in both the \nTeacher Empowerment Act and Straight A's.\n  GAO would be required to evaluate the program's effects on student \nachievement and parental satisfaction.\n  We must cease to think of title I education programs as investments \nin programs or populations, and begin to view them as ``student-based, \nportable entitlements for individual children.''\n  One of the experts I have often turned to for advice on the \nappropriate Federal role in education is the Arizona Superintendent of \nPublic Instruction, Lisa Graham Keegan, one of the leading education \nreformers in the Nation. In endorsing the concept of portability, this \nis what she said:\n\n       Presently, there is no guarantee that a poor child will \n     necessarily receive any benefit from the Title I funds he or \n     she generates for a school district, regardless of how needy \n     that child might be. What I am required by law to do is to \n     distribute this money to central offices of school districts, \n     which are then under no legal obligation to spend the money \n     on particular children. They simply provide the services they \n     want to provide in the schools they wish to provide them in, \n     which many benefit some disadvantaged children, but not all \n     of them. Putting it bluntly, Title I is an entitlement for \n     bureaucracy, not an entitlement for a child.\n\n  This bill changes that. It makes title I something aimed directly at \nthe child--strapping it to that child's back under this portability \ndemonstration as opposed to funding systems and bureaucracies.\n  Portability is already standard practice in federal higher education \npolicy, where an historic choice was made in 1972: students rather than \ncolleges became the main recipients of federal aid. A low-income \ncollege student establishes his own eligibility for a Pell grant, or \nStafford loan, etc., and then carries it with him to the college of his \nchoice. That might mean Stanford or Michigan State, Assumption College, \nor the Acme Truck Driving School. The institution only gets its hands \non the cash if it succeeds in attracting and retaining that student.\n  The same thing could be done with federal education programs meant to \naid needy elementary and secondary students. The big title I program, \nfor example, spends almost $8 billion annually to provide \n``compensatory'' education to some 6.5 million low-income youngsters. \nThat's about $1,250 apiece. What if that money went straight to\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nthose families to purchase their compensatory education wherever they \nlike. To be sure, title I would turn into millions of mini-\nscholarships, like Pell grants.\n  In addition to Straight A's, the Teacher Empowerment Act, and child-\ncentered funding, the Educational Opportunities Act also includes an \nimportant provision for children trapped in failing schools.\n  Listen to the statistics: Over 5,000 title I schools have been \nidentified as ``failing'' schools for over 2 years; over 1,000 for at \nleast 4 years; and over 100 for over 10 years.\n  And yet, we continue to subsidize this failure by keeping the stream \nof title I funding flowing to these substandard schools. In this bill \nwe have a public school choice provision that seeks to remedy this \nproblem.\n  Under the ``choice for failing schools proposal,'' once a school has \nbeen identified as failing, they have 2 years to improve. If after 2 \nyears, the school has failed to improve student performance, the school \ndistrict would be required to use the school's title I allotment to \nallow children in the failed school to attend another higher performing \npublic school. This proposal has the dual effect of terminating federal \nfunds to schools that consistently failed to show any signs of \nimprovement while simultaneously providing the option to low-income \nparents to take their children out of a failing school and put them in \na better school.\n\n  No child should be permanently consigned to a sub-par school. No \nchild should be trapped in a failing school. This bill begins to show a \nway out.\n  Another important provision in this bill addresses the needs of \nsmall, rural school districts that receive small amounts of formula \nfunds and are not able to compete effectively for competitive grants. \nThis program is based on the Rural School Initiative introduced last \nyear by Senator Collins of Maine, which I cosponsored.\n  This initiative has two parts. The first provision allows small, \nrural school districts with under 600 students to combine the funds \nfrom three current formula grant programs: title II--the Teacher \nEmpowerment Act, title IV--Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and title VI--\nthe Innovative Education Strategies grant. Small school districts often \nreceive such small amounts under these separate funding streams that \nthey cannot effectively use the funds. This initiative allows them to \ncombine the funds to develop an effective program to improve student \nachievement.\n  The second provision authorizes supplementary grants to small, rural \nschool districts that forgo eligibility to participate in competitive \ngrant programs. A participating district receives a minimum total of \n$20,000 and a maximum of $60,000 from the existing formula programs \nplus the supplementary grant.\n  This new initiative solves two problems. It recognizes that formula \ngrants to schools are often too small to implement any real changes, \nand it recognizes the limited resources of small districts and the \nenormous amount of paperwork that are required by applying for \ncompetitive grants. Small school districts often lack grant writers and \nthe expertise and time needed to apply for competitive grants. I know \nin my home state of Arkansas that one school district had to take two \nteachers out of the classroom for an entire week just to fill out the \nrequired paperwork to apply for a federal competitive grant. We need \nteachers in our classrooms, not filling out paperwork.\n  This initiative will have a great impact on my home state; 111 of the \n311 total school districts in Arkansas will be eligible to participate \nin this initiative, and every educator that I have spoken with about \nthis has been supportive of this initiative.\n  Every educator I have spoken to in Arkansas about this initiative has \nbeen supportive.\n  Although the United States spends $664 billion annually--more than 8 \npercent of its gross domestic product, GDP--on education, nearly 60 \npercent of our low-income 4th graders, and 40 percent of all 4th \ngraders, cannot read at a basic level. On recent international tests of \nmath and science, our high school seniors ranked near the bottom of \nindustrialized nations; in mathematics, only Cyprus and South Africa \nfared worse.\n  Our children deserve better. The current system, the top-down \nbureaucratic restrictive model has failed American students--tried, \ntested, and failed.\n  Today, one-third of all college freshmen enroll in at least one \nremedial class before attempting college-level course work.\n  Listen to the words of former Education Secretary Bill Bennett: ``We \nhave not yet begun to look at performance or accountability in the \nspending of federal dollars. Of 60 plus programs authorized under ESEA, \nnot one rewards school districts or states for doing well. Not one \ninflicts meaningful punishment on schools that do badly. For the \nresults of such policies, one need only look at the performance of our \ndisadvantaged students. Forty percent of inner-city students cannot \nread by the fourth grade. And 77 percent of low-income fourth-graders \nin urban high-poverty schools are reading below basic reading levels.\n  I read this morning in the CongressDaily that Democrats were \nconsidering offering a whole host of extraneous amendments. I hope that \nis not the case--everything from guns to campaign finance reform. Those \nproposals are worthy of debate but nothing should distract this Chamber \nfrom what is first and foremost on the minds of the American people--\nthe education of our children.\n  I hope those who might consider such a stalling tactic or those who \nseek to move this debate and shift this debate from student \nperformance, student achievement, and improving our schools will \nreconsider and realize this bill not only deserves debate--the \ndifferences will be clear between the two sides--but this bill deserves \na vote. As the debate moves forward and the American people express \nthemselves, the Educational Opportunities Act deserves to be passed by \nthis Chamber and sent to the President.\n  What we have done for 34 years under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act has demonstrably failed. Senator Kennedy said it is tried \nand tested. It was tried and tested and it has failed the test. It is \ntime we change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for a well prepared \nand excellent statement.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague from Vermont whether or not after \nthe Senator from New Mexico speaks he could be followed by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, and I follow the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is the order in my mind.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that following the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the Senator from Tennessee proceed and I follow the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. REED. Reserving the right to object, in arranging the speaking \norder, is it possible to request to be recognized under the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I was alternating back and forth. We have not set time \nlimits, but I urge people to keep it within 15 minutes. Nobody has yet.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that following the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the Senator from Tennessee speak, I follow the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, and then the Senator from Rhode Island speak unless \nthere is a Republican, and then we go back and forth, and then the \nSenator from Rhode Island will speak.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let's proceed the way we have been proceeding. It will \nbe Senators Bingaman, Frist, the Senator from Minnesota, and I will be \nvery accommodating to my good friend from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I come to the floor today somewhat \nuneasy and conflicted about this debate. I am hopeful, on the one hand, \nthat we in the Senate can come together to provide national leadership \nby legislating what research has proven actually works in improving \nstudent performance. On the other hand, I stand having witnessed people \nfrom both sides of the aisle devoting a tremendous amount of time \nduring the last year trying to figure out how to help all of the \nchildren of this country make it in today's knowledge-based economy.\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\n  I am somewhat dismayed that the bill we finally arrived at the floor \nwith is not the consensus legislation we were working to achieve. \nUnfortunately, our efforts to achieve a consensus piece of legislation \nhave not succeeded. We have a bill before the Senate today which is \ndecidedly partisan. I hope that can be changed during the course of \nthis Senate debate.\n  We need to examine this bill carefully because it is very important \nand not easy to comprehend. The bill gives Governors, who choose to \nexercise it, control of Federal education dollars and it would abandon \nthe well-cultivated partnership and the powerful national leadership \nrole that has been developed over several years.\n  On the surface, we see it is a very large bill. I am sure several \npeople have held it up. It is similar to a lot of bills, almost \nincomprehensible in its length. It goes on for nearly 1,000 pages. It \nseems to be, on first reading, chock full of different programs for \npromising ideas such as Safe and Drug Free Schools, education \ntechnology, afterschool programs, even a rural education initiative.\n  It is the kind of assistance that individual schools and localities \nin New Mexico tell me they would like and need but they do not have the \ncapacity or the resources to pursue on their own. All of my fellow \ncommittee members who worked on this legislation in committee know full \nwell that no matter how well we collaborate on the underlying targeted \nprograms, the two Straight A's block grants that were layered on top of \nthe other language at the ninth hour of our deliberations make a lot of \nthe distinctions in the bill and a lot of the programs described in the \nbill virtually meaningless in those States that opt to pursue that \nblock grant.\n  The Straight A's proposal at the heart of the bill sounds catchy. \nHowever, in my view, it is an empty promise. What does it do? I think \nwe need to step back and ask: What do we mean by the Straight A's \nproposal? Essentially, it allows every State to spend Federal funds as \nthey wish for 5 years without input from school districts or educators, \nwithout accountability for increased school performance. Those who \nfavor the block grants say they are good because they allow for more \nlocal control. In the case of Straight A's, this is factually incorrect \nand ironic because a school district or a school actually will lose \ncontrol because the control is vested with the Governor to set the \npriorities for spending within the State.\n  This chart demonstrates that 95.5 percent of the Federal funds for \neducation go to local schools and local districts. State administration \ntakes 4 percent and the Federal administration takes one-half of 1 \npercent. The rest, over 95 percent, goes to the local schools.\n  Under the Straight A's proposal, a Governor who chooses to do so can \nchange that. The discretion as to how that money is spent is no longer \na Federal and a local issue; it becomes a State issue.\n  I think this would be a problem for my State of New Mexico. I know of \nprograms I very much want to see continued. I have trouble seeing how \nthey will be continued under this proposal. I have a list that details \nsome of the programs, and I will go through specific amounts.\n  In contrast to this Straight A's State block grant proposal, which is \nin the bill we are now considering, the alternative, which we have \nprepared and we are going to offer on the Democratic side, is not just \nto throw large sums of money to the States but, instead, to target \nFederal dollars to the communities with the greatest need and to give \nthem true local control by leaving it to them and not the Governor or \nSecretary of Education to decide how to set up programs to meet those \nneeds we have identified in those local communities.\n  Let me remind you, it was exactly because the States and the \nlocalities were not effectively addressing the needs of students in \ndisadvantaged areas that the Federal Government first stepped in to \nprovide targeted aid through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965. And, in subsequent Federal programs, we have followed this \nsame principle. We have focused on areas of national priority, areas \nsuch as education technology and improving professionalism in the \nclassroom. These are areas that otherwise would not be funded because \nof limited resources and that historically have not been funded at \nadequate levels.\n  Let me show one other chart that I think makes this point. When you \nlook at Federal funds, Federal funds are significantly more targeted to \nlow-income children than are State funds. I think no one disputes this. \nThis is a General Accounting Office study in January 1998. It says:\n\n       For every dollar provided for all children, $4.73 is given \n     from Federal funds to low-income children, whereas 62 cents \n     of local money actually goes to low-income children.\n\n  So the Federal Government got into the business of providing \nassistance to education in order to deal with deficiencies which \nclearly existed nationwide and to deal with inadequacies that were \nclearly agreed upon. This is what we are getting away from if we wind \nup adopting the bill which has been presented to us on the floor today.\n  The Straight A's proposal not only does nothing to ensure the most \nneedy children are protected; it allows Federal dollars to flow out of \nthe public school system in the form of vouchers to private schools. I \nknow that is another debate, but unfortunately it has been brought into \nthis debate about this Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nIncorporated into this is authority for a State to take its Federal \nfunds and disburse those in a voucher program to the nonpublic schools \nas well as the public schools. I think that would be a mistake. I think \nit would be a mistake in my State. We are short of resources. The \nFederal funds that come in to help the public schools in New Mexico are \nvery important to those public schools and we do not want to see those \nfunds decreased by virtue of some voucher program, which our Governor \ntoday, in all due respect, strongly favors. It has been a major subject \nof dispute in my State between the Governor and a majority of our \nlegislature.\n  Another feature the proponents of the block grant approach in this \nbill often talk about is providing greater accountability. In the case \nof this Straight A's proposal, the only accountability you will find is \nthat States which fail to make progress will lose a year of \neligibility. It is similar to benching your star player for one \nsemester for flunking a class but bringing him back once he gets his \naverage back up to a D. That is an analogous situation. There is no \nreal accountability in the bill as it comes before us.\n  Under S. 2, as it now stands, at the extreme--and I don't think this \nwill be done, but clearly there have been examples in the past when we \nhad block grants permitted--you could have States deciding to use \nFederal dollars to buy swimming pools, to recarpet offices. The State \ncould choose maintaining the status quo as its goal over the 5 years.\n  A less malevolent picture, and one that probably is more likely, is \nthat a Governor would receive pressure from a handful of constituent \ngroups to persuade him or her to pour all of the block-granted Federal \nfunds into something such as an intensive literacy program or a voucher \nprogram to send kids to private schools. This will sound good, but the \nproblem is you will find it means there are no longer funds for migrant \nand homeless children to receive targeted aid; there is no longer money \nto provide for professional development for teachers so in some \nclassrooms the computer can be used effectively; there is no longer \nmoney for afterschool programs; no longer money to hire new teachers. \nAt the end of the day, as long as the wealthier and higher performing \nschools in the State can do well enough to offset stagnation or even \ndecline in progress at the poorer and lower performing schools, then \nthe Governor would be able to claim he has done his job under the \nStraight A's proposal.\n\n  If he did not do the job, if the goal was not met, then no matter; he \nwould probably be out of office at any rate before the 5-year \nexperiment was over. If he is not, the only consequence is that he \nsimply would go back to the status quo we have today. So this Straight \nA's proposal contains no significant accountability.\n  I have an amendment I intend to offer on the issue of accountability. \nIt will try to correct this. It does so by putting some key provisions \nin the legislation that would provide resources\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\nto States for turning around those schools that are failing. It would \ndemand results of all students so as to eradicate existing achievement \ngaps between minority and nonminority students, between poor and non-\npoor students, between English-speaking students and those who do not \nspeak English as a first language.\n  It would provide significant consequences for poor performance, so \nStates and districts have to take responsibility for actually \ncorrecting the deficiencies in the failing schools. It would require a \nsingle system of accountability for all schools in the State and would \nlimit the availability of flexibility options when a system of \naccountability is not yet in place.\n  The amendment also would ensure that every class would have a \nqualified teacher. It would do that by requiring States which receive \nFederal funds to make that a priority, to ensure that resources are \nprovided and school plans incorporate high-quality, research-based \nprofessional development for their instructional staff.\n  There will be a chance to debate this particular accountability \namendment as we go forward. I hope very much it can be adopted. It \nwould correct many of the deficiencies in the legislation on which I am \nfocused today. But, in addition, as we debate this education bill, I \nintend to bring attention to some other elements that I do not think \nare adequately addressed in the bill. I want to remind the Senate of \nthe importance of teacher training in technology. It simply is not good \nenough that only 20 percent of current teachers are comfortable \nintegrating technology into the subjects they teach or that we \ncurrently invest less than a third of what the experts tell us we \nshould spend on technology training for people going into teaching. We \nneed to deal with that. I will be offering an amendment to do that.\n  Also, in response to concerns from school districts, and also a \nGeneral Accounting Office study that demonstrates there is still a high \nlevel of paperwork burden on schools and districts from States and from \nenvironmental and nutritional regulations, I urge a close examination. \nI have an amendment to do so, to urge a close examination of all of \nthose requirements to try to determine how we can achieve those goals \nwithout unduly burdening the schools.\n\n  Today and throughout the discussion of this bill this week, and I \nbelieve next week as well, I intend to propose some amendments. I hope \nthe Senate will think hard about what it is doing here. This is \nextremely important legislation.\n  I acknowledge there are some philosophical differences on the \nappropriate Federal role in public education. I must call attention to \nthe great shift in attitudes in the Senate since I came here 18 years \nago on the proper role of the Federal Government in education. I am \nvery heartened that we are here today with all sides of the debate \narguing in favor of a major Federal role and disagreeing about what it \nshould be. I can remember many other debates on the Senate floor where \nthe argument was that the Federal Government should get out of the \neducation field, that we should disband the Department of Education, we \nshould, essentially, shift those funds over to the Department of \nDefense and be done with it. So we have made progress in our debate in \nthe Senate. But we clearly have not made enough or we would not have \nthis Straight A's proposal in front of us today.\n  Today the Federal Government's contribution to education spending is \nroughly 7 cents on the dollar. Yet through an understanding that there \nis, indeed, a national priority, in the 35 years of the partnership \nthere have been significant improvements. That 7 cents on the dollar \nhas been focused on needs we all agreed needed attention. I believe we \ncan strengthen those programs that work, we can reform those that do \nnot work, and there are some which are not working as well as they \nshould. But we need to keep our eye on the ball and continue to target \nthe Federal funds, the scarce Federal dollars that we have to put into \neducation, on the students and the schools that need them the most.\n  We need to rise to the occasion. We need to enact a bill that will \nhelp further the goals of education. We need to come together in the \nSenate and not let partisan differences and the upcoming election \ndivide us in this very important set of issues.\n  There is no more important legislation that will come before Congress \nthis year. I hope very much we can come together on some reasonable \nchanges in this bill so it becomes acceptable and we can send it to the \nPresident in a form he will sign.\n  I want to mention several more items. In my home State of New Mexico, \nwe receive over $1 million for migrant education, we receive $10.4 \nmillion targeted for class-size reduction, we receive $2.5 million for \nprofessional development, and we receive nearly $3.5 million for the \ntechnology literacy challenge fund. Those are important programs. Those \nare programs upon which the school districts in my State have come to \ndepend. I do not want to see the funds for those programs eliminated. I \ndo not want to see a blank check go to the State with discretion vested \nin the Governor to either continue or discontinue those programs as he \nsees fit.\n  I believe it is important we amend this bill in significant ways. I \nwill be joining with my colleagues in offering some of those \namendments. I hope very much they will be adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is now recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, it is a great opportunity we have as we \ndebate over the next several days the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act which makes fundamental improvements to education \nprograms that are long in need of such reform.\n  Declining student performance, especially as we compare the \nperformance of our students in public schools to the performance of \nstudents internationally, simply demands a new response. Our students \ndeserve better. It is time to change our Federal education programs to \nensure that school districts, schools, States, and parents have the \ntools they need to provide a high-quality education for all children.\n  As we look back over the last 30 or 40 years, there have been waves \nof education reform, but each of these waves seems to have been washed \naway as shifting sand, leaving little trace of permanent improvement in \npublic education in this country. Even as funding has increased over \ntime, performance has fallen, as we compare our students \ninternationally, leaving teachers and parents to wonder if anything can \nbe done to reclaim those years of lost potential.\n  There is, however, a new movement of education reform sweeping the \nUnited States of America. Because of it, we have a unique opportunity \nto significantly and permanently improve education in this country. We \nhave the opportunity to see to it that every child in every public \nschool in America is, indeed, challenged by standards as high as those \nhopes and those promises of his or her parents, and it is an \nopportunity we cannot and should not waste.\n  We must face today that schools that do not educate, schools that do \nnot teach, and will not change must in the future be held accountable. \nThe diminished hopes of America's children as a result of our \ndeteriorating public education--again most notable as we compare our \nschools and the performance of our students internationally--are sad \nand serious, and no longer can we ignore these diminished hopes.\n\n  We have an opportunity to and we must raise the academic ambition of \nevery school. There are practical things we can do, such as lifting the \nburden of Federal bureaucracy by giving each school the opportunity, \nthe flexibility, to change, all along demanding they be held \naccountable to high standards.\n  Mired in bureaucratic mediocrity, Government today has become almost \nan obstacle, a barrier, not an ally, and it is time for us in \nWashington to acknowledge that the Federal role in education is not \njust to serve the system but to actually serve the child.\n  Yes, Washington must realize that no longer can we attempt to \nmicromanage the day-to-day activities in our schools. We in Washington \nmust realize and must be wise enough to recognize that schools require \nmore flexibility; they require more innovation; they require more \nfreedom to be innovative. Washington must be strong enough to insist on \nimproving performance in return for this flexibility.\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\n  All of us know the tremendous change that is occurring in the 21st \ncentury. We see it around us each and every day, and amidst this change \nwe all know deep inside that the future is ultimately decided by how \nmuch our kids learn. Education is the key that will unlock the future \nfor our children, and that positive, strong education, that \npreparation, must begin in those earliest years--kindergarten, 8th \ngrade, 12th grade. Only successful learning will truly equip our \nchildren for this changing world, and it is time--and we do it in this \nbill--we begin to think boldly about this vision for education.\n  We need to ask the questions: What doors will we open for our \nchildren? What pictures are we going to paint for their future? Will we \nincrease their capacity to learn and to explore or are we going to go \nback and continue to create and enforce barriers that have only failed \nus in the past, that are holding them back as our international \ncounterparts continue to learn and pass them by?\n  Education is, as we will hear again and again, the most important \ngift we can give our children, but the foundation for all lifetime \nlearning is established in these early years of K-12, where we are--and \nwe must admit it--where we are today failing. More of the same is \nsimply not the answer.\n  We have a choice: We can either turn a blind eye to the problems of \neducation today and say, well, let's just add another Federal program, \nor let's accept mediocrity, or let's ignore accountability, or we can \ndo what is bold, what is built into this underlying bill, and that is, \ngive schools the flexibility to be innovative, give States the freedom \nto regulate, and give parents, who care the most about their children, \nthe right to choose what is best for their children.\n  We have to admit it is going to take a lot more than the power of \nWashington to fix education in this country. We need the power of \npeople at the local level--the parents, the teachers, the principals, \nthe school superintendents--to help us discover and apply what works. \nOnce they do, we must give them the freedom to apply what they learn.\n  I mentioned accountability. How can we get schools which are failing \nour children, not educating our children, to change, to improve? Yes, \nby giving them the resources they need, but also holding them \naccountable for their failure. Schools that succeed in educating \nchildren should be rewarded. Schools that fail again and again must be \nheld accountable. We know that rewarding failure only produces more \nfailure, condemning our children to a whole lifetime of low \nexpectations. The issue is about excellence.\n  Today every child does have access to a public school, but not every \none of those schools provides an adequate or quality education.\n  The issue of student performance: If we look at where we are today \nand just face the facts, it is absolutely critical that we recognize we \nare not doing as well as our children deserve.\n  In America, 12th graders today rank not 1st, not 5th, not 10th, not \n15th, but 19th out of 21 industrialized countries in math achievement.\n  In the field of science, we are not 1st, or 5th, or 10th, or 15th, \nbut we are 16th out of 21 nations.\n  If we look in the field of advanced physics, our students rank dead \nlast.\n  Since 1983:\n  Over 10 million students have reached the 12th grade without learning \nto read at a basic level;\n  Over 20 million students have reached their senior year unable to do \nbasic math;\n  Almost 25 million students have reached the 12th grade not knowing \nthe essentials of U.S. history; and\n  Over 6 million Americans have dropped out of high school altogether.\n  S. 2, the bill we are debating this week, the Educational \nOpportunities Act, gives new opportunity, new promises.\n  We hear again and again of the importance of local control, where \nparents know their children's needs the best, where teachers know the \nnames of the students, rather than making these micromanaged, heavily \nregulated decisions here in Washington, DC.\n  It is simply time for us to recognize we should stop feeding the \nbureaucracy here in Washington and start funding the classroom, start \nfunding the student. This is about sending the money where it will do \nthe most good.\n  Simply put, in Washington too many education dollars are wasted on \nadministration and bureaucracy and redtape while too few of those \ndollars ever reach the people they are intended to help--the students.\n  Can Federal education dollars be spent more efficiently and more \nintelligently than they are today? Yes. How? First, we can stop wasting \nthem in Washington. Today, the dollars actually travel from the \ntaxpayer up through our system, and then they filter back down through \nabout 760 separate Federal education programs, each overlapping the \nother, run by 40 different Federal bureaucracies.\n  We can start sending those same dollars, as they travel up through \nthe system, back to the local level, back to the classroom, back to the \ncommunities where parents and teachers and principals can identify \ntheir children's needs. What is right for rural Tennessee simply may \nnot be what is right for schools in the Bronx. We need to let the local \nschools, the local communities, decide, not Washington.\n  Today, about half of the personnel employed by our U.S. public school \nsystem are not teachers but administrators hired to keep up with the \nFederal rules and the regulations. What we need is simplification of \nthese regulations, a streamlining, a more efficient use of those \nFederal education dollars.\n  I have said that no one cares more about children than their parents. \nYou will hear, as this debate unfolds, that the bill, S. 2, is biased \ntoward increasing the role of parents in education today and decreasing \nthe role of regulations which originate in Washington, DC.\n\n  Yes, education is not a Federal issue; it is a family issue. \nEducation is not about bureaucrats; it is about children and their \nparents and the future of those children. Parents--who have those daily \nconversations with their children, who do help their children with \ntheir homework, who attend regular conferences with their teachers--\nproduce better educated students than parents who leave the education \nof their children to bureaucrats.\n  If America's schools are failing our children, parents should have \nthe power to steer their children to more effective schools, to more \neffective instruction. After all, those dollars, wherever they come \nfrom--and, yes, most of them do originate locally, and only 6 or 7 \npercent come from the Federal Government--ultimately it is the parents' \nmoney, it is their children and their children's future.\n  Whether a child is a quick learner, or a slow learner, or a child \nwith disabilities, or a child who just seems to not be able to function \nin the school that he is in, parents should have the freedom--I would \nargue they have the right--to move that child to a school where he has \nthe best chance to succeed, to learn, to be prepared for his future.\n  In some cases, parental choice is about schools with better \neducational opportunities; in other cases, it is literally about \nremoving a child from the line of fire or away from the danger of \ndrugs. The point is, parents do have the right--and they deserve the \npower, I believe--to choose what is best for their child.\n  Parental choice: It is about schools. It is about parental \ninvolvement. It is about doing what is best for your child. It is about \nhaving a say in how your education tax dollars are spent.\n  In closing, I do believe we have a unique opportunity to reform \nFederal education programs. S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act, \nmakes a number of key reforms to current law, with the focus on \nproducing child-centered programs--not Washington-centered programs but \nchild-centered programs--that are flexible, that are results oriented, \nthat have strong accountability built in, and that will lead to \nimproved achievement for all our students.\n  The Educational Opportunities Act seeks to encourage reform rather \nthan mandate particular changes at the Federal level. In this bill, no \none is forced to do anything. The act encourages reform by allowing \nthis choice. States and districts have an option either to keep exactly \nthe sort of funding formulas and the categorical programs they have \ntoday--as they may have done over the last 35 years--or to embrace \nthese new options, these new initiatives, based on local control and\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nflexibility and accountability. It is these new initiatives which \nrequire--and must require--a high level of accountability in exchange \nfor that flexibility.\n  I am very excited about the debate today. We will be talking about a \nnumber of principles. Over the course of the week, we will be talking \nabout the details of the bill. This debate is critically important. The \nbottom line is: Our children deserve better than what we are doing \ntoday. S. 2 addresses the reforms necessary for them to do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, the senior Senator from Minnesota is \nnext. We have about seven more Senators who desire to speak. We are not \nputting any time limitation on them. I am just making Senators aware of \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair and say to my colleague from Vermont \nI will try to stay under 3 hours.\n  Madam President, I, too, think we can do better by our children. It \npains me a little bit to say what I am about to say--not for 3 hours--\nbecause I respect the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords of \nVermont.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield before he gets into the substance \nof his remarks?\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the remarks, I \nbelieve, by my colleague from Georgia, I be allowed to address the \nSenate on the subject matter for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, just as a point of clarification, I \nbelieve the next speaker on our side will be Senator Gregg. So if the \nSenator modifies his unanimous consent request, and it is granted, he \nwill follow Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. DODD. I modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, as much as I respect my colleague \nfrom Vermont holding up the standard that we can do better for our \nchildren, holding up the standard that we need somehow to renew our \nnational vow of equal opportunity for every child, I do not believe \nthis piece of legislation represents the change I have been hearing \nabout. I do not believe S. 2 represents a great step forward for \nchildren in our country, especially vulnerable children. I think this \npiece of legislation, S. 2, represents not a great leap forward but a \ngreat leap backwards.\n  I come to the floor as a Senator from Minnesota to speak against this \nlegislation in its present form because I was a teacher for 20 years, a \ncollege teacher, before becoming a U.S. Senator. Education is my \npassion. I speak against S. 2 because I have been in a school every 2 \nweeks since I was elected almost 10 years ago. I love teaching. I love \nbeing in schools. Today I was at a rally at the State capitol in \nMinnesota with some great students from all around Minnesota who are \nseeing cuts in their school districts, teachers being eliminated, extra \ncurricular activities eliminated, larger class sizes, and course \nofferings being eliminated.\n  I come to the floor to speak against this legislation because I \nbelieve the goodness of our country is to make sure that every child \nhas the same opportunity to reach her or his full potential, and \neducation is the foundation of this opportunity. This piece of \nlegislation does not represent a step forward. It is turning the clock \nback 30, 40 years. That is unacceptable to me as a Senator.\n  This bill is fundamentally flawed because of the programs that it \nblock grants. There is a reason why we made a commitment to migrant \neducation. There is a reason why we made a commitment to homeless \nchildren. There is a reason why we made a specific commitment with \naccountability standards to make sure that title I works for children \nwho are disadvantaged and they can do better in school. There is a \nreason why these are categorical programs. There is a reason why we \nhave set some standards.\n  The reason is, the House of Representatives and the Senate decided \nthat we are a national community as well as States. And as a national \ncommunity, we make a commitment in the House and the Senate that no \nchild, no matter how poor or how vulnerable, no matter the son or \ndaughter of migrant farm workers or a child who is homeless or a child \nwho is living in an inner-city or rural neighborhood that is poor, it \nmakes no difference; those children will also receive assistance. There \nwill be standards. That is a national decision because we are a \nnational community. This piece of legislation throws that out.\n  Some of my colleagues come to the floor and say: We are for change. \nWhat kind of change?\n  Pretitle I, to give but one example, we had the example of school \ndistricts using this money to purchase football uniforms, band \nuniforms, swimming pools, and all of the rest. That is why we decided \nwe were not going to block grant this money. That is why we decided we \nwere going to make sure the title I money went for the children who \nneeded the help.\n  I had hoped we would not have this crude block grant program that \nturns the clock back 30 years plus. I thought we would start out with a \nbipartisan bill. That is not the direction we have gone.\n  This turns the clock back. This basically says, if you are a child of \na mother who is homeless and your mother doesn't have much clout, if \nyou are the child of migrant farm workers and they don't have much \npolitical power, or you are the child of parents who are poor and they \ndon't have much clout, it doesn't matter what the State you are living \nin decides to do. The Governors are free to spend the money however \nthey want. That is what this legislation says in its present form.\n  That is not a step forward. That is a step backward. That is a step \nbackward from the national commitment we have made as the House of \nRepresentatives and Senate, that all the children in this country, \nincluding vulnerable children, will have a chance to do well.\n\n  I have heard my colleagues say: I hope we get into some real debate; \nI will be pleased to yield for a question any time. Well, we need to do \nthis because we have had 30 or 40 years of these programs, going back \nto the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Look at the \nstatistics. We haven't seen any change. There are too many children of \ncolor and too many poor children and too many children with limited \nEnglish proficiency who are not doing well. Now we bring a bill to the \nfloor that is going to make things much better.\n  Give me a break. When I am in communities talking to students and \nparents, talking to people in schools, nobody ever comes up to me and \nsays: Can we have more Ed-Flex? They don't even know what it is. Hardly \nany States have even applied for it. They don't talk to me about Ed-\nFlex, Flex-Flex, flexibility.\n  They say: Why doesn't the Federal Government make a commitment to \npre-K, since most of K through 12 is us? Why don't you adequately fund \ngood developmental child care so when children come to kindergarten \nthey are ready to learn, and we don't have this huge learning gap where \nsome children are way behind, then fall further behind, then drop out, \nthen wind up in prison? Why don't you get real and invest in \ndevelopmental child care?\n  Not with this budget from this majority. And, by the way, not with \nthe budget proposal from this President. We haven't made this \ncommitment.\n  We say we have S. 2 out here because this is for change, to make \nthings better for these children. If we want to make things better for \nthe children, why don't we fully fund the IDEA program so that our \nschool districts don't have to fill in the void? Let's fully fund it. \nLet's get real about the actual investment of dollars. Why do we not \nfully fund the title I program? We are funding title I at about a 30-\npercent level.\n  When I am in St. Paul or Minneapolis, to use two cities in my State--\nand I could talk about other communities--I don't have parents and \nteachers and others rushing up to me saying: We need more Ed-Flex.\n  They say to me: After you get to the schools that don't have at least \n65 percent of the students poor, those schools get no funding at all \nbecause we have run out of title I funding for children who come from \nbackgrounds of difficult circumstances, come to school\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\nill-prepared, are behind, need additional help. We fund this program at \nthe 30-percent level, to the point where at the schools in our cities \nin my State, if they don't have at least a 65-percent low-income \nstudent population, they don't receive any funding.\n  When I talk to people in Minnesota, they ask me: Can we get the best \nteachers? What does this legislation do about getting the best teachers \ninto teaching? Can we figure out creative ways of having more parental \ninvolvement? Can we have smaller class size? Can we focus on good \nprofessional development for teachers? Maybe the money could be used \nfor the Eisenhower programs for math and science, but we eliminate the \nprogram. The Eisenhower Program has been a huge success. In fact, I \nwould like to do more of it. I would like to have money designated for \nprofessional development. The original National Defense Education Act \nhad those summer institutes for teachers, and they were great. Teachers \nloved getting together. They loved comparing notes. They revitalized \none another with new approaches to teaching, new pedagogy, new \nsubstantive matter. It was great.\n  I hear about that. In Minnesota, I also hear about--and I know it is \ntrue in every State--decaying infrastructure, crumbling schools. The \nargument is, can we figure out a way of having more dollars to rebuild \nour schools? S. 2 doesn't speak to any of these issues.\n  I wish to make a couple of other points. One of them is that I have \nheard colleagues talk about flexibility, and this is, I will admit, \nmore a State issue. I don't know quite how we leverage it at the \nFederal level. But Jonathan Kozol has done a wonderful work called \n``Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a \nNation''--and he has written another book and he sent me some data from \nNew York--which says the difference between what New York City spends \nper pupil is about $8,000 per year per pupil and the suburbs range from \n$16,000 to $23,000 to $24,000 a year--two and three times as much. \nJonathan Kozol's earlier book was called ``Savage Inequalities.''\n  So we do not, in this piece of legislation, make sure we live up to \nour commitment that there should be equal opportunity for every child \nand that we should do all we can to make sure poor children and \nvulnerable children have those opportunities.\n  We do precious little to deal with the savage inequalities about \nwhich Kozol talks. We have been shameful in our lack of investment, and \nI know the Senator from Vermont is all for this; he has been an \noutspoken proponent for this. But in our shameful lack of investment in \nearly childhood development, we don't fully fund the IDEA program, \nChildren With Disabilities, and we don't come close to fully funding \nthe title I program. In addition, this piece of legislation shows no \nstrong, unequivocal, positive commitment to how we get the great \nteachers into our schools, how we reduce the class size, how we invest \nin crumbling schools, how we make sure parents are involved, how we \ndeal with the digital divide, how we make sure schools have adequate \nresources, how we make sure children do well before they go to school \nand when they go home. It is just not here.\n  So this piece of legislation is lacking in two fundamental respects: \nA, it is not a great step forward; it is a great leap backward. It \nturns the clock back from a commitment to vulnerable, poor children in \nAmerica. I will oppose it with all my might for that reason, with its \nblock grant. B, it doesn't, in the affirmative, authorize or talk about \nthe kind of investment or funding in the decisive areas that would be \nso important to change so that we could do even better as a nation.\n  Madam President, I wanted to mention a couple of amendments that I \nhave, and then I want to make a plea to the majority leader--not to the \nchair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  I will have an amendment that expresses the sense of the Congress \nthat States and districts that use standardized tests to make high-\nstakes decisions about students should be professional standards on \neducational testing. It should not really be controversial, I hope. But \nI think we have to make sure these tests are used well. I am going to \ncall for a study on the impact of high-stakes testing policies on \nstudents, teachers, and curriculum because I am very worried that when \nwe start using single standardized tests to determine whether a third \ngrader goes to fourth grade, what kind of reading group you are in, \nwhether you graduate, and all the rest, and we have done little to make \nsure every child has the same opportunity to actually pass the test, \nwhat we have done is put the responsibility on kids and students for \nour failure to invest in their future and their achievement. So I think \nwe at least ought to do a study. We ought to have an understanding.\n\n  I will have an amendment making it clear that if States and school \ndistricts use standardized tests to make the high-stakes decisions--I \nam all for testing for diagnostic purposes--to determine whether a \nstudent graduates or goes from one grade to another, at the very \nminimum, appropriate accommodations must be made for language \nproficiency and students with disabilities.\n  There will be an amendment I am going to sort of dedicate to my \nfriend Paul Simon, who is no longer in the Senate. We did this \ntogether. It authorizes grants to urban school districts so they can \nimplement any of the following programs in innovative ways to help \neliminate the learning gap, as it affects children of color and the \npoor, and that could be the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, \nProfessional Development Act, the Immigrant Education program, or the \nClass Size Reduction Program. The Presiding Officer has done a good job \nof making sure we keep the rural piece in, and I am in full accord with \nthat. I want to make sure we also keep in the urban piece.\n  I will have an amendment about which I was talking to my friend, \nSenator Coverdell from Georgia, which I think is extremely important, \nto provide some support for children who witness violence at home. \nEvery 13 seconds a woman is battered in her home. These children don't \nsee the violence in the movies or on television; they see it in their \nliving rooms. It has a devastating effect on their performance at \nschool, and quite often in our schools we don't even know what is \nhappening with these kids. I want to get some support services for them \nso they can do better.\n  I have an amendment to recruit and train highly qualified teachers \nfor high-poverty urban and rural schools. This would provide $500 \nmillion to fund a collaborative between State education agencies, local \neducation agencies, and institutes of higher education. This is how we \ncan recruit people, whether they are right out of college or whether \nthey are people who make a lateral change at age 40 or 50 and want to \nteach in schools. We want to get the training to them and have the \nmentoring. We want to have the internships, and we want to get this \nkind of talent into our schools, especially those schools with a large \nlow-income student population.\n  I will have an amendment that calls for local family information \ncenters. This would expand the Parent Information and Research Center \nProgram in title I to include nonprofit organizations. Sometimes the \nway we can reach some of the hard-to-reach parents is to get them \ninvolved through some of the nonprofits in the community. I think there \ncan be good, bipartisan support for this.\n  I will have an amendment that provides seed money for schools to hire \nmore counselors for mental health services. In my State of Minnesota, \nthe ratio is 1 counselor for every 1,000 students. Indeed, many of \nthose counselors are trained more to what college or university you go \nto, or, if you don't go on to college, what kinds of jobs will be \navailable. What about the kids who have mental health needs? How are we \ngoing to be able to recognize these kids who are struggling and get \nhelp to them?\n  How are we going to tell them? That is a hugely important issue.\n  I am going to have an amendment that provides seed money for \ncounselors. I am not sure how many. I am going to figure out exactly \nthe amendment that I think has the best chance of passing so we can \nmake a good start in this area.\n  Finally, I am going to have an amendment I offered before. I will not \nspend much time on it. We had a vote on it. I want it to be on the \nrecord that\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nI want some historian to include me in a small footnote that we have \nnot done the policy evaluation of ``welfare reform.'' We really do not \nknow where these mothers are. We don't know what kind of jobs they \nhave. We don't know whether the family has had medical assistance. We \ndon't know why there is a dramatic decline in food stamp participation. \nWe don't know what the child care situation is with their kids. We need \nto know, especially since in the next 2 years all of these families are \ngoing to be off assistance and we are going to be pushing a lot of \nvulnerable people off the cliff. I want some policy evaluation.\n  Nobody can tell me this has nothing to do with education because when \nchildren are hungry, they don't do well in school. When children come \nto school with an abscessed tooth because they have no health care or \ndental care, they don't do well in school. When the child care \nsituation is miserable--it ranges from downright dangerous to not even \nadequate--those children come to kindergarten way behind. I have an \namendment that calls for this policy evaluation.\n  I say to the Senator from Vermont that I am not going to go on for 2 \nhours. But this is an important bill for me. I will probably take 5 or \n10 minutes. I will save him having to get up all the time. I will be \nfinished. But I don't want too much pressure on me to be finished \nbecause then I will just get started again.\n  I want to conclude with this appeal to my colleagues on the other \nside.\n  I have stated the reasons for my opposition. Senator Gregg of New \nHampshire will be out here. He will be a powerful advocate for a \ndifferent position. I hope we will have at it. We can do it with \ncivility. We can be formal. Presumably we have respect for one another. \nBut let's have at it. Let's come out here and let the Senate operate as \nthe Senate operates at its best. Let's start bringing amendments out \nhere. Let's have up-or-down votes on amendments. If we need to start \nearly in the morning, let's start early in the morning. If we need to \ngo not until midnight out into the evening, great. Let's work.\n  This is a major bill. I think we all agree that there is no more \nimportant issue. Frankly, the Federal role is critical. This piece of \nlegislation is critical. Let's have at it. It is not atypical when you \nhave a bill of this importance.\n  I was talking to my colleague from Georgia about this. You have a \nbill out on the floor for a couple of weeks. That would be good. I \nwouldn't be at all surprised if there were 90 or 100 amendments. I \nremember during my earlier years, it happened all the time. Amendments \nfall off, or people bring amendments out, and people agree to time \nlimits. Let's go at it. Let's have the debate. Let's make sure it is a \nsubstantive debate.\n  I have a number of amendments. Other Senators have amendments. That \nis the way you operate as a Senator. That is how you can make a \ndifference. That is how you can try to follow up on what people in your \nState have told you about some of the needs and gaps. That is how you \ncan try to be a good Senator. Let's do it.\n\n  We will take a couple of weeks with this. Then we will pass a bill, \nor we will defeat a bill, or it will be similar to what it is now, or \nit will be dramatically changed. But I think the country is ready for \nthat.\n  I think the country is ready for us to have substantive debate. I \nthink it is ready for us to be out here on the floor working. It is \nready for us to be talking about what we believe--I think the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island will agree--would be best for education in our States \nand how we can contribute. It wants that discussion. That is why we are \nhere. I hope we will do that.\n  I hope the majority leader will not come out here in 2 days, which \nhas been the typical fashion--I am not talking behind his back; I have \nsaid this over and over again--and say: I don't like these amendments \nthat deal with how you get guns out of schools; I don't like this \namendment and, I don't like that amendment; these amendments aren't \nrelevant; only if you agree to the following four or five or six \namendments, or whatever, do we go forward. And we say: Absolutely not. \nWe are here as Senators. We have amendments. We are ready to work for \npeople in our State. Then cloture is filed. If there is not cloture, \nthe bill is pulled.\n  I don't think it is a very good bill. So in one sense, I wouldn't be \nunhappy with that result. But as a Senator, I would be unhappy with the \nresult. I want to go forward. I want to have the debate. I want to have \nat this legislation for a couple of weeks. I want us to consider the \namendments out here. I say to the majority leader what I have said \ntwice now: You suck the vitality out of the Senate when you don't let \npeople come out here and offer their amendments and have this debate. \nWe are at our best when we do that, I think.\n  I am all set to go. I am in profound opposition to this legislation. \nI think it is a profound mistake. One person's solution is another \nperson's horror. The Senator from New Hampshire thinks it is just the \nopposite. That is fine. He will state it well. Let's have opening \nstatements. Let's get to the amendments. Let's have debate. And let's \nmove forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I will make a unanimous consent \nrequest so we know where we stand.\n  Next to speak is Senator Gregg; then Senator Dodd, Senator Reed, \nSenator Bunning, and then Senator Lieberman--three or four other \nMembers--for a period not to exceed 45 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, the 45 minutes applies to \nSenator Lieberman.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Senator Lieberman and his group. Others are flexible. \nBut I suggest 15 minutes is an adequate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Vermont for bringing this bill \nforward. We recognize it is an extraordinarily important piece of \nlegislation because it sets Federal policy for education, especially in \nthe primary area where the Federal Government has responsibility, which \nis low-income education.\n  There are really two areas of elementary and secondary school \neducation where the Federal Government is the dominant player. One, of \ncourse, is elementary school education--the low-income kids. The other \nis elementary school education for special needs children. This bill \ndoesn't address the special needs issue. It is not the IDEA bill, which \nis a special needs bill. This bill focuses primarily on how we deal \nwith low-income children.\n  I think it is important to reflect a little bit as we begin this \ndebate as to what the history of this piece of legislation is because \nthat puts in context to a significant degree why it is we on our side \nbelieve there needs to be interest for other options to be made \navailable to the States as they address the issue of educating and \nhelping low-income children achieve and, thus, realize the American \ndream.\n  This bill was put together 35 years ago. At that time, it was a 32-\npage bill with 5 specific programs. Today, this bill before us has 922 \npages; it has 79 different programs. It is a huge piece of legislation \nwhich has expanded radically over the period of the last 35 years. It \noriginally had, and still has, categorical program after categorical \nprogram which specifically told the local school districts and the \nStates how to manage very narrow areas of education in a very \nprescribed way.\n  There has been a philosophy built up over 35 years in this Congress--\nessentially dominated by the Democratic Party when this bill evolved--\nthat essentially says: We in Washington know a heck of a lot better how \nto educate a low-income child than you folks back in the districts do \nwhere that child is going to school; We know better than the parents of \nthat child; We know better than the teachers of that child; We know \nbetter than the principal; We know better than the school district; And \nwe know better than the State.\n  As a result, this bill exploded from a 32-page bill to a 1,000-page \nbill with program after program after program very narrowly, rifle-shot \ntargeted with\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\nsignificant limitations on the funds being spent and significant \ndirections for the local communities.\n  What was the result? The result was that over that period we spent \nalmost $130 billion in education directed at low-income children--$130 \nbillion over 35 years. What did we get for that? Unfortunately, what we \nhad was a bunch of kids who were left behind--children to whom we had \nmade a commitment, and low-income children who weren't educated hardly \nat all as a result of all of these dollars being spent.\n  We know for a fact today that two out of every three low-income \nfourth grade African American and Hispanic children can barely read. \nThis chart shows that over 70 percent of the children in our high-\npoverty schools who are low-income do not meet the most basic levels in \nreading. We know 60 percent of those children do not meet the basic \nlevels of mathematics. We know almost 70 percent of those children do \nnot meet the basic levels in science.\n  This is the product we have produced $130 billion and 35 years later: \n79 programs and 1,000 pages of law. We know in our high-poverty \nschools, low-income kids in the fourth grade read at two grade levels \nless than their peers who are not low-income. We know in our urban \nschools almost half our children are not graduating from high school. \nWe know the achievement gap between our moderate-income, our average-\nincome kids and our low-income kids is not closing as it was supposed \nto after $130 billion but is potentially expanding and, at best remains \nthe same.\n  We have gotten nothing for these kids from all this money that has \nbeen spent. It is not just our low-income kids, the children addressed \nin this bill who are being affected by the quality of education, but \nour entire educational system has serious problems. Forty percent of \nour fourth graders can't read at a fourth grade level. Our 12th graders \nhave seen either a decline in reading, math, and writing skills or, at \nbest, a stagnation of reading, math, and writing skills. I am talking \nabout all 12th graders--not just low-income 12th graders.\n  Our 12th graders, compared with the rest of the world, which is where \nwe are competing today, and what our prosperity is tied to, come in \nabout last among industrialized nations. We are behind Hungary, \nSlovenia, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden. We are just about \nlast in levels of academic achievement in mathematics and last for our \nacademic levels in science.\n  We know there are 7,000 schools in this country today that are deemed \nfailing schools. They are not defined as ``failing'' by the Federal \nGovernment. We have not set a standard to say a school is failing. They \nare defined as failing by the school systems at the State and local \nlevels that rate their own levels. School systems rating their own \nschools have identified over 7,000 schools that do not meet the \nstandards they have set. Some of the schools have had the failing \ndesignation for not just 1 or 2 years but for up to 6 or 10 years.\n  We need to be very concerned about this. We are not the only ones, as \nlegislatures, who are concerned. Our manufacturers and our people who \nare trying to hire folks so they can become prosperous, so they can \nhave good jobs, and so we as a country can compete internationally, are \nconcerned. United States manufacturers have found that 40 percent of \nall 17-year-olds do not have the math skills necessary to do the job \nfor which they are hired; 60 percent do not have the reading skills \nnecessary to do a manufacturing job. That is a staggering number. Over \nhalf the kids leaving our school systems come in to their work \nexperience without the ability to do the job because they cannot read \nand they cannot do math.\n  Madam President, 76 percent of our college professors and 63 percent \nof our employers believe that a high school diploma is no guarantee the \ntypical student has learned the basics necessary to function in our \nsociety, and specifically, in college and the businesses into which \nthey are being hired.\n  We obviously have a very significant problem. I must stress this \nproblem isn't a lack of money. As I said, we have spent $130 billion \nfor title I kids over the last 35 years. We have also as a Federal \nGovernment dramatically increased our funding. This chart reflects how \nmuch we have increased funding for education generally in this country \nfrom 1950 to the year 1997--from about $10 billion to well over $300 \nbillion in total expenditures from K-12.\n  This chart shows how much we are spending on our increases on \nchildren per pupil during that period. From 1970 to 1999, we see the \nincrease per pupil went from $1,000 to well over $7,000 in this \ncountry.\n  The United States spends 6 percent of its national income on primary \nand secondary school education which is more than any other of those \nindustrialized countries. Every one of these countries spends less of \ntheir gross national product for education than the United States, \nexcept Denmark and Canada. All the other countries spend less as a \npercentage of their national product on education.\n  It is not a function of dollars being spent. It is a function of what \nwe are getting for our dollars that we are spending that is the \nproblem.\n  Somebody else said it is a function of the teacher ratio; We simply \nhave too many kids in the classrooms for the teachers to handle. There \nmay be instances where that is the case. I think that is possibly true. \nBut as a practical matter, when reviewing the statistics, it is hard to \ndefend that position. In the 1960s, there were 26 pupils per teacher. \nToday there are 17 students per pupil in this country, on average. The \nPresident has said he wants to have 18 students to one teacher. That is \nthe ratio he wants to reach. As a practical matter, 42 States in this \ncountry already have ratios which equal either 18 to 1 or better for \nthe ratio of students to teachers. We know we have a problem, and it is \nvery significant.\n  Some States have taken this issue on and made significant success. I \npoint to Texas as an example. They have reduced their achievement gap \nby almost a third between the low-income kids and the high-income kids, \nand they have not done it by reducing the level of the achievement of \nthe higher or the moderate-income child, the non low-income child. They \nhave done it by raising achievement levels of the low-income child.\n  One might ask: How have they done it? Texas--and there are lots of \nother States initiating these programs, including Michigan, Arizona--\nhas done it by being creative, taking a different approach with their \nkids by demanding achievement in most instances.\n  When we looked at this bill as it came to the committee for \nreauthorization, we looked at the statistics and said one thing we know \nis what we are doing is not working. There are a lot on the other side \nwho are willing to defend the status quo. I am not. These numbers are \nstaggering. We have had generation after generation of low-income \nchildren who have been given the raw deal in the way the Federal \nGovernment has addressed the issue of educating or trying to help \neducate them by assisting the local communities. Their achievement \nlevels have not increased. They cannot do math, they cannot read, even \nthough we have poured these huge amounts of dollars into trying to help \nthem out. So we knew it was not working, the status quo. We knew those \n79 programs that had come, originally, from 5 simply had not resolved \nthe problem.\n\n  I guess they made a lot of people feel good because there is hardly a \nMember, especially on the other side of the aisle, who has served here \nfor any length of time who does not have one of these targeted programs \nthat is called something--something to help somebody somewhere that has \nhis or her name on it so they can put out their press releases and go \nback to their States and say: I put out the ``da-da-da'' program which \nhelps ``da-da-da.''\n  But the problem is, that has not improved the education of the \nchildren at all, especially the low-income children. So we, on our side \nof the aisle, said let's try to think of a better way to do this. We \ncame up with a basic thematic approach. We said that, first, the \nprograms we put forward should be child centered. That might seem \nobvious and everybody might say, of course, they should be child \ncentered; it is education. Unfortunately, title I, the way it was \noriginally designed and the way it functioned up until 1994, was not a \nchild-centered program.\n  Title I was a school-centered program, an administrator-centered \nprogram. Basically, the money went to the\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\nschools. If you happened to be a low-income child, you may or may not \nhave ever seen that money. If you happened to be a low-income child in \na school system which had less than 35 percent of its kids being low-\nincome kids, you were absolutely not going to see any of that money \nbecause none of that money could go to your school. So a lot of low-\nincome children were simply written out of the system, and the money \ndid not go to the children; it went to the schools. So we said let's \nhave a child-centered approach where we are really looking at the \nchildren.\n  Second, we said title I has not accomplished its purpose, it has not \nimproved the education of low-income kids, so let's put the emphasis on \nachievement; We especially want to see low-income children have their \nmath and reading skills increased; We do not want to see them put into \nsome aggregation where there is a claim of increase because they are \npart of an average; We want a disaggregated approach, so different \ngroups within the low-income community are looked at independently.\n  Then we want those groups of kids to improve relative to everyone \nelse. We don't want everyone else to be brought down; We want to see \nbetter math skills, better science skills, better reading skills for \nthe low-income children so when they leave school, they can read and \nthey can write and they can do math. So we decided we were going to \nhave an achievement-oriented proposal.\n  First, it was child centered; second, it was achievement oriented.\n  Third, we came to the conclusion that maybe we do not know best here \nin Washington; maybe the local school districts do know what they are \ndoing. I meet very few parents, teachers, and principals who really \ndon't want good education. Almost everyone I ever meet who is a parent \nof a student or teacher or principal or superintendent really does want \ngood education. That is why they have committed their lives to this \nexercise. So we said let's give the flexibility to local school \ndistricts so they can make the decision as to how to allocate the funds \nwithin their school districts and within their schools the way it will \nget the best results.\n\n  In order to give that flexibility we also said, fourth, that we want \naccountability. We want the local school districts in the States to \nshow us the kids are achieving at a higher level. They have to be \naccountable.\n  So it has four steps: Child-centered, achievement, flexibility, and \naccountability. That is the theme on which we built this bill, or the \nideas we put into this bill.\n  There was another approach which we took, which is a tactical \napproach. We said we do not know all the answers, unlike some on the \nother side who appear to think they do know all the answers. We said we \ndon't know all the answers, we don't know what the States need and what \nthey want, so we are going to give the States an optional approach. We \nare not going to say you have to do this in order to get the money, or \nyou have to do that in order to qualify for the program. We are going \nto set out a series of options.\n  The way I describe it is it is similar to a cafeteria line. A State \ncan go down that cafeteria line, or a local school district can go down \nthat cafeteria line, and they can pick out the program which they think \nbest suits their ability to produce the results for the low-income \nchild, to enable that child to have a better school experience and to \nlearn more.\n  We do not say you have to take any specific program. We do not say in \norder to get a new teacher you have to take class-size dollars, and if \nyou take class-size dollars, you can't do anything but get new \nteachers. We don't say that. We say you, the State, can go down this \ncafeteria line, and if you like this program--and I will talk about \nthem in a second--if you like Straight A's or you like portability or \nyou like public school choice, you can just take that program and try \nit out in the context of an accountability system where you have to \nprove that you achieve the results of improving the quality of \neducation for the low-income child.\n  But if you don't want any of those programs, if your educational \ncommunity is so strong in your State and you believe you are doing such \na good job that you want to stick with title I as it is presently \nstructured out of all the different rules and regulations and all the \ncategorical programs, you can do that, too. You can go right down \nthrough that cafeteria line, don't pick up anything, and get the same \namount of money. If you take any one of these programs, you get the \nsame amount of money. We are not going to affect anybody's ability to \nget the dollars the Federal Government is sending to them. They are all \ngoing to get the same amount of dollars, but we are going to give some \nStates and communities an opportunity to have options.\n  It has outraged the other side of the aisle for some reason, the idea \nwe would give options. Maybe it is because we are not demanding people \ndo this. The approach we often hear, regretfully, from the Washington \neducational establishment is you must tell people what to do. We are \nnot going to do that. We are going to say you have options and when you \nchoose an option, then we are going to say you have to produce the \nresults, yes, but you will have flexibility within that option to \nproduce those results.\n  Let me talk briefly, because there is going to be a lot of debate \nabout these items, about the four major options in this bill. There are \nalso a lot of other good initiatives in this bill. The Senator from \nMaine put in a superb initiative in rural education that is going to \nhelp rural school districts be able to manage their Federal dollars \nmore, but that is not controversial because it is such a good idea. Let \nme talk about the four items that basically set these themes in place.\n\n  The first, of course, is Straight A's. There are two different types \nof Straight A programs in this bill. One is the Governors' proposal; \nthe other is pure Straight A's and includes title I. Essentially, what \nit says is we are going to take a bunch of programs, 14, 15 programs, \nand instead of having the money go to the States in a categorical way, \nthe States will get the dollars from those programs in a group, and \nthen they will have very significant obligations to meet accountability \nstandards for having improved the achievement of low-income students as \na result of getting those dollars--something which does not now exist. \nWe will give them flexibility, but we will expect results. And low-\nincome kids will learn.\n  This is a State's choice, by the way. The State does not have to take \nStraight A's. If the State doesn't think this will work for it, it does \nnot have to take this track. If a State wants to take this approach, it \ncan. But after taking this approach, it has to prove, after a \nreasonable amount of time, the kids are actually improving in their \neducational levels.\n  The second approach is called portability. Here we have tried to \nengage the parents in the process of becoming involved in the education \nof the low-income child. I think if there is one thing we all \nrecognize, it is that parent involvement is absolutely critical to good \neducation. This is an attempt to get the parents into the process. This \nproposal, essentially, says that instead of sending the money to the \nschools--as I mentioned earlier, if the school does not have 35 percent \nlow-income kids, they don't get any money--instead of sending the money \nto the schools, we give the money to the schools, but we give it to \nthem in relationship to the children who are in the schools so the \nmoney follows the child. It does not flow to the schools. Then the \nparent has the right to go to that school system and say: I am not \nhappy with what my child is learning in this school. I would like you \nto put my child into an afterschool program or a tutorial program--not \na private school; the child still has to go to the public school--but I \nwould like you to put him or her into some sort of private tutorial \nassistance, or it could be public tutorial assistance, that may cost \nmore money.\n  That is allowed today under present law, under title I, but it is not \nat the direction of the parents. The school systems make these \ndecisions. So the parent has the right now to say: Take my title I \nmoney and allow my child to get some assisted learning at a Sylvan \nLearning Center or some sort of other outside assistance program. That \nis portability. The money goes with the child and the parents, although \nthey never get the dollars, they do not physically have the dollars. \nThis is not anything like a voucher, even though it is\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\noccasionally, by people who are really demagogic, being classified as \nsuch, but nobody with any integrity would ever call this a voucher \nbecause it is not--the dollars go to the school, and the school has \ncontrol over the dollars. But the parent has the ability, if the parent \ndecides to do so, to direct that these dollars be used to assist the \nchild in additional educational support, something the school can now \ndo but may not want to do, for whatever reason.\n\n  That is portability. Again, the most common attack we get on this--\nand it is legitimate--is: What happens? Under the present system, money \ncomes together in the school system and the school gets to use it to \nbenefit all the kids. It is not going to take control away from the \nschool and their ability to benefit all the kids with these title I \ndollars.\n  Yes, it is; it is going to benefit the low-income kids. That is \nexactly what it is going to do. Remember, for this program to go \nforward, the school district and the State have to have made the \ndecision this is what they want to do. So if the State and the school \nsystem come to the conclusion the best way to educate their kids is to \nuse portability as an option, then they can apply for it, but if the \nlocal school district, the teachers, the principals, and the \nadministrators decide this is not going to work, they do not have to \napply for it; it is an option.\n  There are some States in this country that, obviously, are going to \napply for it because they already use portability. Arizona uses \nportability for its State funds, and the city of Seattle uses \nportability for its State funds. It is not a new idea. I am sure it \nwill be pursued by those places. It will be on the table and available \nto them if they want it.\n  Another area is public school choice. As I mentioned, in this country \ntoday, 7,000 schools have failed or are failing. What we essentially \nsay is: If your child is in a failing public school--which can do a \nfair amount of damage to a child, to be in that school for 2 years--but \nif that school continues to fail for 2 years--and remember, failure is \ndefined by the States, not by us--then the parent has the right to move \nthat child out of that public school. If that public school fails for 4 \nyears, then the parents have a right to move that child out of the \npublic school and the public school system must assist them in the \ntransportation costs of moving their child out of that public school, \nas long as it is a reasonable number. There is a contingency on how \nmuch can be spent.\n  Parents cannot move their children to a private school and get any \nsupport. This is a public-school-to-public-school choice. In other \nwords, if a parent wants to move their child out of one failing public \nschool, under this bill, they can move to another public school that \nthey, as a parent, believe is doing better. Again, this is a process of \ngetting parents involved. Equally, it is a process of putting pressure \non the 7,000 failing schools.\n  Another area is teacher empowerment. This has already been attacked \nat some length from the other side of the aisle. I heard a commentary \non this. There is a philosophical difference which reflects precisely \nfrom where the two different parties are coming. The President, the \nVice President, and his supporters, have said: If you want to get more \nmoney from the Federal Government, you must use this money to add new \nteachers to classrooms; you must do it.\n  I do not know how Al Gore or President Clinton know that the town of \nMilan, NH, needs more teachers, but for some reason they think they do. \nI do not know how they know that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. On that point, I have been waiting for an opportunity \nto ask that the Senator clarify this. I thought he said the teacher \nratio in 1960, going back 35 years, was 1----\n  Mr. GREGG. To 26; 1 teacher to 26 students in 1960.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In 42 States, it is 1 to 18 or better.\n  Mr. GREGG. Nationally, the average is 1 to 17.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Which is the timetable during which this data has \ngotten progressively worse.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely correct. On a side point to \nwhich the Senator is making an excellent allusion, it is very hard to \ntie student-teacher ratio to improved student performance. Study after \nstudy has been done on this, and, as a matter of fact, the University \nof Rochester did a study of the studies done. There have been over 300 \nstudies done on student-teacher ratio and whether or not that is a \ndeterminative event in the education of a child, whether the education \nof a child improves.\n  At the 17-to-1 level, it really is not. The University of Rochester \ndetermined the most determinative event was the quality of the teacher; \nsurprisingly enough, it was not the ratio of the students to the \nteacher. If there is a teacher of poor quality teaching 17 kids versus \n26 kids, the only advantage is 9 kids are not getting a lousy \neducation. This study found it was the quality of the teacher that was \nthe determinative event, which brings us to our point.\n  Under our proposal, we say to the local school districts: OK, if you \nneed more teachers, if you want to reduce your classroom percentages, \nyou can do that; you can use the money for that; but if you want to use \nit to improve your teachers' ability to teach, you can use it for that, \ntoo. Or if you have really good teachers and the marketplace is trying \nto attract them away from the school system--math and science teachers \nare in great demand in the private sector these days, as are a lot of \nteachers--then you can pay them a bonus to stay in the school system.\n  We took the teacher size categorical straitjacket the President and \nVice President Gore proposed, and we put that together with the \nEisenhower teacher training program and created the Teacher Empowerment \nAct, which essentially says to local school districts: You have the \nflexibility to use this to improve your teachers in any of three \ndifferent ways: Add more teachers if you want; give your teachers \nbetter educational skills; or pay teachers a little bonus or incentive \nto stay in the school and teach if they happen to be people you want to \nkeep on board. That is a difference of approach and a philosophical \ndifference.\n  Those are four items that reflect the difference in our themes, and \nour themes, to reiterate, are these: We think, after 35 years, it is \ntime we focus on the low-income kids and it is time we expect the \nschools in this country to deliver those low-income kids an education \nthat is going to give them a shot at the American dream. Unfortunately, \nwe have not done that as a society. The record is abysmal, and I have \ncited countless statistics to support that. What we expect is a program \nthat is child centered, that is achievement oriented, that is flexible \nand has accountability.\n  I again congratulate the chairman of the committee and members of the \ncommittee who worked so hard on this. I look forward to the \ncontinuation of this debate over the next couple of weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, we have before us this afternoon one of the most, if \nnot the most important pieces of legislation we will consider this \nCongress, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. I thank those who have been involved in this process over the last \nnumber of months.\n  I regret at this late hour we are considering something as \nfundamentally important as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nIt is late in the spring. We have been allocated a few days on this. I \nguess we will have 3 or 4 days this week and maybe a couple days next \nweek and then move on to other business.\n  I appreciate the fact we have some days here. Normally, with this \nissue, given its importance in the national agenda, we would spend a \nlittle more time on it. This is a 5-year program. We will not touch \nthis again for 5 years. Unlike other matters which come up every year, \nthis is a bill with which we deal once every 5 years.\n  I see my colleague present.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I do not \nbelieve there is any predisposition as to\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\nthe length of the debate decided between the two conferences. What the \nSenator outlines might well be the case, but it is certainly not \npredisposed.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for telling me that. I hope that will \nbe the result.\n  My point is, here we are on the first of May and our legislative year \nis winding down. Not that we have done much these last two years; with \nthe exception of one or two things, the highlight of this Congress so \nfar might have to be the renaming of the airport. And now after \nfrittering away weeks on nominations and cloture votes on bills going \nnowhere, we are bringing up ESEA.\n  Perhaps this will change with this bill--if there is any bill that \ndeserves our full and careful consideration, it is this one. Clearly, \nwe should be able to afford more than a few days for the most important \nbill, the most important issue to the American public. We spent weeks \non renaming the airport; our children deserve at least this much.\n  Madam President, how does this make sense? It is certainly not the \nway we have done education in the past. We have always had debates, but \nwe have always been bipartisan. The 1994 ESEA passed with over two-\nthirds of our votes. Historically, education bills have come out of the \ncommittee as overwhelming bipartisan. At least in my 20 years on the \ncommittee--this may sound strange in this day and age, but we actually \nhad elementary and secondary education legislation come out of the \ncommittee with unanimous support. It came to the floor of the Senate \nand was adopted almost unanimously. Elementary and Secondary Education \nlegislation is not and cannot be about scoring points for the \nelection--it is about scoring points for our future, our children. We \nmust work together.\n  And there is much work to be done on this bill. But I do not think it \nis too late, Madam President, to come together around a good bill, a \nstrong bill for America's children and schools. Let's take the time. \nAnd frankly, I believe hidden below a layer of crass partisan policies \nin the bill before us today, there are significant bipartisan \ninitiatives already in this bill we can build on.\n  Senator DeWine and I worked together over months to re-craft the Safe \nand Drug Free Schools and Communities program to make it more \naccountable and to focus the program clearly on programs of proven \nsuccess and that is included here in this bill. I have also worked with \nthe chairman of our Committee on some important but smaller initiatives \nin this bill--the Magnet Schools program, the Character Education \nPartnership initiative which I authored with Senator Domenici, the \nCivics program which I authored with Senator Cochran, the National \nCenter for Gifted and Talented Education and initiatives to improve \nTitle I's preschool services.\n  Unfortunately, these efforts did not carry the day. Instead \nbipartisanship was abandoned and we ended up with this product before \nus today. But, hopefully, before this process is over maybe we can come \nto some agreement on these issues.\n\n  As we start this effort, we should review some of the basic facts. \nThere are some 53 million children every day who go to school in \nelementary or secondary schools in this country. Roughly 49 or 50 \nmillion go to school in public schools, and about 5 million go to \nschool in private or parochial schools. So our primary responsibility, \nas a public institution, obviously, is to deal with public educational \ninstitutions, where almost 50 million of America's children go to get \nan education every day.\n  At the Federal level, we are responsible for about 7 cents on the \ndollar in education; 93 cents on the dollar for the education of our \nchildren at elementary and secondary schools is paid for by the States \nand local governments.\n  So when we highlight all the problems that exist in our educational \nsystem we should keep this seven percent in mind. There is no question \nwe should certainly look at what we may do to contribute to any of \nthese shortcomings. But frankly, it is less a function of what we do \nhere, and certainly far more of a function of what happens in our \nrespective States and communities.\n  That is a sad commentary. I do not like to make it. I wish it were \nnot the case. But the idea somehow that the 7 cents from the Federal \nGovernment is the sole reason--sole reason--why 7,000 schools or 5,000 \nschools, out of the thousands, are failing out there, I think, is an \nunfair allocation of the blame.\n  We need to look at how we spend the $15 billion dollars of federal \nmoney we invest in schools. About $8 billion of that--half of it--is \nall in one program, Title I, which we distribute right back to the \nStates and local communities through a targeted formula.\n  What we have tried to do, over the years, is to target this $15 \nbillion of resources so it just does not become revenue sharing. I know \nthere are those who would support that. I know there are those who \nwould get rid of the Department of Education entirely and merely have \nWashington become a turnstile: Send your money here; send the money \nright back. You decide what you want exactly.\n  Some might say: I do not know why we bother with a turnstile. Some \nmay advocate just offering an amendment to eliminate the Department of \nEducation, eliminating the Federal Government's role all together and \nleaving the money at the State. That is a point of view. I disagree \nwith it.\n  Our role is fashioning instead a national purpose, responding to \nnational needs and leveraging federal dollars. I believe most Americans \nbelieve this is our role, too. They know education is a national \ninterest and that we have national needs and concerns.\n  Improving the quality of education for our poorest children, that is \na national need. I do not only concern myself with the well-being of a \nchild in Bridgeport or Hartford or New Haven. Obviously, I worry about \nthat as a Senator from my State. But I also recognize that my country \nsuffers if, in fact, a child in Tennessee or Vermont or Georgia or \nRhode Island or Texas, is failing in those States, then I think my \nconstituency also suffers.\n  I hope that is not a radical thought, the idea that as a national \nlegislature we are trying to determine what we can do to improve the \nquality of education of children across the Nation, not just in our own \ncommunities. That is a job of our local towns and our States. But as \nnational legislators, with the importance the American public has \nplaced on education, do we just make this a revenue-sharing program, or \ndo we try to speak as closely as possible with one voice about such \nthings as class size, the condition of the buildings in which America's \nchildren learn, whether or not they are getting the proper support they \nneed in immigrant education, or in various other aspects of improving \nthe quality of children's performance levels?\n  I do not think it is so radical a notion that we, as a national \nlegislature, say that across the country these are things on which we \nwould like to see improvement.\n  And with all due respect, Madam President, I believe we owe our \nchildren and our future something much better than the bill before us. \nWhat we have here is another missed opportunity to respond to the calls \nof children, parents, grandparents, teachers, mayors and community \nleaders for real support to accelerate the pace and progress of change \nin our schools.\n  There is no question, in its current form, the bill before us leads \nto gridlock and, at best at the end of the day, more status quo in our \nnation's schools. And the last thing our nation's schools need is more \nstatus quo.\n  The process of school reform began here six years ago in the last \nESEA reauthorization. In 1994, we left behind forever policies based on \nlow expectations for our children and on checking the boxes and \nmeasuring the inputs and revolutioned our policies to focus on high \nstandards for all children, aggressive state-based school reform, \naccountability for results and responsibility for failure. And we have \nseen results.\n  I listened very intently to my colleague from New Hampshire talk \nabout what has happened across the country in education.\n  If you are looking at 35 years, which he was, you get one set of \nnumbers. If you are looking at the last 6 years, there is a different \nset of numbers.\n  Let me show you a chart of math scores on the National Assessment of\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\nEducation Progress. These numbers challenge the notion that what we \npresently have in place is not working.\n  If you take what these numbers represent on the chart, the bottom \nnumbers show the poverty levels in schools. So the first column shows \nthe most affluent schools in the country down to the poorest schools in \nthe country. In every single income category, there has been \nimprovement.\n  One of the largest levels of improvement are in schools where the \nlevel of poverty is 51 to 75 percent. That is where the most dramatic \nincrease has occurred. Even in the poorest schools there has been \nalmost--not quite a doubling--but almost a doubling of improvement in \nmath scores in the last 4 or 5 years or 6 years.\n  Let me quickly add, these scores are still not good. There has been \nimprovement toward higher achievement--but we still have a long way to \ngo before we rest on any laurels. But there has been improvement \nbecause of what we did in 1994 when we passed the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. And not just math scores are up. We have seen \nincreases in reading achievement, particularly in the highest poverty \nschools, fewer dropouts, and more college attendance.\n  But there has not been enough progress. Too many of our schools are \nstill failing--failing their students, their communities and us. I \nbelieve we must push for reform. Reform must be faster, better and \ntargeted at those children most in need. The status quo is not an \noption for failing schools nor for federal education policy.\n  The question before us today must be how to accelerate reforms to \nincrease student achievement further, to reduce the achievement gap, to \nbuild on the lessons we have learned and to focus our resources on \nprograms that work. And what works?\n  As is often the case, it is the simple, meaningful things that make a \ndifference: Smaller class sizes; investments in recruiting, training, \nand supporting teachers; modern, safe school facilities; after school \nopportunities that provide students with enriched opportunities for \nlearning as well as safe, supervised care while their parents work; \nand, real accountability in federal programs.\n  These are simple straightforward proposals to accelerate the pace of \nreform in our schools. These are reforms that parents do not see as \nDemocratic or Republican--they simply see them as gaping needs in their \nchildren's schools.\n\n  But instead of coming together around real change and reform, this \nbill does nothing to move schools forward. In place of increased \naccountability and resources, this bill proposes blocking granting \nprograms currently focused on areas of national need and concern and \ntransforming targeted programs into vouchers for private schools. Block \ngrants, one of the central policy ``initiatives'' of this bill, are no \nprescription for change. Block grants offer no national purpose, no \naccountability, they lessen funding and decrease targeting. They simply \nsupport the status quo, more of the same.\n  When you just have a block grant--and I know there is an appeal to \nblock grants--you cannot, on the one hand, be for block granting \neverything and then simultaneously demand greater accountability. If I \njust give you a check and do not say, by the way, if I am going to \nwrite this check for you, here are the areas in which I want results, \nthen how do I get any kind of accountability at the end of the day?\n  I see my time is expiring, so I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. If I just turn over a blank check to you, in effect, and at \nthe end of the day say, I now want you to be accountable for it--and I \nhave not demanded any kind of requirement where these dollars are \ntargeted--then you get almost zero accountability. That was the \nexperience we had for years. So we changed that--we focused on high \nstandards for all children and accountability for results. We targeted \nresources and demanded a return on these investments.\n\n  What the present bill on the floor does is erase the bill of 1994, in \neffect, and goes back to the past when we didn't have the \naccountability and when achievement was sliding down rather than \ntracking up. We know block grants don't work; we have tried them \nbefore. They simply support the status quo. If that is good enough for \nyou, then maybe this bill is. But in my view, this is not just good \nenough.\n  This bill also walks away from our public schools in supporting \nvoucher programs that would funnel much needed public resources to pay \nfor private schools. Madame President, public schools educate over 90 \npercent of the children in America. They are the foundations of our \ncommunities, our economy and our democracy. We must not, cannot, walk \naway from them like this bill does.\n  These policies are a recipe for failure for our schools--dollars \nfunneled away and frittered away on the status quo, less \naccountability, less targeting to real need, less funding and more of \nthe status quo. These policies are tired, timid and dangerous for our \nschools. Block grants and vouchers are proven failures--why should we \nwaste our time, our schools' time, our children's time and our \nresources on them?\n  We will try to change that over the next 4 or 5 days in this debate. \nI believe there is still hope for this bill. America's children and \nparents are counting on it--and I look forward to rolling up our \nsleeves and getting to work. We owe them and our own futures no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I believe, pursuant to unanimous consent, \nI am to be recognized now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  This is a very important debate about the course of educational \npolicy in the United States. It is important in many dimensions.\n  Typically, when we bring a bill to the floor on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, much of our discussion is about the mechanics \nof the legislation. But this debate opens up broad philosophical topics \nwhich we are confronting in the bill that is before us and the \nalternative which Democratic Senators will offer.\n  There are basically two philosophies at play. The philosophy I bring, \nand that I share with many of my colleagues on the Democratic side, is \nthat there is a very specific role for the Federal Government in \neducation policy. First, we recognize the primacy of State and local \nauthorities in the U.S. Historically, culturally, indeed, \nconstitutionally, State and local authorities govern educational \npolicy. There is a role, though, for the Federal Government. It is a \nrole we have played robustly since 1965; that is, to encourage \ninnovation at the local level while at the same time trying to overcome \nlocal inertia so that together with this innovation, which comes from \nbelow, and with support so we can overcome obstacles at the local and \nState level, we can improve the education of our children and their \nacademic performance.\n  All of this leads to an approach which suggests that our role is \nlimited and targeted, particularly with respect to low-income students, \nwho historically have been denied the kinds of opportunities many other \nAmerican children take for granted. Also, we have a role to reflect \nnational priorities in educational policy, priorities that transcend \nlocal feelings, regional approaches, and truly create a national \npolitical and policy environment for education improvement. That policy \nhas been established in Federal law since 1965.\n  Today, we are confronting another philosophy. That philosophy, \nstripped down to its core, is essentially revenue sharing. My colleague \nfrom Connecticut suggested as much in his remarks immediately preceding \nmine. That approach is to say simply that we have some money and let's \nturn it over to the States. Underlying that approach is the presumption \nthat, of course, the States know what is best. But one of the ironies, \nagain alluded to by my colleague from Connecticut, is that if you are \njustifying this change in philosophy and change of legislation by the \nfact that American education policy is failing, what sense does it make \nto give vast resources without conditions to those individuals and \ninstitutions which control this failing educational policy? The \ninstitutions\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nthat control educational policy are the States and localities. We \ncontribute, from the Federal level, about 7 percent of resources. It is \nvery limited and very targeted. Ninety-three percent of the resources \nare governed by State and local law.\n  So if American education is failing, who is responsible for this \nfailure? And if the States and localities are responsible, why are we \nabout to embark on a legislative policy which would simply turn over \nthe money to them without any real check on how it is spent?\n  It is States and localities that determine how they raise funds. \nThrough history, they have been wedded to the property tax. In fact, \nthe property tax might be the most decisive reason why some school \nsystems succeed and some fail miserably. But that is a local \ninitiative, local policy, and local law. We wouldn't presume to change \nthat. Yet that has a decisive effect on American educational policy.\n  Who certifies teachers? It is the States, not the Federal Government. \nIf you are concerned about the quality of teachers in the classroom, \ndon't come here and blame us for requiring poor teachers to be in a \nclassroom. Don't come here and blame us for requiring shoddy school \nbuildings. There is no Federal law that requires that. It is a \ncombination of State policy and revenue measures that provide \ninadequate resources for many school districts.\n\n  All of these things are under the gambit of State and local control. \nWhat we have tried to do for more than three decades now is to find \npoints of leverage in the system where Federal resources and Federal \npolicies can make a difference to help spur innovation and to help \novercome the inertia we all see at the local level.\n  This philosophical debate will rage for the next several days on this \nfloor. It is an important debate. Again, I believe the policy we have \ndeveloped over several decades makes sense, given the realities of \neducational policy in the United States. It recognizes the key role of \nStates, but it is not an exclusive role. It recognizes that the Federal \nGovernment, in limited, targeted ways, can help improve educational \nquality in the United States.\n  One of the key issues--indeed, it might be the fulcrum upon which \nthis whole debate turns--is accountability. All of those who propose \nthat we turn over resources will argue: But we are requiring more \naccountability. I think this argument in some respects misperceives the \naccountability that has already been built into Federal education \nlegislation and assumes the States and localities will act in all cases \nwisely and well, when in fact history suggests that under the pressure \nof local budgets, under the demands of local political forces, they can \nbe as irrational sometimes as any policy dictate from Washington.\n  Over the last several decades, we have endeavored to improve the \naccountability of States and localities through principally the title I \nprogram, accountability based on student performance. Back in 1988, \namendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for the first \ntime got away from the simple accountability for finance which ruled \ntitle I programs before and started looking at consequences for student \nperformance, tried to begin to develop the notion of standards-based \neducation and of holding States accountable for their title I students \nand the use of Federal dollars.\n  In 1988, for the first time, we started talking seriously about \nstudent outcomes and requiring evaluation of outcomes and improvement \nin student achievement in the context of the title I program. The first \nattempts back then were quite modest. The States were left to set the \nstandards, and the standards were often set too low. There was no real \nenforcement of failure to conform to these standards.\n  Also, in 1988, and years subsequent to that, title I funds went to \nschools determined on the basis of low student achievement, not based \non student poverty levels. As a result, there was this perverse \nincentive essentially to give more money to schools that were failing \nrather than to look at another dimension to measure how we could \nallocate funds. The amendments in 1988 set the stage for action that \ntook place in 1994. That was the Goals 2000 legislation with which, as \na Member of the other body, I was deeply involved. And here we began to \nbuild on a bipartisan effort, which was begun by President Bush in the \ncontext of his educational summit, to develop goals for education in \nthe United States as we approached the new century. The Goals 2000 \nlegislation tried to build on those goals.\n\n  One of the key elements was to try to, once again, enhance the \naccountability for the Federal dollars going to the States and the \noverall performance of the States. Part of the sensitivity to \naccountability and to what was going on in the States was a result of \nbooks such as Jonathan Kozol's book, ``Savage Inequalities,'' which \npainted a very bleak picture of programs, particularly urban education \nprograms, and the distinct disadvantage that low-income students, \ndespite title I funding and State efforts, were still suffering in the \n1980s.\n  Also, at that time, there was a range of court cases. The most \nnotable was in Kentucky, where the whole school finance system was \nchallenged as being inequitable and inefficient. In fact, Kentucky's \nsupreme court declared the financing in Kentucky schools to be not \nsupportable and unequal and something that had to be changed. As a \nresult, Kentucky took the lead in developing an equalized financing \nprogram and comprehensive reform, and other States acted at the same \ntime, such as Massachusetts, Arkansas, and Tennessee. So this effort \nwas ongoing throughout the country.\n  In the context of Goals 2000, there was an attempt to develop \nperformance standards and the opportunity to learn standards, where for \nthe first time we were talking about the resources necessary for \nschools and, most important, for children, to succeed. This was based \nupon the commonsense notion that a child who has a teacher who is \nunqualified and teaching out of their subject area, a child in a \nprogram where there is inadequate facilities, a child that is not able \nto participate fully in activities and advance in classes that are \ncommon, indeed routine, in the suburbs, that child is not going to be \nable to succeed as well as other children. We pushed very hard to \nsimply require the States to answer a fundamental question: After you \nhave identified a school that is failing, based on these outcome \nstandards, what will you do?\n  Frankly, my amendment, which was focused on this effort, caused \nintense opposition because when you come down to the crunch, and try to \nensure schools are performing, there is innate opposition from States \nand localities--they recognize tough actions will be required on their \npart, and there is a natural tendency to resist those types of tough \ndecisions. In fact, not only did my Republican colleagues in the other \nbody object, the White House also objected to the scope of the \naccountability that I envisioned. We moved forward with a concept at \nleast. It was moderated a bit in the final legislation. It required \nthat within the plan for applying for Goals 2000 funding, the States \nwould indicate in a modest way what they proposed to do with respect to \nschools that were failing and systems that were failing.\n  Despite all of this discussion about accountability, Goals 2000 does \nrepresent progress on voluntary standards and also an enhanced \nsensitivity to the notion of making sure that programs work and are \naccountable. Since its passage in 1994, over $2 billion has been \ndispensed. Every State has participated, in a way. It has been useful \nin helping to stimulate reform, to raise standards, and to try to \ndevelop evaluations and assessments so we can know where we are in \neducation policy and improve education throughout the United States. \nThat is an example, in many respects, of how we can use Federal \nlegislation to help move forward the education agenda. I think it is a \nvery powerful example.\n  Contemporaneously with Goals 2000, in 1994, we reauthorized the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, which we are beginning to \ndiscuss again this week in the Senate. In 1994, we focused on ways in \nwhich we could enhance the effectiveness of title I. We made progress \nin streamlining the approach to title I, eliminating what we thought \nwere unnecessary regulatory burdens on school systems, but at the same \ntime focusing on high-quality standards and the notion that every child \ncan learn, and that title I is not simply a program to placate \nstudents, teachers, and parents; it is a program to give them a real \nchance to succeed--\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nand the development of assessments that would measure the progress of \nstudents.\n\n  We tried to target the resources more closely to low-income schools \nand school systems because one of the criticisms of title I is that \neveryone seemed to get a little piece. When the authorization came to \nthe floor, it was everybody trying to fight to make sure their system--\nbe it a poor or a suburban, middle income school system, or even a \nrich, exclusive school system--got their little piece of the action.\n  We did target, much more appropriately, the title I program. Also, \nagain, we thought about corrective action, how to move this system \nforward, how to identify schools that are failing, and how to make \nthose schools appropriately competent to teach children.\n  I offered an amendment to allow States to take corrective action \nagainst any district identified as needing improvement and require such \naction during the fourth year following the identification. My \namendment also gave a list of remedies the States could use. This \namendment was incorporated in the final version of the act. In fact, it \nis this legislation that, for the first time, has allowed us to \nidentify schools that are not succeeding based on State standards. Back \nin 1996 and 1997, it was estimated that there are 1,500 LEAs and about \n7,000 schools that are not succeeding based upon their State standards. \nThe States have the authority--and, in fact, under title I, they have \nthe obligation--to take corrective action.\n  I believe all of this is an appropriate introduction to suggest that \nwe are, in fact, dealing with many of the issues that are prompting the \ndebate we have today--this notion that we are not paying attention to \naccountability, this notion that schools in America are failing. In \nfact, I suggest that because of the steps we took, starting with Goals \n2000 and the last authorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, we are beginning to see progress. As Senator Dodd \nindicated in his remarks, if you look at the statistics, we are seeing \nincreased performance in student mathematics achievements, as measured \nby the National Assessment of Educational Progress, showing that all \nthree age groups--4th grade, 8th grade, and 12th grade--have shown \nprogress.\n  Indeed, black and Hispanic students have made significant gains, and \nsince 1982, racial and ethnic difference in achievement have narrowed. \nScience achievement has also improved. We are also seeing increased \nnumbers of students taking high-level courses, such as algebra II, \ntrigonometry, chemistry, and physics. That is good because this level \nof effort is so important to our educational progress. The selection of \ntougher, more demanding courses, once again, cross racial lines, so \nthat we are seeing all of our students take more challenging courses. \nSo in one sense, what we are doing is working.\n  But in addition to this progress, last year we went further and \nadopted the Education Flexibility Partnership Act because we were \nlistening to the complaints and comments of those who said: Listen, we \nhave to unburden even further these Federal education programs.\n  Ed-Flex, however, has not exactly been overwhelmingly embraced in the \ncountry. There was an article in the Washington Post a few weeks ago \nand, by coincidence, the commissioner of education of Rhode Island, \nPeter McWalters, stated, ``I can get the flexibility I want under the \ncurrent opportunities.'' That was his reason why he was not interested \nparticularly in the Ed-Flex approach. It exists nevertheless. So those \nwho claim the reason we must essentially create block grants for the \nStates is because they don't have flexibility are ignoring the fact \nthat we did, indeed, pass the Ed-Flex legislation.\n  Also, as indicated by the Center on Education Policy and the \nInstitute for Educational Leadership, most State and district school \nadministrators fail to understand the inherent flexibility that already \nexists under Federal law. They see it as barriers to change when, in \nfact, there are no real barriers. For example, the Department of \nEducation reported that of the 617 waiver requests processed by the \nfall of 1998, over one-third weren't necessary because the local \nschools already had the authority under Federal law.\n  One of the other factors in this issue of flexibility and \nappropriateness of Federal legislation policy is the irony that many \nStates' rules are more restrictive than the Federal Government's rules. \nOne-third of the States do not allow districts to consolidate \nadministrative funds, even though Federal law allows them to do so. \nFederal law allows students to operate title I school programs to \ncombine funds for many Federal education programs. However, some States \nrequire schools to account for all programs separately.\n  A lot of the purported burden of Federal rules is really a \nconsequence of State rules, which in some cases are not as flexible.\n  All of this suggests very strongly, at least in my mind, that we have \nembarked on policies which are beginning to show some promise and which \nhave already instilled significant accountability devices within the \nlaw that are targeted to national purposes and compensate for policies \nand programs at the State level which historically did not reach low-\nincome children particularly and others who are typically without a \nvoice in many local communities.\n  But having said that, we approach this reauthorization with a common \ncommitment and a common understanding that we have to do much more. If \nyou look within the United States, we have made some progress. But if \nyou look around the world, we are still not at the level we need to be. \nIf you look at international assessments, our 12th graders score below \nthe international average in math and science, and achievement gaps \nstill remain between minority and nonminority students. We have closed \nthe absolute difference. But those gaps still exist.\n  In 1998, for example, 32 percent of students in the highest poverty \nschools met or exceeded the National Assessment of Educational Progress \nbasic level in reading. But that is only half the rate nationally of \nstudents in public schools. Dropout rates are much higher than the \nAfrican American and Hispanic community than the overall level. We know \nwe have to do more.\n  We also know that as a result of local policies, 30 percent of all \nmath teachers are teaching outside the field of their academic \npreparation, and that percentages are higher in other academic areas, \nas well as in high-poverty schools.\n  Once again, let me emphasize that this is not a result of Federal \npolicies. That is the result of local hiring practices. That is the \nresult of local certification processes. That is the result of \ndecisions made not in Washington but in State capitals and cities \nthroughout this country. Yet we have a national obligation and \nopportunity to try to assist the States to change the disturbing \nstatistics.\n  We also want to insist again that we have appropriate outcome-based \nstandards for measuring performance of young people and making sure as \nbest we can that the States are meeting these obligations. We should do \nthat.\n  The approach this legislation before us takes is an approach that \nessentially is moving away from all of this and saying simply let's \ncreate block grants, turn them over to the States, and let the States \noperate as they have in the past and as they will do without these \nspecific Federal conditions and guidelines.\n  There are two variations within the legislation. There is the 50-\nState Straight A's. Then there is the 15-State Straight A's pilot \nprogram, if you will, sponsored principally by Senator Gregg of New \nHampshire. But all of these approaches lack the quality and the \nemphasis that I believe is necessary to continue the progress we have \nmade to date and to continue our appropriate robust Federal role in \neducation policy.\n  According to Amy Wilkins, who is with the Education Trust, an \norganization that promotes higher achievement for poor and minority \nstudents, I quote:\n\n       The accountability provisions in Straight A's are \n     meaningless window-dressing. The goals are too low, the time \n     lines are too long, and the sanctions too inconsequential.\n\n  In fact, Straight A's might take us way back before Goals 2000, and \nthe last reauthorization where we, as I suggested in my remarks, took \nvery strong steps with respect to accountability. In fact, some of us \nwould have\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\ntaken even further steps to improve accountability for Federal dollars \ngoing to States to assist States overall in improving their educational \nprocesses.\n  We have seen since 1988 attempts to increase accountability. In fact, \nif you go back before 1988, it might reveal how States would react to \nthis new freedom that perhaps they may receive under this bill, an even \nmore chilling scenario.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, pointed out earlier \nin the day some of the excesses we found when essentially the title I \nprogram was a block grant with very few constraints. Money was being \nused to build pools. Money was being used to buy band uniforms. Money \nwas being used for anything that the ingenuity and imagination of a \ngood school administrator could think of, given perhaps the fact that \nthe local community wouldn't fund it. But here is this Federal pot of \nmoney, and I am ingenious enough to use it anywhere I can.\n  We might be headed in that direction once again, although history has \nmoved on a bit. The pressures at the local level are still there. The \nbudget pressures for school, the pressures to do things, and the \nlimited money to do them are still there in every school system.\n  The Straight A's program and the Straight A's scheme as proposed by \nSenator Gregg would block grant funding to the States. We know in a \ngeneral way that block grants usually end up with a lack of \naccountability and with a diffusion of purposes. We have seen this in \nthe maternal and child health care block grants. That has been \ndocumented by outside observers, such as the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities.\n  My fear is essentially that we will head in the same direction with \neducation funding.\n  First I want to make comments about the 50-State Straight A's.\n  It eliminates the targeting of funds to the truly most needy children \nin our country--migrant children, children of immigrants, and homeless \nstudents. Programs for these children are rolled into the larger block \ngrant.\n  It also would allow the States to proceed with an experiment for 3 \nyears after which the Secretary of Education could terminate an \nagreement if there is a determination that student achievement has \n``significantly declined.'' Once again, what they mean by \n``achievement'' is if the States are deficient. I expect, given history \nas a benchmark, that States are not going to challenge themselves too \nmuch, that their achievement is going to be modest at best, and it is \ngoing to be awfully difficult to determine what ``significantly \ndeclined'' means in fact.\n  If the Secretary makes this determination, he has to wait at least 2 \nmore years before he or she can come in and put leverage on the States \nto improve significantly.\n  In the meantime, you have a 5-year cohort of young people who are \nmoving in a system that might be headed precisely in the wrong way, and \nthere is very little we can do to change direction.\n  The other aspect of the 50-State approach of Straight A's is that the \nState offers to participate in this block grant. The accountability \nprovisions, which as I indicated before are rather insignificant, \nreally apply only at the State level. A State could demonstrate \nimprovement according to their own definition. But they could do so by \nsimply aggregating the statistics statewide.\n  Once again, you have laws that focus on children who have always been \na part of our efforts at the Federal level--low-income children who are \nhistorically disadvantaged. The goal of the States is performance \ngoals. Very limited local, let alone Federal, participation is provided \nfor in creating these goals.\n  In some respect, it might be the fact that the authors and proponents \nrecognize that local communities might be struggling with reform, and \nwe have to put it someplace. They have chosen the State level.\n  But that undercuts the argument we all make on this floor that local \ncontrol is paramount because the way this legislation is structured, \nthe States would be a decisive force in determining the goals and \ndetermining the proper use to achieve those goals.\n  There is language, of course, to close the achievement gaps. But \nthere is no real requirement that these gaps be closed. We could \nconceive of progress being made even though we still have significant \ndisparities between racial and ethnic groups. Parents are not \nincorporated in the process as they should, in my view; that is, in the \nStraight A's, 50-State process. If you move to the 15-State version, \nthat is even more objectionable from the standpoint of targeting, from \nthe standpoint of accountability, and from the standpoint of having an \nappropriate Federal-State collaboration on issues that are important to \nus in terms of educational policy.\n  In fact, targeting of federal funds to schools with the neediest \nstudents would no longer be required. It is also a 5-year program, with \nvery little control in the States for 5 years. States get to do their \nthing for 5 years.\n  After 5 years, there is no real penalty, if the States are not doing \nwell. The only time the Secretary could step in is if there were a lack \nof substantial progress. Once again, the States are defining what \n``progress'' is, and I am sure they will not raise the bar too high. \nThat has been my experience. And I think States keep the bar low \nbecause that helps them assure, as best they can, they will be \nsuccessful.\n  It would also not require that all students in the State be \nincorporated in the assessment. ``All students,'' as defined in the 15-\nState version, simply means all students attending public or charter \nschools that are participating in the State's assessment system. The \nState could say, we are not assessing these children, and in effect \nexclude a number of children from the assessment and, consequently, \nfrom their evaluation of overall performance.\n  Then the money could be used for ``any elementary and secondary \neducational purposes permitted by State law,'' which could be vouchers \nand other programs which would undermine seriously not only Federal \neducation policy but public education in general.\n  There is a different approach to these two block grant proposals, an \napproach that will be involved in the Democratic alternative. The key \nelement of that is the accountability provision Senator Bingaman is \nintroducing and I am cosponsoring. It builds on the record of \naccountability I talked about before. It maintains current targeting \ntoward disadvantaged students and requires a single system of \naccountability so you don't get into the fight between title I students \nand other students. It specifies goals in terms of disaggregated \npopulations, and it requires the States to set specific numerical \ngoals.\n  So we are not talking about substantial progress or significant \nprogress. We are talking about picking a goal, working towards it, and \nhaving a more objective measure of whether or not you are going to make \nthat objective.\n  It also requires the identification of those populations of students \nwho are not part of the State assessment so they cannot game the system \nas under the 15-State Straight A's proposal.\n  It establishes significant consequences if the States fail to \nrespond. It requires States and districts to undertake corrective \naction in those situations where the schools or the school systems are \nnot performing. It informs parents by having report cards for parents, \nso they know what is happening. They know if their school or school \nsystem is under a corrective action.\n  In effect, it does what I think we all want to do. It provides not \nonly the context but the consequences so that States will begin to \nimprove or build on the improvements taking place in education \nthroughout this country. We will begin to see not just progress \ndomestically but in those statistics internationally, which is at the \nheart of so much of what we have talked about over a decade or more.\n  We have a lot to do to ensure our education policy is moving forward. \nI believe very strongly that the approach adopted in the bill before \nthe Senate, the two block grants, will not do that. I think it walks \naway from our commitment, particularly our commitment to low-income \nstudents.\n  We know from statistics that seven times the resources of the Federal \nprograms go to low-income students than State programs. We also know as \nwe turn money over to the States, fully a third of the States are \nembroiled in debates about how they spend the money themselves.\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, the State is being sued by suburban \ncommunities who claim they are disadvantaged, that they don't get \nenough State money, while at the same time, of course, in the urban \ncenters such as Providence and Pawtucket, there are 40 languages in the \nschool system and they have tremendous problems with new Americans \ncoming into the school system. They need more and more resources for \nmore programs to deal with populations that didn't even exist in my \nState 10 years ago. This clash goes on and on.\n\n  It suggests to me that the States have real problems themselves \ndeciding how to allocate resources. Citizens of many States are \ncomplaining bitterly about how it is done. Yet in Straight A's and the \n15-State variation of Straight A's, we propose simply to turn over the \nkeys to the State and say: Do what you will.\n  I don't think that makes for good policy.\n  We also know if you look at block grant funding, it historically \ndeclines. In 1981, we created block grants from some education \nprograms, and a few years later those programs declined significantly \nby 12 percent. That is an example of what happens when we put things in \na block grant. The support for the programs dissipates over time. We \nwill find ourselves, particularly if we encounter a difficult budget \nyear at the Federal level, where this block grants approach does not \nyield the kind of resources upon which States have come to rely.\n  We have a lot to do to ensure our education money is spent well, \nspent wisely. I think we have taken appropriate action over the last \ndecade to ensure accountability--not just for financial resources but \nalso for outcomes, for student progress. We have to continue that. We \ncertainly don't want to go back to the days when school systems, \nparticularly in the late 1960s, were spending this money willy-nilly \nbecause there was no accountability. We have examples replete from \nprograms I mentioned before.\n  In the late 1960s in Claiborne Parish, LA, they were building outdoor \nswimming pools. In Benton County, MS, title I funded a 6-week course in \nhomemaking for 11th- and 12th-grade black girls at the old Salem \nSchool, an all-black school. The homemaking course was conducted in \nprivate homes 3 days a week for 4 hours each day. At the same time, at \nthe white high school, they were providing a summer school program in \nEnglish. A report done at the time suggested the young black women were \nessentially being trained to be domestics, while the title I white \nchildren were being trained how to read.\n  That might be a relic of history which in the new century is a quaint \nanachronism, but it shows in particular places with particular \npressures, unconditional block grants could lead to results of which we \nwould not be particularly supportive. I think we can do better than \nthat.\n  I do not suggest this was a phenomenon in one region of the country. \nIn Massachusetts, in the same report, although they had a significant \nminority population in the Boston public schools, they were turning \nmoney back because they could not use this title I money. That suggests \nto me, if they didn't want to use it, they didn't want to engage in a \nserious way to improve every student's output.\n  We have before the Senate an opportunity not to avert our attention \nand our efforts from school improvement, not to walk away from public \neducation, but rather to engage in a serious debate of how we can \nimprove existing Federal programs, how we can infuse these programs \nwith more purpose, how we can go ahead and prevent local pressures and \nlocal priorities from overcoming what should be a national priority--\nimproving the education of every child in this country.\n  I look forward to this debate as it ensues. I look forward to \nensuring we have a vigorous debate on our policy. In the course of this \ndebate, we will offer amendments to try to improve the legislation. I \nhope we will enter this debate recognizing what we have done over the \nlast decade, the fact that progress is being made, the fact that this \nprogress is insufficient, which should cause us not to abandon our \napproach but to strengthen, reform, and improve it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to recognize Senator Murray after Senator \nBunning gives his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  In accordance with the previous order, the Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, this week we begin the debate on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, probably the most important \nFederal program dealing with education in the Nation.\n  The Program needs to be reauthorized and that gives us several \noptions. We can tinker around the edges, make a few changes, put more \nmoney in the pot, and maintain the status quo, or we can use this \nopportunity to reform the program and try to make it better.\n  As far as I am concerned, if you look back over the past 35 years, \nthe choice between these two options is fairly clear.\n  Since 1965, the Federal Government has spent more than $120 billion \non title 1, the largest Federal education program at meeting the needs \nof disadvantaged students. Despite this tremendous amount of money, the \nperformance of disadvantaged students continues to decline--77 percent \nof children in high-poverty urban schools are reading ``below basic.''\n  Test scores of 12th graders in math, reading, and writing have \nremained stagnant or have declined over the last 30 years. Fourth grade \nstudents in high-poverty schools remain 2 grade levels behind their \npeers in low poverty schools in math. In reading, they remain 3 to 4 \ngrades behind. The achievement gap is now widening instead of closing.\n  Half the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on \ntime, if at all. Seven thousand schools are failing according to \ncurrent accountability standards. Many have been failing for 4 to 6 \nyears, some have been failing for as long as 10 years. These schools \ncontinue to receive Federal funds.\n  It is clear that the Federal education effort is failing, and it is \nequally clear that our schools around the Nation are forced to pay a \nheavy penalty for the Federal funds they do receive.\n\n  Burdensome regulations under the current Federal system have a heavy \nprice tag. We keep talking about the need for more teachers but fewer \nthan 50 percent of the personnel employed in 1994 were teachers. \nBecause of unnecessary Federal regulations, administrative staffs \ncontinue to grow every year. Compliance with Federal rules and \nregulations cost States millions of dollars, and millions of man-hours \neach year.\n  The Federal Government only provides somewhere between 5 and 7 \npercent of local school funding, but it demands as much as 50 percent \nof all school paperwork. That means 49 million hours--or 25,000 \nemployees working full time--are spent each year working on redtape and \npaperwork--not educating children.\n  Based on the facts, it is patently clear that status quo is not \nenough. We need to reform, we need to overhaul this Federal education \nprogram. It is not working the way it is supposed to be. It is not \ngetting the job done. And the bill before us this week does include \nsome major reforms.\n  This bill takes up where the Ed-Flex bill that we passed last year \nleft off. It would increase flexibility and local control, allowing \neducators and teachers and parents to make the decisions about local \neducation needs rather than Federal bureaucrats.\n  What would best serve the students in Louisville, KY might not be the \nsame thing that is needed in Williamsburg. Individual communities have \ndifferent needs. Individual school districts differ--and their needs \ndiffer.\n  We need to give local educators and parents the freedom and the \nflexibility to develop local solutions to local needs without \nhandcuffing them to one-size-fits-all solutions designed in Washington.\n  We clearly need to reduce the cost of compliance with Federal \nregulations so that the money we provide actually makes it to the \nclassrooms instead of being frittered away on paperwork and regulation. \nWe need to let teachers teach, and school administrators and parents \ndesign programs that work. This bill does just that in several \nimportant ways. Flexibility, accountability, and portability.\n  It includes a 15-State demonstration project called Straight A's \nwhich would\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\ngive States that choose to participate considerably more flexibility in \nhow they use Federal funds. It would allow States to consolidate up to \n12 Federal formula grant programs and integrate that Federal money with \nState and local funds to serve their children.\n  This bill would also establish ``performance partnerships'' that all \nthe States could participate in. It too, would offer States greater \nflexibility in how they spend Federal education funds in exchange for \naccepting new accountability standards.\n  This bill also contains provisions which would exempt small, rural \nschools with small student populations from several formula grant \nprogram requirements and give them the flexibility to target Federal \nfunds so that they best meet school district's needs. But hand in hand \nwith flexibility, there must be accountability. These new programs \nestablished in this bill require that in exchange for this added \nflexibility, the schools must meet certain standards. They must get \nresults. This bill would reward States that close the achievement gap \nbetween the highest and lowest performing groups of students.\n  States not the Federal Government, would have to establish specific \ngoals for improving performance of all students, and parents could find \nout whether their children's schools were meeting those goals because \nStates and local school districts would be required to issue report \ncards on school performance. We have that in Kentucky, thanks to \neducational reform. I think parents around the Nation deserve to know \nwhich schools are educating children and which are failing.\n\n  Finally, this bill gives parents an opportunity to do something about \nit, if their children's school is not getting the job done. It gives \nthem an opportunity to send their children to a different school--one \nthat is getting the job done. This bill creates a demonstration program \nwhich will allow States to make title I funds portable--so that the \nmoney follows the student. Too many disadvantaged children are trapped \nin failing schools. This bill would allow children to escape.\n  The bill requires a school district to offer any child enrolled in \ntitle I school that has been designated as failing for 2 years, the \noption of transferring to another higher performing public school.\n  Flexibility, accountability, and portability--these three elements \nare essential ingredients of the kind of reform that is necessary and \nall three of them are incorporated in this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. The status quo is not \nworking. It has proven that red-tape and regulation are not the \nanswer--that more money alone is not the answer.\n  Let's try something new: flexibility to let our teachers teach; \naccountability to require our schools to get results; and portability \nthat will give parents more control of their children's education.\n  I congratulate Senator Jeffords and his staff and the committee for \nthe great work that they have done on this bill. As we debate this \nlegislation over this week, and probably into next, I want everybody to \ncome to the floor and debate the issues that are in this bill because \nthis bill is good for kids' education, and that is what the money we \nsend back to the States should be used for. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his excellent \nstatement. I know Kentucky has been a leader in this field. I \nappreciate Senator Bunning sharing his experience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Washington \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today we are beginning a vital education \ndebate. It is a debate in which every student, educator, and parent has \na stake. Schools across America are making progress, but we cannot be \nsatisfied with the status quo. We need to build on that progress.\n  As we begin this debate, I am optimistic. We have the opportunity to \nhelp students across our country. We have the opportunity to invest in \nthings we know work and to make sure every student can reach high \nstandards.\n  I am optimistic, but I am also realistic about the way the majority \nhas handled education this year. While I thank Chairman Jeffords for \nhis genuine continued efforts to keep this a bipartisan process, I have \nto be realistic because, in the end, this has been a sharply partisan \nprocess, and the bill before us proves just that.\n  In committee, I worked with my Democratic colleagues to improve this \nbill, to make sure we kept our commitment to reduce overcrowded \nclassrooms and to make sure that vulnerable students were protected. \nUnfortunately, my amendments, along with most of the Democratic \namendments, were defeated on party-line votes. As a result, this bill \nis a flawed bill, and it will hurt students, but one would never know \nit by listening to its authors. I urge my colleagues and everyone who \ncares about public education to listen carefully to what you hear the \nRepublicans say in this debate and also to listen for what you do not \nhear them say.\n  The rhetoric the proponents of this bill are using does not match the \nreality of the bill. First, they talk about local control, even though \nthis bill reduces the control of local educators by giving all the \nchoices to State bureaucracies. They will talk about local control, \neven though their bill adds an extra level of bureaucracy.\n  Next, they will talk about flexibility and suggest that Federal \ndollars are not flexible, but education dollars, such as the title I \nprogram, today--right now--give local educators great flexibility. In \nfact, one could walk into a dozen title I schools and no two schools \nwill be doing the same thing with that money because this program today \nis flexible. Decisions at the school and district level are being made \ntoday.\n  We will hear them talk about accountability, even though their bill \nwould experiment with students' futures for 3 years before there is any \nmeasure of accountability. That is 3 full years where kids will fall \nbehind.\n  Finally, they talk about helping poor students, even though their \nbill eliminates--eliminates--the guaranteed funding those students rely \non today. My colleagues will hear them talk about things that are much \ndifferent from what their bill actually does. Their rhetoric does not \nmeet the reality of this bill.\n  Just as important, there are many things my colleagues will not hear \nthem say. They will not talk about funding cuts, but as history has \nshown, when specific programs are combined into a block grant, they end \nup with fewer resources. Block grants will mean fewer dollars for the \nclassrooms next year.\n  They will not talk about how their bill will cut the lifelines that \ntarget funding to students who are homeless or neglected or of migrant \nworkers.\n  They will not talk about how their bill will let public taxpayer \ndollars be diverted to private and religious schools.\n  They will not talk about those things, but those are the consequences \nof this bill. Their bill goes in the wrong direction, and students are \ngoing to lose out.\n  Instead of making sure that every student has a chance to reach high \nstandards, the Republican proposal before us makes it easier for kids \nto be left behind. Instead of ensuring we reduce class size, the \nRepublican proposal abandons our national commitment to give students \nless crowded classrooms.\n  Instead of making a national commitment to improve teacher quality, \nthe Republican proposal fails to provide funding for professional \ndevelopment.\n  Instead of ensuring that we invest in the things we know work, the \nRepublican proposal abandons accountability, writes a blank check to \nState legislatures, and hopes for the best.\n  That is not a responsible education policy. That is throwing their \nhands up in the air and walking away from proven methods for helping \nour students achieve. The Republican proposal goes in the wrong \ndirection, and it will leave students behind.\n  I have been traveling around the State of Washington meeting with \nparents, students, and educators. I have visited high-poverty title I \nschools, and I have visited school districts large and small. As I have \nbeen able to discuss how these policies will actually affect what is \nhappening in the classrooms, almost every single local educator has \nurged me to fight this approach because they know it will hurt their \nstudents.\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\n  I have come to the Senate floor today to show the American people \nwhat is at stake because they have a clear choice on how to improve \neducation. On the one hand, we have Democrats who know that, while some \nschools are making great strides, we cannot be satisfied with the \nstatus quo. We believe the way to improve public schools is to invest \nin the things we know work, the things that are proven to help kids \nlearn the basics in a safe, disciplined environment.\n  We believe we should make a commitment to reducing class size by \nhiring more teachers, improving teacher quality, making sure we have \nsafe and modern school facilities, and making sure children have safe \neducational opportunities after school.\n  Educators, parents, and students themselves have told us these are \nthe programs that make a difference in their classrooms, and that is \nwhy we want to make sure there are specific dollars behind those \nprograms. That is what the Democrats are offering.\n  Republicans go in the exact opposite direction. They say we should \nhave no priorities. They do not want to make any commitment to the \nprograms we know work. They do not want to make sure every student in \nevery part of this country can benefit from smaller class sizes and \nimproved teacher quality. It is as if Republicans have forgotten the \nhistory of our national education policy, and by ignoring that history, \nthey are making the same mistakes again and moving us back to a time \nwhen there was less equality in education.\n  One of the reasons this legislation was passed in 1965 was to ensure \nthat every single child had great educational opportunities. \nUnfortunately, before the Federal Government became a partner in \neducation, too many young people did not get the educational resources \nthey deserved. That is why, in 1965, the Congress and the President \nenacted this monumental legislation, the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, which we are debating today, to focus resources on the \nstudents who were left behind and to help us set and meet national \npriorities.\n  We are making progress in improving America's schools. More students \nare staying in school and taking challenging courses today. SAT and ACT \nscores are up, dropout rates are lower today than they were 20 years \nago, and college attendance is at an all-time high, and is increasing \nfor all students, especially minorities.\n  We are making progress but we can't be satisfied with the status quo. \nBut today, some in Congress want to risk letting vulnerable students \nfall through the cracks.\n  So as we reauthorize this legislation, we must stay true to its most \nbasic principle--that no child is left behind. But as we worked in \ncommittee on this legislation, I watched as the majority moved away--\nfar away--from that very basic principle.\n  I would like to mention that--according the Republicans--the Straight \nA's part of their bill is based on the policies of one State. And guess \nwhich Sate it is. It is Texas.\n  Now I happen to like the State of Texas, and I know Texas educators \nare as good as any in America. But there is only so much they can do \nwith the bad policies they have been given.\n  After all, Texas ranks 45th in SAT scores. That is at the bottom of \nthe pack. In Texas, minorities are twice as likely to drop out of \nschool as white students. Texas schools have some of the Nation's \nhighest dropout rates--which, by the way, makes the test scores of the \nremaining students look higher. Texas, after all, is a State that \ndoesn't even require kindergarten. A recent Washington Post article \nnoted that many education experts have concluded the ``Texas Miracle'' \nis more of a mirage.\n  We should base our national education policy on the things that we \nknow work around the country--drawing success stories from educational \ninnovators in every corner of the Nation. And we can do better than the \none state the Republicans chose to highlight with this bill.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes talking about what these \nRepublican block grants will mean for students because block grants \ncould hurt America's most vulnerable students.\n  Today, many Federal education dollars are targeted to the students \nwho need them the most. This ensures that money intended for poor \nstudents actually goes to poor students. It is a responsible, \naccountable way to meet the specific needs of students who would \notherwise likely be left behind.\n  But the block grant proposal before us would allow those dollars to \nbe used for any educational purpose--completely abandoning the \ntargeting that ensures poor students get the help they need.\n  Recently, here on the Senate floor, one of my colleagues described \nthe requirements that Federal dollars can only be used for specific \npurposes--as ``strings.''\n  Let me read you his entire quote, He said:\n\n       On the other side of the aisle, they want to have a string \n     running from every desk out to every classroom in America; \n     30,000 strings running off the desks, and pull a string here \n     and there so every classroom in America has to fall into \n     exactly what we outline in Congress.\n\n  My colleague calls the targeting of these dollars ``strings.'' I \nserved on a local school board. I think it is a good thing that hard-\nearned taxpayers dollars intended for a specific purpose actually go to \nthat specific purpose. It is responsible, and it is accountable.\n  Now I do agree that some Federal programs require too much paperwork \nand that we can't accept the status quo in education--but the overall \nidea that money intended for kids in need actually goes to kids in need \nis vital.\n  Let me give you an example. Recently, my office received a letter \nfrom Brenda Pessin. She directs a program that helps students who are \nmigrant workers. These students rely on Federal education dollars \ntargeted to meet their needs. Ms. Pessin--as director of the ESTRELLA \nprogram of the Illinois Migrant Council, wrote to me:\n\n       After many years of working on the program, I can say \n     without question that it is truly a lifeline for migrant \n     children and their families. There is simply no way that the \n     essential services provided by the program to this special \n     population--with such unique needs--will be continued under a \n     block grant.\n\n  My colleague calls them ``strings.'' But according to Brenda Pessin--\nwho sees every day how these programs help vulnerable students--they \nare ``lifelines.'' I am inclined to listen to Ms. Pessin.\n  I want everyone to understand what these proposed block grants would \ndo. They would cut the lifelines to vulnerable students.\n  Let me say that again. Block grants would cut the lifelines to \nvulnerable students.\n  If you look at this chart, shown here is a targeted Federal education \ndollar. It is surrounded by some of the services it guarantees for \nvulnerable students.\n  Shown here is an uncrowded classroom.\n  Shown here is transportation so homeless students can get to school.\n  Shown here is money targeted for technology training.\n  Shown here is extra time and attention from a qualified teacher.\n  And over on this side of the chart is shown two real students who \ndepend on these programs and who represent hundreds of thousands of \nother students.\n  Shown up on top of the chart is Nikki. Nikki is an 8th grade student \nin Pennsylvania who is homeless. She is normally an A and B student but \nshe was falling behind in two classes and at risk of failing 8th grade.\n  Furtunately, today we have a lifeline--shown right here on the \nchart--going to homeless students. It is called the Education for \nHomeless Children and Youth program. It is money the Federal Government \nsends to States with the requirement that it be used to help homeless \nstudents. This program provided the funding Nikki needed to get extra \nhelp in the classroom and to buy the school supplies her family \ncouldn't afford. You know what. Today she is doing much better in \nschool.\n  Nikki is not alone. There are between 600,000 and 1 million homeless \nstudents nationwide. Most States and localities provide no money for \nhomeless education. In fact, currently the Federal Government only \nprovides enough money to serve 37 percent of homeless students.\n  So right now we are not doing enough to help these vulnerable \nstudents, but at least today we know that the dollars targeted to \nhomeless students are homeless students.\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\n  If that targeting was taken away--and that money could be used for \nanything else--who knows how students like Nikki would get help?\n  Block grants would eliminate the guarantee we make to Nikki right \nnow. Now I am not suggesting that States would misuse the money--but \nwouldn't you rather keep our commitment to Nikki?\n  Wouldn't you rather know that--no matter what happens--the Nikki's of \nAmerica won't be left behind?\n  We know that before we had a Federal commitment, homeless children \nwere left behind.\n  That is why I am fighting to keep our commitment that money for \nhomeless students should go to homeless students.\n  Block grants would cut this lifeline to Nikki and the more than half \na million homeless students like her.\n  Down here on the chart is shown Ancelmo. Ancelmo is just finishing \nhigh school in the Yakima Valley in Washington State. When Ancelmo was \ngrowing up, his parents were migrant workers. They moved around several \ntimes a year in search of work, and Ancelmo had to change schools every \ntime his family moved. Just as Ancelmo started to make a connection \nwith a teacher, and began to feel comfortable with his classmates, he \nwas moved away to another school, in another town--through no fault of \nhis own.\n  Unfortunately, sitting in a classroom is not always an option for \nmigrant students like Ancelmo. As they grow older, their families begin \nto rely on the work they can do. Many migrant students join their \nparents in the field--working long hours to help make ends meet. \nStudents like Ancelmo are trapped. His family needed him in the field, \nbut he needed to be in the classroom so he could get a good education \nand improve his life and his family's life.\n  Fortunately, today, we have a lifeline going to migrant students like \nAncelmo. Thanks to the federally funded Migrant Education programs, \nAncelmo could travel from town to town or State to State and his \nacademic and immunization records followed him.\n  Thanks to Federal funding, many States have established a system of \ninterstate collaboration to help migrant students meet the high \nacademic standards. Without this collaboration, migrant children are in \ndanger of falling further behind.\n  Thanks to federally funded Migrant Education programs, Ancelmo has \nbeen able to follow his dream of working with computers. He had to \novercome a lot of barriers--like learning to speak English, and staying \nat school long hours to have access to a computer. But today--you know \nwhat?--Ancelmo has achieved his goal, and he serves as the computer \ntechnician for his entire school. Ancelmo hopes to go on to become a \ntelecommunications specialist.\n  Thanks to federally funded Migrant education programs, teachers were \nable to work directly with Ancelmo and address his specific needs as a \nmigrant student. He was not lost in the shuffle. Because of this \nattention to his specific needs, he learned quickly and gained \nconfidence in his abilities.\n  Ancelmo is now a great asset to his community. He is a leader in \nchurch programs. He has served as captain of his football, baseball, \nbasketball and soccer teams. He volunteers in the Big Brothers, Big \nSisters program. He takes time to talk to children about staying away \nfrom drugs, and he spends his summers as a peer leader for other teens.\n  One of the reasons we need a national commitment to migrant students \nis because they move from town to town and State to State. I would hate \nto think of what would have happened to Ancelmo if his family had moved \nhim to a State where there was no guaranteed funding for migrant \neducation. That would have hurt not only Ancelmo, but the other \nstudents in his class who would be forced to do more with less.\n  Ancelmo's entire community would have lost out on his talent and \nleadership as well because there would not have been any guarantee that \nhis schools would address his specific needs as a migrant student. He \nwould have fallen through the cracks.\n  Ancelmo is not alone. there are 718,000 students nationwide who \ndepend on the Migrant Education Program.\n  A block grant would eliminate the guarantee we make to students such \nas Ancelmo. Now, I am not suggesting that States would misuse the \nmoney, but wouldn't you rather keep a commitment to students like \nAncelmo?\n  Wouldn't you rather know that no matter what happens, these students \nwon't be left behind?\n  That's why I'm fighting to keep our commitment to vulnerable \nstudents.\n  Block grants would cut this lifeline to 718,000 students like \nAncelmo.\n  Look at these kids. They are cut off from the lifelines that meet \ntheir specific needs. That's what happens to them when block grants are \nimposed on them. Their lifelines to vital services are cut, and they \nare more likely to fall through the cracks.\n  So at the heart of this education debate is a simple question: do you \nwant to make sure that Federal dollars are guaranteed to go to the \nstudents who need them the most? Or do you want to take a chance?\n  Do you want to cut students' lifelines to success?\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues say those dollars should not be \ntied to specific programs, including these programs that make sure \nmoney gets to students who are homeless and migrant.\n  Some Members of the Senate would even let public school dollars be \ndrained away into private schools.\n  Let me be clear: A block grant can't educate a single child. A block \ngrant can't teach a child to read. A block grant can't help a single \nchild learn the basics.\n  But a committed investment in the things we know work, such as \nimproving teacher quality and reducing class size, those specific \nthings can teach children to read. We should be investing in the things \nwe know work, not experimenting with block grants.\n  We have a positive plan to invest in the things we know work. The \nfirst step is to make sure that disadvantaged students don't lose out.\n  The simple question is, is it worth keeping the guarantees to these \nstudents? I think the answer is clear. I think Nikki and Ancelmo would \ntell you: Don't cut the lifeline we depend on.\n  Unfortunately, students like Nikki and Ancelmo--and their parents--\ndon't always show up at school board meetings. They don't show up in \ntheir State capital or here in Congress to say, Don't cut this program. \nSo we've got to be their voice and speak out against the block grants \nthat will cut their lifelines.\n  Mr. President, that is only one of the problems with the Republican \nproposal. Another major problem with block grants is they mean less \nmoney for the classroom. Right now, Republicans want you to believe \nthat they will keep the same amount of money available for education. \nBut when those dollars are combined into a block grant, we know they \nwill be cut.\n  Block grants mean less money for the classroom. You see, block grants \nare not a new idea. They are an old and failed policy. One of the \nreasons block grants don't work is because they don't serve a specific \npurpose. And when there is not a clear purpose, it is hard to make \nprogress toward a goal.\n  That is why education policy today is targeted. We have programs that \nare focused on poor students, on gifted students and on reducing class \nsize.\n  But Republican block grants have no specific purpose. In effect, \nthey're just a blank check. And the trickiest part about block grants \nis they have a history of shrinking. Here in Congress, we have many \nexamples of programs that were turned into block grants. And once they \nwere turned into block grants, they were squeezed and cut every year.\n  Let me give you an example. Title VI is an education program that \nfunds innovative education programs including programs to increase \nlocal flexibility, reduce administrative burdens, and provide services \nfor private school students.\n  In 1982, Congress provided about $708 million. But that year, Title \nVI was turned into a block grant and over time its budget was cut again \nand again. By 1999, funding for this program had been cut by 50 \npercent, chopped in half. That's fewer dollars for the classroom after \nit was turned into a block grant.\n  In contrast, other education programs that weren't turned into block\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\ngrants were increased, such as education technology and Title I. But \nthis one, which was turned into a block grant, was squeezed. That's \nwhat we can expect out of block grants.\n  And the consequences of these block grants will be felt in classrooms \nacross the country. Kids will get fewer resources. That means that \nclassrooms across the country would be overcrowded. New schools won't \nbe built, and teachers won't get the training they need.\n  Anyone who votes for a block grant is saying: I know that under block \ngrants, students will end up with less money, and that's OK with me.\n  I'm here to say that is not OK. We can't let block grants be used to \ncut education funding.\n  Mr. President, in addition to cutting the lifelines to vulnerable \nstudents and cutting education funding, block grants would reduce \naccountability.\n  Parents, teachers and all taxpayers want to know where their hard-\nearned tax dollars are going.\n  Today, we know where Federal education dollars are going. And today, \nwe know they are targeted to the students who need them most. The block \ngrant proposal contained in the ESEA bill would eliminate that \naccountability, and I'm on the floor to say we must keep our education \nbudget accountable.\n  Unfortunately, block grants provide no accountability for where \neducation dollars are going. Block grants provide no accountability to \nensure those dollars are targeted to our most vulnerable students. And \nblock grants provide little or no accountability for student \nachievement.\n  In fact, the Republican proposal would engage a risky, three-year \nexperiment--an experiment that is not based on any proven strategies--\nall with the hope that 3 years down the road, students will not have \nfallen behind.\n  Let me be clear about one thing: While many schools are making \ndramatic gains, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo. We need to \nmake sure all students are achieving at high standards.\n  So the question is: What's the best way to improve public education?\n  After my own experience as an educator, a parent and a school board \nmember, I've seen that making an investment in the things we know \nwork--reducing classroom overcrowding and improving teacher quality--is \nthe way to improve public education.\n  Today, the Federal Government provides only 7 percent of all \neducation funding. The Federal Government's role is small. But we \nDemocrats want to make sure that every one of those Federal dollars are \ngoing where they will help students the most. That means making sure \nthey remain targeted to vulnerable students and investing in reducing \nclass size, improving teacher quality, helping school districts build \nnew schools and modernize old ones, and closing the digital divide.\n  Even though the Federal Government only provides 7 cents of every \neducation dollar, we know where that money goes.\n  We can tell parents how many children are being helped by specific \nprograms. This chart shows how many students are served by specific \nprograms and who will lose under the block grant provisions of S. 2.\n  For example, who will lose? Mr. President, 12.7 million children in a \ntitle 1 program; 71,300 parents and students, or 32,000 families, will \nlose in the Even Start Program; 197,000 students in the Neglected and \nDelinquent Youth Program; Class Size Reduction Program, 29,000 teachers \nand 1.7 million children. The list goes on.\n  Under all of these programs, we see millions of real students who are \ngoing to lose out under block grants.\n  Republican block grants would take all of these vital programs, pool \nthe money together, and then write a blank check to the States, with no \naccountability. Today, we know where our tax dollars are going. But \nunder block grants, we could not even tell taxpayers where their money \nwas going. That is not responsible accounting budget, but that is the \napproach the Republicans are taking.\n  The other side thinks Federal dollars should not be targeted to meet \nspecific needs. But many educators have told me that if these dollars \nwere not targeted, the kids who need them the most would not get them.\n  Block grants provide no focus on proven, effective strategies to \nimprove schools. States could even start private school vouchers that \nwould drain funds away from public schools, where 90 percent of the \nstudents are enrolled. They would take the money from these programs \nand they could use it for that under this bill.\n  When it comes to accountability, Federal education dollars are seven \ntimes more targeted to poor students than State and local dollars. That \ntargeting ensures that poor kids have the resources they need.\n  Unfortunately, the first thing block grants will do is eliminate that \ntargeting. It's not hard to predict the results--poor students will end \nup with fewer resources.\n  Today, we know money is targeted to poor children. We have \naccountability. Under block grants, we don't know. There's no \naccountability to meet the needs of poor students.\n  Next I'd like to turn to student achievement because, unfortunately, \nthe Republican block grant proposal requires little or no \naccountability for better student achievement. The bill does not define \nwhat, if any, consequences schools would face if they fail, nor does it \nspecify when failing schools would face consequences.\n  A state would be free to ignore failing schools and the disadvantaged \nstudents who attend them. Only after 3 years are states held \naccountable for educational results. And even then, the accountability \nis weak--it just says that states must follow the underlying law. By \nthat time, students have lost three critical years of learning.\n  Mr. President, this Republican Congress would take students across \nthe country on a three-year experiment that is not based in proven, \neffective strategies, that will cut the lifelines to vulnerable \nstudents, and that will mean less money for the classroom, and less \naccountability to taxpayers. That's not a sound education policy--\nthat's a disaster waiting to happen.\n  Under the Republican experiment, there will be no guarantee that \nmoney for poor students will go to poor students. Under their \nexperiment, there will be no guarantee that money will go to the proven \nstrategies that help students.\n  They would have us experiment like that for three years, and then \nwe'll see what happens to the students. Anyone looking at that proposal \ncan see poor kids are going to fall behind when resources are no longer \ntargeted to them.\n  Democrats want accountability in education programs. We think we need \nto be able to tell taxpayers where their hard-earned tax dollars are \ngoing. We think we need to be able to tell taxpayers their money is \nbeing targeted to the most critical needs. And we think we need to be \nable to show taxpayers that students are improving. And we don't think \nwe can take three years of a child's education and experiment with that \ncritical time, when students need to master the building blocks of \nlearning.\n  Today, we know where tax dollars are going. Under block grants, we \ndon't know.\n  Today, we know money is targeted to critical needs. Under block \ngrants, we don't know.\n  Today, we know public tax dollars will stay in public schools. Under \nblock grants, we don't know.\n  Under the Republican bill, we would experiment for three years and \nhope students don't fall through the cracks.\n  That's why we're against this proposal. Democrats want to keep our \neducation dollars accountable. I urge my colleagues to reject block \ngrants and stand up for accountability.\n  So, Mr. President, that's the Republican agenda: block grants and \nvouchers, cutting lifelines to vulnerable students, less money for the \nclassroom, and less accountability to taxpayers.\n\n  Parents, teachers and students have told us that agenda won't help \nall students reach their potential. They want us to invest in the \nthings they know make a difference in the classroom--proven, effective \nstrategies like reducing overcrowding.\n  Two years ago, we agreed on a bipartisan basis that we would help \nschool districts hire 100,000 new, fully-qualified teachers to reduce \nclassroom overcrowding.\n  This year, 1.7 million students across the country are learning in \nclassrooms that are less crowded than they were\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nthe year before. These students are learning in classrooms where \nteachers can spend more time teaching, and less time dealing with \ndiscipline problems. These students are getting the individual \nattention they need to learn the basics.\n  During the upcoming debate, I plan to offer an amendment to this bill \nto authorize the class size reduction program. This program has been so \nsuccessful and we should authorize it so that it can help every student \nin this country reach high academic standards.\n  Throughout my state I've heard from superintendents, principals, \nteachers, and parents that reducing class size is really making a \ndifference. We can't abandon this commitment to our schools!\n  Don Worley, of Kettle Falls Elementary School in Washington State \nrecently told me:\n\n       The class size reduction program is one of the best things \n     for kids from the federal government in a long time--reading \n     scores are up and this is really making a difference.\n\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, why would you \nwant to abandon an effort like this when it's really making a \ndifference?\n  The first grade teachers at Eisenhower Elementary School in the \nVancouver School District recently sent me a list of how smaller class \nsize is making a difference in their school.\n  They said the following things--\n  ``Each student receives significantly more one-on-one help for \nacademics and behavior.''\n  ``More curriculum is covered in all areas.''\n  ``Students are leaving the classroom with the ability to read.''\n  ``Students have less ``wait time'' for all kinds of teachers \nresponses.''\n  ``More time is available to really get to know the student.''\n  And ``less paperwork leaves more time for students.''\n  Those are the words of teachers, who are telling us this is making a \ndifference.\n  That's why I plan to offer an amendment that would provide $1.75 \nbillion to our schools to reduce class size in grades 1 through 3.\n  This amendment will target the money where it is needed within \nstates, and 99 percent of the funds will be disbursed directly to local \nschool districts on a formula which is 80 percent need-based, and 20 \npercent enrollment-based.\n\n  The class size reduction program will ensure local decision-making \nand flexibility. School districts can use all funds to reduce class \nsize, or use up to 25 percent for other needs.\n  Any school district that has already reduced class size in the early \ngrades to 18 or fewer children can use funds: to further reduce class \nsizes in the early grades, to reduce class size in kindergarten or \nother grades, or to carry out activities to improve teacher quality, \nincluding professional development.\n  In small districts where the funding level is not enough to hire a \nnew teacher, districts can choose to spend the funds on other \nactivities, such as professional development, recruitment, testing new \nteachers, or providing professional development to new and current \nteachers of regular and special needs children.\n  Mr. President, if you look just in my state at how different school \ndistricts are using their class size money, you can see how flexible \nthe program is.\n  In Washington, the North Thurston School District is using all of \ntheir money to hire teachers to reduce class size. At the same time, \nthe Pomeroy School District, which is a rural district in Eastern \nWashington, used 100 percent of their funding for professional \ndevelopment for their teachers. The Seattle School District even used a \nportion of its funding to recruit teachers.\n  The class size reduction program is simple and efficient. School \ndistricts fill out a one-page form, which is available on-line.\n  And let me just add that teachers have told me that they have never \nseen money move so quickly from Congress to the classroom. Linda \nMcGeachy in the Vancouver School District recently said: ``the language \nis very clear, applying was very easy, and these funds really work to \nsupport classroom teachers.''\n  Mr. President, I've worked as an educator, and I know it makes a big \ndifference if you have 18 kids in a classroom or if you have 25 or 30 \nkids in a classroom. Smaller classes provide a better environment for \nkids to learn the basics with fewer discipline problems.\n  And smaller classes are an example of how Democrats are making a \ncommitment to improving public education.\n  Republicans won't make that commitment, and the American people are \ngoing to get to decide which approach will help students more.\n  We believe that we should put our money behind the things that local \neducators tell us produce results. We believe that we should keep our \ncommitment to vulnerable students. We believed that we should keep \neducation dollars accountable. And we believe that we shouldn't let \nblock grants shortchange students.\n  If you agree that we can't turn our backs on vulnerable students and \ncritical needs, if you agree that we can't break our commitment to the \nthings that are improving America's schools, and if you agree that we \ncan't let block grants cut education funding and hurt students, I \ninvite you to join our effort--along with thousands of parents and \neducators across America--to reject block grants and finally make a \nreal, national commitment to the strategies that are revolutionizing \nAmerica's schools.\n  Join us in this effort--let your Senators know they should reject \nblock grants and instead support smaller class sizes, safe and modern \nschools, and high-quality teachers. Students across America are \ndepending on it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nsharing her valuable experiences with us and for her statement.\n  I believe we have one more speaker who desires to speak before we \nclose out. I ask that she be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today, as have others, to talk about an issue of paramount \nimportance to this Nation, and possibly the most important issue we in \nthe Senate will face this year--how we educate our children.\n  I only hope that we in the Senate are big enough to rise above the \npartisan politics to get results on behalf of our children. We in the \nSenate have a difficult task before us of passing legislation that \nreauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which \ndetermines how the Federal Government allocates money to our public \nschools.\n  Unfortunately, all signs to date point to yet another political \nstalemate on an issue of vital importance to our nation and its \nchildren. Once again, Mr. President, we face the real possibility that \nthe Senate will abandon its responsibility to govern and choose \npartisan politics over sound public policy.\n  I reject this proposition because our children deserve more from \ntheir elected officials. In hopes of fostering a compromise on this \ncontentious issue, I have joined with a group of my moderate Democratic \ncolleagues here in the Senate to promote a ``Third Way'' on ESEA, one \nthat synthesizes the best ideas of both sides into a whole new approach \nto federal education policy.\n  We're calling this bill the ``Three R's'', and it is a bold effort at \nstreamlining massive Federal education programs and refocusing them on \nraising academic achievement.\n  At its core, this blueprint will give more funding and flexibility to \nstates and local school districts, in exchange for greater \naccountability.\n  In addition to being smart national policy, the Three R's proposal \nwould dramatically improve education in my home state of Arkansas.\n  As I noted earlier, the Three R's bill significantly increases the \nfederal investment in our public schools and carefully targets those \nadditional dollars to the neediest public schools.\n  As my colleague who spoke before said, there are those out there who \nwe cannot just leave to chance.\n  Statistics consistently demonstrate that, on average, children who \nattend low-income schools lag behind students from more affluent \nneighborhoods.\n  This is certainly true in Arkansas where the most recent test results \nindicate that students in the economically prosperous northwest region \nof the\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\nstate outperform students in the impoverished Delta . . . These results \nalso indicate that the disparity in student achievement between \nminority and non-minority students in Arkansas continues.\n  I believe strongly that every child deserves a high-quality education \nand that the federal government has a right to expect more from our \nnation's schools. But we also have a responsibility to give public \nschools the resources they need to be successful.\n  Another aspect of the current education framework that affects \nArkansas is the prevalence of competitive grant funding programs.\n  Unfortunately, rural states--and especially rural school districts \nsimilar to where I grew up--do not have the resources necessary to be \nsuccessful under a competitive grant system.\n  Simply put, economically disadvantaged schools don't have the ability \nto chase after federal dollars as effectively as schools who can afford \nto hire professional grant writers. As a result, many of the schools in \nmy state that most need financial support from the federal government \nare too often out of luck.\n  Under the Three R's bill, federal funding is allocated based on total \nstudent enrollment and the number of low-income students in the \ndistrict, not on the ability of savvy grant writers to draft proposals \nwith graphs and color charts.\n  Under our bill, Mr. President, these schools would be guaranteed \nfederal funding which they could use to address their most pressing \nproblems. And they will be held accountable; schools will be forced to \nmake improvements or suffer consequences.\n  Mr. President, we will certainly hear this week from people \nrepresenting both sides of the debate about how to improve public \neducation. But the question we need to ask: who is representing our \nchildren? Who is representing the thousands of young Americans who \ncontinue to underperform academically year after year in an educational \nsystem simply that does not work for the students who are left behind?\n  As we go through this debate this is the question we must ask \nourselves--what, honestly, is the best thing for our children?\n  I say to my colleagues, you want accountability from local schools? \nOur proposal has it.\n  You want more targeted, effective national investment? Take a look at \nour Three R's bill.\n  Do you want qualified, better-trained teachers, flexibility at the \nlocal level and higher minority-student retention rates? We have the \nanswers in this bill--a commonsense approach.\n  Put party politics aside. The ``Three R's'' is the right approach to \nimprove student achievement in every classroom.\n  Congress must do all it can to help our schools meet the challenges \nthey face today and will face in the future.\n  We must do all we can to help our States and local school districts \nraise academic achievement and deliver on the promise of equal \nopportunity for all students. But I will say our most important \nresponsibility is to our children and to their future.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and patience this evening, \nand for all of the hard work that both of these two legislators have \ndone in this field of education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for her help and participation and \nalso for her statement.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the revolutionary idea that tomorrow might \nbe better and that man can do something about it is distinctly \nAmerican. At the heart of self-improvement is a quality education.\n  The purpose of a system of public education is to give every child an \nequal opportunity for success in life whether his parents are rich or \npoor, black or white. In order to ensure that every student has a solid \nbase of knowledge from which to build, we must have high expectations \nand hold schools accountable for the performance of their students.\n  The American people and most members of Congress are in agreement \nthat America's schools are not meeting this challenge. In fact, the \nlonger our students attend school the further behind they fall in \nperformance. More federal programs are not the answer. During the past \nthree decades while student performance has stagnated, federal programs \nhave proliferated. Today, our schools deny our children the basic \nprinciple of opportunity because they fail to adequately equip them for \nthe future.\n  What we need is the courage to change. America has always met the \nchallenges posed to it with innovation, creativity and ingenuity. So \nfar, in the education debate, we have been denied the opportunity to \ntap into this resourcefulness. As a consequence, our students have been \nshort-changed by the focus on a top-heavy education establishment \nrather than on the quality of their education. Business-as-usual is \nfailing our children.\n  Unfortunately, for too long, our system of federal education programs \nhas failed to provide all students with the opportunity for a quality \neducation. We have left generations of students behind while we focused \non inputs and rode the wave of education trend after education trend.\n  First it was ``whole language,'' which has now been repudiated as a \nsingular method for teaching reading. Unlike other subjects, we have \nfirm, scientific evidence on how children learn to read and what \ntechniques teachers can employ to ensure that children learn how to \nread by the 3rd grade. Instruction grounded in phonics has been shown \nto be the most effective means of reading instruction.\n  The newest trend, the ``new, new math'' programs that the Department \nof Education has endorsed, have been repudiated for their ``serious \nmathematical shortcomings'' by 200 mathematicians and scientists, \nincluding four Nobel laureates.\n  And all this because the federal government knows best.\n  The response to stagnant test scores and a widening gap in \nachievement levels between poor and non-poor has been to spend more and \nmore money on more and more programs--each targeted to address a \nspecific purpose that the federal government has deemed most important.\n  I learned through my work as the chairman of the Budget Committee \nTask Force on Education that there are approximately 552 federal \neducation programs. The Department of Education administers 244 of \nthese programs, and even if you count only those ``providing direct and \nindirect instructional assistance to students in kindergarten through \ngrade 12,'' the GAO found that there are still 69 programs.\n  Among these programs, overlap is pervasive. In my office, we \ncall this chart the ``spider web chart.'' This chart, prepared by the \nGAO, shows that 23 federal departments and agencies administer multiple \nfederal programs to three targeted groups: teachers, at-risk and \ndelinquent youth, and young children. For early childhood, for example, \nthere are 90 programs in 11 agencies and offices. In fact, one \ndisadvantaged child could be eligible for as many as 13 programs.\n\n  In addition, the effectiveness of many of these programs is doubtful \nor unknown. The GAO has expressed concern that the Department of \nEducation does not know how well new or newly modified programs are \nbeing implemented, or to what extent established programs are working. \nThe efficacy of Title I also remains uncertain.\n  According to the National Assessment of Educational Programs, 77 \npercent of children in high-poverty urban schools are reading ``below \nbasic.''\n  Test scores of 12th graders in math, reading and writing have \nremained stagnant or declined over the last 30 years and our 12th \ngraders score near dead last in international comparisons.\n  Fourth grade students in high-poverty schools remain two grade levels \nbehind their peers in low poverty schools in math. In reading they \nremain three to four grade levels behind. Contrary to the original \nobjectives the ESEA program was designed to address, the achievement \ngap is now widening.\n  Half of the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on \ntime, if at all.\n  Seven thousand schools are failing, according to current \naccountability standards. Many have been failing for 4 or 6 years, in \nsome cases even 10 years. Despite their long history of failure, these \nschools continue to receive federal funds.\n  Lastly, it should come as no surprise that so many programs and so \nmuch\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\nconfusion comes at great cost. Critics of the education establishment \nnote that although federal funds make up only 7 percent of their \nbudgets, they impose 50 percent of their administrative costs. As one \nconcrete example, Frank Brogan, Florida's Commissioner of Education, \nhas reported that it takes 297 state employees to oversee and \nadminister $1 billion in federal funds. In contrast, only 374 employees \noversee approximately $7 billion in state funds. Thus, it takes six \ntimes as many people to administer a federal dollar as a state dollar.\n  Brogan went on to say:\n\n       We at the State and local level feel the crushing burden \n     caused by too many Federal regulations, procedures, and \n     mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to \n     administer inflexible, categorical Federal programs that \n     divert precious dollars away from raising student \n     achievement. Many of these Federal programs typify the \n     misguided, one-size-fits-all command and control approach. \n     Most have the requisite focus on inputs like more regulation, \n     increasing budgets, and fixed options and processes. The \n     operative question in evaluating the effectiveness of these \n     programs in usually: How much money have we put into the \n     system?\n\n  Cozette Buckney, Chief Education Officer, of the Chicago school \nsystem echoed the sentiments of many state and local officials:\n\n       Excessive paperwork is a concern. Too many reports, the \n     time lines for some of the reports, the cost factor involved, \n     the administrative staff just do now warrant that kind of \n     time on task. That is taking from what we need to do to \n     make certain our students are achieving and our teachers \n     are prepared.\n\n  Today, we have the opportunity to reverse these trends and to \nfundamentally reform our federal education system.\n  Today, we are unveiling a plan that reflects the spirit of \ninnovation. At the core of this innovative effort is the need to \ngalvanize leadership at the state and local level and to hold this \nleadership accountable.\n  The bill that we have before us here today is a good first step in \nthat direction.\n  We focus on student achievement, centering on children, quality \nteachers, school safety, flexibility, and local control.\n  One, instead of inputs, our focus is on outputs--student achievement.\n  We believe that federal programs should hold states and school \ndistricts accountable for closing the achievement gap that persists \nbetween low-income and non-low-income students and minority students \nand non-minority students.\n  Many blame the achievement gap that exists between groups on \ndemographic and socioeconomic factors. This is the soft bigotry of low \nexpectations.\n  Many schools and school districts with high populations of low-income \nstudents increased student performance. In San Antonio TX, over 75 \npercent of the students are from low-income families at the Terrell \nWells Middle School. The School increased student performance by 40% in \nreading from 49.2 to 89.9 percent performing at proficient levels and \nby nearly 60 percent in math within just one year 19.1 to 76.2 percent.\n  Instead of sending states money year after year with no regard for \nresults, we hold states and school districts accountable for the \nacademic achievement of their students. Again, accountability is not \nfocused on how schools and school districts spend the money, but how \nstudents perform as a result.\n  Schools that succeed in educating children should be rewarded. \nSchools that fail again and again must be held accountable. And parents \ndeserve to know which schools are educating children and which are \nfailing.\n  Accountability systems based on results raise the academic \nachievement levels of all students. Texas and North Carolina both have \nserious systems of accountability for teachers and schools, and not \ncoincidentally, have been named two of the best performers in closing \nthe achievement gap based on National Assessment of Educational \nProgress results.\n  There is no excuse for failure. Principals of low-income schools \nthroughout the country are proving that poverty is no excuse for \nfailure.\n  Two, S. 2 focuses on the child rather than the system. Parents, not \nschool systems, should be empowered to make decisions about which \nschool a child attends.\n  It is wrong to compel a child to attend a failing school. Needy \nchildren must be given the opportunity to attend a high performing \npublic school.\n  In no other area of American society do we deny Americans the freedom \nto make choices that affect their well-being. Yet we require many \nparents to keep their students in schools which not only fail to \neducate them, but cannot even guarantee their safety.\n  According to Arthur Levine, President, Columbia University Teachers \nCollege: ``. . . to force children into inadequate schools is to deny \nthem any chance of success. To do so simply on the basis of their \nparent's income is a sin.''\n\n  We must empower parents to choose what is best for their children \nand, as a consequence, to reform our nation's public education system.\n  As John Dewey said, ``What the best and wisest parent wants for his \nchild, that must be what the community wants for all its children. Any \nother ideal for our schools is narrow and unlovely; it destroys our \ndemocracy.''\n  Children should no longer be trapped in failing schools. Parents of \nchildren in failing schools should have greater and more numerous \nopportunities to send their children to a higher performing school.\n  Under the Title I system of accountability, over 7,000 schools have \nbeen identified as failing and that number is expected to grow. Of \nthose 7,000 schools, many have been identified as failing for 4 years, \n6 years, some even for 10 years. Any and every child in one of those \nshould be granted access to better schools.\n  Three, S. 2 reflects the importance of quality teachers. According to \nTennessee's very own Bill Sanders, a professor at the University of \nTennessee, teacher quality has a greater effect on student performance \nthan any other factor--including class size and student demographics. \n``When kids have ineffective teachers, they never recover.''\n  Every child deserves to learn from a high quality teacher--a teacher \nwho is competent in his/her subject area, cares about his/her students, \nand demands academic excellence.\n  Every child's teacher deserves expanded opportunities for additional \ntraining as education reforms raise the standards of achievement for \nstudents. We expect schools to ensure that all of their teachers are \nproficient in their subject areas and are equipped with the skills and \nknowledge necessary to help students meet high standards.\n  Currently, more than 25 percent of new teachers enter our nation's \nschools poorly qualified to teach.\n  In Massachusetts alone, 59 percent of incoming teachers failed the \nbasic licensing exam. Forty-four percent of incoming teachers failed a \n10th grade level competency test.\n  Fifty-six percent of those teaching physics and chemistry, 53 percent \nof those teaching history, 33 percent of those teaching math, and 24 \npercent of those teaching English do not have a major or minor in the \nfield in which they teach. In inner-city schools, the statistics are \neven worse. Inner-city students have only a 50-50 chance of being \ntaught by a qualified math or science teacher.\n  Four, school safety is another important component of our bill. Every \nchild deserves an environment that is free of danger and distractions \nto learning, and where learning is the primary goal. When drugs and \nviolence threaten the classroom, the first victim is learning.\n  Five, and perhaps most important, this bill recognizes the importance \nof flexibility and local control. Parents, community leaders, local and \nstate governments, and not the federal government know best the \neducation needs of their children. All across America states and local \ncommunities are implementing innovative solutions to our education \nchallenges.\n  Indeed, in a recent editorial by an educator and a former Senate \nmajority leader in the state of Maine, Bennett Katz decries the latest \nattempt by the administration to micromanage school spending priorities \nfrom Washington DC. With regard to the President's class size \ninitiative, he says:\n\n       I would opt for [the money] to meet Maine's most pressing \n     education needs as we see them--not as identified by \n     Washington, D.C. politicians. That's the trouble with \n     Washington people dreaming up wonderful programs to be paid \n     for with our tax dollars. We know what our top needs are . . \n     . ask our very savvy commissioner of education. If \n     Washington's lofty thinkers are awash with\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\n     surplus dollars, they should not try to tell us how to spend \n     them on their priorities. If the US Department of Education \n     is so smart, take a look at how successful they are in \n     running the schools in the District of Columbia.\n\n  States and local school districts are innovative. Without question, \nit is states and localities that today are serving as the engines for \nchange in education. The groundwork for success is already in place at \nthe local level--teachers, parents, principals, and communities \ndemonstrate on a daily basis the enthusiasm and desire to succeed. \nHowever, flexibility at the state and local level is critical to the \nsuccess of our schools.\n  But along with the resources, the federal government must also give \nstates and localities the freedom to pursue their own strategies for \nimplementation. With respect to education, tactics and implementation \nprocedures are virtually dictated by the federal government.\n  Rather than working closely with the states, the Congress created 70 \nnew federal education programs in the 1980's. President Clinton, \nthinking that 552 federal educational programs are not enough, \nsuggested 14 more in his fiscal year 1999 budget proposal. The \nrationale for expanding an already overly large and burdensome federal \neducation establishment is simply not discernible. Instead, the states \nshould have the flexibility to put together state strategic plans under \neither the Straight A's program or the Performance Partnerships \nprogram. Under such a plan, the states would establish concrete \neducational goals and timetables for achievement. In return, they would \nbe allowed to pool federal funds from categorical programs and spend \nthese consolidated resources on state established priorities.\n  Paul Vallas, the Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago school \nsystem, explained the crucial elements of the bold reforms that he and \nhis colleagues have been making in Chicago. He didn't have more money \nto work with. What he had--and has made highly effective use of--was, \nin his words, ``flexibility with money and work rules, high standards \nand expectations, accountability from top to bottom . . . and a \nwillingness to take advantage of options.''\n  Vallas went on to say:\n\n       [Another] key to our success has been flexibility. We are \n     fortunate to have a great deal of control over the allocation \n     of resources. In Chicago, almost all of the tax levies for \n     the schools are consolidated. The revenue comes right to us. \n     In addition, our categorical grants from the state are \n     consolidated into two block grants--one for regular education \n     and one for special ed. We decide how all this money is \n     spent.\n       * * * because the state has given us all our funds in block \n     grants and has basically said, ``Here's your money--you \n     decide how to spend it,'' I have been able to reallocate \n     about $130 million into our classrooms and to generate about \n     $170 million in other savings.\n\n  As we all know, there is no more important issue today than \neducation. Some of my colleagues across the aisle have a whole array of \nprograms that they think will solve the problem. Among their many \namendments, I have counted at least 12 new programs that range from $50 \nmillion to $1.3 billion. For many of you, more money and more federal \neducation programs are the answer to all our nation's education woes. \nOf course these programs sound good--but will they really do any good? \nMore money or an additional program is often a surrogate for the \nstructural reform that American education needs. Structural reform, \nchange--this is what many in the education establishment fear. Instead, \ntheir response to crisis is more money and another federal program.\n  But, the last thing that we need is another federal program. The last \nthing that our schools need is more bureaucracy and federal intrusion. \nInstead, what Washington should and can do is to free the hands of \nstates and localities and to support local and state education reform \nefforts. When localities find ideas that work, the federal government \nshould either get out of the way or lend a helping hand.\n  The Educational Opportunities Act is a step in the right direction. \nBuilding on the bipartisan success of Ed-Flex, we have increased \nflexibility and empowered parents. I look forward to the debate that we \nwill have about further empowering parents and children with the \nability to choose where their children go to school.\n  I commend the chairman for his hard work and dedication to education. \nI think there are some very good provisions in this bill.\n  I strongly support both Straight A's and the performance partnership \nprogram that are in title VI.\n  I am pleased to see report card language in title I--I agree with the \nchairman that knowledge is power and that by empowering parents we are \ncreating agents for positive change.\n  Unlike class size reduction proposals, which require States and local \nschools to hire new teachers, the Teacher Empowerment Act, TEA, \nprovides maximum flexibility to states and locals in using $2 billion \nannually to develop high quality professional development programs, \nhire additional teachers, provide incentives to retain quality teachers \nor to fund innovative teacher programs, such as teacher testing, merit-\nbased teacher performance systems and alternative routes to \ncertification.\n  I applaud the chairman's rural flexibility initiative, and I am \ndelighted that we have consolidated several different programs and \ntitles. Although I wish we could have consolidated a few more programs \nand titles, we have made some progress. We used to have 14 titles, now \nwe have 11.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. This debate is not over money. It is \nnot over who cares the most about our nation's school children. This \ndebate is over who knows best--the federal government or the parents, \nteachers and administrators back home who interact with our children \nevery day. The debate is over who do we trust? Federal bureaucrats or \npeople back home who struggle under the weight of federal mandates to \nhelp children learn.\n  The federal government has a track record of failure despite many \nbillions of dollars spent. States and localities, however, have shown \nthe promise and the possibilities of success with innovative methods to \nraise student achievement and to reduce the achievement gap.\n  This bill will give states and localities the tools and the \nflexibility necessary to begin to restore American education to \npreeminence. To achieve educational excellence will take time. There is \nno simple solution and gimmicky short-term fads, like those offered by \nthis Administration, will not lead to long-term success. The Republican \nparty is dedicated to a sustained long-term effort to assure that every \nchild in America receives not just an education, but a quality \neducation. In our global economy, it is no longer good enough to be \nadequate. We must be outstanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3178-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words today \nabout biotechnology and trade. As a working family farmer, I see the \neffects of this debate nearly every week at the grain elevators in my \nhometown of New Hartford, Iowa.\n  With the benefit of this personal experience, and as chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee's International Trade Subcommittee, I have \naddressed the issue of biotechnology and trade in many ways.\n  Last October, my Trade Subcommittee looked at the biotechnology issue \nduring hearings on agricultural trade policy. Last fall, I brought \nCharles Ludolph, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Europe, \nto Iowa to hear the concerns our corn and soybean growers have about \nthe European food scare over GMO products. Last December, I addressed \nthis issue at the WTO Ministerial Conference Meeting in Seattle.\n  And I have continued to have high-level discussions about trade in \ngenetically modified foods with the European Commission. I recently had \nanother meeting in this city with David Byrne, the EU Commissioner for \nConsumer Health and Safety Protection. This was a very informative \nmeeting. If followed\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\na lengthy session I had with Commissioner Byrne in Seattle.\n  In our Washington meeting, Commissioner Byrne and I discussed recent \ndevelopments affecting trade and biotechnology within the European \nUnion.\n  It is with this deep background, and my long-standing concern about \nbiotechnology and trade, that I would like to report to the people of \nIowa and America that I still have great concerns about what we are \nseeing in Europe, and now in Japan.\n  For nearly 30 years, Europe's governments have been telling their \npeople that modern agricultural technology is dangerous. First, it was \nthe pesticide scare of the 1970s. Even though we have added eight years \nto our life spans since we started widely spraying modern pesticides on \nour crops. Then it was growth hormones in meat. Even though European \nscientists have confirmed the safety of these hormones. Now it's \ngenetically modified foods. Even though not one person has ever caught \nso much as a cold from eating a genetically enriched product.\n  Now we learn that just last week, Japan's Ministry of Health and \nWelfare is getting set to require mandatory safety tests on genetically \nmodified foods before they can be imported into Japan. This will \ndramatically and adversely affect our farmers, who ship about $10 \nbillion worth of products a year to Japan. Every year, Japan relies on \nUnited States production for 80 percent of its corn imports.\n  Japan is taking this action even though genetically modified products \nproduced in the United States must be approved by a food regulatory \nagency that the world looks to as the model for what a food safety \nagency should do.\n  And both the Japanese and the European Union governments know that \ngenetically modified foods are only approved for sale after thousands \nof field trials and rigorous testing.\n  So what's going on?\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that a good part of these developments \ncan be explained by a desire to restrain trade. Non-tariff trade \nbarriers we've been fighting to eliminate for 50 years. Agricultural \nproducers in Europe, and in Japan, can't grow corn, or soybeans, or \nmany other products more efficiently, at better prices, than we can. So \nthey look for other means to counter the competitive edge we enjoy.\n  After the United States and our trading partners agreed to the \nAgreement on Agriculture, one of the Uruguay Round Agreements, it is \nmore difficult now to use quotas, tariffs, and subsidies to favor \ndomestic producers.\n  So fear is used instead.\n  Mr. President, it was a Democrat President, Franklin Roosevelt, who \nsaid, ``The only thing we have to fear is, fear itself.'' As far as \nbiotechnology is concerned, the only thing Europe, and now Japan, have \nto offer is fear. It's how the Europeans have protected their domestic \nagricultural markets from American competition for 30 years.\n  Just look at the comment by Germany's environment minister, Jurgen \nTritten, when the European Commission proposed a redrafting of the \nlegislation governing the admission of genetically modified products \ninto the EU. Just as they planned it, this new European Union \nlegislation has the effect of slowing the approval of new U.S. \ngenetically modified products in Europe to a trickle. The German \nminister was elected. He hailed this legislation as a ``de facto \nmoratorium.''\n  And if it's not the case that the Europeans, and now Japan, are using \nfear as a new trade barrier, why is it that these governments, and the \nantibiotechnology activists who are so worried about the impact of \ngenetically modified foods, seem completely unconcerned about \nbiotechnology in medicine? Is it because they really know that medical \nuses of biotechnology are completely safe?\n  I don't want to give the impression that all of this consumer fear \nhas been whipped up just to restrain trade. There is always legitimate \nconcern about new technology, especially in food.\n  But in my view, the unprecedented safety record of our food \nregulatory system completely eliminates this concern.\n  And it appears that Europe's governments have overplayed the extent \nof consumer concern. A recent poll of 16,000 Europeans by the European \nCommission's own Environment Directorate found that Europe's citizens \nare less concerned about GMOs than they are over other environmental \nissues. When asked to rank their chief environmental concerns on a list \nof nine issues, GMOs finished ninth, in last place.\n  There is also another dimension to this issue you don't hear the \nantibiotech activists talk about. That is the fact that we can now \nprove that biotechnology is the most powerful tool for good that our \nresearchers have ever had.\n  Right now, some 400 million people currently suffer from Vitamin A \ndeficiency, including millions of children who go blind every year. A \nnew genetically-enhanced form of rice containing beta-carotene, called \n``golden rice,'' will mean these children will not be cruelly robbed of \ntheir sight.\n  Another form of ``golden rice'' included genes to overcome the \nchronic iron deficiency suffered by 2 billion people in rice cultures. \nWomen have always been subject to extra risk from birth complications \nbecause of anemia.\n  What are the terrible risks in our food approval system that would \njustify blinding children, or subjecting Asian women to birth \ncomplications? The answer is simple: there are none. There is just the \npolities of fear.\n  Because biotechnology is such a great force for good, this must \nchange. What can we do about it? I don't have all the answers. But I do \nknow this. We have got to talk about finding a worldwide solution. And \nwe can only do that if the United States leads.\n\n  Right now, the Quad Countries--the United States, the European Union, \nJapan, and Canada--lack a coherent vision for how to address the \nbiotechnology issue. This is largely because the senior Quad partner, \nthe United States, has backed away from its traditional leadership role \nin shaping global trade policy. In fact, as a result of this \nadministration's lack of focus and vision, this is the first time in 50 \nyears that we have not succeeded in going forward with a new global \ntrade liberalization agenda.\n  As a result, the United States is reduced to agreeing to half-hearted \nideas put forward by the European Commission in Geneva, like a \n``consultative forum'' to look at biotech issues. Mr. President, I'm \nnot even sure what a ``consultative forum'' is, or what it is supposed \nto accomplish, but we have agreed to it.\n  Another sign of this administration's failure of leadership on trade \nis the fact that at Seattle, we refused to seek a comprehensive round, \nknowing this unreasonable posture would never be accepted by our \ntrading partners. In fact, the administration's refusal to negotiate a \ncomprehensive round was a complete reversal of United States policy \nthat successfully launched and completed the last round of global trade \nnegotiations, the Uruguay Round.\n  In 1986, our then United States Trade Representative, Clayton \nYeutter, said only a comprehensive round would result in the greatest \ngains for the United States. He was right. It did.\n  I have a high regard for Ambassador Rita Hayes and her team in \nGeneva. They are leading agriculture negotiations that started about \none month ago. But their hands are tied. They have to negotiate within \na very narrow framework because a political decision made months ago to \nlimit the scope of new global trade negotiations made it all but \ncertain that the talks in Seattle would not succeed.\n  This is certainly a far cry from the traditional, bold United States \ntrade agenda that has brought us such tremendous prosperity.\n  Right now, agriculture is struggling. Our farmers are struggling. Mr. \nPresident, I said a few moments ago that Europe and Japan are using \nfear in place of facts with regard to trade and biotechnology.\n  But we cannot counter fear with uncertainty. We cannot combat false \ninformation with confusion. And we cannot oppose political expediency \nin Europe with a lack of resolve at home.\n  There is a great debate going on about extraordinary new technology \nand trade that we must lead. that sort of focused international \nleadership can only come from the White House. Because America speaks \ndiplomatically only thru the Office of the President,\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nwe need an administration that understands that we must trade globally, \nso we can prosper locally.\n  I urge the administration in the strongest possible terms to rise to \nthis challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3180-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DEDICATION OF PORTRAIT OF JUDGE DAN M.

Mr. President, because of the way in which the Senate last \nweek ended its consideration of S.J. Res. 3, a proposed constitutional \namendment on crime victims' rights, I did not have an opportunity to \ninclude in the Record a number of thoughtful editorials from across the \ncountry. I now ask unanimous consent to have a number of them printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Asheville Citizen-Times, Apr. 25, 2000]\n\n                     Victims' Bill Seriously Flawed\n\n       Today, the United States Senate will vote on the joint \n     Senate Resolution proposing that a victims' rights amendment \n     be added to the U.S. Constitution. The amendment has been \n     endorsed by some 39 Attorneys General, by organizations such \n     as Racial Minorities for Victim Justice, as well as by the \n     presumptive Republican Presidential nominee Gov. George W. \n     Bush.\n       In effect, the amendment would offer victims the \n     constitutionally guaranteed right to:\n       Be notified of proceedings in the criminal case;\n       To attend public proceedings in the case;\n       To make a statement at release proceedings, sentencing and \n     proceedings regarding a plea bargain;\n       To have the court order the convicted offender to pay \n     restitution for the harm caused by the crime.\n       Some of these provisions may indeed restore some balance to \n     a system that leans heavily in favor of protecting criminals' \n     rights. Some of these provisions are already being enacted in \n     certain jurisdictions and in certain cases on behalf of \n     vitims--the right to be present at hearings and to make \n     statements for example.\n       Many prosecutors are opposing this amendment because of the \n     unintended effects it could have, and the public should \n     oppose it in light of many unanswered questions and concerns. \n     For example, should rival gang members be notified of pending \n     hearings and be invited to make statement against those \n     rivals? What of convicted violent felons who are themselves \n     victimized in prison--who are the true victims? Will \n     prosecutors be compelled to notify thousands of victims in \n     the case of a national telemarketing scam?\n       These are real questions that the Senate is grappling with. \n     Without real answers, they should vote ``No.'' We should not \n     tamper with the U.S. Constitution when a statute will suffice \n     in place of an amendment. That document is too important to \n     who are as Americans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 23, 2000]\n\n                       Distorting Victims' Rights\n\n       Senate vote: A constitutional amendment could actually harm \n     victims and rights of innocent.\n       It's an election year. You can tell by the flurry of votes \n     on proposed constitutional amendments in Congress this month. \n     The latest, set for the Senate this week, is perhaps the most \n     deceptive and dangerous--a victims' rights amendment.\n       On the surface it seems reasonable, similar to rights \n     adopted in 32 states. It would guarantee crime victims the \n     right to speak at parole, plea-bargain or sentencing \n     hearings, to be notified of an offender's release, to \n     restitution, and a speedy trial.\n       But wait a minute: Isn't the defendant the one who has a \n     constitutional right to a speedy trial? This amendment would \n     change all that: Victims would have rights equal to a \n     defendant.\n       That's just the start of the dangers. The amendment doesn't \n     define who's a victim. Parents? Ex-spouses? Cousins? \n     Boyfriends?\n       It would create a third party in trials intent on \n     retribution, even though the defendant may not have committed \n     the crime.\n       It would give victims the right to oppose plea bargains. \n     One of the lead lawyers in the Oklahoma City bombing case \n     says this would have made virtually impossible to convict \n     Timothy McVeigh.\n       Victims also would have the right to demand a speedy \n     trial--even if prosecutors say they need more time to build a \n     winnable case. And what happens if the ``victims'' disagree? \n     In the Oklahoma City case, there would have been thousands of \n     ``victims,'' many entitled to court-appointed lawyers.\n       This could lead to grotesque distortions. A battered wife \n     who strikes back and maims her husband could wind up paying \n     restitution to the ``victim.'' So could a shopkeeper who \n     shoots a robber--the ``victim'' becomes the robber.\n       We fear for the right to a fair trial. Crime victims' \n     prejudgement of the defendant clashes with the notion that \n     you're innocent until proven guilty.\n       Victims deserve certain rights. But not in the \n     Constitution. Why hasn't Congress passed federal laws to \n     assist them? It could be decades before a constitution-\n     cluttering amendment is approved.\n       This is the wrong approach. The proposal could damage our \n     court system and our fundamental rights.\n       We urge Senators Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes \n     to vote against this ill-conceived constitutional amendment--\n     and then commit to drawing up more clearly defined laws \n     giving crime victims a voice in court.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 20, 2000]\n\n         Criminal Act--The Folly of a Victim's Rights Amendment\n\n                           (By Steve Chapman)\n\n       Some conservatives love Mt. Rushmore so much that they want \n     to alter it, by adding Ronald Reagan. Likewise, many people \n     think the U.S. Constitution is not so flawless that it \n     couldn't be improved. Each group ignores the possibility that \n     its revisions may turn something that is nearly perfect into \n     something that is, well, not nearly perfect.\n       Recently, the Senate barely failed to approve a \n     constitutional amendment to eliminate the terrible national \n     scourge of flag-burning. Next week, it will vote on the \n     Victims' Rights Amendment, which is based on the odd notion \n     that the criminal justice system does too little for the \n     victims of crime.\n       In fact, the nation spends enormous sums every year for the \n     victims of crime. Legions of police, lawyers and judges labor \n     every day to find, prosecute and punish people who aggress \n     against their neighbors. We run the world's biggest \n     correctional system, with 1,500 facilities devoted to the \n     care and feeding of nearly 2 million inmates--and that's not \n     counting more than 3 million lawbreakers on parole or \n     probation. All of this is partly for the protection of \n     everyone, but it's also an affirmation of our concern for \n     crime victims.\n       So what oversight is the amendment supposed to address? \n     Some victims feel their interests are not considered and \n     their voices are not heard when criminal justice decisions \n     are made. Asserts the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``The \n     victims of crime have been transformed into a group \n     oppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them.'' \n     Its remedy is to give victims of violent crimes the \n     constitutional right to attend all proceedings, to make their \n     views known about sentencing and plea arrangements, to be \n     notified of an offender's impending release, to insist on a \n     speedy trial and to get restitution from the victimizer.\n       But the claim of oppression is a vast exaggeration. In a \n     country with 8 million violent crimes committed every year, \n     the justice system is bound to cause some victims to feel \n     dissatisfied and even angry. If 95 percent get satisfactory \n     treatment, that leaves hundreds of thousands of people a year \n     who are shortchanged.\n       Some of the supposed mistreatment stems not from \n     callousness, but from efforts to provide the accused a fair \n     trial. Amendment supporters want victims to be able to attend \n     trials from start to finish, just as defendants do. But the \n     only time they are barred is before they testify--to minimize \n     the chance that they will (intentionally or not) tailor their \n     testimony to match that of other witnesses.\n       The unassailable reason for the rule is that it improves \n     the chances of finding the truth. This is not a favor just to \n     suspects: A crime victim gains nothing if the courts punish \n     the wrong person and let the guilty party go free.\n       Keeping victims informed about the proceedings, and letting \n     them attend, could create huge problems in some cases. Take \n     the Columbine High School massacre, where two \n     students murdered 13 people and wounded 23 others before \n     committing suicide.\n       Suppose Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had lived to stand \n     trial. Who would be entitled to attend and comment on any \n     proposed plea bargain? The families of the 36 dead and \n     wounded? The families of all the students who witnessed any \n     of the shootings? The families of all Columbine students? \n     Your\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\n     guess is as good as the Senate's: The Victims' Rights \n     Amendment doesn't bother defining the term ``victim.''\n       The wider the net, the bigger the logistical challenge. \n     Just notifying all these people of every proceeding, from the \n     time a suspect is arrested until the time he's released from \n     prison years or decades later, would be hard enough. Making \n     room for them in court might mean holding the trial in a \n     large auditorium. Letting each one speak would not exactly \n     advance the goal of speedy justice.\n       There is nothing to stop the states from mandating \n     consideration of crime victims. In fact, all 50 states have \n     done that. As former Reagan Justice Department official Bruce \n     Fein testified at a recent House hearing, ``Nothing in the \n     Constitution or in U.S. Supreme Court precedents handcuffs \n     either Congress or the states in fashioning victims' rights \n     statutes.''\n       The advantage of helping victims by these means is that we \n     can experiment to find solutions that are sensible and \n     affordable and abandon those that are not. But a \n     constitutional amendment would transfer the power to courts \n     to enforce these new rights, without much regard for \n     practicality or proportion.\n       It would amount to giving unelected federal judges \n     instructions to do good and a blank check with which to do \n     it. Only years later would we find out whether the benefits \n     would be worth the cost and by that time, it would be very \n     hard to change our minds.\n       The Victims' Rights Amendment is not likely to do much for \n     crime victims that can't be done by other means. But by \n     creating a new constitutional demand of unknown dimensions, \n     it threatens to make victims of us all.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Collegiate Times, Apr. 25, 2000]\n\n              Victims' Rights Bill Violates Others' Rights\n\n       Although the victims' rights amendment, set to receive \n     Senate vote at the end of the month, sounds like it has all \n     the makings of noble piece of legislation, its true colors \n     shine through as potentially endangering to the rights of the \n     accused.\n       The bill finds bipartisan support, primarily bolstered by \n     the efforts of Senators Jon Kyl (R-Arizona) and Dianne \n     Feinstein (D-California.)\n       The measure would provide victims with the right to \n     notification of public proceedings, which emerge from the \n     alleged offense against them.\n       In addition, it provides the right of presence at hearings \n     and capacity to testify when the topics of parole, plea-\n     bargaining or sentencing are concerned. Further, victims \n     would be privileged with orders of restitution and attention \n     to their interests in the initiative of speedy trials \n     (Washington Post, April 24).\n       On a state level, many of these provisions already exist.\n       But does the Constitution, the ultimate framework of our \n     nation's concept of justice, deserve this slap in the face \n     legislation?\n       Certainly, when anything is under consideration of \n     amendment to the Constitution, a thorough analysis should \n     occur to both ensure the delicate balance of the Constitution \n     between the accused and the accuser remains intact and that \n     justice remains the focus at all times.\n       Upon examination, this measure is exposed as a travesty to \n     both. Any right the accused has under the Constitution would \n     be grossly usurped by the passing of this bill into law.\n       For example, a defendant's constitutional right to a fair \n     trial would rest on the victim's concern in pursuing justice \n     swiftly for their own sake. Another ramification of this bill \n     includes the inevitability of prosecutorial hold ups.\n       By integrating the emotional response of victims into the \n     proceedings of plea-bargaining and sentencing where \n     prosecution once exercised discretion as given to them by \n     law, fairness in sentencing and swiftness in sentencing seem \n     harder to come by.\n       On the most basic of levels, the sheer label of victim \n     conflicts with the very sentiment for which the Constitution \n     stands.\n       The use of the word victim violates the premise of \n     innocence until guilt has been proven in a court of law. By \n     labeling the accuser as a victim, guilt has been assigned to \n     the accused.\n       It prematurely uses terminology that assesses a situation \n     in light of allegations rather than legally submitted \n     evidence.\n       The rights of all victims remain preserved in the \n     Constitution.\n       The fact that courts are fully prepared to issue a denial \n     of all freedoms to the accused, should they be found guilty, \n     guarantees, on the behalf of victims as well as society at \n     large, justice will be served.\n       Justice will be served by the end processes and not \n     prematurely.\n       For this reason, the interests of victims are under \n     constant consideration. This piece of legislation threatens \n     to disrupt the balance the Constitution maintains and tip the \n     scale in favor of victims.\n       This bill, should it be made into law, promises an \n     undemocratic approach to dealing with the accused in a manner \n     which jeopardizes their rights and liberties.\n       The court system pursues prosecution on behalf of victims.\n       To undermine these efforts in the name of victims' rights \n     seems the most forthright ruin of what the Constitution truly \n     intended as safeguards for the accused as well as the \n     accuser.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Herald, Everett, WA, Apr. 19, 2000]\n\n            Amendment to Aid Victims Could Cause More Damage\n\n       The U.S. Senate is nearing a vote on a constitutional \n     amendment that seeks to enact a good idea. Like many fine \n     concepts, however, the proposed victims' rights amendment \n     could cause enormous trouble. The Senate has been looking at \n     the proposal seriously since last year. Good arguments have \n     been made on both sides of the amendment, which has \n     bipartisan sponsorship from Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and \n     Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\n       As amendment supporters argue, the level of crime in \n     American society should cause us to look more carefully at \n     protecting the rights of victims and their families. Too many \n     court decisions have protected criminals' rights without a \n     corresponding development of the law to assure victims' \n     interests are respected. Indeed, the whole area of \n     prosecution has changed so much in the past 200 years that an \n     amendment could be a reasonable addition to the Constitution. \n     When the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, for \n     instance, it was common for victims themselves to bring a \n     criminal case.\n       Still, a constitutional amendment ought to be a matter of \n     last resort. The amendment simply fails to meet that \n     elemental test. In fact, portions of what the amendment seeks \n     to ensure are already required in existing federal law.\n       Unfortunantely, members of Congress have failed to provide \n     the appropriations necessary to ensure that victims are \n     notified of hearings and to make sure that prosecutors have \n     the time and resources to be in regular contact with them. An \n     amendment to the Constitution requiring such actions would do \n     little to remedy such neglect. Indeed, unless followed by \n     better funding, the amendment might put even more strain on \n     prosecutors' time and budgets, making them more reluctant to \n     take on difficult cases. That would work decidedly in the \n     favor of criminals, not society.\n       Many prosecutors and victims' groups have concerns about \n     the potential for unintended harm from the amendment. Their \n     arguments make enormous sense. During the past two decades, \n     America has begun to address its crime problem more \n     seriously. From local offices to the federal government, \n     prosecutors and lawmakers are doing better in addressing the \n     needs of victims and society. The step-by-step approach is \n     showing results in reduced crime. Methodical, painstaking \n     improvements should be strengthened, rather than being \n     shunted aside in favor of a constitutional amendment that, at \n     best, promises more than it would deliver.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3181-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3181-S3182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY 2000\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Friday, April 28, 2000, we remembered \nand honored the sacrifices of the men and women across the years who \nhave lost their lives on the job. We also marked the 30th anniversary \nof the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which has done so much to \nreduce such casualties by improving conditions in the workplace for \nemployees across the country. On this day, we renewed our commitment to \nfair and safe working conditions for every American.\n  The progress that we have made over the past 30 years is remarkable. \nIn 1970, the year the Occupational Safety and Health Act was signed \ninto law, 13,800 workers died on the job. Since then, workplace \nfatality rates have fallen by 74 percent. Over 200,000 lives have been \nsaved. Injury rates have fallen by more than a third.\n  In observance of this important day, we must also remember the lives \nand the families that have been irrevocably changed by workplace \ninjuries and illnesses. Despite the progress, 154 people still lose \ntheir lives on the job on the average day. Last year in Massachusetts, \n91 workers died on the job--more than double the number in 1998. \nCurrently, it is estimated that 1,000 deaths a year result from work-\nrelated illnesses, and 1,200 workers a year are diagnosed with cancer \ncaused by their jobs. Clearly, those high numbers are unacceptable.\n  As the global economy continues to expand and change the new \nworkplace, new challenges are created for ensuring adequate safety \nprotections. The modern workplace is being restructured by downsizing \nstaff, larger output quotas, mandatory overtime, and job consolidation. \nThis restructuring creates new pressures on workers to be more \nproductive in the name of efficiency and competitiveness. New \ntechnologies in the workplace make it easier to do jobs faster, but \nthey pose new hazards as well.\n  For ten years, workers have been struggling to achieve a workplace \nfree from ergonomic injuries and illnesses. Since 1990, Secretary of \nLabor Elizabeth Dole announced the Department\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nof Labor's commitment to issuing an ergonomics standard, more than 6 \nmillion workers have suffered serious job injuries from these hazards. \nEach year, 650,000 workers lose a day or more of work because of \nergonomic injuries, costing businesses $15-20 billion per year.\n  Ursula Stafford, 24 years old, worked as a paraprofessional for the \nNew York City school district. She was injured assisting a 250-pound \nwheelchair-bound student. She received no training on how to lift the \nstudent, nor did her employer provide any lifting equipment. After two \ndays on the job, she suffered a herniated disc and spasms in her neck. \nAs a result of her injuries, her doctor told her that she may not be \nable to have children, because her back may not be able to support the \nweight.\n  Charley Richardson, a shipfitter at General Dynamics in Quincy, \nMassachusetts, sustained a career-ending back injury when he was \nordered to install a 75-pound piece of steel to reinforce a deck. \nAlthough he continued to try to work, he found that on many days, he \ncould not endure the pain of lifting and using heavy tools. For years \nafterwards, his injury prevented him from participating in basic \nactivities. The loss that hurt Charley the most was having to tell his \ngrandchildren they could not sit on his lap for more than a couple of \nminutes, because it was too painful. To this day, he cannot sit for \nlong without pain.\n  OSHA has proposed an ergonomics standard to protect workers from \nthese debilitating injuries. Yet in spite of the costs to employers and \nto workers and their families, industry has launched an all-out, no-\nholds-barred effort to prevent OSHA from issuing this important \nstandard. A stronger standard would go a long way to reducing this \nleading cause of injury.\n  Ergonomics programs have been shown to make a difference in reducing \nthe number of injuries that occur on the job. Johns Hopkins University \ninitiated a program which significantly reduced the rate of such \ninjuries by 80 percent over seven years. A poultry processor's program \nlowered the incidence of workers' compensation claims by 20 percent. A \nprogram by Intel Corporation produced a savings of more than $10 \nmillion.\n  Hopefully, after this long battle, a national ergonomics standard \nwill finally be put in place this year. If so, it will be the most \nsignificant workplace safety protection in the 30 years since OSHA \nbecame law. The ergonomic standard will be a landmark achievement in \nimproving safety and health for all workers in America. May this \nWorkers Memorial Day serve as a monument to the progress we are making, \nand as a constant reminder of our obligation to do more, much more, to \nachieve the great goal we share.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3182-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The \nprogram is designed to help further educate and discipline teens in \novercoming drug and behavioral problems. Mr. Sagen Woolery is being \nhonored for volunteering his time and creating ``The Kid's Kitchen,'' a \nsoup kitchen for needy children and their families which is fully \noperated by kids between the ages of 8-12.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are \nless involved in their communities than they once were, it is vital \nthat we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these \nyoung people have made. People of all ages need to think more about how \nwe, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to \nensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young \nvolunteers like Ms. Ruffin and Mr. Woolery are inspiring examples to \nall of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  Ms. Ruffin and Mr. Woolery should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of \ntheir recognition, they will come to Washington in early May, along \nwith other 2000 Spirit of Community Honorees from across the country, \nfor several days of special events, including a congressional breakfast \nreception on Capitol Hill.\n  I heartily applaud Ms. Ruffin and Mr. Woolery for their initiative in \nseeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the \npositive impact they have had on the lives of others.\n  In addition, I also salute other young people in Georgia who were \nnamed Distinguished Finalists by the Prudential Spirit of Community \nAwards for their outstanding volunteer service.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the great \npeople of Goreville, IL, during their centennial celebration. Although \nGoreville was not officially incorporated until 1900, it has been a \nbusy settlement since before the Civil War. A post office was \nestablished as early as 1886, after the Gore family migrated from \nGeorgia to settle on the land they had purchased from the government in \n1854. When the Civil War broke out, General John A. Logan visited the \ncommunity to recruit volunteers for his 31st Illinois Volunteer \nInfantry, which rendezvoused at Camp Dunlap in Jacksonville, IL, before \nmoving on to Fort Defiance in Cairo, IL.\n  When the Chicago and Eastern Illinois railroad went through Johnson \nCounty in 1889, the village moved its businesses down the road. This \nflexibility proved beneficial to Goreville as the small village \nprospered.\n  In April 1900, the village was incorporated, and was formally \nrecognized by the State of Illinois in a small ceremony on July 5, \n1900. While Goreville's population has never been extremely large, it \nhas gradually grown to 900 people. Goreville is nestled next to Ferne \nClyffe State Park. In 1923, the State Park was declared ``the most \nbeautiful spot in Illinois.''\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\n  The week of May 7-13 has been designated as the Goreville Centennial \nCelebration.

Mr. President, the true spirit of Americanism \ncannot truly be captured in the pages of history. It is not found in \nour vast acquired lands, nor is it printed in our two-century-old \nConstitution. Americanism is felt and entrenched deep in our soul. It \nis the goose bumps we get when hearing the Star Spangled Banner and the \nemotional chills that run through our veins when witnessing the \nchanging of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The undying \npassion and loyalty we have for our nation is Americanism.\n  John Adams understood this loyal, patriotic, American spirit when he \nwrote, ``Our obligations to our country never cease but with our \nlives.'' In fulfillment of that obligation, many lives have been \nsacrificed to guarantee our liberties for ourselves and our posterity. \nThe loyalty and devotion demonstrated by the veterans of our Armed \nForces must never be forgotten or discounted.\n  Every year on May 1, our country takes the opportunity to celebrate \nthat passionate allegiance and pay tribute to those before us who \nunselfishly ensured the continued success of America and strength of \nour democracy. Thanks to the efforts of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nCongress mandated in 1958 that May 1 of each year shall be recognized \nas ``Loyalty Day.'' Across the nation, VFW posts express their \nsteadfast commitment by sponsoring parades, hosting banquets and \nreplacing worn flags in their communities.\n  While Loyalty Day is an occasion to reminisce about past \nachievements, we should also take this opportunity to focus on our \nfuture. As history has repeatedly shown, challenges to our ideals of \ndemocracy are imminent. Each previous generation has shown valor in \nrising to face those challenges. Now the continued success of our \nnation relies on instilling in our young people an ardent appreciation \nfor our American ideals, so they may be prepared to face future \nobstacles.\n  Each of us in our own unique way can show our commitment to the \nideals upon which this nation was founded. Whether flying the flag, \nvisiting a monument, teaching a child the Pledge of Allegiance or \nsimply thanking a veteran, I ask that you join me today in celebrating \nLoyalty Day. I encourage everyone to discover the passion of our \nforefathers and experience the pride of true Americanism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3183-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MARIE CASCONE ROTUNDA\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

She has tirelessly given of herself \nthrough her dedication to many noble and charitable causes. She has \nserved with the International Special Olympics, taken it upon herself \nto create an emergency food pantry in the Township of Lawrence and for \nthe past several years, she has focused much of her effort in \nsupporting the Sunshine Foundation, which helps chronically and \nterminally ill children realize their dreams and fulfill their wishes. \nFurthermore she has spearheaded fund raising efforts that have raised \nover $2 million for charitable causes in her community.\n  The Trenton community is truly fortunate to have been graced by such \na talented and caring person.

Mr. President, today I honor a man who spent 48 \nyears of his life serving the public as an elected official for the \nState of Colorado. A man who served 2 years as the president of \nColorado's 35th school district, 6 years as a board member of the town \nof Palisade, 6 years as a member of the Colorado House of \nRepresentatives, 2 of those as House Speaker, 10 years as a Colorado \nState Senator where he was both the Majority and Minority Leader, and \n24 years as a member of the U.S. House of Representative where he was \nthe Chairman of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. I am \nreferring to the late Congressman Wayne N. Aspinall from the small \npeach and winery town of Palisade, CO.\n  Let me talk about Wayne Aspinall's time in the U.S. Congress. In \n1956, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Irrigation and Reclamation, he \ncreated the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 which authorized \nGlen Canyon, Flaming Gorge, Navajo and Curecanti Reservoirs, plus \nseveral smaller projects authorized for construction and others \ndesignated for study. The act was signed into law by President \nEisenhower on April 11, 1956.\n  In 1959, he became Chairman of the U.S. House Interior and Insular \nAffairs Committee. The ensuing 14 years of his leadership was viewed by \nmany as the most productive in history in terms of new water projects, \nnational parks authorized, wilderness designated, redwoods protected, \nthe States of Alaska and Hawaii were admitted to the Union, and so much \nmore.\n  This remarkable Congressman's accomplishments continued. In 1964, he \nlead the way to the Wilderness Act, which became law September 3rd and \ndesignated 9.1 million acres of wilderness and set aside more for \nstudy. At the same time, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was \nestablished primarily for parks acquisition.\n  Then, in 1968, he created the Colorado River Basin Development Act, \nsigned into law by President Johnson on September 30, which balanced \ndevelopment in the basin. On October 2nd of the same year, his bill was \nsigned protecting 58,000 acres of California redwoods and the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund was further enhanced.\n  Finally, he returned to his hometown of Palisade, CO in 1973 to live \nin a new home over the Colorado River which his life's work had done so \nmuch to preserve as a valuable resource for the entire western United \nStates. He died October 9, 1983.\n  Now the citizens in his hometown plan to honor his memory with a one-\nand-half times life-size bronze sculpture by noted North Carolina \nartist Thomas Jay Warren. The statue will be the central feature of a \nMemorial which will include the representation of a dam and river. \nSeveral adjacent Memory Walls will be inscribed with the major \nachievements of the man known affectionately today in Colorado as ``Mr. \nChairman.''

Aspinall Memorial created it as an \neducational one, designed as much to teach students and others of the \nimportance of sound water conservation, good government, and the \nhistory of water in the West as a record of the Chairman's stellar \naccomplishments.\n  The $165,000 Memorial will sit in the southeast quadrant of what is \nnow known as Palisade Park, on a bluff above the Colorado River about \n50 yards from the home to which he had retired.\n  I commend the people of Palisade and other Coloradans for their \neffort to honor a man who served the great State of Colorado and our \nNation with such distinction. I am proud to say that I knew him as a \nyoung man. My father, Amos Allard, was chairman of his congressional \ndistrict. My family is proud of the affiliation with the Wayne Aspinall \nfamily and count ourselves among his many supporters. I urge all of who \ncan do so to support this project financially.\n  Mr. President I ask that a list of Commission members and a copy of \nColorado House Joint Resolution 00-1030 concerning support for the\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\nAspinall Memorial Commission be printed in the Record.\n\n                  Aspinall Memorial Commission Members\n\n       Tilman N.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Joseph \nNastasi, who has been an advocate for the seniors of Monroe, Louisiana, \nfor 18 years as executive director of the Ouachita Parish Council on \nAging.\n  A veteran of World War II, and the wars in Korea and Vietnam, Joe \nhonorably served his country in the Marine Corps from 1943 until he \nretired in 1979. After his long and distinguished service, Joe shifted \nhis focus to serving older Louisianians as he began work with the \nOuachita Council on Aging in 1982.\n  Under his leadership, the Ouachita Council on Aging has significantly \nincreased its senior services. Eighteen years ago, daily meals were \ndelivered to 80 seniors. Today, that number has expanded to \napproximately 500. And, in large part to Joe's efforts to enhance \nsenior transportation, more seniors in Ouachita Parish now have access \nto essential services such as heart and cancer centers.\n  In addition to his work with the Council on Aging, Joe has also \nserved as President of the Louisiana Council on Aging Directors \nAssociation, on the boards of the Louisiana Public Transportation \nAssociation and Louisiana State University Monroe Medical Center, and \nas a member of the Louisiana Elderly Health Care Council.\n  As ranking Democrat of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I can \ntell you that Joe has been an invaluable resource to me and my Aging \nCommittee staff. Last November, he testified at an Aging Committee \nfield hearing in Monroe and provided excellent insight into the \nchallenges faced by family caregivers. Joe's experience and insight \nhave enriched our work time and again.\n  After many years of loyal service, Joe recently retired from the \nOuachita Council on Aging. I want to thank him for his hard work and \ndedication, and wish him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3184-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3184-S3185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNITION OF DAVID FORRESTER OF THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES CENTER\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to share with you an \nexample of how local educators are using the innovations in the high \ntech field to improve our children's education. David Forrester, \nfounder and director of the Learning Opportunities Center in Tumwater, \nWashington, has created a program that gives students with unique needs \nthe opportunity to work at their own pace in an environment that \nteaches them new skills and encourages them to excel. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to acknowledge Mr. Forrester's outstanding work \nand give him my next Innovation in Education Award.\n  David Forrester is the mastermind behind the Learning Opportunities \nCenter which has grown over the last six years and now supports 150 \nstudents ages 9 to 21 from high schools in nearly ten separate school \ndistricts. The Center supports students from extremely rural areas or \nwho have struggled in the traditional education system. Through this \ncenter, students succeed and take courses in English, Math, and Science \nthrough a computer system specifically created for their needs.\n  With the help of grant money, Mr. Forrester has designed software \nwhich he has named Pathware. Pathware allows him to manage a large \nscope of curriculum and organize it to fit each student's needs. In \nessence, each student has their own personalized program that can help \nthem work at their own level and pace in multiple subject areas, \nallowing him to maintain one-on-one relationships with his students.\n  Pat Cusack, the Coordinator of the School to Work program at the New \nMarket Vocational Skills Center considers David Forrester to have, \n``He's a man with a big heart who puts kids first with tireless energy \nand tremendous vision.''\n  Shaun Rohr, a student of Mr. Forrester, has told me that because of \nthe Learning Opportunities Center and Mr. Forrester's motivation, he \nhas been offered a job in web-page design. Shaun says, ``Mr. Forrester \nis always there to help, and shows you different ways to approach a \nproblem. At first I was not ready to learn web-page design, but Mr. \nForrester kept asking me and showed me how. Without his belief in me \nand his patience with me, I probably would not have learned.''\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\n  I applaud the dedication and hard work of Mr. Forrester who has found \nnew and creative ways to serve the needs of his students and I am proud \nto recognize his contributions and his persistence in carrying out his \nvision. By creating so many new options for children, Mr. Forrester is \ngiving back to local schools and setting a wonderful example for those \naround him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3185-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    WOODBRIDGE HIGH STUDENTS SELECTED AS FINALISTS IN CIVICS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \ncongratulate 15 students and their teacher, Ms. Barbara Hudson, from \nWoodbridge High School in Bridgeville, DE, for their outstanding \nachievement in qualifying as finalists of the ``We the People . . . The \nCitizen and the Consitiution'' program.\n  This program is administered by the Center for Civic Education which \nprovides curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high \nschool levels for more than 26.5 million students nationwide. These \nmaterials assist students in obtaining a working knowledge of our \nConstitution, Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic \ngovernment.\n  Next, ``We the People'' conducts a 3-day competition which tests a \nstudent's knowledge of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. A mock \nCongressional committee hearing is conducted in which the students \ntestify and then respond to questions on Constitutional issues before a \npanel of judges.\n  This demanding competition takes hard work and diligence to reach the \nnational finals, which are being held in Washington, D.C. from May 6 to \nMay 8, 2000. I am pleased to congratulate those students from \nWoodbridge High School who will be participating in the final stage of \nthis competition: Jennifer Blackwell, Steve Breeding, Jarelle Bruso, \nJohn Conner, Rachel Dawson, Shawnita Dorman, Chelsea Ferrell, Adam \nHickman, Jerome Holder, Nick LaRusso, Kat Leiter, Jennifer Sheets, \nLatoya Thompson, Robert Tribbett, and Jessica Umstetter. Together with \nthe help of their teacher, Ms. Hudson, they successfully learned and \napplied a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy. Their knowledge \nwill be tested yet again during the national finals, where they will \ncompete with more than 1,200 students from throughout the United \nStates.\n  It is exciting to see these young people from Delaware and so many \nother students from across the Nation expressing interest in our \ncountry's Government. Programs such as ``We the People'' help to \ninspire new generations of leaders. These students from Woodbridge High \nSchool are shining examples of the promise bright young people offer \nthe future of this country.\n  It is my honor to recognize these students who represent excellence \nin Delaware scholastics, and I am sure that my fellow Delawareans join \nme in wishing these young ``Constitutional experts'' the best of luck \nduring the upcoming competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3185-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A TRIBUTE TO NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I proudly rise today in recognition \nof National Science and Technology Week. Since 1985, the National \nScience Foundation has used this opportunity to celebrate and bring \nawareness to the scientific and technological wonders that encompass \nour lives.\n  American spirit and determination have created advancements our \nsociety could not have imagined a mere 50 years ago. As the world \nembraces the new information age, our quality of life has been the \nbenefactor. Telecommunications and the Internet have brought billions \nof people together, while biotechnology research gives hope to solving \nmany of our world's medical mysteries. Environmental technology allows \nincreased sustainability of our precious natural resources and space \nsciences open up new and exciting worlds.\n  Science, education, and community organizations all over the U.S. are \nparticipating in National Science and Technology Week. Clearly, \npromoting the awareness of science and technology to the public \nbenefits everyone. In particular, piquing the interest of children has \nbeen proven to instill a lifetime of learning. The importance of a \nstrong scientific education is indisputable, for the skills we learn as \nchildren prove invaluable on a daily basis in adult life. Here in \nCongress, the legislative process utilizes scientific reasoning methods \nto pinpoint problems, research solutions, experiment, and choose the \nbest course of action.\n  I am proud of my efforts during the 106th Congress to secure $5 \nmillion in funding for improvements to the Minnesota Valley National \nWildlife Refuge and National Park Services operations in the new \nScience Museum of Minnesota. Our state-of-the-art museum allows all \nMinnesotans the opportunity to experience wonders of science ranging \nfrom a face-to-face encounter with a polar bear to navigating a virtual \ntowboat down the Mississippi River. I encourage all our citizens to \nplan a visit soon.\n  As National Science and Technology Week activities are conducted \nacross the country, it is my hope that all Americans reflect on the \nsignificance of science and technology in our society. In science, as \nin all of life, the only barriers we cannot overcome are those we do \nnot attempt. Please join me this week in celebrating our achievements \nand potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3185-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3185-S3186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE LAST CLASS IN BUTTE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in a recent article in the New York \nTimes, Nicholas Kristof, a reporter, posed the question why this \ncountry should care about the fate of family-based agriculture in this \ncountry.\n  Many people are asking that question today. For part of the answer, I \nsuggest they read a short essay by Elizabeth Haugen, a high school \nsenior in Butte, North Dakota, a town of 129 people in the central \nportion of my state.\n  Elizabeth has grown up on a family farm. As her grandmother put it, \nshe ``helps with the cows, drives truck, cleans granaries, and \nmaintains an A+ grade average.'' She sings in the State Choir and \ncompetes in statewide speech contests.\n  Elizabeth is a member of the last graduating class in Butte Public \nSchool--one of two seniors. After she leaves the school will close. The \nschool will not close because it has failed. It has been a success, and \nButte too has been a success. For generations, the school, and the \ntown, have produced the kind of traditional community values that we \nhear so much about in this Chamber and that this Nation desperately \nneeds.\n  The Butte Public School will close because family farms are failing, \nand family-based agriculture is the economic base of Butte--as it is \nfor thousands of small communities like it across America.\n  This is not rural romanticism of Jeffersonian nostalgia. It is real. \nIf we want the kind of traditional values in this country that people \nhere in Washington preach so much about, then we have got to show some \nconcern for the kinds of economic arrangements that promote those \nvalues--including the family farm.\n  Family based agriculture is not failing in this country because it is \nunproductive or inefficient. It is failing because it cannot survive in \na marketplace in which big grain companies, food processors and the \nrest are permitted to stomp on family farmers with impunity. It cannot \nsurvive when the federal government favors these corporate interests at \nevery turn.\n  To begin to understand why we need to act, I commend this essay by \nElizabeth Haugen to my colleagues. ``The little town of Butte, North \nDakota is the positive evidence that the small, trustworthy, and simple \nlifestyle still exists,'' she writes. How would we replace those \nvalues, once they are lost?\n  I include for the Record a copy of the essay.\n  The essay follows:\n\n                     The Little World All By Itself\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Haugen)\n\n       We live in a world of advanced technology, increasing \n     violence, and the rush of people running through their lives \n     in an attempt to conquer their busy schedules. What has \n     happened to the silence? The beautiful grazing land? The \n     simple pleasures of life? It once was all people knew. Let's \n     dig deep. This lifestyle has been preserved somewhere.\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\n       I've grown up on a farm with the closest neighbor one and a \n     half miles down the road. I have attended a public school \n     that has endured a startling decrease in the student body of \n     100 to 34 students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. I \n     ask myself if I have been sheltered and deprived--or \n     fortunately been forced to dig into the soil where I've found \n     what really matters?\n       Butte, North Dakota. It has a population of a dwindling \n     number of 129 people, but it is a place of great happiness \n     and memories for many. Art Meller, 93 years young has never \n     lived anywhere else. He remembers when the old people used to \n     call Butte, ``the little world all by itself.'' Butte was \n     founded as Dogden in 1906. Since then the cornerstone, and \n     the town's greatest asset, has been the school.\n       I'll never forget that first day of kindergarten when I \n     walked into school and met my nine classmates. Now, I will \n     finish my senior high school with only one classmate. We are \n     excited for the typical reasons just like any other senior, \n     but there is something that is unique about our class. Not \n     only are we the only two seniors, but also we will be the \n     last graduating class of Butte Public School. The cornerstone \n     of Butte will be closing its doors. ``It's sad to see Butte \n     School end because when the school closes, the town closes,'' \n     said Matthew, one of seven juniors. It is sad, and everyday \n     as I drive down Main Street, the only paved street in town, I \n     gaze at the sights--the Cafe, the grocery store, the Farmer's \n     Union, and the small town bar--that have given me hope.\n       On a normal day I hear the sounds of wind blowing, children \n     playing outside, and the murmur of people talking. It's not \n     the sounds of loud sirens, or construction machinery, or \n     traffic jams. It is simply, for the most part, a safe and \n     comforting environment--``the little world all by itself.'' \n     People living only an hour away haven't heard, or even know \n     that a town named Butte, North Dakota exists.\n       Every morning I drive down the four blocks of Main Street \n     to school, and every morning I slow down as two elderly women \n     cross the street. They are on their daily walk to the Butte \n     Post Office and then to the Cafe for a cup of coffee. Oh, and \n     don't forget the small town gossip. It's the chatter of \n     figuring out all 129 people's lives in Butte. When the town \n     is so small, shouldn't everybody know everything? It's a \n     different life, ``the little world all by itself.''\n       As I walk in the school doors there are no metal detectors, \n     no locks on lockers, just the smiles and solemn faces of the \n     small student body ready to put in another day at Butte \n     school, knowing that there won't be many more at Butte. We \n     aren't about violence or competition. Students have developed \n     cherished friendships. We are proof that school isn't all \n     crime and violence. It isn't a scary place. The wonder of \n     ``will a bomb blow up today?'' isn't a thought. It's a place \n     where every student shares the common bond of simple \n     pleasures: seeing deer running in the open country, or not \n     having to worry about locking the doors or turning on the \n     alarm system. Everybody has gone outside at night and been \n     able to enjoy the bright, shining stars.\n       The little town of Butte, North Dakota is the positive \n     evidence that the small, trustworthy, and simple lifestyle \n     has been dug up and still exists. Don't lose heart. Pick up \n     your shovel and start digging deep.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3186-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SHITAMA MANZO SENSEI AND TAKAKI MASANORI SENSEI\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

It is dedicated to the ethical and physical \nprinciples that compose the martial arts of Jujutsu and Judo and was \none of the first martial arts schools in Japan to teach the United \nStates Military Jujutsu and Judo.\n  Shitama Manzo Sensei and Takaki Masanori have given much of their \ntime and energy working for the betterment of others.

Mr. President, on Sunday, the anniversary of the \nfall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam conflict, the Washington Post \ncarried on its Op-Ed page a thoughtful, healing reflection on those \nevents by Senator Kerrey entitled, ``Was It Worth It?'' A hero--and \ncasualty--of that conflict, the only Member of Congress ever to have \nreceived the Congressional Medal of Honor, he might understandably have \nturned his attention to those who did not think so and did not serve. \nInstead he allowed that for a period he had shared the same doubts, but \nhad overcome them. As he contemplates the human destruction done by the \ndictatorship that followed, he concludes: ``I believe the cause was \njust and the sacrifice not in vain.'' He is now, as he was then, a \nperson of limitless courage.\n  I ask that his article be included in the Record.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 30, 2000]\n\n                            Was It Worth It?\n\n                            (By Bob Kerrey)\n\n       The most difficult war of the last century was not Vietnam; \n     it was World War I. In 1943, the year I was born, veterans of \n     the Great War Were remembering the 25th anniversary of their \n     armistice while their sons were fighting in Italy and the \n     Pacific against enemies whose military strength was ignored \n     on account of the bitter memories of the failures of the \n     First World War.\n       So, as I remember April 30, 1975, I will also remember Nov. \n     11, 1918, and what happened when America isolated itself from \n     the world. But I will also remember the pride I felt when I \n     sat in joint sessions of Congress listening to Vaclav Havel, \n     Kim Dae Jung, Lech Walesa and Nelson Mandela thank Americans \n     for the sacrifices they made on behalf of their freedom.\n       The famous photo of South Vietnamese ascending a stairway \n     to a helicopter on the roof of our Saigon embassy represents \n     both our shame and our honor. The shame is that we, in the \n     end, turned our back on Vietnam and on the sacrifice of more \n     than 58,000 Americans. We succumbed to fatigue and self-\n     doubt, we went back on the promise we had made to support the \n     South Vietnamese, and the Communists were able to defeat our \n     allies. The honor is that during the fall of Saigon, we \n     rescued tens of thousands of our South Vietnamese friends, \n     and in the years that followed we welcomed more than a \n     million additional Vietnamese to our shores.\n       For a young, college-educated son of the optimistic \n     American heartland, the war taught some valuable lessons. My \n     trip to Vietnam gave me a sense of the immense size and \n     variety of our world. I was also awed by something that still \n     moves me: that Americans would risk their lives for the \n     freedom of another people. At the Philadelphia Naval Hospital \n     I learned that everyone needs America's generosity--even me.\n       During the war, I knew the fight for freedom was the core \n     reason for our being in Vietnam. But after the war, as I \n     learned more about our government's decisionmaking in the war \n     years, I became angry. I was angry at the failure of our \n     leaders to tell the truth about what was happening in \n     Vietnam. I was angry at their ignorance about the motives of \n     our North Vietnamese adversaries and the history of Vietnam.\n       Our leaders didn't seem to understand the depth of \n     commitment of our adversaries to creating their version of an \n     independent Vietnam. I particularly detested President Nixon \n     for his duplicity in campaigning on a promise to end the war \n     and then, once in office, broadening the war to Cambodia. But \n     time has taught me the sterility of anger. So, as I recently \n     told former secretary of defense Robert S. McNamara, I \n     forgive our leaders of the Vietnam period.\n       I am able to forgive, not out of any great generosity of \n     mine but because the passage of time and the actions of the \n     Communist government of Vietnam proven to me we were fighting \n     on the right side. In their harsh treatment of the Vietnamese \n     people, in denying them medicine and essential consumer \n     goods, and in persecuting religious practice, the Vietnamese \n     Communists in the postwar years proved themselves to be--\n     Communists.\n       The most eloquent comment on life under Ho Chi Minh's heirs \n     was the flight of millions of Vietnamese who risked death on \n     the high seas rather than live under that regime. If there \n     was to be a trial to determine whether the Vietnam War was \n     worth fighting, I would call the Boat People as my only \n     witness.\n       Was the war worth the effort and sacrifice, or was it a \n     mistake? Everyone touched by it must answer that question for \n     himself. When I came home in 1969 and for many years \n     afterward, I did not believe it was worth it. Today, with the \n     passage of time and the experience of seeing both the \n     benefits of freedom won by our sacrifice and the human \n     destruction done by dictatorships, I believe the cause was \n     just and the sacrifice not in vain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3186-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3186-S3187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3187-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the first and second times, and placed on \nthe calendar:\n\n       H.R. 3767.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to obtaining an apology \n     from the government of Japan for crimes against prisoners of \n     war during World War II; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, 33,587 men and women in the United States military \n     and 13,966 United States civilians were captured by the \n     forces of the Empire of Japan in the Pacific Theater during \n     World War II, confined in brutal prison camps, and subjected \n     to severe shortages of food, medicine, and other basic \n     necessities; and\n       Whereas, many of the United States military and civilian \n     prisoners of the Imperial Japanese Government during World \n     War II were forced to work in coal, copper, lead, and zinc \n     mines, steel plants, shipbuilding yards, and other private \n     Imperial Japanese industries; and\n       Whereas, many of the United States military and civilian \n     prisoners of the Imperial Japanese Government were starved \n     and beaten to death or executed by beheading, firing squads, \n     or immolation, while working for Japanese business entities \n     that have become some of the largest multinational companies \n     in the world today; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Republic of Germany has formally \n     apologized to the victims of the Holocaust and provided \n     financial compensation to its victims; and\n       Whereas, the United States government, in 1988, \n     acknowledged the unfairness of its policy of detaining and \n     interring Japanese-Americans during World War II; and\n       Whereas, while Japanese government officials have expressed \n     personal apologies and supported the payment of privately \n     funded reparations to some victims, the Japanese government \n     has refused to fully acknowledge the crimes of Imperial Japan \n     committed during World War II and to provide reparations to \n     its victims: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana requests that \n     the President of the United States and the United States \n     Congress take all appropriate action to further bring about a \n     formal apology and reparations by the Japanese government for \n     the war crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese military \n     during World War II. Be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Japanese Ambassador to the United States, the President of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and each member of Louisiana's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-469. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to Social Security; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, in November 1999, the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures (NCSL) published a position-neutral report \n     titled ``Federal Reductions to Social Security Benefits of \n     State and Local Employees: The Windfall Elimination Reduction \n     and the Government Pension Offset''; and\n       Whereas, the NCSL report stated that two federal Social \n     Security provisions known as the Government Pension Offset \n     (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) result in \n     a reduction of Social Security benefits received by \n     beneficiaries who also receive ``uncovered'' government \n     retirement benefits earned through work for a state or local \n     government employer where the Social Security payroll tax was \n     not paid; and\n       Whereas, the NCSL report stated that congress, in crafting \n     the GPO and WEP benefit reductions, intended to alleviate \n     concerns that public employees who had worked primarily in \n     uncovered, non-Social Security employment receive the same \n     benefit as workers who had worked in covered employment \n     throughout their career; and\n       Whereas, the NCSL report stated that the GPO reduces the \n     Social Security spouse's (widow's) benefit by two-thirds of \n     the amount of the public retirement benefit received by the \n     spousal beneficiary and, in some case, the offset will \n     eliminate a Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to some government employees who \n     worked primarily in uncovered employment and who have earned \n     an uncovered government pension and also worked enough \n     quarters in covered employment to qualify for an earned \n     Social Security benefit which is subject to a reduction of up \n     to one-half of the amount of the uncovered public retirement \n     benefit earned; and\n       Whereas, based on the facts as presented in the NCSL \n     report, it can be argued that both the GPO and the WEP \n     reductions are unfair to lower-wage public employees who \n     receive lower uncovered public pension benefits, because the \n     greatest reductions are suffered by the lowest Social \n     Security earners, and both reduction provisions assume that \n     public employees in uncovered employment, are career \n     employees and make no adjustments for employees who may move \n     in and out of public sector employment or who may qualify for \n     only a minimal uncovered government pension: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize congress to repeal the two federal Social \n     Security provisions known as the Government Pension Offset \n     and the Windfall Elimination Provision, and thereby prevent \n     the reduction of Social Security benefits received by \n     beneficiaries who also receive ``uncovered'' government \n     retirement benefits earned through work for a state or local \n     government employer. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-470. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to tax treatment of \n     independently contracted school bus operators; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, many Louisiana school systems retain school bus \n     operators who own their own school buses and who act as \n     independent contractors for the purpose of transporting \n     students to and from school and school-related events, and \n     each such operator incurs expenses in the performance of his \n     duties, including the cost of new tires, tune-ups, routine \n     maintenance, engine and body repair, interest on financing of \n     the bus, and depreciation thereof; and\n       Whereas, in each year prior to 1989, such operators were \n     paid a base salary that was reported to the Internal Revenue \n     Service on form W-2 which applies to statutory employees and, \n     in addition thereto, were paid a separate operation expense \n     reimbursement allowance that was reported on form 1099-\n     Miscellaneous which applies to independent contractors; and\n       Whereas, in each tax year prior to 1989, each such operator \n     was required to pay income tax on his base salary, but it \n     appears that the Internal Revenue Service apparently either \n     condoned or was unaware of the prevailing tax practice of the \n     operators who were foregoing the reporting of their form \n     1099-Miscellaneous allowance as taxable income thereby \n     allowing, in effect, a tax exemption relative thereto; and\n       Whereas, the former practice of many operators was to carry \n     forward the unused, untaxed portion of their expense \n     allowance to be applied in any future year if the expense \n     allowance paid in that year did not cover the expenses \n     actually incurred; and\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\n       Whereas, during the year 1988, or sometime thereabout, the \n     practice of issuing both a form W-2 and form 1099-\n     Miscellaneous to an individual employee came to the attention \n     of the Internal Revenue Service which, apparently, concluded \n     that the practice of treating a single employee as both a \n     statutory employee and an independent contractor, and the \n     resulting accumulation of unused, untaxed expense allowances \n     was unacceptable and further concluded that a law or \n     regulation was necessary to address the subject; and\n       Whereas, in tax year 1989, United States Treasury \n     Regulation Sec. 1.62-2 became effective, which required \n     employers to pay operational reimbursement allowances in \n     compliance with an arrangement known as an ``accountable \n     plan'', requiring operators to: (1) only claim expenses \n     incurred in the operation of their buses, (2) provide \n     employers with an itemized list of actual operating expenses, \n     and (3) return to their employers the amount of expense \n     allowance that exceeded the actual expenses incurred during \n     the pay period; and\n       Whereas, to comply with the 1989 tax regulation, employers \n     began changing their method of paying operators by \n     discontinuing the payment of a separate operational expenses \n     allowance, while simultaneously increasing each operator's \n     base salary by an amount equal to the former expense \n     allowance, and reporting the total amount to the Internal \n     Revenue Service as form W-2 salary; and\n       Whereas, reporting operational expense allowance as form W-\n     2 salary instead of form 1099-Miscellaneous income, deprives \n     each operator of the opportunity to forego reporting the \n     total amount of the allowance as taxable income as was the \n     widespread practice prior to tax year 1989 and, furthermore, \n     subjects the unused expense allowance to taxation unless that \n     portion is returned to the employer; and\n       Whereas, the federal government's apparent objective of \n     preventing the accumulation of unused, untaxed expense \n     allowance appears to be neutral on its face, but it \n     nevertheless has caused a departure from treating all \n     operators the same, resulting in a situation that many \n     operators consider to be unfair and disparate treatment \n     between operators, and one example of such perceived \n     disparate treatment is the contrast between those operators \n     who itemize their expenses for deduction purposes as compared \n     to those who must claim the standard deduction; and\n       Whereas, there are operators whose personal finances are \n     such that they file a federal income tax form 1040 along with \n     a schedule of deductions, and their individual circumstances \n     allow them to deduct all or a part of their expense allowance \n     from taxable income but, by contrast, there are other \n     operators whose personal finances are such that they must \n     claim the standard deduction and, because their circumstances \n     do not allow for itemization, they have no choice but to \n     report their operation expense allowance as taxable income \n     less any returned portion; and\n       Whereas, the division of operators into those two groups \n     reveals that one group can deduct allowances from taxable \n     income while the other group cannot, thus causing disparate \n     treatment between the two groups, even though the factors \n     that distinguish the groups may be based on totally random \n     and fortuitous circumstances that are unrelated to the \n     occupation of school bus operator, including such factors as \n     home ownership, having a second job, or being married to a \n     highly compensated spouse; and\n       Whereas, any such disparate treatment can be corrected \n     simply by returning to the pre-1989 policy of treating \n     independently contracted school bus operators as hybrid \n     employees, meaning that they should be treated as statutory \n     employees with respect to their base salary and treated as \n     independent contractors with respect to their operation \n     expense allowance, provided such policy includes an \n     authorization to report the total amount of such allowances \n     on form 1099-Miscellaneous, with an exemption of those \n     allowances from taxable income without returning the unused \n     portion, and thereby allowing a carryforward thereof: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to correct disparate \n     treatment of independently contracted school bus operators by \n     enacting legislation to cause a return to the pre-1989 policy \n     to treating such operators as hybrid employees, meaning that \n     they should be treated as statutory employees with respect to \n     their base salary and treated as independent contractors with \n     respect to their operation expense allowance, provided such \n     policy includes authorization to report the total amount of \n     such allowances on form 1099-Miscellaneous, with an exemption \n     of those allowances from taxable income without returning the \n     unused portion, and thereby allowing a carryforward thereof. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the president of the United States Senate, to the speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and to each \n     member of the Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-471. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the compensation of \n     retired military personnel; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, American servicemen and women have dedicated their \n     careers to protect the rights we all enjoy, and many career \n     military personnel have endured hardships, privation, the \n     threat of death, disability, and long separations from their \n     families while in service to our country, and those soldiers \n     and sailors who have made a career of defending our great \n     nation in peace and war from the time of the American \n     Revolution until the present day are integral to the success \n     of our military forces; and\n       Whereas, there exists a gross inequity in the federal \n     statutes that deny disabled career military personnel equal \n     rights to receive Veterans Administration disability \n     compensation concurrent with receipt of earned military \n     retired pay, although legislation has been introduced in the \n     United States Congress to remedy this inequity applicable to \n     career military personnel; and\n       Whereas, the injustice involves those veterans who are \n     retired with a minimum of twenty years of service, in that \n     they are denied the receipt of hard-earned military longevity \n     retirement pay which is not paid, but should be paid \n     concurrently with Veteran Administration awards for service-\n     connected disability compensation.\n       Whereas, there is a significant difference between earned \n     career military retirement benefits that are based on twenty \n     years or more of honorable and faithful service and rank at \n     time of retirement, and disability compensation which, unlike \n     longevity retirement pay, is intended to compensate for pain, \n     suffering, disfigurement, chemical exposures, wound injuries, \n     and a loss of earning ability has a minimum requirement of \n     only ninety days of active duty; and\n       Whereas, military retirement benefits are not ``free'' \n     because military personnel must contribute toward their \n     retirement, which results in a reduction of military base pay \n     by approximately seven percent when pay and allowances are \n     computed and approved by Congress and, traditionally, career \n     military personnel receive lower pay and retirement benefits \n     compared to their civilian counterparts after a life of \n     hardship and long hours without overtime pay and without the \n     advocacy of unions to seek better benefits; and\n       Whereas, the Veterans Administration pays to disabled \n     veterans with a total body disability of thirty percent or \n     more additional compensation known as ``dependents \n     allowances'' which is based on one or more dependents of the \n     disabled veteran and the amount of the allowance increases \n     with the severity of the disability, and the Department of \n     Defense causes to be deducted from disabled veterans' \n     benefits an amount which is more or less the same amount as \n     the dependents allowance, and essentially leaves the disabled \n     veteran with no dependents allowance, and the effect of that \n     practice is to extend discriminatory treatment to the \n     families of disabled retirees; and\n       Whereas, it is patently unfair to require disabled military \n     retirees to fund their own Veterans Administration \n     compensation by deductions on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and \n     no such deduction applies to the benefits of similarly \n     situated federal civil service or congressional disability \n     retirees, and to correct this unjust discrimination a \n     statutory change is necessary which will also serve the \n     purpose of ensuring that America's commitment to national and \n     international goals is matched by the same allegiance as \n     already shown by those who sacrificed their physical well-\n     being on behalf of those goals: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to amend Title X, \n     United States Code, relating to the compensation of retired \n     military, to permit concurrent receipt of retired military \n     pay and Veterans Administration disability compensation, \n     including dependents allowances.

Therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take all \n     appropriate action to eliminate unnecessarily intrusive \n     questions on the census form in order to ensure maximum \n     participation and accuracy of the United States census. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does urge and \n     request Louisiana citizens to complete and return their \n     census forms as soon as possible in order to assure that \n     Louisiana citizens will benefit from public and private \n     sector services and equal representation which are dependent \n     upon an accurate census.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to quality care for \n     active duty and retired military personnel and their \n     families; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 125\n\n       Whereas, thousands of dedicated men and women comprise the \n     armed forces of the United States, the greatest military \n     force in the world; and\n       Whereas, these men and women make great personal sacrifices \n     to lend their gifts, talents, and time to protect the people \n     of this nation, and to aid others around the world who are \n     threatened by the malevolent acts of despots and their \n     regimes, and natural acts of destruction; and\n       Whereas, World War II and Korean War military retirees and \n     their families constitute a significant part of the aging \n     population in the United States; and\n       Whereas, active duty and military retirees were guaranteed \n     free, quality, lifetime medical benefits for themselves and \n     their immediate families upon their retirement for serving \n     our country honorably for 20 or more years; and\n       Whereas, prior to the age of 65, military retirees and \n     their families were provided health care services at military \n     medical facilities; or through other United States Department \n     of Defense programs; however, upon reaching the age of 65, \n     they lost a significant portion of health care coverage to \n     which they were entitled through federal legislation that \n     eliminated such medical benefits in 1995; and\n       Whereas, many military retirees and their families live on \n     a fixed income and cannot obtain quality health care and \n     pharmaceuticals or afford to pay for these services out-of-\n     pocket; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has closed 58 military \n     hospitals and has downgraded 26 military hospitals to \n     clinics, and the Department of Defense has proposed that an \n     additional 26 military hospitals be closed; and\n       Whereas, many active duty and military retirees and their \n     families are unable to access military treatment facilities \n     because such facilities no longer exist or have been \n     downsized to the extent that space for health care services \n     has become nonexistent; and\n       Whereas, our very freedom, and the rights and comforts that \n     we all enjoy and many take for granted in the free world, \n     were bought with the tremendous sacrifice of families, \n     personal freedom, limbs, minds, and the lives of brave, \n     patriotic, and honorable men and women; and\n       Whereas, these honorable men and women, who have sacrificed \n     in the service of their country, and their immediate families \n     are deserving of the health care that they were guaranteed; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring, \n     That the Congress be urged\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\n     to restore quality health care to active duty and retired \n     military personnel and their families. Acknowledgment of the \n     great sacrifices made by these persons in the defense of our \n     safety and freedom would be best demonstrated by honoring the \n     pledge made to them by fully restoring their right to free, \n     quality, lifetime heath care; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States; the Speaker of the Unites States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and the members of the Congressional Delegation of Virginia \n     in order that they may be apprised of the sense of the \n     General Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-480. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to an increase in \n     funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and \n     financial aid for middle income students; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 222\n\n       Whereas, Historically Black Colleges and Universities \n     (HBCUs) have been in existence for more than 150 years, \n     arising at a time in America's history when the education of \n     African-Americans and whites was separate and unequal; and\n       Whereas, these colleges have been the firm foundation that \n     have provided the crucial means for the educational and \n     economic advancement of African-Americans; and\n       Whereas, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, \n     dedicated to equality and excellence in higher education, \n     embody many of our most deeply cherished values--equality, \n     diversity, opportunity, and hard work; and\n       Whereas, by serving the African-American community, HBCUs \n     serve all Americans by preparing gifted young men and women \n     to succeed in every sector of society, by helping persons \n     from low-income communities--African-American and white--to \n     realize their dreams and life goals; and\n       Whereas, by producing alumni who are great scientists and \n     mathematicians, gifted and talented musicians and artisans, \n     superb athletes and sportsmen, outstanding statesmen and \n     orators, skilled military leaders, and other noteworthy \n     individuals whose immeasurable contributions have benefited \n     mankind; and\n       Whereas, although colleges and universities associated with \n     other racial and ethnic groups have an equally long and \n     glorious history, and an even brighter future as a result of \n     the many men and women alumni who are recognized leaders in \n     the community and have the wealth to establish endowments and \n     donate substantial financial awards to their institutions; \n     and\n       Whereas, a growing number of African-American college \n     graduates have been blessed to achieve social, political, and \n     economic status, the vast number of alumni of Historically \n     Black Colleges and Universities have not had the same \n     opportunity as persons in the majority culture to establish \n     social and business connections and amass fortunes that would \n     enable them to support their alma maters; and\n       Whereas, the majority of African-Americans with bachelor's \n     degrees in engineering, computer science, life science, \n     business, and mathematics have graduated from one of the 105 \n     Historically Black Colleges and Universities and according to \n     the United States Department of Education's National Center \n     for Education Statistics, historically Black colleges and \n     universities coffered 28 percent of all bachelor's degrees \n     awarded to African-American graduates in 1996, although \n     enrollment at HBCUs constituted only 16 percent of all \n     African-American college students; and\n       Whereas, although our society has evolved and minority \n     persons may attend traditionally white institutions, there is \n     still a need for HBCUs, as they provide a learning \n     environment where teacher expectations are high, personal \n     dreams and aspirations are nurtured, the campus climate is \n     tolerant of differences, and the ambiance is respectful of \n     Black history and culture; and\n       Whereas, with an illustrious past and a hopeful present, \n     without increased support and financial assistance, HBCUs and \n     the many African-Americans, low-income and middle-income \n     persons that they serve, the challenge to be competitive in \n     the 21st century will become an insurmountable hurdle; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has provided funding and \n     other support services to HBCUs and their students through \n     many programs and services, as well as financial aid, \n     substantial increases in the level of federal funding is \n     desperately needed to sustain and expand the educational \n     programs and services given the escalating costs of higher \n     education; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to increase \n     funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities \n     (HBCUs) and financial aid for middle income students; and, be \n     it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the Senate shall \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the President of the Senate, and the members of the \n     Congressional Delegation of Virginia so that they may be \n     apprised of the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in \n     this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-481. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to the Trade Act of \n     1974; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 98\n\n       Whereas, the Trade Act of 1974 established a statutory \n     framework for providing transitional adjustment assistance to \n     employees displaced due to increased importation of \n     competitive products; and\n       Whereas, the adoption by Congress of the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) included the establishment of a \n     transitional adjustment assistance program in the event that \n     imports of competitive goods from Canada or Mexico are an \n     important contribution to workers' separation; and\n       Whereas, since the adoption of NAFTA, the number of imports \n     from Canada and Mexico of products directly competitive with \n     products manufactured in the United States has increased; and\n       Whereas, many manufacturing plants in the United States \n     have displaced workers or closed entirely due to increased \n     competition from imported products; and\n       Whereas, American workers have been struggling to find \n     similar employment and need retraining services to be \n     qualified for other types of employment; and\n       Whereas, the current length of time for retraining benefits \n     under the Trade Act is inadequate for most Americans to \n     complete retraining programs; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring, \n     That the General Assembly of Virginia memorialize the \n     Congress of the United States to amend that portion of the \n     Trade Act of 1974 establishing the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program to \n     extend the maximum time period for receipt of benefits from \n     52 weeks to 78 weeks; and be it\n       Resolved further, That the General Assembly of Virginia \n     most fervently urge and encourage each state legislative body \n     of the United States of America to enact this resolution, or \n     one similar in context and form, as a show of solidarity in \n     petitioning the federal government for greater benefits to \n     workers displaced due to the adoption of NAFTA; and, be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, the Secretary of the United States Department of \n     Labor, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     each member of the Congressional Delegation of Virginia, and \n     to the presiding officer of each house of each state \n     legislative body in the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-482. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New Hampshire relative to heating oil prices and the Federal \n     Weatherization Program; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                          Senate Resolution 14\n\n       Whereas, prices for home heating oil, kerosene, and diesel \n     fuel spiked dramatically this winter in New Hampshire and \n     reached record highs in our state and throughout the \n     Northeast; and\n       Whereas, heating oil prices in the state rose to prices \n     which were well over $1 per gallon higher than last winter's \n     fuel prices; and\n       Whereas, kerosene prices in the state rose to well over $2 \n     per gallon; and\n       Whereas, gasoline prices have skyrocketed, and threaten to \n     reach or exceed $2 per gallon in the coming season; and\n       Whereas, households across the state struggle to pay their \n     necessary heating and transportation fuel costs; and\n       Whereas, New Hampshire citizens remain vulnerable to future \n     fuel price volatility; and\n       Whereas, tight fuel supplies and very low supplier \n     inventories exacerbated the price volatility problem; and\n       Whereas, sustained below freezing temperatures this past \n     winter and during typical New Hampshire winters make this \n     situation of particular concern as a health and safety issue \n     for our citizens; and\n       Whereas, 75 percent of all home heating oil used in the \n     United States is used in New England during 12 weeks of \n     winter; and\n       Whereas, the federally-funded Low Income Weatherization \n     Program last year provided approximately $870,000 to New \n     Hampshire to enable cost-effective energy conservation \n     investments for the neediest households to reduce their \n     energy consumption and heating bills; and\n       Whereas, the Weatherization Program is one of the most \n     effective means of reducing low income homeowners' reliance \n     on imported heating fuels, and resultant energy cost burdens, \n     while also advancing health and safety goals; and\n       Whereas, the federal State Energy Program enables states \n     like New Hampshire to target all sectors of the economy--\n     including schools, municipalities, business, industry, state \n     facilities, non-profits, and the residential sector--with \n     energy saving and renewable energy initiatives, education, \n     and creative solutions to energy problems, and further \n     permits the state to monitor and track key trends in fuel \n     prices and supplies so as to foster emergency preparedness; \n     and\n       Whereas, the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Program (LIHEAP) afforded New Hampshire over $17 million this \n     year ($8.5 million base grant plus $9.1 million\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\n     in emergency funds) for income eligible households to pay \n     essential heating costs, thereby averting hardship and crisis \n     for thousands of elderly, disabled, and families with young \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate:\n       That the senate hereby urges the United States Department \n     of Energy to take all available measures to assure adequate \n     inventory levels in the Northeast, including re-examination \n     of regional heating oil reserve options, as well as minimum \n     wholesale inventory requirements; and\n       That the senate hereby urges Congress to repeal the new 25 \n     percent Weatherization Program match requirement scheduled to \n     go into effect in 2001, which would place states like New \n     Hampshire at potential risk of loss of all federal funding to \n     this valuable program; and\n       That the senate hereby urges the White House to maintain \n     pressure on OPEC to agree to increase production levels when \n     they meet on March 27, 2000, to increase petroleum product \n     supplies available throughout the region in order to reduce \n     prices; and\n       That the senate hereby urges Congress to support increase \n     funding for much-needed federal programs, at proposed \n     national levels of $1.4 billion for LIHEAP, $175 million for \n     the Weatherization Program, and $44 million for the State \n     Energy Program, so that states can best assist residents and \n     businesses to decrease their fuel consumption and afford \n     essential heating costs; and\n       That the senate clerk transmit copies of this resolution to \n     the President of the United States, the Vice-President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the Department of Energy, the \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the members \n     of the New Hampshire congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-483.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve \naccess to benefits under the TRICARE program; to extend and improve \ncertain demonstration programs under the Defense Health Program; and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n             military health care improvements act of 2000\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an enhanced \npiece of legislation the Military Medical Improvement Act of 2000. This \nrevised legislative initiative incorporates the major concerns of \nbeneficiaries I heard pertaining to the original legislation.\n  S. 2087, the Military Health Care Improvement Act of 2000 that I \nintroduced on February 23, 2000, contains a provision authorizing a \nmail order pharmacy benefit for military retirees, dependents and \nsurvivors over age 64. Since S. 2087 was introduced, the Personnel \nSubcommittee of the Senate\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\nArmed Services Committee has conducted a hearing on medical issues \nwhere beneficiary representatives conveyed the importance of a \ncomprehensive pharmacy benefit to committee members. I chaired sessions \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee where senior Department of \nDefense officials, both uniformed and civilian, addressed the \nimportance of the medical benefit and meeting health care commitments \nto retirees as recruiting and retention issues.\n  Due to my grave concern about meeting the needs of military \nbeneficiaries, and the importance of health care as a component of the \ncompensation package, I have continued to solicit views of military \nbeneficiaries on medical benefits. I recently conducted a town hall \nmeeting in Norfolk, Virginia, devoted exclusively to military health \ncare issues. A recurring concern mentioned by the participants was that \nthe pharmacy provision of S. 2087 did not include a retail pharmacy \ncomponent. I have come to the conclusion that it is critical that we \nexpand access to a retail benefit for all military beneficiaries.\n  The legislation I am introducing today responds to the concerns I \nhave heard from military beneficiaries and includes a modified pharmacy \nprovision that expands the mail order pharmacy program to all military \nbeneficiaries with no enrollment fee or deductible and that would \nprovide access to retail pharmacy networks for all military \nbeneficiaries, including those eligible for Medicare. This benefit \nwould mirror the current Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) pharmacy \nbenefit. The BRAC pharmacy benefit is currently restricted to only a \nfew Medicare-eligible military retirees. The modified pharmacy benefit \nI am suggesting would, in effect, extend the BRAC benefit to all \nMedicare-eligible beneficiaries of the military health care system.\n  Based on lower than expected costs associated with this enhanced \nprovision, and my recent amendment to the budget resolution which \nallows for funding of medical reserve account to accommodate \nincorporation of programs to address military retiree's health care \nneeds, I am confident this body will embrace this further commitment to \nmeeting the health care needs of those who have so faithfully served \ntheir nation.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Warner \nin bringing this enhanced military medical improvement legislation to \nthe floor today. As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, I have \nchaired several oversight hearings which have contributed to \nidentifying areas of improvements to the original legislation. While \nthe pharmacy benefit included in S. 2087 is significant, beneficiaries \nhave expressed concern over meeting their acute prescription drug \nneeds.\n  The version of the Military Medical Improvement Act of 2000 that I \njoin the chairman in introducing today, builds upon the previous \nlegislation and provides for enhancement of the pharmacy benefit by \nadding a retail component on the pharmacy program to address the acute \nmedical needs of our military retiree population. The new legislation \nprovides for system wide expansion of the Base Realignment and Closure \nof ``BRAC'' pharmacy benefit. The BRAC benefit includes access to \nretail networks with a 20 percent beneficiary cost share. The benefit \nalso includes the mail order pharmacy program with current co-pays of \n$8 for a 90 day supply of drugs with no enrollment fees for \ndeductibles.\n  I feel it is critically important to provide a uniform benefit for \nall our military retirees and their families. Revised cost assumptions \nassociated with S. 2087, and a provision in the Budget Resolution, \nallow us to enhance the original provision to more closely meet the \nneeds of those who were promised health care.\n  Mr. President, as I travel and meet with military beneficiaries, I \nwill continue to examine opportunities to improve and enhance the \nhealth care package provided to our service members, their families, \nretirees, their dependents, and survivors. The medical component of the \ncompensation package continues to grow in significance as health care \ncosts increase and the recruiting environment becomes more difficult. \nMeeting the commitment to military retirees sends a strong message to \nthose young people we seek to draw to military service.\n  This enhanced legislation continues the ongoing process of working \ntoward meeting the needs of the military population. As chairman of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee I am committed to further examination of follow \non opportunities to improve the military health care system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2487. A bill to authorize appropriations for Fiscal Year 2001 for \ncertain maritime programs of the Department of Transportation; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n     maritime administration authorization act for fiscal year 2001\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2001 for the Maritime Administration. \nThe introduction of this bill continues the Senate Commerce Committee's \ncommitment to insuring our nations maritime industry can compete in the \nworld market.\n  The bill contains the authorization of appropriations for the \nMaritime Administration [MarAd] for fiscal year 2001 covering two \nappropriations accounts: (1) operations and training and (2) the loan \nguarantee program authorized by title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, \n1936. Operations and training activities include the costs incurred by \nMarAd headquarters and regional staffs in the administration and \ndirection of programs that support the American maritime industry. \nThese funds also cover operations of the United States Merchant Marine \nAcademy (USMMA) and assistance to the six state maritime academies. The \ntitle XI loan guarantee program for shipbuilding authorizes the \nSecretary of Transportation to guarantee private sector financing for \nthe construction or reconstruction of U.S.-flag vessels in U.S. \nshipyards.\n  Additionally, the bill amends Title IX of the Merchant Marine Act of \n1936 to provide a waiver to eliminate the three year period that bulk \nand breakbulk vessels newly registered under the U.S. flag must wait in \norder to carry government-impelled cargo. The bill also provides a one \nyear window of opportunity for vessels newly registered under the U.S.-\nflag to enter into the cargo preference trade without waiting the \ntraditional three year period.\n  Finally, the bill provides the Secretary of Transportation the \nauthority, regardless of any other law, to scrap 39 obsolete vessels in \nthe National Defense Reserve Fleet that pose an immediate hazard to \nnavigation and the environment and to scrap additional vessels if the \nSecretary determines they pose a hazard. It requires the Secretary to \nreport to Congress within one year of the date of enactment with a plan \nto dispose of the remaining obsolete vessels and extends the deadline \nfor completing disposal of all obsolete vessels by three years.\n  I look forward to working on this important legislation and hope my \ncolleagues will join me and the other sponsors in expeditiously moving \nthis authorization through the legislative process and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2487\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Maritime Administration \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Transportation for the Maritime Administration the following \n     amounts:\n       (1) For the expenses necessary for operations and training \n     activities, not to exceed $80,240,000 for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001.\n       (2) For the costs, as defined in section 502 of the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act of 1990, of guaranteed loans authorized by \n     title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 \n     U.S.C. App. 1271 et seq.), $2,000,000, to be available until \n     expended.

A bill to expand and enhance United States efforts in the \nRussian nuclear complex to expedite the containment of nuclear \nexpertise that presents a proliferation threat, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n             nuclear weapons complex conversion act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation, the \nNuclear Weapons Complex Conversion Act of 2000, to dramatically improve \nour programs that deal with non-proliferation risks associated with the \nFormer Soviet Union. My legislation will also significantly enhance our \nability to consider future arms control agreements.\n  Today, we face challenges involving the warheads, materials, and \nexpertise developed during the days of the Cold War. With that War \nbehind us, arguably the greatest global security challenge involves \ncontainment and management of proliferation threats--many of which are \nin danger of being fueled with former Soviet capabilities.\n  Congress has repeatedly demonstrated frustration with the \nAdministration's progress in this key area. A significant part of this \nconcern arises from today's wide range of uncoordinated programs, all \ndealing with non-proliferation issues. Programs aren't integrated into \none coherent thrust led by a focused and committed Administration. Our \nnon-proliferation programs resemble a patchwork quilt designed and \nexecuted by several artists.\n  The net effect of our non-proliferation programs is far less than it \ncould be and needs to be. These programs are begging for coherent \noversight and inter-agency cooperation. To address this need, which is \nfar from new, the 1996 Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation called for \nappointment of a new-level non-proliferation czar.\n  This Administration never acted on this law. Without this \ncoordination, inter-agency turf fights remain unresolved, potential \nsynergies aren't exploited, and redundancy and inefficiency can run \nrampant. My legislation therefore expresses a Sense of Congress that \nthe time is long overdue for this coordination.\n  My legislation also deals specifically with the largest unmet \nchallenges of the former Soviet Russian nuclear weapons complex. That \ncomplex contains three main challenges: weapons production capacity, \nmaterials for those weapons, and people.\n  Programs associated with the materials, where goals and progress are \neasier to define and measure, are demonstrating credible progress. But, \nthe other areas present more complex challenges.\n  The ``brain drain'' issue reflects a concern that scientists and \nengineers with critical knowledge might sell their knowledge to rogue \nstates. The weapons production issue raises concern about Russia's \nability to rapidly reconstitute forces that could invalidate future \narms control agreements. These twin issues then, non-proliferation and \nthe credibility of future arms control agreements, urgently need \nimproved approaches.\n  We already have a Nuclear Cities Initiative within the Department of \nEnergy, but it has barely begun to scratch the surface in dealing with \nthe problem of their cash-strapped and over-sized nuclear complex. To \ndate, NCI has not garnered enough Congressional support to have stable \nand realistic funding, largely because it hasn't set goals and \nmilestones against which progress can be documented and measured.\n  The concerns on weapon production capabilities highlight very large \nasymmetries. The U.S. has significantly reduced the size of our nuclear \nweapons production complex. These reductions were accomplished openly, \nand are transparent to Russia. Russia, in contrast, has barely started \nto downsize its complex. Their complex is still sized at Cold War \nlevels.\n  Little information about the Russian complex is shared, and ten of \nits most sensitive cities remain closed. Although the Russian Federal \nMinistry of Atomic Energy has announced its intent to significantly \ndownsize its workforce, it has been slow in accomplishing this goal and \nany progress is very closely held.\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\n  The current Nuclear Cities Initiative was established to assist \nRussia in creating job opportunities for employees who are not required \nto support realistic Russian security requirements and to facilitate \nconversion of the production facilities. It has focused on creation of \ncommercial ventures that provide self-sustaining jobs, primarily in \nthree of the closed cities. The current program scope, progress, and \nfunding are not consistent with the scale of the threats to us.\n  I want to significantly advance our progress in the nuclear cities. \nHowever, to gain sufficient advocacy for a major funding increase, the \nprogram must demonstrate rapid progress in downsizing and an ability \nfor the U.S. to track progress against verifiable milestones that \nsupport a Russian complex consistent with their future national \nsecurity requirements.\n\n  My legislation substantially increases the funding and scope of our \nprograms with the Russian nuclear weapons complex to assist the Russian \nFederation in restructuring its complex, but does this conditioned on a \ncommitment from the Russian Federation to measure progress against \nrealistic, transparent milestones. Without their commitment, and \nwithout an ability to track progress against such milestones, it is \nsimply not appropriate for us to continue to fund programs within their \ncomplex.\n  My legislation supports the ongoing commercialization programs in \ntheir complex. In addition, however, it authorizes the federal \ngovernment to contract for research in support of United States \nagencies in cases where the Russians have unique capabilities and \nfacilities.\n  My legislation demands that funding for this expanded program, for \nthe 2002 fiscal year and beyond, be contingent on making significant \nmeasurable progress on key issues of strategic interest to both \ncountries, including:\n  Demonstrable conversion from military to civilian activities at the \nfour cities participating in the FY 2001 program.\n  Development of a ten year plan by the Russian Federation for a \nnuclear weapons complex downsized to reflect the changing national \nsecurity needs of Russia. This plan should reflect a production \ncapacity consistent with future arms control agreements.\n  Increased transparency of Russian production capacity and nuclear \nmaterials inventories to eventually match that of the United States.\n  In addition, my legislation authorizes funding for educational \ninitiatives both in the United States and in the Former Soviet Union \nfocused on developing new non-proliferation experts. There are now few \npeople who can assist in these difficult downsizing processes while, at \nthe same time, minimizing the threat presented by residual weapons \nmaterial or expertise.\n  Significant cooperation from the Russian government must occur for \nmilestones to be set and met. That won't happen unless they concur that \nthese steps are also in their best interests. From interactions with \nsenior levels of their Ministry of Atomic Energy, I've learned that \nthey share the view that progress in this area is in the best interests \nof both nations.\n  It is certainly in our mutual interests to accomplish the transition \nof both nations' nuclear weapons complexes with as much care and as \nlittle proliferation risk as possible. It is also in each nation's \ninterests for the other to maintain a sufficiently credible complex to \nsupport realistic national security objectives. To the extent that we \ncan take these steps in a mutually transparent way, we should be able \nto assure each other of our future intentions.\n  Mr. President, this legislation can significantly impact our non-\nproliferation and future arms control national security objectives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3195-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3195-S3197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 662\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a \nSenate resolution which designates August 16, 2000 as ``National \nAirborne Day.''\n  On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test \nPlatoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The \nParachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed \nthe first official army parachute jump on August 16, 1940. The success \nof the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne \ncontingent that has served from World War Two until the present.\n  I was privileged to serve with the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the \nfirst airborne divisions to be organized. In a two-year period during \nWorld War Two, the regiments of the 82nd served in Italy at Anzio, in \nFrance at Normandy (where I landed with them), and at the Battle of the \nBulge.\n  The 11th, 13th, 17th, and 101st Airborne Divisions and numerous other \nregimental and battalion size airborne units were also organized \nfollowing the success of the Parachute Test Platoon. In the last sixty \nyears, these airborne forces have performed in important military and \npeace-keeping operations all over the world, and it is only fitting \nthat we honor them.\n  Mr. President, through passage of ``National Airborne Day,'' the \nSenate will reaffirm our support for the members of the airborne \ncommunity and also show our gratitude for their tireless commitment to \nour Nation's defense and ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/01/senate-section/article/S3197-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3197-S3199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 AKAKA (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3103\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Moynihan, and \nMrs. Murray) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to \nthe bill (S. 2) to extend programs and activities under the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       ``(a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the \n     `Excellence in Economic Education Act of 2000'.\n       ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) The need for economic literacy in the United States \n     has grown exponentially in the 1990's as a result of rapid \n     technological advancements and increasing globalization, \n     giving individuals in the United States more numerous and \n     complex economic and financial choices than ever before as \n     members of the workforce, managers of their families' \n     resources, and voting citizens.\n       ``(2) Individuals in the United States lack essential \n     economic knowledge, as demonstrated in a 1998-1999 test \n     conducted for the National Council on Economic Education, a \n     private nonprofit organization. The test results indicated \n     the following:\n       ``(A) Students and adults alike lack a basic understanding \n     of core economic concepts such as scarcity of resources and \n     inflation, with less than half of those tested demonstrating \n     knowledge of those basic concepts.\n       ``(B) A little more than \\1/3\\ of those tested realize that \n     society must make choices about how to use resources.\n       ``(C) Only \\1/3\\ of those tested understand that active \n     competition in the marketplace serves to lower prices and \n     improve product quality.\n       ``(D) Slightly more than \\1/2\\ of adults in the United \n     States and less than \\1/4\\ of students in the United States \n     know that a Federal budget deficit is created when the \n     Federal Government's expenditures exceed its revenues in a \n     year.\n       ``(E) Overall, adults received a grade of 57 percent on the \n     test and secondary school students received a grade of 48 \n     percent on the test.\n       ``(F) Despite these poor results, the test findings pointed \n     out that individuals in the United States realize the need \n     for understanding basic economic concepts, with 96 percent of \n     adults tested believing that basic economics should be taught \n     in secondary school.\n       ``(3) A range of trends points to the need for individuals \n     in the United States to receive a practical economics \n     education that will give the individuals tools to make \n     responsible choices about their limited financial resources, \n     and about the range of economic choices which face all people \n     regardless of their financial circumstances. Examples of the \n     trends include the following:\n       ``(A) The number of personal bankruptcies in the United \n     States rose and set new records in the 1990's, despite the \n     longest peacetime economic expansion in United States \n     history. One in every 70 United States households filed for \n     bankruptcy in 1998. Rising bankruptcies have an impact on the \n     cost and availability of consumer credit which in turn \n     negatively affect overall economic growth.\n       ``(B) Credit card delinquencies in the United States rose \n     to 1.83 percent in 1998, which is a percentage not seen since \n     1992 when the effects of a recession were still strong.\n       ``(C) The personal savings rate in the United States over \n     the 5 years ending in 1998 averaged only 4.5 percent. In the \n     third quarter of 1999, the personal savings rate dropped to \n     1.8 percent. A decline in savings rates reduces potential \n     investment and economic growth.\n       ``(D) By 2030, the number of older persons in the United \n     States will grow to 70,000,000, more than twice the number of \n     older persons in the United States in 1997. The additional \n     older persons will add significantly to the population of \n     retirees in the United States and require a shift in private \n     and public resources to attend to their specific needs.
