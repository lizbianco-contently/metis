Mr. President, over the weekend in Nebraska, I met with a \nnumber of agricultural producers about the current prices in American \nagriculture. Over the last 3 weeks, my staff and I have spoken to over \n100 agricultural producers in the State of Nebraska--hog producers, \ncattle producers, grain producers; and then the second rim, the outer \nrim representing the agricultural community--bankers, implement \ndealers, automobile dealers. All had a consistent theme as to what we \nmust do to direct our attention and our effort to dealing with this \ncrisis in America.\n  As we begin debate today on the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture \nappropriations bill and on the emergency appropriation for agriculture, \nwe should keep in mind some important dynamics about American \nagriculture. Leaders of both parties in the Senate committed last week \nto including in the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill an \nemergency funding measure to provide the short-term assistance needed \nfor our agricultural producers, and that assistance should include \nincreasing the market transition payments--I am confident we will see \nlegislation to do that--lifting the caps on loan deficiency payments, \nand additional funding for crop insurance. I know that part of Freedom \nto Farm in 1996 was the commitment to America's agricultural producers \nto, in fact, reform crop insurance. We are on our way in that area, but \nwe have not yet arrived at that reform.\n  Crop insurance is a very key dynamic to the future of American \nagriculture. The emergency appropriations bill should include relief \nfor livestock producers, and I am confident we will see that in both of \nthe bills that will be presented today, plus other emergency measures.\n  As we address this immediate crisis, we must continue to work on the \nlong-term priorities. The perspective is\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\nclear. We have an immediate problem, and we will address that immediate \nproblem. But let us not lose sight of the long-term priorities for \nAmerican agriculture.\n  To do that we must focus on the demand side of the equation. When I \ntalk about the demand side of the equation, I am talking about trade. I \nam talking about trade policies that encourage market development and \nthe opening of new markets for our producers. We must continue to work \nfor trade and sanctions reform--another critical component of the 1996 \nfarm bill. I regret to say that Congress and the President have not \ndone a very good job in the area of trade and sanctions reform. We are \nworking on it, but we are a long way from being where we should be.\n  For example, it is estimated that current unilateral sanctions cost \nthe U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year. Who do we penalize? \nWho do we hurt? We hurt ourselves. We must stop using agricultural \npolicy as a foreign policy weapon. Instead, we must extend a strong \nmessage to our customers and competitors around the world that U.S. \nagricultural producers are consistent and reliable suppliers of quality \nand plentiful agricultural products.\n  We need fast track authority for the President in order to reach \ntrade agreements that will open more markets to our agricultural goods \nand allow our producers to compete on a level playing field.\n  Today we stand in a situation that is unprecedented in the last 25 \nyears. This President of the United States has been without fast track \nnegotiating authority since 1994. Obviously, there has been a lack of \nfocus on priority on this issue. Every day the President does not have \nthe authority to negotiate trade treaties and arrangements and deals, \nthe European Union is doing it; the South American trade organization \nMercosur is doing it; others are doing it. We are not. Do we not \nunderstand that we will pay a very significant price, a high price, for \nbeing moved out of those markets because we have not placed trade as a \nhigh priority? Fast track authority is certainly a very clear example.\n  We must work to break down protectionist barriers in the next round \nof the World Trade Organization negotiations being held this fall in \nSeattle and strongly oppose the European Union's delay on lifting the \nban on hormone-enhanced beef.\n  We should work with China to encourage its entrance into the WTO. Do \nwe really not understand that it is surely in the best interests of \nAmerica, stability in the world, and new markets for all American \nproducts to have China in the World Trade Organization, not cutting \ncorners but complying with all the necessary criteria to be a member of \nthe WTO? It is in our best interests to continue to bring China into \nresponsible organizations where China has more responsibility and \naccountability and opens a market of 1.3 billion people. We need more \nfocus in that effort.\n  The President must make trade a top priority. He must make trade a \ntop priority and then lead. It is not good enough to say our trade \nambassador will negotiate. The President sets the agenda; the President \nsets the priority. Presidents lead. The next President of the United \nStates is going to be consumed with an immense series of challenges. \nThe Congress needs to place a higher priority on working in these \nchallenges.\n  We must fulfill our commitment to American agriculture for tax and \nregulatory reform. Our national tax policy should encourage long-term \ninvestment in production agriculture that helps our current producers \nstay in business.\n  We must reduce Government regulation and cut taxes. There are a \nnumber of things we can do, that we promised we would do in 1996:\n  Eliminate the estate tax. Our family farmers should not have to sell \nthe family farm to pay taxes in order to keep the farm going. That cuts \nright to the core for our future and for the next generation of \nfarmers;\n  Provide capital gains tax relief on the sale of the farmland by our \nproducers, expanding on the exclusion given to homeowners in 1997. \nEventually, we should abolish capital gains taxes. The Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, affirmed his view on that before \nthe Senate Banking Committee;\n  Create tax-deferred farm and ranch risk management accounts to help \nease fluctuations in income, thereby giving our producers another \nmanagement tool;\n  Ensure that farmers and ranchers receive the full benefits of the \npermanent income-averaging provisions and not lose them because of the \nalternative minimum tax;\n  Obviously, we must eliminate the marriage penalty and provide 100 \npercent deductibility for health insurance premiums.\n  These are real; these connect; they are relevant. They will help \nAmerican agriculture; they will help our country.\n  We must ease the regulatory burdens on our agricultural producers. \nThe USDA, the EPA, and other regulatory agencies hit farmers with \ndozens of different regulations that tie up their land, they tie up \ntheir time, they tie up their capital, and reduce their efficiency and \nreduce their profits. To what end? What is the cost-benefit ratio?\n  Let's take a real-life example. Two of our biggest competitors, \nBrazil and Argentina, have been gaining in their share of the world's \ncommodity trade, especially in corn and wheat. The Brazilians and the \nArgentines are able to make a profit on these crops at prices lower \nthan production costs in the United States.\n  Why? There are many reasons we can measure. I will state a couple. \nThe Brazilians and Argentines pay much lower taxes than our American \nagricultural producers pay. Second, they have fewer Government \nregulations to contend with. Their Government does not place added \nburdens on them, not only as producers but as marketers. Their \nGovernment actually helps. Their Government doesn't stand in the way. \nWe need to do the same thing.\n  In 1996, we got the Federal Government out of the farmers' fields. \nNow we need to get the Federal Government off the farmers' backs.\n  In the short term, we must swiftly conclude action on an agricultural \nappropriations bill that will provide emergency relief to our commodity \nand our livestock producers. Over the long term, it is good public \npolicy, domestically and internationally, to provide for abundant and \ninexpensive food. We can support that policy by adopting prudent \nGovernment policies, Government policies such as trade policies that \nencourage market development, policies which create international \nfinancial stability.\n  Here is a very clear example of how the globe connects, how all 6 \nbillion people in the world connect. Stability is the base from which \nwe work to help develop emerging democracies, market economies, opening \nnew opportunities and new markets. All of our policies are connected--\nnational defense, foreign policy, trade policy--and ``ground'' all of \nour other policies with an anchor of stability so that the people of \nthe world will have the hope that they must have to have a better world \nand a better life. It gives all people of the world an opportunity to \nbuild bridges to each other.\n  We need tax policies which encourage long-term investments in \nproduction agriculture to help sustain our current producers. These are \nthe most important ways we can help our farmers and our consumers, our \ntaxpayers, and our international trade partners.\n  In the short term, we need to share the risks--yes, share the risks--\nthat from time to time will adversely impact farming, such as has been \nthe case for the last 2 years. We cannot sustain a long-term policy of \nproviding abundant and inexpensive food without occasionally producing \nmore than the market will absorb in the short term. We cannot control \nthe weather or international markets. We need to factor in those \nrealities of farming and not act shocked every time this happens.\n  Most agricultural producers I have spoken to, not just in the last \nmonth but in the last 4 years, 5 years, 10 years, do not believe that \nthe United States should retreat to the 1980 set-aside, higher price \nsupport policies which they believe only extended and deepened problems \nof the 1980s and certainly would extend and deepen the current crisis. \nI agree.\n  To support production agriculture and sustain the producer base which\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\nhas contributed so much to our economic stability and prosperity, we \nneed to provide short-term support to our agricultural producers now.\n  Congress needs to pass a realistic and a responsible emergency \nagriculture bill. The Congress must act this week.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10065-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE REGULATORY OPENNESS AND FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last week, 20 of my colleagues of both \nparties joined me in introducing the Regulatory Openness and Fairness \nAct, a bill to amend the Food Quality Protection Act to ensure that the \nEPA used sound science in its evaluation of pesticide uses. This \nlegislation is particularly relevant given yesterday's announcement by \nthe EPA that they will ban two important pesticides.\n  Let me begin by saying that a safe food supply is, of course, in \neveryone's best interests. We all want to ensure that our children and \nAmerican consumers continue to have access to abundant, safe \nagricultural products. It is in the best interests of consumers and \nagricultural producers that decisions on pesticide uses are based on \nsound scientific analysis--sound scientific analysis. That was the \nintent of the law which passed, with strong bipartisan support, 3 years \nago. In 1996, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act to ensure \nthe safety of our Nation's food supply. It passed with the overwhelming \nsupport of the agricultural industry and was seen as a much-needed \nmodernization of laws governing all pesticide use.\n  As written and signed by the President, the FQPA requires the EPA to \nreassess all of the Nation's pesticides, using more data, taking more \nfactors into account, and allowing greater margins of safety. The FQPA \nalso requires that these standards be based on hard data and sound \nscience, not arbitrary assumptions or computer models.\n  Under the FQPA, next week the EPA faces its first deadline for \nannouncing its evaluation of some 3,000 uses of pesticides. As EPA \nprepares for its deadline, it has not fully used the sound scientific \nanalysis called for in the 1996 FQPA bill. Instead, the EPA has relied \non theoretical computer models and worst case scenarios in many of \nthese cases. The EPA frequently prefers this approach, partly as a \nresult of not having the resources or the time to focus. But this is \nnot what Congress intended in 1996. We did not intend for farmers to \nlose the use of safe and effective pesticides. We did not intend for \npublic health officials dealing with pest control issues to lose the \nproducts that help them protect the public.\n  The bill my colleagues and I have introduced, the Regulatory Openness \nand Fairness Act, makes sure that EPA follows what was the intent of \nCongress 3 years ago. It will lessen the chance that safe and effective \npesticides would be removed from the market without scientific \njustification; it provides a clear and predictable regulatory process \nbased on scientific data; it streamlines the process for evaluating new \npesticides; and it provides Congress with facts on how the act, as \napplied by the EPA, affects agriculture exports.\n  We cannot forget that crop protection allows our farmers to produce \nthe grains, the fruits, and the vegetables that feed not just our \nNation but the world. Unnecessary regulations have a dampening effect \non the engine that has fueled America's economic growth. That engine is \ncalled productivity. If the FQPA is not implemented fully and fairly, \nbased on sound science, we will unnecessarily place our agricultural \nproducers at a very great competitive disadvantage in world markets. \nProduction prices will increase, productivity will decrease, and \nconsequently our farmers will see their exports decline. This is hardly \nthe time to be placing extra, unnecessary burdens on America's farmers.\n  This bill is good for both consumers and agricultural producers. \nConsumers will continue to have safe, affordable, and abundant \nagricultural goods and farmers will continue to have the tools they \nneed to produce safe, quality food products and to compete in the world \nmarket.\n  In Nebraska, we call that common sense. I am proud to join my 20 \ncolleagues in a strong bipartisan effort to introduce the Regulatory \nFairness and Openness Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10065-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10065-S10067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LITTLE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of one segment of \nthis Congress. We are about to break for an August recess which is an \nopportunity for Members to be back in their States and with their \nfamilies. I am looking forward to that, as I am sure are many of my \ncolleagues. But it is a good time for us to reflect on what we have \ndone and what we have failed to do in the last several months.\n  Each of us is elected with a responsibility to come to Washington and \ntry to respond to some of the challenges facing families and \nindividuals and businesses across America. I am sad to report as of \nthis moment we have little to show for our efforts this year. The \nColumbine shooting, which focused the attention of America on violence \nin our schools, rallied the Senate in a rare bipartisan fashion to deal \nwith violence in schools. We passed the Juvenile Justice Act, which had \nsensible gun control provisions contained in it, and tried as well to \nattack this culture of violence which is becoming more dominant in our \nsociety.\n  If you will recall, it was a tie vote, 50-50. The tie was broken by \nVice President Gore, the bill passed, it went over to the House, and \nwas hopelessly mired down by the efforts of the gun lobby because of \ntheir resistance to any changes in gun control. So we are here today, \nthe first part of August, with literally nothing to show for this whole \nissue of school safety. By the time we return, our kids will be back in \nschool, another school year will have started, and this Congress will \nhave failed to react to a problem that is on everyone's mind.\n  The second issue, one that continues to haunt us, is the issue of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Yesterday, I was in Bloomington, IL, and met \nwith a group of doctors and nurses at hospitals to talk about what is \nhappening with health insurance, how families feel so helpless when \nhealth insurance clerks are making decisions that doctors should make. \nWhen we tried to address it on the floor, sadly, we were defeated by \nthe health insurance lobby, a lobby which continues to spend millions \nof dollars to overcome our efforts on behalf of patients and families. \nThat, again, is another issue with which we failed to deal.\n  Finally, of course, we will be talking a lot this week about the tax \nbreak as well as the whole question of the budget. There are many of us \nwho think the action by the Senate last week was not a very wise one. \nWe have a chance now, if our economy recovers and continues to grow, to \ngenerate a surplus. Then we have to decide what to do with it. First \nand foremost, I think we should do no harm to this economy. The economy \nmoves forward, creating jobs and businesses and new housing starts. Yet \nAlan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman, warns Congress on a \nweekly basis not to pass the Republican tax cut package, a $800 billion \ntax cut primarily for wealthy individuals, which could fuel the fires \nof inflation and raise interest rates, jeopardizing home mortgages, \nbusiness loans, and family farmers, who are trying to stay in business.\n  First and foremost, we ought to be cautioned that Alan Greenspan, who \nhas no partisan interest in whose ox is gored in this battle, has \nwarned us do not do it. Second, even when I go home and speak to the \nmost conservative Republicans in my home State of Illinois, they say: \nIf you have a surplus, Senator, for goodness' sake, the first thing you \nought to do is get rid of the national debt, the $5.7 trillion we have \namassed in debts over the last, well,\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\ntwo centuries plus, most of it in the last 10 or 15 years. That debt \ncosts us $1 billion a day. All across America we collect payroll taxes \nand income taxes--for what? To pay the interest on the debt, not to do \nsomething good and new for this country; not to improve education or \nthe safety of our streets or to build new highways or mass transit. No, \nit is interest on the national debt.\n  So on the Democratic side, we think the highest priority, if there is \nto be a surplus, is to eliminate that debt. What legacy do we want to \nleave to our children? Wouldn't it be great to leave them a debt-free \nAmerica and say to them: You have it here, the best country in the \nworld, a history and tradition you can be proud of, and you do not have \nto pay for the debts of our generation.\n  That to me is so basic, so sound, in opposition to the concept that \nwe are somehow going to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people among \nus as an alternative.\n  If we are going to do that and reduce the debt, we can do it in a \nfashion that is fair to everyone and do it in a way that preserves \nSocial Security and Medicare. Many senior citizens are not even aware \nof the fact the Medicare system is in trouble. Yet it is. They would \nlike to see Medicare expanded, as I would, to cover prescription drugs \nand to be even a better program so seniors can remain healthy and \nindependent for a longer period of time. But, sadly, the Republican \napproach to this includes no money for Medicare, no money for Medicare \nout of this surplus. Do you know what that means? Seniors who are \nstriving to be independent and healthy will not get a helping hand when \nthey should. That is what this budget and tax debate has been about.\n\n  Sadly, that is where we find ourselves as we head toward the August \nrecess--our failure to enact the juvenile justice bill to make our \nschools safer; our failure to enact the Patients' Bill of Rights so \nthat people across America who have health insurance can believe they \nhave a doctor they can trust and a doctor who is making decisions for \nthem and their family; our failure to enact a bill to deal with our \nsurplus which is responsible, a bill that will not jeopardize the \neconomy, a law which, in fact, will make sure we reduce our debt and \nreduce these interest payments which we have to pay; and something that \ndeals with the whole question of the solvency and future of Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  When I look at this Congress, it is sad, with all the talent we have \non both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat alike, that we have \nbeen unable to come to any conclusion where we can go home in the month \nof August and point with pride to what we have accomplished.\n  Unfortunately, there is little we can point to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from California \nfor a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for crystallizing where we are. When \nthe Senator says we will go home and there is nothing we can point to, \nhe is right. What happened to the juvenile justice bill and all the \nsensible gun control measures? Every day we wake up to some other \nhorrible incident, and we are doing nothing to protect our children and \nour people from gun violence. It strikes me that the same thing \nhappened with the Patients' Bill of Rights--nothing. The kind of sham \nbill that came across this place and passed isn't going to make any \nlives better.\n  But then, it seems to me, when our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle do something, they do something bad. My friend was alluding \nto it. I just want to ask a couple questions on that point.\n  Is it not a fact that the tax bill which we passed did not allocate \none slim dime for Medicare?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is a fact. It has been a sad commentary that we know \nin the year 2015, if I am not mistaken, the Medicare system, as we know \nit--this current system--is going to go bankrupt, be insolvent. Many \nseniors want additional benefits to help them stay healthy and \nindependent, like the prescription drug program which we support. When \nwe made an effort on the floor, in a vote just last week we could not \nrally any support from the Republican side of the aisle for the \nprescription drug program so that seniors can stay independent and \nhealthy. That, I think, is a shame.\n  I would like to go home this August and say to seniors and those of \nus soon to be in the program: We have done something positive. You can \nlive a longer, more independent, and healthier life. But we can't even \npoint to that. Instead, the Republicans suggest we can give tax cuts to \nwealthy people and special tax breaks to certain businesses.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to pick up on that Medicare question. Because when \nmy friend said seniors want to live fuller lives, this is so true. That \nis where we are now. We have come such a long way with our health \nresearch and with our ability to take certain prescription drugs that \nhelp us live fuller lives; that when we look out into the future, with \nthe demographic changes that are coming, this is our biggest challenge. \nHow do we make sure that when we pass age 60, 65, 70, 75, we are living \nfull lives?\n  This tax bill turns its back on this whole matter by doing zero for \nMedicare. They can say: Oh, we left a whole lot of money over here, and \nwe can possibly use it, but the fact is, it is zero for something we \nknow is coming down the road at us and something that is very \nimportant.\n  So it seems to me--and I would just ask my friend to comment; then I \nwill yield the floor--that when we go home, assuming this Republican \ntax bill continues to roll--and from what we can tell it may well \ncontinue to roll right through--what will have been done will be bad \nfor Medicare, bad for paying down the debt, and threatens this economy. \nJust listen to Alan Greenspan. He is the one my friends from the other \nside of the aisle have followed very religiously.\n  Suddenly, Alan Greenspan gets up and says: You better not now. Don't \nstimulate this economy now. You could threaten recovery. They roll \nright over Alan Greenspan, and they are going to roll right over us. So \nwe are going to go home and probably say they didn't do what they \nshould have done on juvenile justice, sensible gun control, HMOs--\nfighting against them--and what they did do threatens this economic \nrecovery and does nothing for Medicare. It is a bad deal all the way \naround.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute in \nmorning business.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from California, I agree with \nher. The sad thing is, if we give these tax cuts to the wealthiest \namong us, as proposed by the Republican bill, we are going to \nultimately shortchange, in the outyears, some critically important \nprograms for America, such as education.\n  Think about it. As we go into the 21st century, with all the demands \non our children, what they need to learn to be competitive and succeed \nis the very best educational system. The Republicans, with their tax \nbill to create shortfalls in spending on education, are really \nshortsighted.\n  So as you look at it, here we stand on the third day of August, about \nto adjourn at the end of this week, with precious little to point to. \nWe have been here for months. We have not listened to the American \npeople. We have not responded to them. As we go home, I hope that we \ncan build up some bipartisan approach as we conclude this year to \naddress safety in schools, the Patients' Bill of Rights, and a sensible \napproach to using any budget surplus that is good for the long-term \nneeds of America.\n  I thank the Senator from California for joining me on the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed, is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that a fellow in my office, Ms. \nBarbara Murray, be granted floor privileges during the pendency of my \ndiscussion on the child care quality incentive bill.\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reed pertaining to the introduction of S. 1475 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I wanted an opportunity to talk about the \nfarm crisis that is now facing our country, and certainly facing my \nState. I represent North Dakota, which is one of the most agricultural \nStates in the Nation. There is no question that our farmers are facing \na crisis of really unprecedented proportion.\n  As I go around my State, every place that I have a farm meeting, \nfarmers have a sense of hopelessness. One of the reasons is that is \nhappening to farm income. I have just come from a hearing where the \nSecretary of Agriculture is testifying. We were talking there about the \npattern of farm income. It is very interesting, if you back out \nGovernment payments, which have been increasing now in the last several \nyears in response to this economic calamity--in 1996, farm income \nabsent Government payments was $46 billion.\n  This year farm income, absent Government payments, is estimated to be \n$27 billion. Farm income from the prices that farmers receive for the \ncommodities they sell is in a virtual free-fall.\n  This chart shows headlines from the newspapers back home talking \nabout what is happening to farm prices. The first one is from the major \npaper in our State: ``Going down, down, down. USDA sees lower prices \nfor wheat, corn, soybeans, and other major crops.''\n  Another major story: ``Lower crop prices predicted.''\n  Again, the story is the same--collapsing farm prices.\n  Farmers have been hurt by more than low prices. They have been hurt \nby what I call the ``triple whammy'' of bad prices, bad weather, and \nbad policy.\n  The bad prices are right at the heart of what is causing this farm \ncollapse. This chart shows farm prices of two major commodities, wheat \nand barley, for a 53-year period. It really tells the story.\n  These are inflation-adjusted prices. So we are comparing apples to \napples.\n  These are what farmers have been receiving for these major \ncommodities from 1946 to 1999. You can see that the blue line is wheat. \nWheat has gone from almost $18 a bushel back in the 1940s to about \n$2.50 a bushel today--a long-term price decline without many real \ninterruptions, although we saw a major one back in the 1970s. We all \nremember that period when farm prices skyrocketed. But absent that, we \nhave really been in a long-term price decline for wheat, barley, and \nmany other commodities as well.\n  I think this chart tells a very important story because it compares \nthe prices farmers receive for what they sell and the prices they pay \nfor what they buy.\n  The green line goes back to 1991 and shows what prices farmers are \npaying for the inputs that they must buy to produce crops. You can see \nthat the prices farmers pay have been going up very sharply. On the \nother hand, prices that farmers have been receiving went up to a peak \nin 1996--interestingly enough, right at the time we passed the last \nfarm bill. In fact, we were told at the time we would see permanently \nhigh farm prices. That proved to be absolutely wrong. Those permanently \nhigh prices lasted about 90 days. Since then, we have seen a virtual \nprice collapse.\n  Just as I indicated before, prices farmers have been receiving have \nbeen dropping dramatically, and the prices for the things they pay have \nbeen rising inexorably. That creates this enormous gap between the \nprices they are paying and the prices they are receiving. That is what \nhas led to that reduction in farm income I talked about in my initial \nremarks. This is a crisis by any definition.\n  If we look at what is happening to individual commodities in \nrelationship to the prices farmers receive and the actual costs of \nproducing those commodities, we can see it very clearly.\n  This is what has happened with respect to wheat prices. The green \nline is the cost of production. The red line is the prices farmers are \nreceiving for their product. You can see the prices farmers receive are \nfar below the costs of producing the product. That is what has led to \nthis cash flow crunch. That is why farmers are telling us: If you do \nnot take dramatic action, tens of thousands of us are going to go out \nof business.\n  In my State, the estimates are that we will lose 20 or 30 percent of \nour farmers in the next 18 months unless we act. Let me repeat that. In \nNorth Dakota, we are being told by the experts at the State university \nand major farm organizations that unless we act we will lose 20 to 30 \npercent of the farmers in my State in the next 18 months. That is a \ncrisis.\n  It is not just in wheat. You see the same pattern. This is soybeans. \nWe don't grow many soybeans in North Dakota. Soybeans are grown further \nsouth and to the east. But you can see the same kind of pattern.\n  Here is the cost of production. Here is what the farmers are \nreceiving. Since 1997, farmers are well below the cost of production \nwith respect to soybeans. In wheat, the pattern is the same, and in \nsoybeans. But there are other crops as well that are critically \nimportant.\n  This shows what has happened in corn. The red line again is the \nprice. The green line is the cost of production. Since 1997, we have \nbeen below the cost of production in corn.\n  You can't stay in business very long in that circumstance. You can't \nstay in business very long when you are getting less in terms of a \nprice for your product than what it costs you to produce that product. \nYou can hang in there a while as you give up equity and as you go \nbackwards on your balance sheet, but at some point the banker comes \ncalling. He says: Mr. farmer, you are out of business. You can't \ncontinue to lose equity.\n  The result has been that we have started to lose farm families in my \nState in a very dramatic way. Back in 1989 we had over 28,000 family \nfarmers in our State. We can see that we held that in 1990, and in 1991 \nwe saw a drop of about a thousand farmers. Then, in 1992, we actually \ngot some recovery. In 1993, we dropped down to about 26,000. Since \nthen, it has been a constant erosion, so that now we are down to about \n22,000 family-sized farms in our State. It is really a dramatic decline \nin the last 20 years--almost a 20-percent drop.\n  Remember what I said. The experts are telling us now that we could \nsee another 20-percent drop in just the next 18 months--perhaps even \nmore than that; perhaps even as much as a 30-percent loss unless we \nact.\n  What are the reasons for this? Part of the reason is the financial \ncollapse in Asia and the financial collapse in Russia because those \nwere major customers for our farm commodities. But there are other \nreasons as well.\n  I believe one of the key reasons is the budget decisions that were \nmade at the time of the last farm bill. The last farm bill had some \nstrengths to it, some pluses. The biggest strength, I believe, is the \nflexibility it provided to farmers to plant for the market rather than \na farm program. But we also made some budget decisions at the time that \nmade it very difficult to write any kind of reasonable farm bill.\n  This chart shows what I am talking about. It shows the resources that \nwere provided to agriculture under the previous farm bill. That \naveraged $10 billion a year. The new farm bill provided $5 billion a \nyear. In other words, the support for agriculture was cut in half at \nthe time of the last farm bill.\n  That has special implications because if we look at what was \nhappening\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\nwith our major competitors, we see that they were doing something quite \ndifferently. While we were dramatically cutting our support for \nproducers, our European competitors--our major competitors--were \nmaintaining very high levels of support. The Europeans were spending, \non average, $44 billion a year--on average, $6 billion for us. This is \nfrom 1996 to 1999, just those 3 years. You can see that the Europeans \nreally have us whipsawed. They are outspending us seven to one. They \nare winning their competition the old-fashioned way. They are buying \nthese markets. That is what the Europeans are up to.\n  Unfortunately, we are engaged in unilateral disarmament. We are \ncutting in the face of massive superiority on the other side. One of \nthe chief trade negotiators for the Europeans told me several years \nago: Senator, we believe we are in a trade war in agriculture. We \nbelieve at some point there will be a cease-fire. We believe there will \nbe a cease-fire in place, and we want to occupy the high ground. The \nhigh ground is market share.\n  That is exactly what they are up to. And how well it is working. They \nhave gone, in 20 years, from being major importers to being major \nexporters. In fact, they have surpassed the United States in terms of \nagriculture exports. One of the ways they have done it is to spend \nenormous sums of money to put themselves in a position of superiority.\n\n  This chart shows how the European Union is flooding the world with \nagricultural export subsidies. This is the European share of world \nagricultural export subsidies, accounting for nearly 84 percent of all \nworld agricultural export subsidies; the United States' share, this \nlittle red piece of the pie, is 1.4 percent. They are outgunning the \nUnited States 60 to 1.\n  It is no wonder farm income is declining. It is no wonder exports are \ndeclining. It is no wonder our farmers are under enormous pressure. \nThey are under enormous pressure because our European friends have a \nplan and a strategy to dominate world agricultural trade. Again, they \nare doing it the old-fashioned way: They are buying these markets. They \nthink the United States is asleep. They think we will not fight back. \nThey have told me: Senator, we think you are so prosperous in so many \nother areas, you will give up on agriculture.\n  So far, we are proving them right. We are engaged in unilateral \ndisarmament in a trade confrontation. We would never do it in a \nmilitary confrontation. Why are we doing it? Why are we giving up and \nletting them dominate world agricultural trade? What are the \nimplications this fall when we go to negotiate with them? I can tell \nyou what I believe the implications are. I believe we are headed for a \nguaranteed loss.\n  I was referring to the trade negotiator for the Europeans saying to \nme they believe we are in a trade war. They believe at some point there \nwill be a cease-fire. They believe there will be a cease-fire in place, \nand they want to occupy the high ground. The high ground is market \nshare. He is right. That is the high ground. We are headed into \nnegotiations with them this fall, and we have no leverage. How will we \npossibly get a good result when they have America outspent 7 to 1 in \noverall support, 60 to 1 in export subsidies? How are we going to win \nthat negotiation? What is our leverage to change this relationship? \nThere is no leverage. We are going to lose unless we do something.\n  I personally believe we have to rearm in agriculture, to put more \nresources into the fight, to send the Europeans a clear and \nunmistakable message that the United States is not going to roll over; \nwe are not going to surrender; we are not going to wave a white flag \nand turn over world agricultural trade to them; we will insist on a \nlevel playing field.\n  In the last trade negotiation, that gap existed as well. The \nEuropeans have a much higher level of support than we have. Did that \ngap close? Did our level of support go up? Did the European level go \ndown? Did the gap close? No, it did not. Instead, we got equal \npercentage reductions on both sides from an unequal base, leaving the \nEuropeans in the superior position.\n  If we look back at the last trade negotiation, we got a 36-percent \nreduction in export trade subsidy and a 24-percent reduction in \ninternal support on both sides. But the Europeans were at a much higher \nlevel. When there are equal percentage reductions from unequal bases, \nthe Europeans remain in a superior position. It does not take a whole \nlot to figure out that if we continue that pattern of equal percentage \nreductions from an unequal basis, we will continue to leave the \nEuropeans in a superior position; we will continue to leave our farmers \nat a competitive disadvantage; we will continue to sign the death \nwarrant of tens of thousands of family farmers.\n  That is the hard reality of what we confront. We have before the \nSenate a disaster response. It is clearly called for. It is clearly \nnecessary to meet this collapse of farm income and to meet these \nadverse weather conditions.\n  With respect to weather, in my State there are 3 million acres of \nland not even planted this year. There are millions more planted very \nlate because of overly wet conditions. It may sound strange out here on \nthe east coast. I saw a story in an east coast newspaper that in one \nlocation they are out painting the grass green because of the drought. \nWe can't paint a crop; we can't go out and paint wheat and somehow make \nit healthy. We can't paint corn. It doesn't work. Maybe one can paint a \nlawn. I have never seen that done. It sounds rather bizarre to me, but \nthat is what they were doing in New Jersey the other day. They were \npainting the lawn green, trying to respond to this drought. That is an \nunusual response. But it is not going to work in agriculture. Farmers \nin West Virginia, in Delaware, and in Maryland cannot go out and paint \na crop. That will not do the job. The fact is, they don't have a crop.\n  In my part of the country it is not drought; it is overly wet \nconditions, 5 and 6 years of incredibly wet conditions. You cannot even \nget into the fields to plant. There has to be a disaster response. It \nhas to deal with the bad weather. It has to deal with these ruinously \nlow prices. Yes, it has to deal with the bad policy of putting our \nfarmers at a severe disadvantage to their European competitors.\n  We are telling our farmers: Go out there and compete against the \nFrench farmer, the German farmer; and while you are at it, take on the \nFrench and German Governments as well. That is not a fair fight. We \nhave to help level the playing field.\n  Yes, there has to be a disaster response, absolutely. But there has \nto be more than that. There has to be a long-term policy response. We \nhave to be able to say to our European competitors that the United \nStates is not going to roll over; we are not going to surrender; we are \nnot going to give up the agricultural markets; we intend to fight.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation we call the Fight bill, \nFarm Income and Equity Act, to level the playing field. If the \nEuropeans are going to play the game this way, we will play it that \nway. We will fight back. We will put our farmers in a place that they \ncan compete. That is fair. That puts us in a position to go to the next \ntrade talks and have a chance to come out winners rather than losers.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I don't recall when the Senator began talking, but we \nwere to go back on the bill at 10:30. I understand we are not on the \nbill. I was going to ask if the Senator would yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield. I just reached the conclusion.\n  I am happy to yield with the concluding thought that we do need to \nrespond. We need to respond to this disaster emergency. We also need to \nrespond with a longer-term policy change.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10068-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10068-S10069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 244\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Anderson\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 244.--Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1999\n       Summary: S. 244 would authorize the appropriations of $224 \n     million to the Department of Interior (DOI) to make grants to \n     the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System for the construction \n     of a drinking water supply project. The Lewis and Clark Rural \n     Water System is a group of cities and rural areas in \n     southeastern South Dakota, northwestern Iowa, and \n     southwestern Minnesota. CBO estimates that implementing S. \n     244 would cost $62 million over the 2000-2004 period, with \n     the rest of the authorized spending coming after 2004.\n       Enactment of this bill would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not \n     apply. The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act (UMRA). State and local governments might incur some \n     costs as a result of the bill's enactment, but these costs \n     would be voluntary.\n       Estimated Cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 244 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within the budget function \n     300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         By fiscal year, in millions of\n                                                    dollars\n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                        2000   2001   2002   2003   2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthorization Level..................    224      0      0      0      0\nEstimated Outlays....................      1      2      9     25     25\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of Estimate: For purposes of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that the full amount of the authorization will be \n     provided in 2000. We estimated the annual amount of spending \n     on this drinking water system construction project using \n     information from the local water system and historical \n     spending rates for similar projects. Completion of this \n     project is expected to take about 12 years.\n       Pay-as-You-Go Considerations: None.\n       Estimated Impact on State, Local and Tribal Governments: S. \n     244 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined UMRA. \n     The bill would require that the nonfederal share of project \n     costs equal 20 percent, except for the incremental cost of \n     participation in the project by the city of Sioux Falls.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to \npay tribute to the life of Captain Jennifer Shafer Odom. She died on a \nmountainside in Colombia--where she was defending our Nation and our \nvalues.\n  This morning, her grieving family is at Dover Air Force Base--to \nbring their daughter home for the last time.\n  On July 23, Captain Odom was on an Army reconnaissance plane that was \nflying near a major drug-producing region of Colombia. During bad \nweather, the plane crashed into a mountainside--killing the five \nAmericans and two Colombians on board. These brave soldiers were \ncasualties in our war against drugs. They were fighting to keep drugs \noff our streets and out of our schools. They know that this is \nessential to our national security and our national values.\n  Captain Odom grew up in Brunswick, Maryland. She was a valedictorian \nat Brunswick High School. She was active in so many areas--from sports \nto theater.\n  As a scholar, an athlete and a leader--it's not surprising that she \nchose to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. She wanted to \nuse her many talents to serve her country.\n  She graduated from West Point in the top quarter of her class. She \nserved in the United States Army with valor and distinction--raising to \nrank of Captain.\n  But it is not just for her accomplishments that she will be missed. \nI've spoken to her family several times in the past few days. What \ncomes across is their pride in the kind of person that she was. She was \nso dear to her friends and neighbors that the entire community joined \nin a prayer chain to pray for her and for her family.\n  Captain Jennifer Shafer Odom served our country with distinction. Her \ncourage and her sacrifice remind us that our freedom abides in the \nheroism of pilots like Captain Odom.\n  Her death was a tragedy--but her life was a triumph. She leaves \nbehind a grieving husband, and her heartbroken parents. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in keeping Captain Odom and her family in our \nprayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10069-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10069-S10070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS' ASSETS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Holocaust Era \nAssets Tax Exclusion Act amendment to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999. \nI am pleased that this amendment was cleared on both sides of the aisle \nand has been accepted by the full United States Senate. The passage of \nthe Abraham-Fitzgerald-Moynihan-Schumer Holocaust Era Assets Tax \nExclusion Act amendment by unanimous consent, demonstrates beyond \nshadow of a doubt the United States Senate's firm solidarity with those \nwho suffered during the Holocaust. In addition, I would like to offer \nmy sincere gratitude to Chairman Roth for his leadership and support \nduring this process, without which we might not have had this \nopportunity to pass such important legislation.\n  The passing decades have not obscured the horrors of the Nazi regime \nand the horrors it committed during its 12 years in power. Many people \nin America and around the world live every day with memories of \natrocities they suffered during this terrible time. Rounded up, placed \nin ghettoes or death camps, left to starve or tortured and murdered, \nmillions had their lives taken from them, figuratively and literally.\n  We must never forget these atrocities. Thanks to the hard work of \nmany, particularly within the Jewish community, we have numerous \nreminders of this inhumanity which can and should increase our \nawareness and our commitment to preventing any such events from \noccurring ever again. But there is more that we must do. Only recently \nhas public attention been properly directed toward another great crime \nof the Nazi regime and those who cooperated with it: the systematic \nlooting of Jewish economic assets. In addition to committing outright \ntheft and looting, the Nazis seized liquid assets that could be \nconverted easily into cash, such as insurance policy proceeds and bank \naccounts. Documents discovered over the past several years show that \nthe Nazis specifically targeted insurance policies held by Jews as a \nsource of funding for their expansionist, totalitarian regime.\n  I am sorry to say that some insurance companies also specifically \n(and illegally) targeted Jewish families. Knowing that Jewish policy \nholders soon would be taken to concentration camps, these firms sold \nspecifically tailored policies, taking as much cash as possible up \nfront, with no intention of honoring their obligations.\n  After the war, Holocaust survivors struggling to restart their lives \ntried to collect on their policies, access their bank accounts and/or \nreclaim assets that had been illegally seized from them. Unfortunately, \ngovernments, banks, and insurance companies failed to fulfill their \nduty to treat Holocaust victims with justice and dignity. Instead, they \nrefused to honor policies or return stolen assets. In this way, \nsurvivors of the Holocaust were victimized\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\ntwice, first by the Nazis, then by the financial institutions that \ndeprived them of their assets.\n  Today, after over 50 years of injustice, Holocaust survivors and \ntheir families are finally reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. It is \nhigh time these victims of oppression finally got back some of the \nproperty stolen from them. It also is time, in my view, that the rest \nof us stood up to protect them from further raids on their assets. \nUnder current law, any money received by Holocaust survivors in their \nsettlements with banks and other organizations that once cooperated \nwith the Nazis is treated as gross income for federal tax purposes. And \nthat's just plain wrong.\n  My colleagues and I offer this amendment to prevent the federal \ngovernment from imposing income tax on any settlement payments, \nreceived by Holocaust survivors or their families resulting from a \nHolocaust claim. We do so because we feel it is morally imperative that \nwe stand with the victims of this injustice, and that this nation not \ntreat as income what is in fact the return of what had been stolen.\n  Specifically, our amendment would allow a Holocaust survivor or the \nsurviving heirs to receive a tax exemption for any monies received as \npayment resulting from a Holocaust claim from any international fund \nfor survivors.\n  This would include settlements from the action ``In re Holocaust \nVictims' Asset Litigation'' or any other similar lawsuit, including \nactions already settled.\n  Also included would be the value of any land recovered from a foreign \ngovernment as a result of a settlement arising out of the illegal \nconfiscation of such land in connection with the Holocaust.\n  The victims of the Holocaust have suffered far too much for any such \ntaxation to be just. These settlements represent but a fraction of what \nis owed to those who suffered under Nazi tyranny. To treat them as \nincome subject to taxation would be to add a new injury to the old.\n  Mr. President, we cannot undo the evil acts of the Nazi regime. But \nwe can put ourselves firmly on the side of those who suffered so \nunjustly by passing this amendment. By excluding Holocaust settlement \nmonies from taxation, we will show that we understand what justice \ndemands of us as we face the continuing consequences of an unjust \nregime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10070-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10070-S10071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         KOSOVO'S DEADLY LEGACY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as NATO soldiers struggle to keep the peace \nin Kosovo, war crimes investigators labor to identify and exhume bodies \nfrom hundreds of mass graves, and the costly effort to rebuild homes \nand communities gets underway, we are seeing a repeat of many of the \nchallenges that confront any post-conflict society.\n  One I want to mention today is a threat that is hidden among the \ndebris, killing and horribly injuring civilians and NATO peacekeepers \nindiscriminately as they work to rebuild what was destroyed in the war.\n  The threat is unexploded ordnance, and in Kosovo that means landmines \nleft by the Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army, and cluster bombs \ndropped by NATO forces, mostly by American aircraft.\n  I have often spoken about the problem of landmines. There are tens of \nthousands of them scattered in the fields, forests, and roads of \nKosovo.\n  Each one is designed to blow the legs off the unsuspecting person who \ntriggers it. Usually it is a farmer, or child, or some other innocent \nperson trying to rebuild a normal life. The United States is helping to \nclear the mines, but it is a tedious, costly, and dangerous job.\n  But even more than landmines, it is unexploded cluster bombs which \npose the greatest danger to civilians and NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo.\n  Cluster bombs are a favorite antipersonnel weapon of the U.S. \nmilitary, and hundreds of thousands of them were dropped by NATO planes \nover Kosovo. They cover wide areas, are designed to explode on impact, \nand they spread shrapnel in all directions.\n  People and lightly armored vehicles are the usual targets, but since \ncluster bombs are often dropped from high altitudes they often miss the \ntarget.\n  Not only do they too often miss the target, between 5 and 20 percent \nof cluster bombs do not explode on impact. According to the State \nDepartment, there may be as many as 11,000 of these deadly bomblets \ncurrently lying on Kosovo soil, waiting for someone, anyone, to walk or \ndrive by and set them off.\n  Unlike landmines, their location cannot be accurately mapped. We do \nnot know where they are. Like landmines, it is the victim who pulls the \ntrigger.\n  The usual victims of these explosions, like landmines, are innocent \ncivilians, not military targets. And they remain active for years. In \nLaos, where millions of United States cluster bombs were dropped during \nthe Vietnam war a quarter century ago, people are still losing their \nlives, their limbs, and their eyesight from these weapons.\n  Cluster bombs do not discriminate. NATO peacekeepers are not immune. \nChildren are not immune. Approximately 5 Kosovars each day are killed \nby unexploded ordnance, mostly U.S. cluster bombs. Over 170 people have \ndied this way since the war ended.\n  Even though we have known about this problem for decades, little has \nbeen done to try to minimize the harm to civilians from cluster bombs.\n  Recently, to its credit, the Pentagon began studying this problem. \nThere are two things that could and should be done immediately.\n  First, we need to significantly reduce or eliminate the problem of \ndud cluster bombs that remain active and dangerous. We have the \ntechnology to make landmines self-destruct or self-deactivate after a \nshort period of time.\n  Why can't that same technology--usually a simple battery that runs \nout after a few hours--be applied to cluster bombs? It needs to be \ndone.\n  Second, the Pentagon should revisit its rules of engagement for using \ncluster bombs. In Kosovo, NATO showered cluster bombs over densely \npopulated areas. Was this militarily necessary or justified? Was it \nconsistent with international law?\n  Since too often they miss the target, what limits should be imposed \non where and when cluster bombs can be used so the innocent are not \nharmed? These questions need answers.\n  I am not the only one concerned about this. The same concerns have \nbeen conveyed to me by active duty and retired members of our Armed \nForces. Just recently, the House Armed Services Committee included \nlanguage in its report accompanying the fiscal year 2000 National \nDefense Appropriation Act, which directs the Secretary of Defense to \nestablish a defense-wide program to develop affordable, reliable self-\ndestruct fuses for munitions.\n  I see a real problem, and countless tragedies, resulting from the way \nthese munitions are designed and used. We can do better.\n  There is always too much death and destruction in any military \nconflict. The lingering threat of landmines and unexploded bombs can be \nsignificantly reduced. If implemented, the changes I have suggested \ncould save many innocent lives in the aftermath of war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a brief article and a \nletter to the editor about cluster bombs that appeared in the August 3 \nWashington Post, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, August 3, 1999]\n\n                           The Remains of War\n\n       U.S. warplanes dropped 1,100 cluster bombs during Operation \n     Allied Force against Yugoslavia, says the Defense Department. \n     Each contained 202 bomblets. That's 222,200 bomblets each. \n     With a dud rate of 5 percent, it is likely, a DOD spokesman \n     said, that about 11,110 bomblets are sitting around \n     unexploded.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Duds Keep On Killing\n\n       The problem of high dud rates in cluster bombs has been \n     well known to the military for years. The 5 percent dud rate \n     mentioned in ``NATO `Duds' Keep Killing in Kosovo'' [front \n     page, July 19] must be characterized as more of a prayer than \n     a fact: Dud rates among cluster munitions were as high as 30 \n     percent during the Vietnam War. Dud rates during the Gulf War \n     were as high as 20 percent.\n       Laos remains littered with millions of duds in unmarked \n     minefields. They continue to kill farmers who strike them \n     with implements and children who mistake them for toys. Many \n     young victims' parents were not even born when the United \n     States dropped these weapons in unprecedented numbers. The \n     grandchildren of Kosovars and Serbs\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\n     alike will die as they discover unexploded bombs in the \n     future.\n       The military was aware of how attractive these ``bomblets'' \n     are. Numerous similar stories came out of the Gulf War \n     explaining that the brightly colored and appealing shapes \n     made unexploded cluster bombs irresistible to child and \n     soldier alike.\n       These weapons should be banned from the U.S. arsenal and \n     arsenals around the world.--Virgil Wiebe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10071-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NEW MILLENNIUM CLASSROOMS ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the New \nMillennium Classrooms Act amendment to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999. \nI am pleased that this amendment was cleared on both sides of the aisle \nand has been accepted by the full United States Senate. The passage of \nthe Abraham-Wyden New Millennium Classrooms Act amendment by unanimous \nconsent, demonstrates beyond shadow of a doubt that the United States \nSenate is firmly committed to bringing quality high technology to \nschools and seniors. This provision will go a long way toward ensuring \nour nation's technological and economic leadership in the New Economy.\n  First, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman \nfor his leadership and support during this process, without which we \nmight not have had this opportunity to pass such important legislation. \nIn addition, I would like to express my thanks to Senator Wyden who has \nworked closely with me to develop this strong legislation which would \nbridge the digital divide between technological haves and have-nots, \nensuring that all our nation's students, and seniors, enjoy access to \nquality technology and the Internet.\n  When I first introduced this legislation, I was joined by Senators \nWyden, Hatch, Kerrey, Coverdell, Daschle, Jeffords, Lieberman, Allard, \nGorton, Burns, and McConnell. Like me, they believe it will encourage \ncompanies and individuals to donate more computers to schools, helping \nthese institutions train kids for jobs in the fast-growing high \ntechnology sector of our economy. Since then we have been joined by 14 \nadditional colleagues from both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, our kids must be prepared for the jobs of the 21st \ncentury, which requires training and experience with computers and the \nInternet. Unfortunately, not enough schools have the equipment they \nneed to teach the essential skills our kids and our nation need to keep \nour economic future bright.\n  Education Secretary Riley recently testified before the Joint \nEconomic Committee, saying that he expects us to see 70 percent growth \nin computer and technology-related jobs in the next six years alone. In \nless then six months, 60 percent of all jobs will require computers.\n  However, Mr. President, our classrooms have too few computers. And \nthe computers they do have are so old and outdated that they cannot run \nthe most basic software or even access the Internet. One of the more \ncommon computers in our schools today is the Apple IIc, a model so \narchaic it is now on display at the Smithsonian.\n  Mr. President, the problem is even worse for those already \ndisadvantaged. A recent Commerce Department report, Falling through the \nNet: Defining the Digital Divide'' shows a growing divide between \ntechnological haves and have-nots. Among the study's findings:\n  The gap between white and black/Hispanic households with incomes \nbetween $15-$35,000 per year has increased, from 8% five years ago to \n13% today.\n  Households with annual incomes of at least $75,000 are more than 20 \ntimes as likely to have Internet access than households at the lowest \nincome levels.\n  All this points up the need to encourage access to the Internet from \ncomputers outside the home. Access translates into usage, then \nexperience and knowledge. Bringing high technology to schools, \nespecially schools in economically disadvantaged areas, and senior \ncenters will provide students and seniors the opportunity to succeed in \nthe next millennium that they might not have had otherwise.\n  The Detwiler Foundation, an organization with unparalleled status as \na facilitator of computer donations to K-12 schools nationwide, \nestimates that if just 10 percent of the computers taken out of service \neach year were donated to schools, the national ratio of students to \ncomputers would be brought down to five to one, or even less.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, through tax incentives, would increase \nthe amount of computer technology donated to schools.\n  Our amendment would do the following:\n  First, allow a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the fair market \nvalue of the donated computer equipment, including computers, \nperipheral equipment, software and fiber optic cable related to \ncomputer use, generally, and a 50 percent credit for donations made \nwithin designated empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian \nreservations. Increasing the amount of the tax credits for donations \nmade to schools and senior centers in economically-distressed areas \nwill increase the availability of computers to the children and seniors \nwho need them most.\n  Second, increase the age limit to include equipment three years old \nor less. Many companies update their equipment every 3 to 5 years. Yet \nthree year old computers equipped with Pentium-based or equivalent \nchips have the processing power, memory, and graphics capabilities to \nprovide sufficient Internet and multi-media access and run any \nnecessary software.\n  Third, expand the pool of eligible donors. By expanding the number of \ndonors eligible for the tax credit we can increase the number of \ncomputers available as well.\n  In addition, this amendment would require that donated computers \ninclude an installed operating system. Sophisticated hardware can be \neasily damaged during transport or even when the donating company's \nprivate files and documents are removed. Without the operating system, \nit could be weeks before the school is aware of any problems concerning \nthe donation. Further, inclusion of an operating system will ensure \nthat students can begin using the machines as soon as they are plugged \nin, without further burdening school budgets with the added purchasing \ncosts of an operating system and license.\n  This amendment has been endorsed by: the National Association of \nSecondary School Principals, Microsoft, The Information Technology \nIndustry Council, The National Association of Manufacturers, The \nTechnology Training Tax Credit Coalition, 11 senior executives of \nleading technology companies and venture capital firms, The National \nAssociation of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, TechNet, and \nthe United States Chamber of Commerce.\n  All of these organizations agree that this amendment will provide \npowerful tax incentives for businesses to donate high-tech equipment to \nour classrooms.\n  Mr. President, without duly increasing federal expenditures or \ncreating yet another federal program or department this amendment will \ngive all our children an equal chance to succeed in the new millennium.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10071-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10071-S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DR. GERALD WALTON, RETIRED UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI PROVOST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I want to honor a man of integrity, \nperseverance, intellect, and dedication. Dr. Gerald Walton recently \nretired from my alma mater, the University of Mississippi. Dr. Walton \nhas served Ole Miss for nearly forty years in several capacities \nranging from a part-time English instructor in 1959 to the position of \nProvost from which he is retiring.\n  Born and raised in Neshoba County, Mississippi, Dr. Walton has been a \ngreat servant of higher education in Mississippi. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Southern Mississippi in 1956 with a degree in English. He \nthen attended Ole Miss, where he obtained his master's degree and then \nhis doctorate. Dr. Walton's next step was a stint as a teaching \nassistant. Once he got his foot in the door, he quickly gained the \nrespect of his colleagues and began to move up in the ranks. He has \ndemonstrated exemplary commitment to public education.\n  In addition to managing the demands of a career in academia, Dr. \nWalton has been dedicated to his family. He has always put his wife and \nthree daughters first. I am envious of all the free time he will have \nfor his four grandchildren.\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\n  Mr. President, Dr. Walton has stood the test of time. He has adjusted \nto the many changes Ole Miss and our society have experienced. Dr. \nWalton has always stood by his principles of right and wrong, which \nwere first professionally tested in 1962. He was one of only a handful \nof faculty who publicly supported James Meredith and the integration of \nOle Miss. Several members of the faculty advised him not to sign a \nletter of support, but as Dr. Walton would say, ``I felt it was the \nright thing for me to do.'' His character was challenged early and he \npassed with flying colors.\n  Dr. Walton's abilities and personal demeanor have made him one of the \nfavorite administrators on campus, a fact which is evidenced by his \nholding several leadership positions during his tenure at Ole Miss. He \nhas been described as modest and deeply principled. Often, Dr. Walton \nhas been the one who carried the responsibility and made crucial \ndecisions, but he shies from the spotlight, and allows others to be \nrecognized and applauded. Today, we applaud Gerald Walton.\n  Mr. President, at Ole Miss, Dr. Walton has proven himself to be \nmulti-talented. He has served the University as a teaching assistant, \nAssistant Professor, the Director of Freshman English, the Associate \nDean and Dean of Liberal Arts, Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic \nAffairs, Interim Chancellor, and finally in the position of Provost. In \neach of his positions, Dr. Walton has been the type of leader for whom \nevery one of his students and colleagues would do most anything. Other \ncontributions on his long list of accomplishments are the roles he \nplayed in organizing the first Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference \nand the Oxford Conference for the Book.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Walton is not one to brag on himself, but never \nthought twice about bragging on the University or his colleagues. I am \npleased to have the opportunity to honor such a deserving individual. I \ntrust that the Senate will join me in congratulating Dr. Gerald Walton \non his retirement from a distinguished career at the University of \nMississippi. My dear friend, Chancellor Robert C. Khayat, said it best \nwhen he was speaking of Dr. Walton. He said, ``Truly, Gerald Walton can \nmove into the next phase of his life knowing that the words, `Well \ndone, my faithful servant,' apply to him.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10072-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the opening of \nthe 1999 tobacco marketing season in my home state of South Carolina. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States is \none of the world's leading producers of tobacco. It is second only to \nChina in total tobacco production. Tobacco is the seventh largest U.S. \ncrop, with over 130,000 tobacco farms in the United States.\n  In South Carolina, tobacco is the top cash crop, worth about $200 \nmillion annually. It also generates over $1 billion in economic \nactivity for my state. Tobacco production is responsible for more than \n40,000 jobs on over 2,000 farms and continues to account for about one-\nfourth of all crops and around 13 percent of total crop and livestock \nagriculture in South Carolina.\n  It has been a hard couple of years for tobacco farmers in my state. \nLast year, a settlement between the State Attorneys General and five \ntobacco companies was completed. This settlement has created insecurity \nin these farmers' lives, as well as in their communities. Once again \ntobacco quota was cut this year. The cut was 17 percent, which means \nthat these farmers have seen their quota reduced by 35 percent over the \nlast 2 years.\n  In recent years, we have seen a rise in tobacco imports, as domestic \npurchases by companies have declined. This has had a direct effect on \nthe economy of my state. Many of the rural towns in South Carolina have \ngrown up around producing tobacco, and decreased demand for domestic \ntobacco has affected them greatly. I hope these companies see the need \nto purchase more domestic tobacco and decrease the amount of tobacco \nthey import. It is imperative for these rural communities' economic \nstability that domestic tobacco purchases rise.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion I want to wish the tobacco farmers and \nwarehousemen in South Carolina the best of luck this year. I wish that \nI could be down in South Carolina for this festive occasion of opening \nday, but duty calls. Although I can't be there physically, they all \nknow that I'm there in spirit. And as hard as I have worked in the past \nfor them, they can expect me to work even harder to ensure farmers and \ntheir communities remain economically sound.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10072-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10072-S10073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. RUDOLPH E. WATERS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a great educator \nwho has fought diligently on behalf of all Mississippi students.\n  Dr. Rudolph E. Waters has been employed at Alcorn State University, \nthe nation's oldest historically black land-grant institution since \n1957. Over the past 40 years, Dr. Waters has worked tirelessly to \nimprove education standards.\n  While at Alcorn State, Dr. Waters has served as Dean of Students, \nDean of Instruction, Coordinator of Title III Programs, Vice President, \nInterim President, and Executive Vice President. In 1964, while serving \nas Dean of Instruction, he was a participant in the Institute for \nAcademic Deans at Harvard University.\n  Born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, Waters received his B.S.C. from \nDePaul University in 1954. After studying for his master's degree at \nBoston University and doing a stint at Southern Illinois University, he \nreceived his Doctorate of Philosophy from Kansas State University in \n1977.\n  His professional affiliations include the American Association for \nHigher Education, the National Association of Collegiate Deans and \nRegistrars, Phi Delta Kappa, Delta Mu Delta, and the National Society \nfor the Study of Education.\n  Dr. Waters has worked with youth of all ages. He has been a member of \nthe Commission on School Accreditation; the Commission of \nInterinstitutional Cooperation for Alcorn State University and \nMississippi State University; and a member of the board of directors \nfor several organizations including the Andrew Jackson Council of the \nBoy Scouts of America, the University Press of Mississippi and the \nNational Commission for Cooperative Education.\n  Dr. Waters's commitment to excellence has allowed him to serve on \nvisitation teams for the Commission on Colleges of the Southern \nAssociation of Colleges and Schools and the Council on Study and \nAccreditation. In his work, he has advised schools across the southeast \nincluding Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Alabama Lutheran Junior \nCollege in Selma, Morris College of Sumter, South Carolina; and Natchez \nCollege in Mississippi.\n  He has been awarded several special honors and commendations \nthroughout his professional career including the Outstanding Educator \nAward from Rust College in 1976, the Alumni Fellow Award from Kansas \nState in 1988,\n\n[[Page S10073]]\n\nand the Kappan Of The Year from the Utica chapter of Phi Delta Kappa in \n1993.\n  Dr. Waters's writings have focused on teaching and the shaping of \nyoung minds He authored ``Implications of Studies on Class and School \nSize for Programs in Business Education in the Public Secondary \nSchools'' and ``A Profile of Presidents of Historically Black Colleges \nand Universities.'' He also co-authored ``Justice, Society, and the \nIndividual: Improving the Human Condition'' which was published in the \n1978 Yearbook of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum \nDevelopment.\n  Dr. Waters is not only a great educator, but a great rhetorician and \nhistorian. On numerous occasions, he has been called upon to represent \nthe university at both state and national events. He has a great \nknowledge of history and a distinguished usage of rhetoric and \nphilosophy.\n  On the campus, Dr. Waters is loved by administrators students and \nfaculty. His kindness and gentle manner are always appreciated, and his \nupbeat spirit and attitude are an attribute is caught by all who come \nin contact with him.\n  I commend Dr. Waters for all he has accomplished and all that he has \nyet to achieve. Dr. Waters is truly a shining star for Alcorn State \nUniversity and for all Mississippians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10073-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1233) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lott (for Daschle) amendment No. 1499, to provide emergency \n     and income loss assistance to agricultural producers.\n       Lott (for Cochran) amendment No. 1500 (to Amendment No. \n     1499), of a perfecting nature.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his willingness to let the Senate resume the bill. I \nappreciate very much also his efforts to try to identify the ways we \ncan develop a comprehensive response to the disaster situation and the \neconomic crisis that exists in agriculture today.\n  Last evening, before the Senate adjourned, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Indiana, Mr. Lugar, spoke for about 30 minutes, focusing the \nattention of the Senate, as we should be focused, on the difficulties \nof designing a plan to deal with this problem in agriculture that \naffects all commodities, all regions of the country, because there are \ndisparities around the country in terms of economic losses, weather-\nrelated damages to crops, and market influences in the agricultural \nsector. All of that means some farmers are doing fairly well.\n  There was an article in my home State press yesterday, as a matter of \nfact, talking about the aquacultural industry in the State of \nMississippi, and what a good year those who are producing farm-raised \nfish are having in comparison with the other agricultural producers in \nour State.\n  This is probably replicated in many other States. Some farmers are \nhaving a good year but many are not. We are trying to identify ways we \ncan design a program of special assistance to deal with those \ncatastrophic situations where the Government does need to respond. It \nis my hope we can design a disaster program that sends money directly \nto farmers who need financial assistance rather than create larger \nGovernment programs with money going into the bureaucracy, or expanding \nconservation programs, as the first-degree amendment would do, and \ninstead opt for the alternative that is the second-degree amendment \nwhich I have offered that sends the money directly to farmers.\n  I was called this morning by one of the network radio news reporters \nand was asked whether or not the program we are recommending is more \nloans for farmers. Farmers, he had heard, do not want more loans. I \nassured him that is not what we were proposing. We are not proposing \nthat farmers be given more loans. We are proposing that they be given \nmore money, direct payments, using the vehicle of the existing farm \nlegislation that gives authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to \nmake direct payments to farmers in the form of transition payments. We \nare doubling the amount of the transition payments in this second-\ndegree amendment. That makes up the bulk of the dollar cost of the \nsecond-degree amendment as estimated by the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  So I think we are on the right track in trying to identify the best \nway to help farmers who are in an emergency situation, to identify \nthose who are in an emergency and to give them money in direct payments \nin this special situation.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, actually, I do not know whether it is a \njump ball. I will be pleased to go in order, if we could do it that \nway. I see the Senator from Kansas was ready to speak, and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. Can we alternate from side to side?\n  I ask unanimous consent to follow the Senator from Kansas. I didn't \nmean to beat him to the punch. I am anxious to debate.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have no objection to that whatsoever. I have about 15 \nor 20 minutes of remarks.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will listen to my colleague and then ask unanimous \nconsent I be able to follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, but \nif we are going to establish an order, and if there is an appropriate \nback and forth, I ask that I follow Senator Wellstone on this side of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Rather than agree to that, and I think it is a good idea \nto go back and forth from one side of the aisle to the other, we do not \nhave a time agreement, and I think it is a mistake now to try to get a \ntime agreement. Senator Grassley, I know, was on the floor making notes \na while ago. He stepped off the floor just now. I wouldn't want to \njeopardize his right. He has been here for some time this morning.\n  I hope what we can do is, if the Senator from Kansas can proceed as \nsuggested by the Senator from Minnesota, and then the Senator from \nMinnesota, at that time we can take a look and see who wants to speak. \nBut I know the Senator from North Dakota is interested in this debate \nand participated in the debate yesterday. We look forward to hearing \nhis comments again today.\n  Several Senators addressed the chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I think the Senator from \nMississippi misunderstood. My intention was to say if there is a \nrequest after Senator Wellstone to speak on that side, I understand \nthat. But if we are going to establish an order, because I am here and \nwould like to speak, I am happy to leave and come back at an \nappropriate time. If we going are to establish an order now, I would \nlike to be in that order.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Kansas \nwill yield further, I had suggested we not try to establish an order. \nThat was my response to the question. He asked if we were going to \nestablish an order. My answer is, as the manager of the bill, I \nrecommend against it at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, what is the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota is, immediately following the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Kansas, he be allowed to speak.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I clarify this? I had the floor. I was trying to \nbe accommodating.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes. He was.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I simply said, if the Senator felt I jumped in, beat \nhim\n\n[[Page S10074]]\n\nto the punch, I would be pleased to follow the Senator from Kansas. I \nam ready to yield, or I will keep the floor. Shall we do that?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor and \nhas propounded a unanimous consent request. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, I was thanking the \nSenator from Minnesota for his graciousness, for his generosity of \nspirit, for his courtesy to the Senator from Kansas. I appreciate that \nvery much, as the manager of the bill. I think what he suggested was \neminently fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). No objection is heard. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I rise to discuss the need to provide emergency \nfinancial relief to our country's farmers and ranchers and to rural \nAmerica in what will hopefully be short-term assistance that will allow \nour producers to meet their cash flow needs while Congress also pursues \nthe long-term objectives needed to provide a profitable agriculture \nsector into the 21st century.\n  As one Kansas farmer told me recently: ``Pat, in farm country today \nwe are just not in very good shape for the shape we are in.''\n  Farmers today, as many of my colleagues are pointing out, are \nstruggling with depressed prices and cash flow difficulties, especially \nfarmers who do not receive program payments under the current farm \nbill.\n  We can and should provide relief to enable our producers to get \nthrough these very difficult times, and the choice between the relief \npackage that has been offered by Senator Cochran and that offered by \nSenator Harkin will determine the kind and amount of assistance that \nwill be forthcoming--or some other substitute.\n  In this regard, I have been urging Congress to act on a program of \nlimited but effective assistance before this August break to send a \nstrong signal to farmers, ranchers, and most important, the agriculture \nlending community. Land values have not tailed off, but the continuing \nstress certainly could lead to that. We need to nip that in the bud.\n  On the other hand, I do not believe it is in the interest of American \nagriculture to rewrite the current farm bill or to enact policy that \nwill be market interfering, market disruptive, and lead us back down \nthe road to command and control farm policy from Washington. \nUnfortunately, I believe both of the proposals that are before us \ntoday, or at least some aspects of those proposals, do fall into that \ncategory, especially the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Dakota, Mr. Daschle.\n  I will discuss the shortcomings of these proposals later, but first \nlet me point out, this emergency assistance debate is only part of the \nstory. The rest of the story involves the drumbeat of rhetoric we have \nheard from our Democrat colleagues and friends across the aisle, and \nthe Clinton administration, who, month after month, week after week, \nday after day, have blamed the 1996 farm bill, called Freedom to Farm, \nfor the collapse of commodity prices, if not the end of production \nagriculture and family farms in the United States.\n  Reading the press releases, the resulting headlines, and listening to \nmy colleagues, you would think the current farm bill was the result of \nsome sinister plot concocted in the dead of night.\n  Apparently, they would like farmers and ranchers to believe our \ncurrent farm policy is responsible for record worldwide production; \nincreasing and record yield production and productivity; the worst \ninternational economic crisis since the early 1980s decimating our \nlargest markets; record subsidies by the European Union, some $60 \nbillion; weather--too much rain, too little rain, the obvious drought \nin the Atlantic States, La Nina and El Nino; persistent plant diseases \nin the northern plains, and crop infestation in all other regions; new \ntechnology and precision agriculture; currency changes and the value of \nthe dollar that have reduced American exports--that would be some farm \nbill. But those are the causes that have actually led to the low \ncommodity prices.\n\n  In fact, the current farm bill came after 38 full committee and \nsubcommittee hearings in the House Agriculture Committee during my \ntenure as Chairman, 21 of which were held in farm country--every \nregion, every commodity--all open-microphone listening sessions. \nExtensive hearings were also held here in Washington on this side of \nthe Capitol in the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  Literally thousands of farmers and ranchers voiced their opinion. \nThey overwhelmingly stated they wanted the Government to get out of \ntheir planting decisions, to quit interfering in the marketplace, so \nthey could make their own marketing decisions based on what was best \nfor their farms, their ranches, according to the market.\n  The bottom line, farmers told us there was too much in command and \ncontrol that came from Washington. They were tired of standing in line \noutside the Farm Service Agency so that Washington could tell them what \nto plant in exchange for a Government subsidy.\n  As one 89-year-old Kansas farmer told us in Dodge City--and I quote:\n\n       I farmed for nearly 60 years and I never planted a crop \n     that the government had not told me I could plant.\n\n  The single most important goal and rationale behind the 1996 farm \nbill was to restore decision making back to the individual producer, \ni.e., the freedom to farm.\n  It is true--almost all of the speeches that have been made on the \nfloor of the Senate, and all of the press conferences that we have \nheard all throughout farm country--it is true our commodity prices are \ndepressed. Markets are depressed worldwide. Everyone involved in \nagriculture certainly knows and is dealing with that firsthand.\n  But as the saying goes in farm country: Comin' as close to the truth \nas a man can come without gettin' there is comin' pretty close but it \nstill ain't the truth.\n  Or put another way, no matter who says what, don't believe it if it \ndoesn't make sense. With all due respect to my colleagues who \napparently believe the 1996 Farm Act is the root cause of problems in \nfarm country, I do not believe that is simply the case.\n  I understand the politics of the issue. As scarce as the truth is, \nthe supply seems greater than demand. And with Freedom to Farm, there \nis no demand amongst some of my Democrat friends.\n  But politics aside, I must admit I am both puzzled and amazed by the \nrhetoric we have heard over and over and over and over again. How can a \nfarm bill that has provided on average more income assistance during \ndifficult times over the past 3 years than occurred during the five-\nyear average under the old farm bill be bad for farmers?\n  Let me point out that the market situation for all raw commodities is \nunder stress. In addition to low crop prices, we have also been \nsuffering through low farm prices for cattle, for hogs, for oil, for \ngold, for gas, and all raw commodities. None of these commodities has \nbeen covered by a farm bill--any farm bill. Is the current farm bill \nresponsible for the market collapse in these commodities? Obviously \nnot. But the causes that caused those low prices are the same ones that \ncaused the problem with regard to farm country.\n  There was an interesting press report about a week ago. It was on the \nfront page of a newspaper about the severity of the agriculture \nsituation--and it is severe. The lead of the story said:\n\n       In the wake of dismal prairie farm income projections, \n     agriculture officials emphasized the need for an improved \n     long term safety net. If something is not done we are going \n     to lose a lot of farmers.\n\n  But you know, that story was not about the United States; it was \nabout Canada and their farm crisis. Canadian farmers are facing bleak \nprospects; and the same is true in Great Britain; and the same is true \nin Europe; and the same is true all over this world, in Latin America \nand South America, as well.\n  I do not think that Freedom to Farm caused their problems. This is a \nworldwide market decline, and as such is unprecedented.\n  What has caused the low commodity prices?\n\n[[Page S10075]]\n\n  First, farmers worldwide have had good growing weather and produced \nrecord crops for 3 years in a row--unprecedented. That is what my good \nfriend and colleague, the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, said \na few weeks ago when we attended a joint meeting--unprecedented record \ncrops.\n  Second, we have experienced a world depression in regard to our \nexport markets, both in Asia and Latin America and South America.\n  Third, the European Union is now spending a record $60 billion--85 \npercent of the world's ag subsidies--on their subsidies.\n  Fourth, the currency exchange rates reduced the level of farm exports \nand farm prices. A 16-percent appreciation in the value of the U.S. \ndollar has been responsible for 17 to 25 percentage points of the \ndecline in corn and wheat prices.\n  Fifth, a market-oriented farm program depends on an aggressive trade \npolicy. In regard to trade, although it is very controversial, we did \nnot do fast track. We had a very historic agreement with China, with \nbipartisan work on it, and then it was pulled back; and then it was \nfollowed by the bombing of the Chinese Embassy. That was not the \nintent, but that is what has happened. And we are about to put \nagriculture last--certainly not first--in the coming WTO trade talks in \nSeattle. We continue to employ counterproductive sanctions that punish \nU.S. farmers and reward our competitors with market share and have no \neffect on our foreign policy.\n  The administration has moved in this regard. We have bipartisan \nsupport for sanctions reform, but we still cannot use the USDA export \nprograms in regard to making those sales.\n  Again, the cause for these low prices is not the 1996 farm bill. \nQuite the contrary, under Freedom to Farm--and I want everybody to \nlisten to this--farmers in each State represented by most of the \ncritics of the 1996 act have and are receiving more income assistance \non average than they did under the old bill.\n  Under Freedom to Farm, farmers themselves--not Washington--have set \naside their crop production and switched to other higher value crops. \nNevertheless, we hear the mantra that we do not have a safety net.\n  Let me point out, for the past 3 years of the current farm bill we \nhave provided transition payments--somehow or other in this debate the \nreality of transition payments over the 6-year life of the farm bill \nhas been ignored. It is almost like they do not exist in the minds of \nthe critics, but we have provided them. They are direct income support, \nand that amounts to approximately $23 billion to our farmers and \nranchers for the past 3 years of the bill.\n  On the downside, we have also provided nearly $3 billion in what is \ncalled loan deficiency payments. That means the price goes below the \nloan rate. The loan rate was pretty low. We would never have imagined \nwe would have to use the LDP program, but we had to--$3 billion. Recent \nestimates by the USDA are projecting possible LDPs totaling $8 billion \nthis year.\n  These numbers total to nearly $34.5 billion by the end of 1999, and \nthey do not include the $6 billion in lost market payments and disaster \nrelief that were paid to farmers in 1998.\n  If you add in the $6 billion emergency package of last year, and the \nproposed assistance now being debated, the total is unprecedented--\nunprecedented--but even before these disaster payments you still had \nmore income under the current farm bill than farmers would have \nreceived under the old one, under the 5-year average. So from that \nstandpoint, I do think we have a safety net.\n\n  In the past 3 years in Minnesota, for the benefit of my dear friend \nand colleague, Senator Wellstone, the safety net for farmers under \nFreedom to Farm averaged $136 million more in total payments compared \nto the state average under the old bill.\n  In South Dakota, the safety net for farmers under Freedom to Farm \naveraged for the past 3 years was $58 million more than the state \naverage under the old bill.\n  In North Dakota--Senator Dorgan and Senator Conrad are two Members \nwho fight for their farmers and believe very passionately that we must \naddress this problem--$15 million more; in Nebraska, $109 million more; \nand in Iowa, the safety net for farmers under Freedom to Farm in the \nlast 3 years provided $162 million more than the previous bill.\n  Is it enough in regard to the problems we face that are \nunprecedented? Is it enough for the northern prairie States with border \nproblems and wheat scab and weather you can't believe? I do not know. \nThat is for those Senators and those farmers to determine. But there \nhas been a significant increase in that direct income assistance to \nthose producers.\n  Finally, for those who like roosters at the dawn and coyotes at dusk, \ncrow and howl that we have ripped the rug out from underneath our \nfarmers and the safety net, let me point out that during the first 3 \nyears of Freedom to Farm, the average amount of income assistance to \nhard-pressed farmers was higher in every one of the 50 States than the \n5-year average for each State during the previous farm bill. Again, \nthese higher 3-year averages do not include emergency assistance that \nproducers received through the structure of the Freedom to Farm Act \nthat farmers received last year and they will receive this year when we \nfinally get to the determination of whatever emergency package we \nshould pass.\n  In making these statements, let me urge my colleagues to do their \nhomework. Take time to read an assessment of the 1996 Farm Act by the \nCoalition for Competitive Food in the Agriculture System, published \nthis June. In brief, the summary concluded the act did not cause the \nlow commodity prices--I mentioned the two causes--supported the \nunderlying health of the farm economy, and has provided a strong safety \nnet--yes, buttressed by the emergency legislation--and, one of the \nbiggest conclusions, forces U.S. competitors to adjust to the world \nmarket.\n  There is a summary of this report, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the summary printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     An Assessment of the FAIR Act\n\n       Food and agriculture remains the US economy's largest \n     single economic sector, accounting for $1 trillion in \n     national income, and employing 18 percent of the nation's \n     entire work force. Almost one-fourth of US economy.\n       In 1996, the US Congress passed historic farm legislation, \n     allowing the US agricultural economy to respond to the global \n     market. The FAIR Act provided farmers with a strong safety \n     net, coupled with the freedom to plant for the market. It \n     ended the counterproductive practices of taking good US \n     cropland out of production and of setting a global price \n     floor for all the world's farmers, which served only to \n     intensify foreign competition against U.S. growers.\n     Fundamentals of the FAIR Act\n       Eliminated planting requirements.\n       Eliminated supply controls and acreage idling programs.\n       Freed farmers to plant for the market.\n       Eliminated variable deficiency payments.\n       Provided guaranteed transition payments.\n       Retained competitive price support levels.\n       Retained marketing loans to prevent government stockpiling.\n\n\n            the FAIR Act Did Not Cause Low Commodity Prices\n\n       The passage of the FAIR Act coincided with sea changes in \n     the global economy, which have dramatically affected the US \n     agricultural economy. Years of worldwide economic growth, \n     particularly in middle income developing countries, led to \n     rising demand for meat and animal feed. Increased market \n     access achieved by the Uruguay Round Agreement, as well as \n     regional agreements such as NAFTA, allowed US farmers to take \n     advantage of that growth overseas. New technologies \n     (biotechnology, precision farming, no till agriculture) were \n     increasing crop yields at the same time as record high prices \n     led farmers in the United States and overseas to expand \n     acreage.\n       Two years after the enactment of the FAIR Act, the global \n     economy suffered the worst international crisis since the \n     early 1980s. The fast growing Asian economies, which together \n     are the largest single market for US exports had been the \n     fastest growing importer of US food and agricultural \n     products, suffered dramatic reversals, as did Russia.\n       Asian demand was down 17 percent in 1998, and will be down \n     another 23 percent this year. Ironically, sales to Mexico \n     were up 17 percent, and NAFTA is the fastest growing market \n     for U.S. farmers.\n       The sharp drop in demand for food and agricultural products \n     coincided with record harvests in the United States, Brazil, \n     Argentina and other food producing nations. Between 1993 and \n     1998, world wheat production has shifted from 65.4 MMT below \n     trend to 31.7 MMT above trend--an increase in supply of \n     nearly 100 MMT. World corn production has shifted from 52 MMT \n     below trend in the early 1990s to 36 MMT above trend in the \n     late\n\n[[Page S10076]]\n\n     1990s--an increase of 88 MMT. Soybean production has seen \n     similar trends, with production 7 MMT below trend in the \n     early 1990s and 11 MMT in the latter half of the 1990s. As a \n     result of these huge shifts in supply, world prices have \n     dropped far from their uncharacteristic highs in the mid-\n     1999s, to slightly below average levels, when compared to the \n     firt half of the decade.\n\n\n  The FAIR Act Has Supported the Underlying Health of the Farm Economy\n\n       During the tenure of the FAIR Act, the underlying financial \n     health of the sector has improved, when compared to the first \n     half of the 1990s. Total farm assets were 18 percent higher \n     than the 1990-94 average in 1996 and are estimated to be 30 \n     percent higher in 1999. Similarly, land values in 1998 were \n     16 percent higher than their average value in 1990-94, and \n     are projected to be 38 percent higher in 1999. Moreover, \n     liquidity ratios are up, debt servicing ratios are down, and \n     return on equity has increased from 0.5 percent in 1995 to \n     2.3 percent in 1998.\n       While there have certainly been regions and commodities \n     that have suffered from sharp prices declines and from \n     various weather and crop related disasters, overall, average \n     farm income during the FAIR Act has been higher than farm \n     income under previous legislation. Even with the declines in \n     1998 and 1999, farm income during the FAIR Act is higher on \n     average than during the previous farm legislation.\n       In perhaps the most important measure of the financial \n     outlook for the sector, farmland prices continue to rise \n     throughout the country. Since 1995, the price of farmland in \n     the Corn Belt has risen from $1600 per acre to over $1800 per \n     acre; land in the Great Lakes has risen from just over $1000 \n     per acre to almost $1300 per acre. Even in the Northern \n     Plains, which has suffered the most in terms of prices and \n     disasters, farmland prices are up from just under $1000 per \n     acre to almost $1100 per acre.\n\n\n               The FAIR Act Provides a Strong Safety Net\n\n       Under the terms of the FAIR Act, $35.6 billion will be \n     provided to farmers through direct income payments over seven \n     years, for an average of $5 billion annually. In addition, \n     expenditures under the commodity loan program, which makes up \n     the difference between the loan rate and a lower market \n     price, have added an additional $1 billion annually, an \n     amount that could reach $3.5 billion in 1999 alone. In \n     addition, the disaster relief and market loss payments during \n     1998 added an additional $6 billion in government payments to \n     farmers. In all, payments under the FAIR Act have totaled \n     $5.7 billion per year. By comparison, payments under the old \n     farm program averaged $5.5 billion per year. Because they are \n     based on previous production levels and historical program \n     yields, the bulk of those payments go to large, commercial \n     farmers who account for the bulk of U.S. production.\n\n\n   The FAIR Act Forces U.S. Competitors to Adjust to the World Market\n\n       In the past, when the United States took land out of \n     production in response to low prices, our competitors in \n     Brazil, Argentina and other countries simply expanded their \n     acreage to take up the slack. When the United States raised \n     its support prices in the early 1980s, farmers in other \n     countries took advantage of the price floor set by the United \n     States, to expand their production. In effect, the United \n     States functioned as the Saudi Arabia of the World grain \n     market. Those policies provided a safety net not just to US \n     farmers, but to the world's farmers.\n       Under the FAIR Act, U.S. farmers face no government-\n     mandated set-asides. As a result, they have brought nearly 10 \n     million acres back into production. With the safety net of \n     the marketing loan in place, U.S. farmers are guaranteed to \n     receive the loan rate, even if world prices fall to lower \n     levels. This means that farmers in other countries will be \n     forced to respond to world markets prices, while U.S. farmers \n     benefit from the higher U.S. loan rate. Should world prices \n     rise above U.S. loan rates, U.S. farmers will be able to \n     receive the full benefit of those higher prices.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, most of the critics of the current act \nhave recommended that we rewrite the farm bill, and I think most, at \nleast--and I don't want to be too specific here because I am not sure--\nhave indicated they would like a return to set-aside programs and \nhigher loan rates and farmer-owned reserves, basically a return to the \nold farm bill. They say we need to do it so we can control production \nand increase the price of our commodities. Lord knows, I would like to \ntry anything, almost, to increase the price of our commodities.\n  My question is this: How do we convince our competitors to follow \nsuit? Past history shows us that when we reduce our acreages, our \ncompetitors do not follow suit. World stocks are not reduced. They \nincrease their production by more than we reduce ours. There is no \nclearer example than during the 5-year period from 1982 to 1988 when \nthe United States harvested 12 million fewer acres of soybeans and, \nduring the same period, Argentina and Brazil increased their production \nby 14 million acres. Guess which countries are now the largest \ncompetitors of the United States in the soybean market.\n  Critics will also claim that plantings and stocks have increased and \nprices have plummeted because our farmers were allowed to plant fence \nrow to fence row. That is not true either. The United States was not \nthe cause of increased world production. In 1996, farmers in the United \nStates planted about 75 million acres of wheat. Under Freedom to Farm, \nthat fell to 70 million in 1997, 65 million acres in 1998. That is \nalmost a 14-percent drop in wheat acreage. The farmer made that \ndecision, not somebody in Washington, a voluntary set-aside. It was a \npaid diversion because he got the AMTA payment. USDA projections are an \nadditional decrease this year of another 9 percent. That is a voluntary \nfarmer set-aside, not a government mandated set-aside.\n  If U.S. wheat farmers planted less wheat, where did the record crops \ncome from? We have been blessed with near perfect growing conditions in \nmost of wheat country. The average farmer's yield went from 36 bushels \nan acre to 43 last year, 47 this year. Once again, the American \nfarmer's record of productivity is simply amazing. I don't know of any \nfarm bill that has ever been able to control production in other \ncountries, or the weather, or growing conditions. I don't think even \nour friends across the aisle who are most critical would propose trying \nto limit the farmer's yield.\n  Still despite these facts, the naysayers say we must control \nproduction and raise loan rates. Raising loan rates will only increase \nor prolong the excess levels of crops in storage and on the market and \nactually result in lower prices down the road. Excess stocks will \ndepress prices. Do we then extend the loan rate or raise it, leading to \nan endless cycle, leading to a return to planting requirements and \nWashington telling farmers to set aside ground to control production \nand limit the budgetary costs?\n  How do higher loan rates help producers who have suffered crop \nfailures and have no crop underneath the loan? We had low prices in the \nmid-1980s. As a matter of fact, in 1985, and, it seems to me, in 1986, \nwe spent almost $25.9 billion. We tried PIK and Roll; we tried \ncertificates; we tried set-asides. We tried everything under the sun. \nWe passed the 1985 act dealing with unprecedented world conditions. So \nwe tried that. We had the higher loan rates.\n  It is one thing to propose a new farm program, albeit we haven't seen \nanything too specific. But how do you pay for the budget cost, \nnotwithstanding the emergency declaration of this legislation, which I \nthink is appropriate? There was no request from the President, after 3 \nyears of complaining, no request from Secretary Glickman for additional \nfunding. It seems to me it is one thing to propose changes in the farm \nbill in the form of increased loan rates, however you want to change \nit--or, as the President says, we just need a better farm bill--and \nanother to propose how we pay for it.\n\n  The reason I am bringing this up is, I think we need a little truth \nin budgeting, aside from the proposed emergency legislation that we \nneed. Do the advocates of change pay for the new program, set-asides, \nand increased loan rates or whatever it is in regards to the new farm \nprogram by taking away the transition payments now provided to farmers \nunder Freedom to Farm? Will farmers willingly give up the transition \npayments, direct income assistance, and go back to the days of standing \nin line at the Farm Service Agency, filling out the forms and the \npaperwork, and set aside 20 percent or more of their acreage?\n  What do we tell farmers who have on their own made historic planting \nchanges from primary crops in the past to crops of higher value--oil \nseeds, sorghum, dry peas, navy beans, soybeans, and, yes, cotton? Under \nFreedom to Farm, I tell my distinguished friend and colleague from \nMississippi, in the heart of cotton country, we have 40,000 acres in \nKansas that are now in cotton production. When Steve Foster wrote the \nsong ``Those Old Cotton Fields Back Home,'' he was talking about \nKansas. We have the most cost-efficient cotton in the world because the \ntemperatures are so low, you don't have to use pesticides on the \ninsects. None of that would have happened\n\n[[Page S10077]]\n\nwithout the flexibility in regards to the new farm bill.\n  The reduction in wheat acreage going to other crops has been dramatic \nin 1997 to 1998: 15 percent down in North Dakota, 15.5 percent in South \nDakota; 18 percent in Kansas; 18 percent in Minnesota; 15 percent in \nTexas. These are farmer-made decisions, and the changes in American \nagriculture have exceeded all expectations. Farmers have switched \nbecause it made economic sense.\n  The plain and simple and sometimes painful truth is that all U.S. \nproducers are no longer the most efficient producers of certain crops, \nnow wheat, in the world. That is true of other crops. But if you give \nthe farmer the proper research and the proper export tools and the \nproper precision agriculture tools and the proverbial so-called level \nand fair trading field--which does not exist right now--he can be.\n  But we must also have the flexibility and the freedom to respond to \nmarket signals. So instead of looking back to the failed policies of \nthe past, I think we must look to a long-term agenda for the future \nthat allows our farmers and ranchers to be successful. That agenda \nincludes most of what was promised during the passage of the Freedom to \nFarm Act--promises, promises, promises. I held up this ledger. I had \ntwo of them. On one side it said, if we go to a market-oriented farm \nprogram, these are the things we will have to do to complement it in \norder that it may work. And we listed them. That was the other side of \nthe ledger.\n  Unfortunately, I am sad to say that those promises have not been kept \nby either side of the aisle. If I get a little thin skinned in regards \nto all the criticism in regards to the act that we put together, I am \nmore than a little unhappy in regards to the Republican and Democrat \nleadership and the lack of progress on things we promised that would \ncomplement Freedom to Farm, things that attract bipartisan support from \nall of us who are privileged to represent agriculture.\n  I am talking about an aggressive and consistent trade policy, fast \ntrack legislation, sanctions reform with authority to use USDA export \nprograms, a strategy for WTO negotiations that puts agriculture first, \na renewed effort to complete the trade breakthrough we had with China. \nI am talking about tax legislation. Some of it is in the tax bill. \nUnfortunately, we have a political fussing and feuding exercise, and \nsome of these will not actually take place--100-percent self-employed \nhealth insurance deductibility, farm savings accounts. If we had farm \nsavings accounts, this situation would be tough but it wouldn't be \ngrim.\n  Capital gains and estate tax reform. I am talking about crop \ninsurance reform. Senator Kerrey and I have what I think is a very good \ncrop insurance bill. I am talking about regulatory reform and about \ncommonsense management of the Food Quality Protection Act. And, yes, I \nam talking about reasonable emergency assistance to provide income \nassistance due to the unprecedented record crops, EU subsidies, world \ndepression of the export markets. And that brings us to the two \nproposals we have before us today.\n  Let me point out that, given the dynamic change in agriculture and \nworld markets, no farm bill has ever been perfect or set in stone. That \nhas been the case with the seven farm bills I have been directly \ninvolved with since I have had the privilege--seven of them. That \nstatement is buttressed by the fact that, in the last 10 years, there \nhave been no less than 13 emergency supplementals or disaster bills. \nGiven the current drought in the Atlantic States and our price and cash \nflow problems due to the unprecedented developments I have already \ndiscussed, there are going to be 14. It is just what form it will take. \nBut it seems to me we should not be in the business of spending more \nthan is necessary, or making changes in farm program policy that will \nbe market disruptive, or that will lead us back down the road to \ncommand and control agriculture in Washington. That, of course, depends \non your definition.\n  There are several questions, or concerns, I have in regard to the \nemergency assistance package introduced by my friend, Senator Harkin, \nand my friend from Mississippi, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee. The income loss assistance that has been \nproposed by Senator Harkin, as I understand it, has a fixed amount of \n$6.4 billion made available. But it sets up a parallel supplemental \nloan deficiency payment system with a separate $40,000 payment. It \nprovides that payments be made to producers with failed acreage, or \nacreage prevented from plantings, based on actual production history, \nand provides for advance payments to producers as soon as possible. And \nwe want that.\n  I think we are headed toward a train wreck in regard to the payment \nlimitation. One of the major concerns among farmers is the $75,000 \npayment limitation on an existing $7 billion to $8 billion worth of \nloan deficiency payments. Now we are trying to cram an additional $6.4 \nbillion through a payment limitation half that size, and it seems to me \nwe are going to have some real problems. Per unit payments will go up, \nand a smaller and smaller percentage of production will be covered.\n  Now, if this new payment form is supposed to go to those who produce, \nit is ironic that we are going to see 85 percent of the producers who \nproduce the field crops shortchanged to bulk up payments to those that \nreally create 15 percent of the crops. This isn't the big producer/\nsmall producer argument. I think the penalty will reach down to the \nmedium-size commercial farmer, while the part-timer with a job in town \nmay reap a windfall.\n  Discretion to the Secretary. Last year's disaster program was \npredicated on giving the Secretary maximum discretion to use his \nexpertise to create a fair and speedy program. The delivery of disaster \npayments was delayed for 8 months. This program relies even more \nheavily on the Secretary. I hope that Secretary Glickman has magic in \nthe way he can get the payments out.\n  The Secretary must take a fixed amount of money and fairly divide it \namong producers; guess in August the total production of a variety of \ncrops for the year; determine which producers will have failed acres \nand determine their actual production history; calculate how a $40,000 \npayment limit will affect the division of the funds; create a per \nbushel, pound, or hundredweight payment for crops not yet harvested; \ndetermine how to make advanced payments; and he must prorate payments \nwhen and if all the guesses happen to turn out to be wrong.\n  Last year, with a far simpler task, the Secretary gave up and waited \nuntil June to make the payments. Let me point out that transition \npayments under the AMTA supplemental plan went out in 10 days. They \nwere delivered to producers in 10 days. Direct income assistance: A \nfarmer could take the check and show it to his banker and say: I can \nmake it through the next year.\n\n  WTO limits. Almost unnoticed in the farm crisis is the rapid increase \nin payments made to producers. The United States is rapidly approaching \nthe limit allowed in the treaty for payments defined in something \ncalled the amber box as trade distorting. All payments associated with \ncommodity loans, including LDPs, are counted in the amber box. They are \nnot counted in the AMTA box if you provide farmers direct assistance \ndue to unprecedented things. That will nearly double LDPs in 2000 and \nmay very well put us over the limit, making it very difficult for the \nPresident to sign a bill that would violate the Uruguay Round \nagreement.\n  My question is: What is the White House position on the Harkin \namendment as it applies to payments to farmers through the loan \ndeficiency payment program, as opposed to the AMTA payments? I have \nother questions, too.\n  I have indicated to my colleague from Minnesota that I would not take \ntoo long, and I have already done that. I apologize to him. Again, we \nknow the money can be distributed through the AMTA system in as little \nas 10 days.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a second?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I only have about 2 minutes left.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is the Senator's life. I don't agree with him, \nbut he must lay out his case.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the most important thing is to get this emergency \nassistance out to farmers as fast as we can and keep it within a realm \nthat is at least reasonable in regard to the budget and in a way the \nfarmer can get the\n\n[[Page S10078]]\n\nassistance. We can do that in 10 days by the system that is proposed by \nthe Senator from Mississippi.\n  I have already mentioned the payment limitation concern. I must say, \nif you look at the Harkin amendment, it not only deals with emergency \nassistance--and Senator Harkin truly believes we ought to rewrite the \nfarm bill, and he is doing that in regard to his amendment.\n  We have peanuts, dairy payments, and livestock payments; and I am \nassuming most of it would go to the hog producers, but we means test \nthat again. We have set-aside authority and we have disaster funding, \nwhere we set aside another $600 million. We backfill the 1998 disaster \nassistance. Then we have money to establish a permanent program for \nland that has been flooded for continuous years. With all due respect \nto my colleagues from the Northern Plains, we have a name for a land in \nKansas that has been covered with water for 3 years; it is called a \nlake.\n  We have millions for tobacco producers. My golly, are we going back \nto 1982 when we all decided in the House of Representatives--and we \nwere all there at that time--we were going to get the Government out of \nsubsidizing tobacco farmers? Are we back to that? Be careful what you \nask for. So we have included tobacco in this bill. I am not making any \naspersions on the hard-hit tobacco producers, but, folks, that is not \nPC. I am not sure about that one. And then we have mandatory price \nreporting, something I have supported in the Agriculture Committee, \nwith some changes made by Senator Kerrey. But we are approving funding \nfor legislation and we haven't even marked it up yet.\n  Then we have mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meat and \nvegetables. Right now, we have a tremendous problem with the European \nUnion and all countries in Europe on GMOs, genetically modified \norganisms. People in white coats are descending upon the fields over in \nGreat Britain, ripping up the GMO crops. The problem is, they made a \nmistake and ripped up the wrong crop. We ought to go to sound science \nand work out these problems, and we are trying to do that.\n  In regard to the trade problems we have--which Secretary Glickman \ntalks about and most aggies are worried about--we are going to put this \nin country-of-origin labeling on top of that issue. I don't think it \nhas really been proven that our producers will increase prices and that \nit will result in trade retaliations.\n  We have $200 million for a short-term set-aside. I don't want to go \nback to set-asides; I think that would be counterproductive. Some of \nthese provisions I have mentioned are also in the provision introduced \nby my dear friend and colleague, the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I think, again, we ought to be providing emergency assistance to \nfarmers and not be writing the farm bill but proceeding to work \ntogether in a bipartisan way, if we possibly can, to address the real \nreasons as to why we have these low commodity prices.\n  When this comes up this afternoon, I urge Members to pay attention. A \nlot of this gets very convoluted and very technical, I know, in regard \nto farm program policy. But it would be my desire that Members look \nvery closely at this in regard to the budget implications and things \nthat can go bump in the night--the law of unattended effects--down the \nroad that I don't think we want to experience in farm country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to say to my colleague from \nKansas that he ended up talking about the emergency bill that is before \nus. But a good part of his remarks were devoted to the farm bill, what \nI call the ``freedom to fail'' bill. I want to say to my colleague from \nKansas that he kept talking about the failed policy of the past. I \nthink he ought to focus on the failed policy of the present. The failed \npolicy of the present is the ``freedom to fail'' bill.\n  My colleagues also talked about the painful truth. The painful truth \nin the State of Minnesota is that we are going to lose yet thousands \nmore of farmers on the present course. We have to change the course. \nThat is the painful truth.\n  I remember that maybe a year and a half ago when I went to a \ngathering in Crookston, MN in northwest Minnesota, there was a sign \noutside that said, ``Farm Crisis Meeting.'' I thought: My God, are we \ngoing back to the mid-1980s? But it is not only northwest Minnesota.\n  I was in Roseau County two weekends ago. It is pretty incredible. It \nis the low prices. It is also the weather. The county typically plants \nabout 500,000 acres of wheat. This year only 10 percent--50,000 acres--\nwas planted. It appears that a mere 10 percent of the 50,000 acres will \nproduce a crop.\n  It is northwest Minnesota with the low price. It is the weather. It \nis the scab disease, and now the price crisis affects all of Greater \nMinnesota.\n  When my colleague talks about $136 million spent in Minnesota with \nthe AMTA payments, it reminds me of what farmers always say, not about \nthe smaller banks but about the big branch banks: They are always there \nwith the umbrella when there is sunshine outside, but whenever it is \nraining they take the umbrella away.\n  Of course, the payments were up when we were doing well. But the \nwhole point of what we had in our farm bill before ``freedom to fail'' \nwas we had some countercyclical measures to make sure there was some \nprice stability. That is the point.\n  The point is that when part of our export market collapses, and when \nfamily farmers can't make a go of it, or when you continue to have to \ndeal with conglomerates that control almost all phases of the food \nindustry--when I hear my good friend from Kansas talking about laws of \nsupply and demand, I smile. Family farmers in Minnesota want to know: \nWhere is Adam Smith's invisible hand? Family farmers in the Midwest \nwant to know, where is the competition? Because when they look to whom \nthey buy from, and when they look to whom they sell, they are faced \nwith a few large conglomerates that dominate the market.\n  I say to my good friend from Iowa that in Fayette County--I guess \nthere is a town of Fayette also in northeast Iowa--on Sunday I went to \na pig roast. This farmer said: I am out of business. This is the last \npig. This is it for me.\n  Our pork producers are facing extinction, and the packers are in hog \nheaven.\n  We have a frightening concentration of power.\n  All of my colleagues who are strong free enterprise men and women, \nall my colleagues who talk about the importance of the market and \ncompetition, ought to look at what my friend from Kansas talks about as \na painful truth, which is we don't have Adam Smith's invisible hand and \nlaw of supply and demand. Everywhere we look in this industry, you have \nconglomerates that have muscled their way to the dinner table, \nexercising their raw political and economic power over our producers, \nover consumers, and I also argue over taxpayers.\n  In all due respect, when my friend from Kansas says we ought to look \nat the failed policies of the past, I want to say that we ought to look \nat the failed policy of the present.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle can talk about anything \nthey want to talk about. All of it is relatively important. Crop \ninsurance is important. We can do better. We can do better in a lot of \ndifferent areas. But let's not talk about failed policies of the past. \nLet's talk about the failed policy of the present because that is what \nfarmers are dealing with. Family farmers are going under, and time is \nnot neutral.\n\n  I want to shout it from the mountain top of the Senate in response to \nthe remarks of my good friend and colleague from Kansas. The most \nimportant thing that we can do is rewrite this farm bill. The most \nimportant thing we can do is make the kind of structural changes we \nneed to make so that family farmers can get a fair shake because right \nnow what we did in that ``freedom to fail'' bill is take away any \nopportunity for farmers to have any kind of leverage and bargaining in \nthe marketplace with these large grain companies. And, in addition, we \ntook away any kind of safety net.\n  So when part of the export market isn't there, although we are doing \nfine and the exporters are doing well, our family farmers aren't.\n\n[[Page S10079]]\n\n  The point is that for those farmers who do not have huge reserves for \ncapital and aren't the conglomerates, they go under.\n  Senators and United States of America, this debate about this \nemergency package--and more importantly the debate that is going to \ntake place this fall about how we write a farm bill--is a debate that \nis as important as we can have for anyone who values the family farm \nstructure of agriculture because we will lose it all if we don't change \nthis course of policy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just for a question.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota put his finger on it. When I heard \nthe Senator from Kansas speak, it seemed as if what he was saying was \nthat we are going to leave farmers and ranchers out there at the mercy \nof the grain companies, the packers, the wholesalers, the retailers, \nand the processors. They are making money in the domestic market, but \nthe farmers are not.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota: Does the Senator believe that it is \na viable responsibility for our government to ensure that family \nfarmers have some bargaining power, some power out there in the \nmarketplace so they can get a better share of the consumer dollar that \nis being spent in America today?\n  I add to that, I say to the Senator, that under previous farm \nprograms--and under what we have been advocating in terms of raising \nloan rates and providing for storage and things such as that--they \nprovided that farmers have a little bit better bargaining power in \nterms of selling their crops, and thus hopefully getting a better \nportion of their income from the market.\n  I thought it was a curious argument for a conservative from Kansas to \nbe making that the measure of the success of the Freedom to Farm bill \nis how the Government checks go out to farmers. I find that a curious \nargument.\n  My question to the Senator is whether or not it is a legitimate role \nfor the Federal Government to play to help level the playing field \nbetween farmers and those who buy their products from the farm.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me respond to my friend from Iowa. \nFirst, I agree it is ironic to hear some of our colleagues try to boast \nabout direct payments to farmers when they talk about the ``freedom to \nfail'' bill. By definition, if we are spending $17 billion a year for \npayments to farmers, the market is not doing a very good job.\n  Second, let me say to my colleague from Iowa, when I hear my good \nfriend from Kansas talk about the law of supply and demand, I smile \nbecause the family farmers throughout the country want to know where is \nAdam Smith's invisible hand? Where is the competition? It misses the \nvery essence of our debate. Conglomerates basically control almost all \nphases of the food industry, whether it is from whom the farmers buy or \nto whom they sell.\n  There are two questions: No. 1, how can we give family farmers some \nkind of leverage in the marketplace? We tried to do that in some of our \npast farm bills through the loan rate, and also a safety net, to try \nand deal with farmers when prices plummeted. Second is the compelling \ncase for antitrust action.\n  Let me say we are going to pass a bill that will provide some \nassistance to farmers, but there are two questions: What kind of \nassistance? I will analyze that in a moment. The challenge before the \nSenate is the kind of assistance. I think there are pretty huge \ndifferences.\n  In our bill, the Democrats bill, we have about $2 billion in \nassistance for disaster relief. In case anybody hasn't noticed, we have \ndrought in the country. We have people who are devastated, people who \ncannot grow anything. We have some disaster relief, $2 billion. I don't \nthink our colleagues on the other side have anything in that bill, in \nwhich case I say to colleagues when they vote on these amendments, it \nwould seem to me Members would be hard pressed to vote against an \namendment purporting to provide emergency disaster relief that doesn't \ntake into account the weather. Not only are my colleagues not taking \ninto account the failed policy of the present, they are not taking into \naccount the drought.\n  My second point: I far prefer, to the extent we can, to make sure the \nassistance gets to those farmers who need it the most. The AMTA \npayments tend to go to the larger producers and tend to go to land \nowners, even if they are not producers. It is quite different than LDP. \nI would like the LDP targeted, as targeted as possible.\n  There are some differences between these two proposals. The \nRepublican plan is similar to their tax cut plan. They parcel out \nbenefits in inverse relationship to need. What farmers are saying to me \nin Minnesota or when I was in Iowa this past weekend: Look, we want to \nget the price. We want to deal with the price crisis. We want to have a \nfuture.\n  If you are going to provide some assistance, I didn't hear farmers \ntalking about AMTA payments because they know the great share of the \nbenefits will go to those who need it the least.\n  We have some major differences. We take into account the drought--\nsmall thing, the drought. We make sure there is some direct assistance \nto people who are confronted with the drought. Our colleagues on the \nother side don't have such assistance.\n  In addition, we try to target to production as opposed to AMTA \npayments, which is all a part of the ``freedom to fail'' bill. It was \ntransition for people to go out. AMTA payments were great, as my \ncolleague from Kansas points out, when prices were up. Everybody loved \nit. The problem is the ``freedom to fail'' bill, which was passed, did \nnot take into account what would happen to family farmers when the \nmarkets collapsed, the prices were low, and there was no safety net, no \nbargaining power and no way that family farmers would be able to cash \nflow and make a living. There is no future for family farmers in the \nState of Minnesota with this failed farm policy.\n  I say to my colleagues, we have some votes this afternoon on the \nwhole question of some emergency assistance. That is step one.\n  I believe for reasons I have explained that our proposal makes much \nmore sense in terms of getting some help to people. If we are going to \ncall it emergency assistance--and that is what it is--then we better \nget some assistance to people who are devastated because of the \ndrought. We better have disaster relief in a bill which purports to be \nan emergency assistance package.\n  Second, we ought to try and make sure the benefits go to the people \nwho need it the most.\n  Finally, I say to my friends on the other side, I don't believe \nanybody should have to stand up and say the Freedom to Farm bill was a \n``freedom to fail.'' I don't care whether people have to admit to a \npast mistake. I don't want anybody to believe they have to admit to a \npast mistake. But we better change the policy. However we do it, \nwhatever Senators want to say, my focus is on the failed policy--not of \nthe past but of the failed policy of the present. My focus is on this \n``freedom to fail'' bill.\n  We have to take the cap off the loan rate, raise the loan rate. We \nhave to get a decent price. We have to target it and have a much \ntougher and fair trade policy. We have to make sure we have some \nconservation practices. We have to make sure we don't have people \nplanting fence row to fence row. We have to make sure we take antitrust \naction seriously. Teddy Roosevelt was for antitrust action a long time \nago.\n  It seems to me that the United States Senate can go on record to \nsupport antitrust action. It seems to me we can be on the side of \nfamily farmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield. I thought we were going back and \nforth but if the Senator would like to speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is very gracious to offer that. I do not ask \nthat. However, I wanted to have an understanding as to how we are \nproceeding. I believe I probably was on the floor ahead of most others \nother than the Senator. If the Senators are alternating, does the \nSenator from North Dakota wish to go next?\n  All I want is a chance to speak at some point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the Senator to yield for a question.\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, I sought an \nanswer to that question some while ago. I have been on the floor an \nhour. I stepped off the floor for a moment.\n  I believe the Senator from Mississippi indicated the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley, perhaps wanted to speak next. In any event, I think \nperhaps it would be helpful if we established some order, and I am \nwilling to accept whatever order the managers wish to establish. If I \nam not able to speak now or soon, I will ask consent to be recognized \nat 2:15 to speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I propose the following unanimous consent \nrequest, if it is agreeable to the Senator from Texas, the Senator who \nis managing the bill, and Senator Harkin. I ask unanimous consent that \nafter Mr. Gramm has completed his remarks, Mr. Dorgan be recognized, \nthen Senator Grassley, and then I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank all Senators. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I did not come over this morning to get \ninto a political debate about farm policy. But the issue is so \nimportant that I thought there were some things that need to be said \nthat I do not believe have been said. I would like to preface my \nremarks by saying that, to the best of my knowledge, my State is the \nbiggest beneficiary of American farm programs, not on any kind of per \ncapita basis but because we have a lot of farmers and ranchers.\n  I am very concerned about the drought in some parts of the country, \nwhich we have a long tradition of responding to and dealing with. That \ntradition has been based on documenting the drought, documenting the \nloss, and then compensating people who lose. It has not been based on \nanticipating a loss, estimating it, appropriating money on a widely \ndiscretionary basis and allowing bureaucrats to give out literally \nbillions of dollars. That has never been the policy in the past. I do \nnot think we ought to undertake it today. So before I get into the text \nof what I wanted to talk about, let me make it clear there are many \nareas of the country that are suffering from drought. We have a long \ntradition, an established program. I have been supportive of that \nprogram and I intend to continue to be.\n  What I want to talk about is not the drought. What I want to talk \nabout is what is happening in agriculture and my concern that we are \npartially misreading what is happening. I want to talk about farm \nprices, and I want to talk about the two remedies that have been \nproposed and that are currently before the Senate, and I want to voice \nmy concern about both of them.\n  I do not want to get into a political debate about farm policy, but I \nwant to make the point that I believe we are drifting far afield from \nany kind of rational farm policy in America in what we are doing. Maybe \nsome would view it as an unkind judgment, but in my opinion we are \nengaged now in a political bidding contest where we simply are seeing \nfigures made up on both sides of the aisle, I would say, where we are \ncompeting to show our compassion and competing to show our compassion \nwith somebody else's money. I would be moved into thinking this was \npure compassion if we were debating giving our own money. But since we \nare debating giving the taxpayers' money, it is hard to be \ncompassionate with somebody else's money.\n  Having said that, I see this farm problem a little bit differently \nthan most of my colleagues. Since I do not think this point has been \nmade in the debate, I want to make it.\n  First of all, it is clear, and I think everybody is in agreement on \nthis, that American agriculture has been affected by the Asian \nfinancial crisis and that the demand for American farm products from \nAsia has fallen off by 40 percent. The demand for farm products is what \neconomists call ``inelastic.'' That is, when the price changes, it \ndoesn't have an immediate, instantaneous or substantial impact on \nproduction. So this decline in the demand for products in Asia has had \na substantial impact on price.\n  Obviously, we are all hopeful that Asia is going to recover from its \nfinancial crisis and that they are going to be back in the market and \nthat this part of the factors that are driving down farm prices will go \naway over time. That is the basic logic of the proposal that has been \noffered by Senator Cochran. It basically is that as the Asian financial \ncrisis is solved, as Asians get used to, once again, consuming American \nfarm products--the best rice, the best meat, the best cotton; as they \nget used to the joys of wearing cotton underwear made of American \ncotton--they are going to buy a lot more of it and everything is going \nto come back and prices are going to be good again. To the extent that \nthesis is correct, the right thing to do is to adopt the Cochran \nsubstitute.\n  The Democrat substitute is really based on the logic that there are \nno markets. Our Democrat colleagues do not largely believe in markets \nand do not, by and large, believe in the basic principles of economics. \nThey would rather the Government make the price of farm products. So it \nis not surprising that their substitute has grown from $9.9 billion to \n$10.7 billion, 50 percent bigger than Senator Cochran, but they would \nbasically begin to take steps to go back to the old supply management \nprogram where the Government would be the setter of prices and where we \nwould, in essence, take American agriculture ultimately under this \nprogram out of the world market.\n\n  The problem with that, besides having a substantial impact on the \nstate of the American economy, is that primarily, while there are many \nfarm State Senators, there are relatively few farm district Members of \nthe House. If we go back to supply management, given the apportionment \nof representation in the House, we will never set prices that will be \nhigh enough to produce prosperity in rural America.\n  So I know all of the rhetoric, going back to the 1920s, much of which \nhas very leftist roots, would lead many of our Democrat colleagues to \nbelieve if we could get Government to manage agriculture, we could make \nit great. The problem is--and I say this as a person representing an \nagricultural State, a State that produces most farm products, the only \nState in the Union that produces both cane and beet sugar, a State that \nis in virtually every kind of agriculture that you can name--the plain \ntruth is that agriculture does not have enough political clout, day in \nand day out, to get the Government to set prices high enough that we \nwill ever have true prosperity in rural America. That is why I am never \nsupporting going back to the Government managing agriculture.\n  The only chance we have to make rural America not just a good place \nto live--because it is the best place to live. When I ultimately leave \nWashington--and I hope to be here as long as Strom Thurmond, which \nwould give me another 40 years--I do not ever plan to live in a town \nthat has a stoplight again. I prefer rural America. I think it is the \nbest place to live. I want to make it one of the best places to make a \nliving, which is why I was for Freedom to Farm and why the underlying \nphilosophy of the Cochran program is superior.\n  It does not appeal to people who want Government to manage things, \nwho believe that Government can do it better. But the plain truth is, \nwithout being unkind, there is only one place in the world where \nsocialism still has dedicated adherents, and that is on the floor of \nthe Senate and the floor of the House of Representatives. Everywhere \nelse in the world it has been rejected. But here it still has dedicated \nadherents, people who believe if we just let Government run things--\nhealth care, agriculture, whatever--that it would go better. I do not \nbelieve that is true.\n  But I want to go beyond simply pointing out the superiority of the \nCochran approach to the Democrat substitute. I want to raise a question \nabout both because there is another force at work that nobody is \ntalking about, and with which we are going to have to come to grips. \nFrankly, in representing a farm State, it is something about which I \nworry.\n  It is a blessing that creates a problem. The blessing is that while \nAmerica is in the midst of a technological explosion, technology in \nagriculture is growing twice as fast as technology in the economy as a \nwhole. Productivity\n\n[[Page S10081]]\n\nper farm worker is growing twice as fast as the productivity of the \nworker in the economy as a whole. So there is an underlying factor \nwhich is driving down farm prices which has nothing to do with the \nAsian financial crisis. That underlying factor is the explosion of farm \ntechnology. Farm technology, by driving down the cost of production, is \ndriving down the cost of farm products by increasing supply.\n  Let me give an example of it. We have fewer chickens in America today \nthan we had 10 years ago. Yet we are producing more poultry. We have \nfewer pigs today and yet we are producing more pork. How is that \npossible? Because of a technological revolution that is occurring in \nAmerican agriculture.\n  As I look at agriculture and as I look at the use of sensors, as I \nlook at the use of new technology, nobody can know the future but it \nseems to me, looking at it--the only way we can see the future is by \nlooking to the past. Looking at the recent past, it seems to me we are \nprobably on the edge of an explosion of technology driven by \nbiotechnology, driven by sensing devices, driven by the communication \nage where we are probably looking at a 20-year period where the natural \ntrend in farm prices, independent of the Asian financial crisis, will \nbe down.\n  Please do not believe because I say this that I want the trend to be \ndown. But I think if we are going to set out a long-term policy, we \nhave to understand the world at which we are looking. I believe these \ntechnological changes, which are partially responsible now for \ndeclining farm prices, are probably not going to go away.\n  One of the things I think that is hidden--I will get to these figures \nin a moment--is that while farm prices are down, so are farm costs. So \nthis is leading some people to look at farm prices and define a \nfinancial crisis which is clearly there but not to the degree that the \nprice of the final product alone would show.\n  Let me note that we had a recent estimate come out by USDA of net \nfarm income. Let me also remind my Democrat colleagues that the Clinton \nadministration runs the Department of Agriculture, not the Republican \nmajority in Congress. The Clinton administration is now forecasting \n1999 farm income to be $43.8 billion. Farm income in 1998 was $44.1 \nbillion. So that is three-tenths of $1 billion below last year.\n  If you look at the last 8 years, from 1990 through 1998, average farm \nincome has been $45.7 billion. We are looking at an income level that \nis basically $1.9 billion below that level. If you look at the last 5 \nyears of average farm income, it has been $46.7 billion. So in looking \nat that number, we are looking at an income level there where we are \nabout $2.9 billion below that level.\n  Part of the story that is not being told in this debate, as we sort \nof jockey back and forth as to who can tell the grimmest tale in \nagriculture, is that the current farm program is doing a lot for \nAmerican agriculture.\n  Last year, the American farm program, in dealing with a decline in \nprices, put into American agricultural $12.2 billion of income. Under \nthe existing programs that are in place, through guaranteed minimum \nprices, and other programs, we are looking already, without any \nlegislative action, because of the way the current law is written, at \nthe taxpayer paying $16.6 billion of payments to farmers. Or, in other \nwords, when the Department of Agriculture estimates that net farm \nincome next year is $43.8 billion, 39 percent of that estimate is made \nup of payments that are being made under the existing farm program.\n  Especially when our Democrat colleagues get up and talk about the sky \nfalling, they completely leave out of the story that under existing \nprograms we have guaranteed minimum prices, through our loan program, \nthat will mean $16.6 billion of payments from the Federal Treasury to \nthe American farmer without any legislative action whatsoever by the \nCongress.\n  So I guess the first question that I pose is, that if farm income \ntoday is $2.9 billion below the average of the last 5 years, and if the \nincome for the last 5 years has been the highest level of income in the \nmodern era, Why are we talking about $10.7 billion of new payments to \nAmerican agriculture?\n  From where did the $10.7 billion come? And $10.7 billion added to the \nlevel of farm income today would put average farm income substantially \nabove the average for the last 5 years, substantially above the average \nfor the last 8 years, and substantially above the average of farm \nincome in the modern era of America. From where did the $10.7 billion \ncome?\n  It seems to me that the $10.7 billion figure is simply a political \nfigure. It started out fairly low at the beginning of the year. It has \ngotten bigger every month. I now understand that in the House, \nDemocrats are asking for $12.9 billion. So what is happening is we are \nin a bidding contest.\n  Let me also say that in terms of the $6.9 billion that has been \nproposed on our side of the aisle, I do not see the logic of that \nnumber, either. It seems to me that since we have a loan program which \nin some cases has yet to be triggered because we have not harvested the \ncrops, so that we do not know, in the final analysis, the extent of the \ndrought or the impact of the bumper crop that is being produced in some \nparts of the country --we know the impact on price for corn and wheat \nand cotton and soybeans; we have a guaranteed minimum price--the \nlogical thing to do would be to not get involved in a political bidding \ngame but to simply allow the crop to be harvested, assess the drought \ndamage, and decide how much to do and how to target it to the people \nwho have actually lost money instead of a giant effort to simply throw \nmoney at the problem.\n\n  I am sure all of my colleagues are aware that from the disaster \nassistance for agriculture last year, still some of those programs have \nyet to be spent by the Clinton administration. So rather than getting \nin a bidding contest, it seems to me, with all due respect, that what \nwe ought to be doing is waiting until our crops are harvested and \nassess what farm income is, compare it to a norm for the recent \nhistoric period, and then decide what we want to do to try to make a \ncorrection, see to the extent to which programs that are now in effect \nhave an impact on farm income, and then figure out what the gap is \ncompared to the norm, and then decide who lost money, and then see what \nwe might do about it.\n  But with $10.7 billion, if you spent the money by giving it to \nfarmers, you would drive incomes far above the national norm, you would \nbe overcompensating, in some cases, several times; and in reality, much \nof this money goes to a bureaucracy in Washington and not to the \nfarmer.\n  So I am sorry that we have gotten into this debate, which ultimately \nhad to come when we brought up Ag appropriations because we are going \nto have an election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of next \nyear. So we are engaged in this political bidding contest for the \nsupport of American agriculture. I do not see how these kinds of \nnumbers can be justified, especially when we do not know what farm \nincome is going to be.\n  Let me also say that this appropriations bill does not even go into \neffect until October 1. Not one penny that would be spent by the \nadoption of either one of these amendments will be available to farmers \nuntil October 1, and given the record of the Clinton administration, it \nis highly probable that most of this money won't even be distributed \nuntil next year. My point is, why don't we wait until we have the \nactual data, until we know who actually lost money, and make a rational \ndecision.\n\n  Another point I would like to make----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, because of another engagement, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized to speak at 2:15 when the Senate \nreconvenes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there are some other figures I think we \nneed to look at in deciding what we should be doing. I want to raise \nthese. I know people are going to object to the fact that someone would \nactually try to raise concerns about the actual numbers we are talking \nabout in American agriculture, when we are engaged in a debate about \ntrying to outbid each other and spending money. This is from the \nEconomic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This\n\n[[Page S10082]]\n\nis their agricultural outlook, just published in July of this year on \npage 55.\n  Let me tell my colleagues why this is important, and then I will go \nthrough the numbers. Why this is important is, we are basically \npointing fingers back and forth saying we are not doing enough for \nAmerican agriculture and that we ought to spend $10.7 billion or we \nought to spend, in the House, $12.9 billion. I will go over a few \nfigures which stand out to me in that somehow what is being shown in \nthe actual numbers about agriculture and what is being debated on the \nfloor of the Senate are two entirely different things.\n  Facts are persistent things. In listening, especially to our \ncolleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle, one would assume that \nfarm assets are falling right through the floor. One would assume we \nare virtually back in the Depression and the Dust Bowl and that USDA \ninitial estimates for 1999 would be falling dramatically. Anybody who \nis listening to this debate would believe that is true.\n  Well, it is not true. In fact, in 1998, the preliminary number is \nthat the total value of farm assets was $1,124,700,000,000. The initial \nestimate by USDA--this is the Clinton administration--is that farm \nassets at the end of this year will be $1,140,300,000,000. So while we \nare talking about the world coming to an end in agriculture, we have to \njunk the farm program and go back to letting Government dictate farm \nprices and engage in artificial scarcity and pay farmers not to plant \nand basically turn agriculture into one giant cooperative on the Soviet \nstyle plan because of the collapse in American agriculture. The reality \nis that we are projecting farm assets to rise this year and not fall. \nIn fact, last year was a terrible year in agriculture. We had a huge \nfarm payment at the end of the year as part of our emergency spending.\n  What do you think happened to farm assets last year? They went up, \nnot down. They rose from $1,088,800,000,000 to $1,124,000,000,000. \nSomething about this picture doesn't fit.\n  Let me go on. What do you think is happening to financial assets held \nby American farmers and ranchers? If you listen to all this doomsday \nscenario from our Democrat colleagues about how we have to junk the \nfarm program and go back to a Government-run program, you would think \nfarmers and ranchers are having to sell off financial assets, cash in \ntheir retirement, withdraw money out of the bank, close down their IRAs \nto try to stay in agriculture.\n  Facts are persistent things. In fact, we are projecting that \nfinancial assets held by American agriculture will actually rise this \nyear from $50 billion to $51 billion.\n  Now, what do you think is happening to farm debt? You listen to all \nof this doomsday discussion about how we have to junk the farm program \nand have an American commissar of agriculture who has to go in and say: \nYou cut back production by 20 percent; you plant this crop; you plant \nthat crop; we will guarantee your prices. We will have artificial \nscarcity, and then we will make all this work through Government edict. \nWhat is the justification for all these program proposals? The \njustification, you would think, would be that farm debt is exploding; \nright? We are having a crisis?\n  Does anybody listening to this debate believe that farm debt in \nAmerica is not exploding? You would never believe it wasn't exploding. \nYou would think farmers are going deeper and deeper and deeper into \ndebt. You would be wrong. In fact, the USDA estimate is that farm debt \nwill actually decline in 1999, and it will decline from $170.4 billion \nto $169.1 billion.\n  What would you think would be happening to real estate debt? In \nlistening to our Democrat colleagues talk about how we have to have the \nGovernment take over agriculture and go back to a program where you \nbasically work off Government edicts because of a collapse in \nagriculture, you would think real estate debt is rising. People are \nhaving to borrow money against their land. They are having massive \nforeclosures. Could anybody listening to this debate not believe that \nreal estate debt was exploding in America? They couldn't. They would \nknow it had to be happening. But facts are persistent things. The fact \nis that real estate debt is actually declining in America. The \nprojection by USDA is that the amount of real estate debt that farmers \nand ranchers have will decline from $87.6 billion to $86.7 billion.\n  Could anybody listen to this debate and not believe that non-real \nestate debt that farmers have is exploding? That is not possible. You \nlisten to this debate, you have to conclude that every farmer in \nAmerica is going deeper and deeper and deeper into debt. They are \nborrowing money. They are losing money. There is a catastrophe, a \ncrisis, and we have to have Government take over agriculture. But \nastounding as it is, when you look at the numbers, non-real estate debt \nin agriculture is actually projected to decline in 1999 from $82.8 \nbillion to $82.4 billion.\n  Finally, there could be no doubt about it, listening to this debate. \nEquity in farms and ranches in America has to be plummeting. There is \nno way that you can have all these catastrophes we have heard about, \nleading us to the argument that we need to spend in excess of $10 \nbillion right now in agriculture, and we need to junk our whole export \nproduction-based farm system to go back to a program that we couldn't \nmake work in a simpler era when the Government basically ran \nagriculture. No one could doubt, not one person who listened to this \ndebate, if you did a survey, not one person in 1,000 would have any \ndoubt that farm equity, the equity of farmers and ranchers, what they \nown, has to be declining as a result of this agricultural crisis. But \nit is not so. In fact, equity, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nis projected to not only rise but to rise substantially in 1999, to \nrise from $954.3 billion to $971.2 billion. How can farm equity be \nrising when we have a crisis of such magnitude that we are debating \nhaving the Government take over American agriculture?\n  Well, the reality is, it is rising.\n  Let me mention two other figures. Could anybody listening to this \ndebate believe that the debt-to-equity ratio in American agriculture is \nactually declining in 1999 or that equity is rising and debt is \nfalling? Could you believe that, listening to this debate? You probably \ncould not, but it is. And in terms of debt-to-assets, it is also \ndeclining from a ratio of 15.2 to a ratio of 14.8.\n  Now, the reason I went through all these numbers is, we should not be \nhaving this debate right now. This has turned into a political bidding \ncontest where we are literally bidding to see who can spend more money. \nWe need to know what is going to happen in terms of this year's \nharvest, and we need to know what farm income is when the harvest is \nin, before we set out a program to spend billions and billions of \ndollars to, A, be sure we are helping the people who need help and, B, \nbe sure that the program makes sense.\n  There are some things we should be doing. We should be working to \nopen world markets. Part of Freedom to Farm was a commitment to change \ntrade policy. We ought to be debating trade today. We ought to be \ntalking about how we can get the President to go ahead and finish the \nnegotiations with China on WTO accession, so that they would have to \nlower their trade barriers against American agriculture. We should be \ndebating taxes today. We committed to a program of letting farmers not \nonly income average but to set aside a certain amount of income for a \n5-year period, so that when times are good, they can set aside money so \nthey have it when times are bad.\n  We ought to be talking about risk management and what we can do to \ndeal with it. We ought to be talking about regulatory reform, where \nregulations are having a heavier and heavier burden on American \nagriculture. But we are not. What we are doing is talking about \nspending vast sums of money when we have no documentation of the exact \nmagnitude of our problem or the distribution of that problem.\n  Now, I know the vote is going to be on, and I know we are going to \nhave it this afternoon. I know we are going to have an opportunity to \nspend $10.7 billion to junk the American farm program and go back to \nsupply management. I know we are going to have a vote on spending $6.9 \nbillion to keep the current system and just allocate $6.9 billion to be \ngiven away if and when, later on, the administration gets around to \nallocating it. But surely there must be some question raised when \naverage farm income for the last\n\n[[Page S10083]]\n\n5 years has been $46.7 billion. The projection by USDA is that farm \nincome will be $43.8 billion, and the adoption of either one of these \namendments will produce farm income far above the average of the last 5 \nyears.\n  Why is that a problem? It is a problem because if I am right that \nthis explosion of technology in agriculture, which is growing twice as \nfast in terms of technological advances as the whole economy, if this \nis going to mean that for 20 years we are going to tend to have \ndownward pressure on agriculture prices because of expansion in \nproduction and lower cost of production, to be in essence subsidizing \nand encouraging people to come into agriculture, or stay in it if they \nare inefficient, we are working counter to what we know has to happen \nfor agricultural prosperity to occur.\n  The reason I went to the trouble to come over here and raise all \nthese unpleasant facts in the midst of a debate about giving money is \nthat there is one other figure that just is extraordinary to me. What \nwould you think is happening to the amount of land being rented by \nAmerican farmers? Prices are falling. We had prices falling last year, \nand we had an emergency spending bill. What would you think would be \nhappening to cash rents? Well, everything I know about economics and \nabout agriculture would tell me that, knowing what happened last year \nwith prices declining and knowing the projections for this year, cash \nrents would have gone down. Everything you know would suggest that. \nBut, in reality, cash rents are up--up--so that farmers are spending \nmore money renting land in 1999 than they did in 1998. What does that \nsuggest? Well, it suggests that what we did in 1998 actually pulled in \nmore production, not less, and that we actually contributed to this \nproblem by what we did in 1998.\n\n  The world is not going to come to an end if we spend $10.7 billion or \n$6.9 billion. Every penny of it is going to be added to the deficit. \nThat is money that is not going to go to reduce debt, or fix Medicare, \nor pay for Social Security. We have all heard and used all those \narguments--mostly when it benefited our side of the argument.\n  But please consider what is going to happen if we continue with these \nprograms where the net impact is to bring more resources into an \nindustry that is having a technological explosion, which is expanding \nsupply, where we are producing more pork with fewer pigs, more poultry \nwith fewer chickens--what is going to happen if we continue for 3 or 4 \nmore years the kind of program we had last year, which apparently--and \nI simply raise the concern because nobody has mentioned it--what is \ngoing to happen if we are paying so much money that we are actually \nencouraging more production rather than compensating people partially \nfor their losses. The adoption of either one of these amendments will \nmean that farm income next year will be above the average for the last \n5 years.\n  Now, I would like farm income to be high. But the point is, I am \nafraid we are overriding the natural adjustment mechanism whereby, as \npeople can produce more and more product with fewer inputs, what tends \nto happen is, they put fewer inputs into the industry. If I am right \nabout this technology change, we are, with either one of these dollar \nfigures, planting a seed that is going to destroy American agriculture \nas we know it because we are going to end up exacerbating oversupply \nand driving prices further and further down, and then we are going to \nhave no choice except to let an awful lot of people go broke or to have \nthe Government come in and say: OK, you produce at 50 percent of your \ncapacity, and you produce at 50 percent of your capacity.\n  I just wish we were having somebody look at these kinds of problems \nbefore we got into this bidding war in the midst of an Agriculture \nappropriation bill. I wish we could wait until the fall and know what \nthe losses were. None of this money will be available until October 1. \nThen we can come up with a reasonable program to try to compensate for \nsome of these losses. But to simply be making up numbers in the \nbillions is very dangerous and irresponsible, and we could end up \nreally hurting the most efficient farmers and ranchers.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me all this time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, has the order been entered as yet with \nreference to the conference luncheons today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nthe Senate to recess for those luncheons be temporarily extended for a \nhalf hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Reserving the right to object, the Presiding \nOfficer has something that I have to do in the policy session and would \nnot be able to Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would be happy to Chair.\n  I have done a little bit of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the request were propounded to be here to \nhear the Senator's speech, the Chair would be willing to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Chair is very gracious.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed at this point \nin lieu of Mr. Dorgan. The list of names of Senators, I think, that \nhave been entered up to this point would be, as of this moment, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Byrd. And I have permission of Mr. Dorgan \nto substitute myself for his name at the moment, and let his name fall \nin place for my name under the present circumstance. So it would be Mr. \nByrd, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Dorgan.\n  I seek the help of the distinguished manager of the bill, Mr. \nCochran, who is my friend. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nat this point.\n  Would it be the wish of the manager, then, that the Senate recess, \nand the others on the list be recognized following the conferences?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think that \nis a good suggestion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I was on the floor and objected.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will allow me, I haven't forgotten my \npromise to the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the recognition \nof Mr. Dorgan, in order to comport with the understanding that there be \nalternative speakers, that a Republican Senator be recognized, and that \nhe then be followed by Mr. Baucus. This will all occur after the \nconference luncheons.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no objection. I think that is a \ngood suggestion.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the Chair's understanding as to how \nlong I will speak and when the Senate will recess for the conference \nluncheons?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the \nSenator will speak as long as he wishes.\n  Mr. BYRD. After which the conference luncheons will occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until the hour of 2:15.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. At which time those Senators on the list as presently \ndrawn would be recognized in the order stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, usually, in this town, newspaper headlines are about \npolitics. News stories feature articles about tax cuts, health care \nplans, and various partisan tactics.\n  But, yesterday's headline in the Washington Post, reads ``Drought Is \nWorst Since Depression,'' and the story that follows warns of drought \nconditions that have gripped the Mid-Atlantic that are second only to \nthe those seen during the bleak years of the Great Depression.\n  We have begun to feel the pinch of this drought, with water usage \nlimited in certain areas. With these restrictions, many people are \ninconvenienced by the loss of their home landscaping investments--\nwatching their grass, flowers, and shrubs slowly withering and turning \nbrown.\n\n[[Page S10084]]\n\n  But, this drought is more than an inconvenience for those employed in \none of America's hardest-working, most selfless professions. That is \nfarming. Farming is hard luck even at best.\n  I speak of the farmers throughout our region, including West \nVirginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware, they are more \nthan just inconvenienced. They are watching their very livelihoods \nslowly wither and turn to dust.\n  In West Virginia, this drought has devastated--devastated--the lives \nof hundreds of family farmers, and I am deeply concerned about the fate \nof West Virginia's last 17,000 surviving small family farms. West \nVirginia farmers work hard on land most often held in the same family \nfor generations. They farm an average of 194 acres in the rough \nmountain terrain, and they earn an average of just $25,000 annually. \nThat is $25,000 annually for 365 days of never-ending labor.\n  The distinguished occupant of the Chair, who hails from Wyoming, \nunderstands that farming is an every-day, every-week, every-month, 365-\nday operation every year with no time off. In farming there is no time \noff. That is $68.50 a day for days that begin at dawn and run past \nsunset in this scorching heat. Today, as the drought lingers on, West \nVirginia farmers, particularly cattle farmers, find themselves in \ncritical financial circumstances.\n\n  To address this crisis, I urge my colleagues to support the inclusion \nof a $200 million emergency relief program for cattle farmers in the \nFiscal Year 2000 Agricultural Appropriations Bill which is before the \nSenate. My provision--if enacted--would provide Federal disaster \npayments to cattle farmers for losses incurred as a result of this \nyear's heat and drought. Compensation would depend on the type and \nlevel of losses suffered, and would be available to cattle farmers in \ncounties across the Nation which have received a Federal declaration of \ndisaster for severe drought and heat conditions.\n  My provision provides direct assistance to farmers who have dedicated \ntheir lives to feeding this Nation, and who suffer at the will of \nMother Nature with no recourse.\n  In West Virginia, my emergency drought aid for cattle farmers will \nliterally decide the future fate of hundreds of small family farmers. \nThe drought has sucked the life from the land, and is on the verge of \ndraining the last resources from the pockets of the drought-stricken \nfarmers.\n  As of yesterday, Senator Rockefeller and I went to West Virginia and \nwere there when the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Glickman, was there \nto witness some of the drought-stricken areas in the eastern panhandle.\n  On that trip to West Virginia, Gus Douglas, the West Virginia \ncommissioner of agriculture, told of being at a market where animals \nwere being taken for sale.\n  One farmer, who had worked his entire life breeding a herd of which \nhe could be proud, was there with his animals. He was there to sell his \ncattle at this market. He was not there just with ten or twenty head of \ncattle. He was there with his entire herd. He knew that he did not have \nenough feed to make it through winter, so despite the fact that his \nanimals would be poor prospects at auction, he had brought them all to \nbe sold. They had already consumed the fodder that would otherwise \nsustain them through the coming winter months.\n  This farmer was losing twice. First, he would make no profit on the \ncattle he would sell. Second, he could no longer afford to keep his \nherd. It was time to completely liquidate the herd. As the farmer \nunloaded his animals at the market, there were tears in his eyes.\n  It was too late for this farmer, and if we do not act quickly to get \nan emergency assistance package passed, it will be too late for many, \nmany more family farmers throughout the land.\n  During our visit to West Virginia, Secretary Glickman declared all \nfifty-five West Virginia counties a federally designated disaster area. \nWest Virginia is not alone, and my provision will help, if it is \naccepted, if it is adopted, will help cattle farmers in Virginia, \nMaryland, Pennsylvania, and any other region that receives a natural \ndisaster declaration for excessive heat and drought.\n\n  During this visit with the Secretary, more than twenty farmers and \ntheir wives, gathered inside a barn on Mr. Terry Dunn's property in \nJefferson County to share their personal stories about how the drought \nis impacting them and what kind of help they need. The overwhelming \nconsensus was that programs that were designed to work at a time when \nour agriculture markets were strong, are not going to be enough to keep \na new generation on the family farm.\n  In spite of all types of adversity, family farmers have had the \ningenuity to keep their farms working for generations. Surely they can \nbe trusted to wisely use direct federal payments, and with this same \ntime-tested ingenuity, keep their farms running. Farmers in West \nVirginia have wisely diversified their crops. In ordinary years, many \nfarmers grow enough different kinds of crops to be able to feed their \nanimals, their families, and still take produce to market for a good \nportion of the summer. But, the extraordinary times of this drought \nrequire that we act now to help West Virginia's farmers and other \nfarmers in the non ``farm states'' who are currently experiencing \ndifficulties as the result of extreme weather conditions.\n  According to government statistics, West Virginia is experiencing \nsome of the most severe water shortages in the nation. Crop losses in \none county alone, Jefferson County, were estimated two weeks ago to be \nalmost $8.7 million and they are above that now. In the Potomac \nHeadwaters region of the state, conditions are much worse. Total \ndamages in the state for crop losses are more than $100 million. This \nfigure does not even include the value of grazing pasture lost and \nwinter feed eaten during the summer, or losses incurred from selling \nlivestock early, due to extreme weather conditions.\n  Almost fifty percent of West Virginia's cropland is pasture, forty-\nsix percent is harvested, and the remaining four percent is idle. The \nhay and corn that usually feed the cattle herds are gone. The ponds are \nshallow and foul, the springs are dried up, and the wells are dry.\n  Although West Virginia farmers are willing to work day and night to \nkeep up with the backbreaking work of farming, no amount of work will \nrestock the dwindling stores of grain that are now being used to keep \nanimals alive at the height of the summer growing season, when \npastureland should be more than enough to satiate an animal's hunger. \nNo amount of sweat can restore vigor to stunted crops that have gone \ntoo long without a soaking downpour of rain reaching the deepest roots. \nThere is little that these farmers can do to fill their wells or farm \nponds with water.\n  I traveled to see the damage that the drought in West Virginia is \ncausing for farmers. I heard for myself the stories they told. I saw \nfor myself the impact this drought is having, and I saw on those tired, \ndrawn faces the impact this drought is having on the bodies, the minds, \nand the souls of men and women who earn their bread by the sweat of \ntheir brow, in accordance with the edict that was issued by the Creator \nHimself when He drove Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.\n\n  We visited a corn field on Terry Dunn's farm. The reddish soil was \ndust at my feet. The corn stalks that should have grown beyond my head \nby this time of the season were barely knee high.\n  I wanted to see what kind of ears these stunted stalks were \nproducing. The ear of corn that I reached down and selected snapped too \neasily from the stalk. This not yet shucked ear of corn was barely \nbigger than two rolls of quarters. I saw the conditions of the cattle \nand pastureland in West Virginia. I saw the dry, cracked fields; I saw \nthe stunted corn stalks; and I heard the stories of farmers. It all \namounts to a heart-breaking picture.\n  I urge my colleagues to help all cattle farmers in areas declared as \nFederal disaster areas as a result of excessive heat or drought, and to \nsupport my provision in their behalf. My amendment will ensure direct \nrelief to the cattle farmers in the Northeast affected by this natural \ndisaster. It will serve to bolster other important aid for fruit and \ncrop losses.\n  The sweltering temperatures have taken their toll on farmers in the \nMid-Atlantic region. Let us not turn the heat up further. Let us \nsupport the small family farmer in his or her hour of need.\n\n[[Page S10085]]\n\n  My amendment is a part of the Daschle-Harkin bill.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \non this side of the aisle because I think it meets all the income \ndeficiency needs of American agriculture pretty much in the same way as \nthe Democrat proposal does, but it also does not spend money in a lot \nof other areas that do not meet the immediate needs of agriculture.\n  I have always thought of agriculture and the needs of food production \nand the process of food and fiber production in America as kind of a \nsocial contract between the 2 percent of the people in the United \nStates who earn their livelihood in farming and the rest of the 98 \npercent of the people, as well as a social contract of the last 60 \nyears of some Government involvement and some Government support of \nagriculture, particularly in times when income was very low.\n  Thinking of it as a social contract, then, I do not like to believe \nthere is a Democrat way of helping farmers or a Republican way of \nhelping farmers. I like to think of our being able to work together on \nthis social contract pretty much the same way we work together on \nMedicare and Social Security--to get agreements when there are changes \nmade in those programs.\n  In those particular programs--and, thank God, for most agricultural \nprograms--there have not been dramatic changes over the years unless \nthere has been a bipartisan way of accomplishing those changes. So, \nhere we are, with a Democrat proposal and a Republican proposal. People \nwatching this throughout the country, then, have their cynicism \nreinforced about how Congress does not cooperate.\n  While this debate has not been going on just today and yesterday but \nover the last 2 or 3 months, there was an assumption that there would \nbe help for agriculture under almost any circumstances; it was just a \nquestion of how to do it and exactly how much. While this debate was \ngoing on, we have had different approaches, and it has brought us to a \npoint where we have a Republican proposal and a Democrat proposal and \nwe are talking past each other. I am hoping sometime before this debate \ngets over today and we have a final document to vote on, that we are \nable to get together in a Republican and Democrat way and have a \nbipartisan solution, at least for the essential aspects of the debate \ntoday, which is to have an infusion of income into agriculture \nconsidering that we have the lowest prices we have had in a quarter \ncentury.\n  I think there are two stumbling blocks to this. I think on the \nDemocrat side the stumbling block to bipartisan cooperation is a belief \namong some of those Members that some of the money should find its way \nto the farmers through changes in the LDP programs as opposed to the \ntransition payments. On our side, the stumbling block seems to be that \nwe are locked into no more than $7 billion to be spent on the \nagricultural program.\n  So I hope somewhere along the line we can get a compromise on this \nside and a compromise on that side of those two points of contention. \nHopefully, we on this side could see the ability to go some over $7 \nbillion--and that the Democrats would see an opportunity to use the \nmost efficient way of getting all the money into the farmer's pocket \nthrough the AMTA payments.\n  The reason for doing it that way is because we do have a crisis. The \nbest way to respond to that crisis is through that mechanism because \nwithin 10 days after the President signs the bill, the help that we \nseek to give farmers can be out there, as opposed to a convoluted way \nof doing it through the LDP payment.\n  I do not know why we could not get a bipartisan compromise with each \nside giving to that extent--Republicans willing to spend more money and \nthe Democrats willing to give it out in the way that most efficiently \ncan be done.\n  So I see ourselves right now as two ships passing in the night, not \nspeaking to each other. We ought to be able to get together to solve \nthis. That is my hope. I know there are some meetings going on about \nthat now. I'm part of some of those meetings. I hope they can be \nsuccessful.\n  In the meantime, talking about helping the family farmer, I think it \nis very good to have a description of a family farm so we kind of know \nwhat we are talking about. I am going to give it the way I understand \nit in the Midwest, and not only in my State of Iowa.\n  But it seems to me there are three factors that are essential in a \nfamily farming operation: That the family makes all the management \ndecisions; that the family provides all or most of the labor--that does \nnot preclude the hiring of some help sometimes or maybe even a little \nbit of help for a long period of time; but still most of the labor \nbeing done by the family--and, thirdly, that the capital, whether it is \nself-financed or whether it is borrowing from the local bank or from \nanother generation within the family, is controlled by the family \nfarmer--the management by the family, the labor by the family, and the \ncapital controlled by the family.\n  Some people would say: Well, you have a lot of corporate farms. I do \nnot know what percent, but we do have corporate family farms. But that \nis a structure they choose to do business in, especially if they have a \nmultigenerational operation to pass on from one generation to the other \nand want to with a little more ease.\n  In addition, some people would say: Well, you have a lot of corporate \nagriculture. You might have a lot of corporate agriculture in America, \nbut I do not see a lot of corporate agriculture, at least in grain \nfarming in my State of Iowa--mainly because most corporate people who \nwant to invest their money do not get the return on land and labor \nthrough grain production that they normally want for a return on their \nmoney. Of course, that strengthens the opportunity to family farm. But \nat least when I talk about the family farmer, that is the definition \nthat I use.\n  In my State, the average family farm is about 340 acres. We have \nabout 92,000 farming units in my State. By the way, if we do not get \nthis agricultural economy turned around, we are going to have a lot \nless than 92,000 in a few months, as well.\n  Nationwide, there are about 2 million family farming operations with \nan average acreage of about 500 acres. So the average family farm size \nnationally is bigger than in my State. But remember, whether you farm \n10,000 acres as a cattle farmer in Wyoming or 2,000 or 3,000 acres as a \nwheat farmer in Kansas or 350 as a corn, soybean, or livestock \noperation in my State of Iowa, it still is one job or maybe two jobs \nbeing created with all that capital investment.\n\n  Let me tell you, it takes a tremendous amount of capital--both \nmachinery as well as land--to create one job in agriculture compared to \na factory, and many times more than for a service job. So those are the \nfamily farmers I am talking about whom I want to protect.\n  Earlier in this debate there was some hinting about the problems of \nthe farmers being related directly to the situation with the 1996 farm \nbill. I am not going to ever say that a farm bill is perfectly written \nand should never be looked at, but I think when you have a 7-year \nprogram, to make a judgment after 3\\1/2\\ years that it ought to be \nchanged, then what was the point in having a 7-year program in the \nfirst place?\n  It was that we wanted to bring some certainty for the family farmer \nwithout politics meddling in their business. A 7-year program was \nbetter than a 4- or 5- or 6-year program. So we wanted to bring some \ncertainty to agriculture.\n\n[[Page S10086]]\n\n Obviously, a 7-year program does that more so than a shorter program. \nSo a family farm manager would not have to always be wondering, as he \nwas making decisions for the long term: Well, is Washington going to \nmess this up for me as so many times decisions made by bureaucrats in \nWashington have the ability to do?\n  So I am saying some people here are hinting at the 1996 farm bill \nbeing that way. Others of us are saying that the trade situation is the \nproblem because farmers have to sell about a third of their product in \nexport if they are going to have a financially profitable situation.\n  I want to quote from Wallaces Farmer, January 1998, in which there \nwere tremendous prospects, even just 18 months ago, before the \nSoutheast Asia financial crisis was fully known, for opportunities for \nexports to Southeast Asia. That situation for the farmer was further \nexacerbated by the problems in Latin America. So I want to quote, then, \na short statement by a person by the name of John Otte: ``World \nfinancial worries rock grains.''\n\n       ``Expanding world demand, particularly in Asia, is the \n     cornerstone of the case for continued strength in corn, wheat \n     and soybean prices,'' points out Darrel Good, University of \n     Illinois economist.\n\n  Quoting further from the article:\n\n       Asian customers bought 57% of our 1995-96 corn exports, 66% \n     of our 1996-97 corn exports and almost 50% of our wheat \n     exports in both years. They [meaning Asian markets] are \n     important markets. No wonder Asian currency and stock market \n     problems bring grain market jitters.\n       ``Signs of stability in Asian financial markets as central \n     banks intervened to support currency values brought a sigh of \n     relief to U.S. commodity markets,'' says Good.\n       ``Whether late fall problems represent an economic hiccup \n     or the beginning of more serious problems is still unknown. \n     However, the developments underscore the importance of Asian \n     markets for U.S. crops.''\n\n  We know the end of that story. The end of that story is that we did \nhave that collapse of markets. And it very dramatically hurt our \nprosperity in grains in the United States last year, and more so this \nyear.\n  Now, just to put in perspective the debate today, because there is so \nmuch crepe-hanging going on, particularly from the other side of the \naisle, there is a quote here by Michael Barone of the August 28, 1995, \nU.S. News and World Report. One sentence that will remind everybody \nabout the greatness of our country and our ability to overcome some of \nthe problems we face comes from an article called ``A Century of \nRenewal.'' It is a review of the 1900s. He says:\n\n       There is something about America that makes things almost \n     always work out very much better than the cleverest \n     doomsayers predict.\n\n  So for my colleagues, particularly those on the other side of the \naisle who want to hang crepe and want to talk about the disastrous \nsituation we are in right now, I do not want to find fault with their \nbringing to the attention of our colleagues the seriousness of that \nproblem. But they should not leave the impression that there is no hope \nbecause this is America. We have gone through tough times before. All \nyou have to do is remember 1985 and 1986 in agriculture and the 1930s \nin agriculture. Yet the American family farm that was the institution \nthen--probably on average back in those days of only about 150 acres \nnationwide; today that is 500 acres nationwide--was a smaller \noperation, but remember, it was still run by the family farmer, the \nfamily making the management decisions, the family controlling the \ncapital, and the family doing the labor.\n  Please remember that, even the most cleverest of doomsayers here \ntoday: Don't give up on America. Don't give up on American agriculture. \nDon't give up on the family farmer. We are in a partnership during the \nperiod of time of this farm bill. We have to meet our obligations, and \nthat is what this debate is about. But this debate ought to be about \nhope for the family farmer as well.\n  I rise in support of our family farmers. Agriculture producers are in \ndesperate need of immediate assistance. We need to find the best \noptions available in these trying times. The Democrat proposal attempts \nto address the problems confronting our family farmers but, I think, \nfalls short of our most important goal, which is providing assistance \nas quickly as possible.\n  I realize this disaster affects farmers all across the Nation, but at \nthis moment I am most concerned about my friends and neighbors back \nhome. I am concerned that the Democrat alternative, by tying revenue \nrelief to the LDP payments, will delay the efficiency of delivering the \npayment, unlike the transition payment which is more efficient.\n  The Democratic alternative offers provisions that would have a long-\nterm effect upon agriculture. I don't want anyone to misunderstand me \non that point. There are many things we can do to improve the \nagricultural economy, but the task before us today is to develop and to \npass a short-term relief package that we can get out to those in need \nas quickly as possible.\n  According to the Farm Service Agency's estimate, the transition \npayments provided to corn growers this year will pay out at a rate of \n36 cents per bushel. The supplemental transition payment Republicans \nare offering will equal an additional 36-cent increase on every bushel \nof corn produced this year. That is 76 cents in assistance for Iowa \nfamily farmers, before you figure in any income through the loan \ndeficiency payment.\n  As a Senator from my State of Iowa, I believe it is also particularly \nimportant to include language providing relief for soybean growers who \nare not eligible for the transition payments. That is why our proposal \nalso contains $475 million in direct payments to soybean and other \noilseed producers. I am proud to say that Iowa is No. 1 in the Nation \nin the production of soybeans, but our growers have been hard hit by \ndevastatingly low prices. Prices for soybeans are the lowest they have \nbeen in nearly a quarter of a century, down from the $7-a-bushel range \njust a couple of years ago to less than $4 today, which is way, way \nbelow the cost of production. That is why I and other Senators \nrepresenting soybean-producing States wanted to make sure that soybean \ngrowers were not left out of any relief package.\n\n  Finally, the Democrat proposal falls short in another very important \narea. I think it undermines our U.S. negotiating objectives in the new \nmultilateral trade negotiations that the United States will launch \nlater this year. It will sharply weaken, and perhaps destroy, our \ncountry's efforts to limit the enormously expensive European Union \nproduction subsidies that make it impossible for our farmers to sell to \nthe 540 million European consumers.\n  I will say a brief word on that point. First, the United States just \npresented four papers to the World Trade Organization in Geneva \noutlining U.S. objectives for the new agriculture negotiations starting \nthis fall. The first of these papers deals with domestic support. It \nstates that the United States negotiating objective with regard to \ndomestic support is a negotiation that results in ``substantial \nreductions in trade-distorting support and stronger rules that ensure \nall production-related support is subject to discipline.''\n  Production-related payments are by definition trade distorting. They \nare exactly the kind of payments that we want the European Union to get \nrid of. I don't know how we can enter into tough negotiations with \nEuropeans, with their production payments our No. 1 negotiating target, \nwhile we boost our production-related payments at the same time, which \nis what is done with part of the money under the Democrat proposal. \nThis would undermine our negotiators and give the Europeans plenty of \nreason to hang tough and to not give an inch.\n  My second point is closely related to the first. We will measure \nsuccess at the new world trade talks based on how well we do at \ncreating an open global trading system. The European Union's common \nagricultural policy nearly torpedoed world trade negotiations as early \nas 1990. The European Union later said it was reforming its common \nagriculture policy, but farm handouts this year in the European Union \nwill reach $47 billion, nearly half of the entire European Union \nbudget. Moreover, the largely production-based European Union subsidies \nstill help those who least need help. Twenty percent of the European \nUnion's richest farmers receive 80 percent of the common agriculture \npolicy handout.\n  World farming is sliding deeper into recession with prices of some \ncommodities at historic lows. Now is not the\n\n[[Page S10087]]\n\ntime to give up on pressing the European Union hard to truly reform \nthis vastly wasteful subsidy program in their continent. But that is \nexactly what we would end up doing if we go down the same road of tying \npart of these payments to production, as the Democrat alternative would \ndo.\n  There are many enemies of agriculture market reform in the European \nUnion who are just looking for any circumstance to justify their \nspecial pleading and to combat and counteract United States negotiators \nin order for the European Union to keep their production subsidies \ngoing. I am afraid that is exactly what the Democrat plan would do. I \nthink as chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee, I have a \nresponsibility to tell my colleagues this.\n  We should not hand the European Union an excuse to back away from \nreal reform that opens the European Union's huge agricultural markets \nto American farmers.\n  The proposal that we pass today should be the fastest and most \nefficient option available to help our family farmers. The most \nimportant thing we can do today is to work towards providing emergency \nrevenue relief to our farmers as quickly as possible.\n  It is for that reason I urge my colleagues to vote for our Republican \nalternative, to provide ample and immediate relief for hard-hit \nfarmers, assuming we are not able to work out some sort of bipartisan \nagreement between now and that final vote.\n  I only ask, in closing, for people on the other side of the aisle who \nare criticizing the 1996 farm bill to remember that what we call the \n1996 farm bill relates mostly to agricultural programs and totally to \nthe subject of agriculture. We need to look beyond that basic \nlegislation and realize there were a lot of things promised in \nconjunction with that farm bill through public policy that we have not \ngiven the American farmer, which makes it difficult to say we have \nfully given the American farmer--the family farmer--the tools he or she \nneeds to manage their operation in the way they should.\n  Yes, we have given them the flexibility to plant what they want to \nplant without waiting for some Washington bureaucrat to do that. We \nhave given them the certainty of a certain transition payment every \nyear, from 1996 through the year 2002. We have told them, with the 7-\nyear farm program, that they have 7 years where we are going to have \nsome certainty, political certainty, in Washington of what our policies \nare. But we also promised them more trading opportunities.\n  We have not made the maximum use of the Export Enhancement Program so \nthat we have a level playing field for our farmers. We have not given \nthe President fast track trading authority so that in the 24 agreements \nthat have been reached around the world among other countries we could \nhave been at the table, and haven't been at the table, and that there \nis no President of the United States looking out for U.S. interests in \nthose negotiations; and for the sake of the American farmer, we should \nbe at some of those tables--at least those tables where agriculture is \nbeing talked about.\n  We have not given the farmer the regulatory reform that has been \npromised. And from the standpoint of taxes, we haven't given the farmer \nthe opportunity, through the farmers savings account, to level out the \npeaks and valleys of his income by being able to retain 20 percent of \nhis income to tax in a low-income year, so that he is not paying high \ntaxes one year and no taxes another year. We haven't given him the \nability to do income averaging without running into the alternative \nminimum tax. We haven't reduced the capital gains tax enough. And we \nstill have the death tax, the estate tax, which makes a lot of family \nfarmers who want to keep the farm in the family sometimes have to sell \nthe farm to pay the inheritance tax, instead of keeping the family farm \nand passing it down from one generation to another. Sometimes, if they \ncan't afford to do that, they either make their operation so \ninefficient that they close down business or else they have a terrific \ntax burden over them as well.\n  So here we have an opportunity to--in the spirit of the 1996 farm \nbill, when we told the farmers of America we were going to have a \nsmooth transition over the next 7 years, we said to them we are going \nto set aside $43 billion for each of those next 7 years--not for each, \nbut cumulative for those 7 years. This year, it is $5.6 billion. Well, \nwe look back now, and in 1996 we did not anticipate the dramatic drop-\noff in exports because we could not have predicted the Southeast Asian \nfinancial crisis and the contagion that caught on in Latin America. So \nwe are going back now, unapologetically, on keeping a promise to the \nfamily farmers that we are going to keep this smooth transition we \npromised them, and that is what the amount of money we are talking \nabout here on the floor is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have waited some while to be able to \nspeak on these disaster bills and on this general issue. I am very \npleased to have the opportunity for my colleague from New York who \nasked if I would yield for a minute for a question. I am happy to do \nthat.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota and \nSenators Harkin and Daschle for the farm aid amendment, and for their \nhard work. This measure will help farmers across the country, including \nthe farmers of New York State, who were hard hit by drought and last \nyear's storms.\n  We are in the midst of the worst drought since the Dust Bowl in my \nState. There is not a penny of relief for farmers with drought \nassistance. This drought is affecting farmers throughout the Eastern \nUnited States. When I meet with farmers in New York who tell me they \nare facing unprecedented losses, they are now pointing to letting \nfields die off to conserve water, or other fields. We can't do anything \nabout the rain, but the Democratic amendment would increase section 32 \nfunding to give farmers some relief from the devastation on the farm \nand would increase funding for the disaster relief fund--something that \nwould help New York's apple and onion farmers who faced tens of \nmillions in losses last year.\n  In urging my colleagues to support the Democratic amendment, I simply \nask the Senator from North Dakota, am I correct in assuming that the \nDemocratic amendment does have this kind of drought relief, which is \nnot in the other bill?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New York is correct. That is one of the \ndistinctions between these two pieces of legislation. As the drought \nspreads across the eastern seaboard and other parts of the country and \nbegins to devastate producers there, there needs to be some disaster \nrelief. We have two pieces of legislation proposed today, one of which \nhas no disaster relief at all, even in the face of this increasingly \ndifficult drought.\n  So the Senator from New York, speaking on behalf of producers who are \nhard-hit in New York, is certainly accurate to say that the amendment \nwe have offered provides drought relief and the alternative does not.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his generosity.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is not about Republicans and \nDemocrats. I start by saying to my colleague from Iowa that I hope, \nwhatever comes from all of this debate, at the end of the time we can, \nas Republicans and Democrats, find a way to provide appropriate relief \nto people who are hurting. There is not a Republican or a Democratic \nway to go broke on the family farm. The destruction of hopes and dreams \non the family farm is something that is tragic and something to which \nwe need to respond.\n  This is not of the family farmers' making. They didn't cause prices \nto collapse or the Asian economies to have difficulty, and they didn't \ncause a wet cycle or crop disease. It is not their fault. We must, it \nseems to me, respond to it. But it is appropriate, I think, for there \nto be differences in the way we respond. There is a philosophical \ndifference in the way we respond. Also, there has been a difference in \nthe aggressiveness and interest in responding. I know that if this kind \nof economic trouble were occurring on Wall Street or in the area of \ncorporate profits, we would have a legislative ambulance, with its \nsiren, going full speed in trying to find a solution. It has not been \nquite so easy because it is family farmers.\n  Darrel Sudzback is an auctioneer from Minot, ND. Blake Nicholson, an\n\n[[Page S10088]]\n\nAssociated Press writer, wrote a piece the other day. He said:\n\n       Darrel Sudzback likens farm sales to funerals. He said, \n     ``If you don't know the deceased, you are not likely to get \n     emotional.'' But more often than not these days, auctioneers \n     must help a friend or a neighbor sell off a lifetime of hard \n     work. Marvin Hoffman says, ``It just hurts me to do this. \n     When they hurt, I hurt.'' With many families [Mr. Nicholson \n     writes] sliding deeper into an economic nightmare, the number \n     of farm sales in North Dakota continues to rise. ``It used to \n     be,'' one auctioneer said, ``that a farm auction was kind of \n     like a social event, a joyful event when somebody was \n     retiring.'' Julian Hagen said that he conducted auction sales \n     for 43 years, but he said, ``Now there is a different \n     atmosphere at auction sales. If people know that a man is \n     forced out, that is not a good feeling. It is tough to deal \n     with when you have known a family farmer for quite a few \n     years, and now they have to give up a career or property \n     they have had in the family for generations. I try to stay \n     as upbeat as I can. Bankers in north-central North Dakota \n     say that area has been hit by 5 years of flooding and crop \n     disease, and many farmers have been forced off the land.\n\n  People need to think of this problem in terms of not only lost \nincome, but assume you are on a farm and you have a tractor; you have \nsome land; you have a family; you have hopes and dreams. You put a crop \nin the ground and see that this is what has happened to your income--to \nyour price.\n  Then on top of that, add not only collapsed prices, but add the worst \ncrop disease in this century--the worst in a century in North Dakota. \nOn top of that, add a wet spring so that 3.2 million acres--yes, I said \n3.2 million acres--of land could not be planted. It was left idle. Add \nall of those things together, and you have a catastrophe for families \nout there struggling to make a living.\n  Will Rogers was always trying to be funny. He used to talk about the \ndifference between Republicans and Democrats. He said on April 6, 1930, \n``Even the Lord couldn't stand to wait on the Republicans forever.''\n  He was talking about the farm program.\n  There is a difference, it seems to me. There is a difference between \nRepublicans and Democrats in how we construct a solution to the \ndisaster and the crisis, and how we feel the underlying farm bill \nshould be changed.\n  Will Rogers also said, ``If farmers could harvest the political \npromises made to them, they would be sitting pretty.''\n  I want to talk a bit about those political promises--the political \npromises given farmers early on to say that we want to get rid of the \nfarm program as we know it in this country, get rid of the safety net \nas we know it, and create something called ``transition payments'' \nunder the Freedom to Farm bill.\n  I mentioned yesterday that the title was interesting to me. Sometimes \ntitles can change how people perceive things notwithstanding what might \nbe the real part of a proposal. Early on when people began to sell \ninsurance in this country, they called it death insurance. You know, \ndeath insurance didn't sell too well. So they decided that they had \nbetter rename it. So they renamed it life insurance, and it started \nselling. It was a better name. It is a product that most Americans need \nand use.\n  It is interesting. What is in a name. The name for the farm bill a \nfew years ago was Freedom to Farm. We passed a Freedom to Farm bill. \nThe wheat price slump on this chart may be unconnected, or maybe not to \nFreedom to Farm.\n  Here are the wheat prices before--Freedom to Farm--and wheat prices \nsince. Chance? Happenstance? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe we face a \ncircumstance in this country where the underlying farm bill was never \ndesigned to work and allowed for collapsed prices. Maybe that is the \nfact.\n  I want to begin with a bit of history.\n  About 40 years ago, a biologist by the name of Rachel Carson wrote a \nbook that in many ways changed our country. It was called ``The Silent \nSpring.'' The book documented how the products of America's industrial \nproduction were seeping into our country's food chain. The modern \nenvironmental movement was also from Rachel Carson's book, ``The Silent \nSpring.''\n  Today we face another ``silent spring'' in this country. Like the \nfirst, it is of a human making. But it is not about birds, and it is \nnot about fish. It involves our country's independent family farmers \nand producers. It involves our social habitat--the farm communities of \nwhich family farmers are the base.\n  We know that family farmers are hurting. In fact, many would consider \nit an extraordinary year if they had any opportunity at all to meet \ntheir cost of production. I know of cases that break my heart--people \nwho have fought for decades, and now are losing everything they have. \nWhat is worse is that some opinion leaders are starting to throw in the \ntowel. They say, well, maybe family farming is a relic of the past. \nMaybe it is not of value to our country anymore. Maybe it is time to do \nsomething else.\n\n  I don't buy that at all. I think one thing we can say about the \nfuture is that people will be eating. The world's population is growing \nrapidly. Every month in this world we add another New York City in \npopulation. Every single month, another New York City in population is \nadded to our globe. We know there is no more farmland being created on \nthis Earth. It doesn't take a genius to put those two together.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to underscore the point the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota is making.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to go with Secretary Glickman and \nGovernor Glendening to visit one of the farms that has been affected by \nthe drought in our State. It is devastating to see. Of course, it is a \ncompound of two things: The low commodity prices, which the Senator is \ndemonstrating with his charts--this is not only wheat but the same \nthing applies to other basic commodities as well--and the drought, \nwhich is crippling certain parts of the country.\n  We talked to this farmer who has been farming ever since he was a \nyoung boy. His father was a farmer. His grandfather was a farmer. He \ndoesn't know whether he will be in farming next year because of what \nhas hit them--the combination of the low commodity prices and the \ndrought which is now desperately affecting our country.\n  He is not alone. Farmers across Maryland and indeed, the nation, are \nfinding themselves facing similar circumstances. Nearly one fourth of \nMaryland's corn crop is in poor to very poor condition. Likewise, 55 \npercent of pastures and hay fields are in poor or very poor condition. \nMilk production has decreased because of the high temperatures. And \nbecause pastures and field crops are in such bad shape, cattle and \ndairy farmers are now faced with a dilemma, whether or not to sell \ntheir animals or begin feeding them hay which should be utilized over \nthe winter.\n  Maryland has suffered extensive drought damage for three consecutive \nyears. However the drought this year is by far the worst since the \ndepression. Yesterday, the United States Geological Survey reported \nthat we may be in the midst of what could become the worst drought of \nthe 20th century. Rainfall throughout Maryland is currently between 40 \nand 50 percent below normal. Throughout Maryland, counties are \nreporting losses as high as 100 percent for certain crops. Most \nalarmingly, there is no end in sight.\n  But the crisis affecting agriculture is about more than the drought. \nThe dramatic drop in commodity prices, since the enactment of the \nFreedom to Farm Act, has had its affect on farmers throughout the \ncountry and the State of Maryland. The poultry industry, which is \nMaryland's largest agricultural producer, has witnessed a 45-percent \ndecrease in exports. The situation for farmers is bleak and many are \nlosing their businesses.\n  Mr. President, Maryland depends on agriculture. Agriculture is \nMaryland's largest industry contributing more than $11 billion annually \nto our economy. More than 350,000 Marylanders--some 14 percent of our \nState's workforce--are employed in all aspects of agriculture from farm \nproduction of wholesaling and retaining. Forty percent of our State's \nland is in agriculture--more than 2 million acres. So when our family \nfarmers and the farm economy start hurting--everyone suffers.\n  Our farmers are in trouble and they deserve our assistance. This \nmeasure provides that assistance in the form of direct payments and low \ninterest loans.\n\n[[Page S10089]]\n\nIt gives nearly $11 billion in emergency assistance to farmers and \nranchers who have been affected by natural disaster and economic \ncrisis. $6 billion of that amount will deliver income assistance to \nfarmers hit hard by the economic disaster. And more than $2.6 billion \nwill be used to address natural disasters such as the drought. Within \nthe disaster funds, nearly $300 million in section 32 and disaster \nreserve funds has been included to specifically address the Mid-\nAtlantic drought.\n  Mr. President, the need for this amendment is real. Until we are able \nto reform the Freedom to Farm Act or manufacture rain, these funds are \nvital to the preservation of the farm industry throughout the State of \nMaryland and the United States.\n  In my judgment, it is imperative that we pass this legislation.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator from North Dakota yielding. I want \nto underscore the crisis nature of the situation to which he is \nreferring.\n  I want to acknowledge the consistent and effective leadership which \nhe has exercised on many of these farm issues. He and others of us \nexpressed concerns and questions at the time the 1996 act was passed. \nMuch of that now seems to have come around to hit us--compounded, of \ncourse, by these serious weather circumstances which exist not in all \nparts of the country but in certain parts of the country.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. He is talking about a \ndrought which is devastating part of our country even as collapsed \nprices have been devastating wheat farmers and the grain farmers in my \npart of the country.\n  I want to respond to some things that were said earlier today that \nsomehow we are not as efficient as we need to be as family farmers.\n  In my judgment--and I think the evidence supports this--the family \nfarmer in our country is as productive as any in the world. It supports \nour rural communities in ways that corporations never will and never \ncan.\n  Family farmers have faced hard times before. This is not something \nnew. The history of farming is a history of difficulty. But never \nbefore has the Federal Government done so little to help and so much to \npush the producer off the edge.\n  On top of the floods that we have talked about and the drought and \nthe slump in the foreign markets, our farmers are facing a plague of \ndeliberate public policies--yes, established here in Washington--that \nundermine their economic interest. They face trade agreements designed \nfor the convenience of food processors rather than food producers. They \nface a ``see-no-evil'' posture toward antitrust enforcement that has \nleft family farmers selling into controlled markets that dictate the \nterms to them. On top of that, they face a 1996 farm bill that \nfundamentally doesn't and can't work.\n  There is a larger issue than dollars and cents; namely, the kind of \ncountry we are going to be.\n  It is not fashionable to raise all of these issues. We are supposed \nto keep our mouths shut and cash in on the stock market which has done \nquite well. But the Founding Fathers didn't create this country \nprimarily to be an engine of stock market riches or rising gross \ndomestic product. They created this country to promote a way of life \nbased on freedom and democracy and independent producers in contrast to \nthe aristocracy they left behind in Europe.\n  The concept of independence and freedom was rooted in the land, and \nthey couldn't conceive of these things being separate.\n  Wendell Berry, a farmer, testified recently in Washington at a \nhearing that I chaired. He said:\n\n       Thomas Jefferson thought the small land owners were the \n     most precious part of state, and he thought government should \n     give priority to their survival. But increasingly, since \n     World War II our government's manifest policy has been to get \n     rid of them. This country is paying a price for this. That \n     price doesn't show up on the supermarket shelves but rather \n     our Nation's spirit and our character.\n\n  Independent family-based agriculture produces more than wheat, beef, \nand pork. It produces a society and a culture, our main streets, our \nequipment dealers, our schools, our churches, and our hospitals. It is \nthe ``culture'' in agriculture. Take away family-based producers and \nall that is left are calories. That is a radical change in our country. \nI am not talking about rural sentimentalism or nostalgia. It is \nsomething we know from experience. Rural communities work. They have so \nmany of the things the Americans all over this country say they want, \nincluding stable families, low crime rates, neighborliness, a volunteer \nspirit.\n  In my hometown of Regent, ND, they still leave the keys in the car \nwhen they park on Main Street. Try doing that here. Many Americans have \nplenty of food on their tables, but what they feel is a growing dearth \nof the qualities that they want most are the qualities that farm \ncommunities represent. It would be insane, in my judgment, to stand by \nand let these communities wither on the vine by neglecting the economic \nbase that sustains them.\n  Yes, the Nation's financial establishment is enthused about that \nprospect. It can't wait to turn hog barns into agrifactories and more. \nHowever, that will not advance this country's interests. We can't stop \nbad weather and we can't stop unruly markets, but we can change Federal \npolicies that turn adversity into quicksand for family farmers.\n  I listened to a ringing defense of the current farm program. I \nlistened to one of my colleagues who was an economist, and I mentioned \nbefore I used to teach economics but was able to overcome that and go \non to think clearly. There is an interesting debate among economists \nabout all of these issues. First, is there a crisis? Listening to part \nof the debate this morning one would think there is nothing wrong on \nthe family farm. Is there a crisis? Would anyone in this country be \nfeeling there is a crisis if this is what happened to their income? If \nany sector of the American economy had this happen to their income, \nwould they consider it a crisis? The answer is, of course.\n  I had a farmer come to a meeting who farmed the lands that his \ngranddad farmed, his dad farmed, and he farmed. He stood up and said: \nFor 23 years, I farmed this land. His chin began to quiver and his eyes \nbegan to water. He could hardly speak. He said: I'm going to have to \nleave this farm.\n  Anyone could tell he loved what he did. He was going to lose the farm \nthat his granddad, dad, and he had farmed for those many decades. Is \nthat a crisis? I think so.\n  In my State, add to the fact that incomes have collapsed because of \nprice collapses, 3.2 million acres were not planted because of wet \nconditions in the spring--3.2 million acres. A young boy wrote some \nwhile ago and said: My dad could feed 180 people and he can't feed his \nfamily.\n  Is that a crisis? Of course.\n  Why the crisis? I mentioned collapsed prices and a wet spring and the \nworst crop disease in the century in our part of the country. This \nnotion of a farm bill that says the free market shall determine what \nhappens in agriculture, by cutting the tether and turning it all loose, \nfinds you scratching your head and wondering, gee, why didn't this work \nout the way we thought? Because the market isn't free. It never has \nbeen free and never will be free.\n  That bill that says we will transition farmers out of any help, over \n7 years that bill transitions farmers into a marketplace that is fixed. \nDoes anybody know what kind of tariff we have putting beef into Japan \nat this moment? I guess it costs $30 or $35 a pound to buy T-bone steak \nin Tokyo. Does anybody know what tariff exists on beef going into \nJapan? Very close to 50 percent. That is a failed free market by any \ndefinition anywhere. That is after we reached an agreement with them 10 \nyears ago.\n  How about China? They consume half the world's pork. Are \nwe delivering a lot of hogs into China? No, we have a $50 billion to \n$60 billion trade deficit with China and we are not exporting enough \nhogs into China.\n\n  What about wheat in Canada? No. I drove to the border of Canada with \na truck and couldn't get the wheat into Canada. I stopped at the \nborder, and all the way to the border, semitruckload after \nsemitruckload after semitruckload was coming into this country, hauling \nCanadian grain into our country and undercutting our farmer's prices. \nWe sit at the border trying to go north, you can't. The border coming \nsouth is flooded by millions\n\n[[Page S10090]]\n\nof wheat acres, unfairly subsidized, sold to us by a Canadian wheat \nboard. It is a state monopoly and would be illegal in this country, \nwith it's secret prices. Our trade officials downtown wouldn't lift a \nfinger--never have and never will--to deal with the unfair trade \npractices.\n  I mention Japan, China, and Canada. I could list other countries for \nan hour, but I won't. Then we say to the family farmers, operate in a \nfree marketplace. That is what we have created, a marketplace that is \nfundamentally corrupt with respect to fairness to our family farmers.\n  My colleague this morning, Senator Conrad, talked about the Europeans \nsubsidizing exports to the tune of ten times our subsidies. Is that \nfair competition? I don't think so.\n  Over and over and over, if it is not just unfair competition in \nselling, selling into our marketplace with products that ought not be \nallowed, produced with growth hormones or produced with chemicals that \nwe wouldn't allow to be used in this country on animals or grains--that \nhappens every day in every way.\n  We produce canola in this country and we are prevented from using a \nchemical on the canola that we would purchase from Canada because that \nchemical can't be allowed into the country. However, the Canadians can \nuse that chemical on their canola, plant the canola, harvest it, and \nship it into Belfield, ND, to put it at a crushing plant, crush it, and \nput it into our food chain.\n  My farmers say: Why is that the case? What is going on here?\n  What is going on here is family farmers have been set up in every \nsingle way, set up for failure.\n  I heard this morning what was being proposed here was socialism. I \nheard what was being proposed here was being proposed by a bunch of \nleftists. I heard what was being proposed here was being proposed by \npeople who don't believe in the principles of economics. I sat here and \nthought, that is novel; an interesting, pithy new political debate \ncalling people socialists or leftists. Or maybe it isn't so new. Maybe \nit is just a tired, rheumatoid, calcified debate by people who can't \nthink of anything else to say.\n  Deciding to stand up and help family farmers in a time of crisis and \ntrouble is socialistic? Are you kidding me? It is everything that is \nright about the instincts of this country.\n  When part of this country is in trouble, the rest of the country \nmoves to help. I wasn't there, but in the old wagon train days when we \npopulated the western part of this country with wagon trains, one of \nthe first lessons learned was don't move ahead by leaving somebody \nbehind. That is an indelible lesson. The same is true with this country \nand its economy. Don't move ahead by leaving some behind. When family \nfarmers are in trouble, we have a responsibility to help, not crow \nabout socialism and leftists. What a bunch of nonsense.\n  The fact is, the same kind of debate includes this: We are no longer \nthe most efficient in farming. I heard that this morning. We are no \nlonger the most efficient in farming. Nonsense. Show me who is better. \nTell me who is better. I am sick and tired of this ``blame America \nfirst'' notion. We lose because we are no longer the most efficient. \nTell me who is more efficient anywhere else in the world. Stop blaming \nthis country first for everything.\n  If we had a free market, if we had open markets, if we had fair \ncompetition, if we didn't have policymakers setting up family farmers \nfor failure, and if they paid as much attention to the family economic \nunit--which apparently has no value to a lot of folks in this country--\nas we do for the corporate economic unit, maybe we would see some \npolicies that would say to family farmers, you matter in this country's \nfuture and we want to keep you.\n  I do not understand much of this debate, except we face the \nrequirement to do two things, and we need to do them soon. First, we \nmust respond to a farm crisis. That is the purpose of the two bills on \nthe floor of the Senate today. We do it in very different ways.\n  As my colleague from New York mentioned, the majority party bill \ndoesn't even respond to any part of the disaster; there are no disaster \nprovisions at all. Of course, we have a substantial part of this \ncountry now facing a serious drought, so it is a very serious problem. \nWe have very different ways in which we provide income support to \nfamily farmers. The majority party follows the Freedom to Farm bill, \nwhich of course is a total flop, total failure. It gives payments to \npeople who are not producing. It says: You are not producing; you are \nnot in trouble; you don't have any crop; here's some money. What kind \nof logic is that? It doesn't make any sense.\n  We propose a mechanism by which we provide help to people who are \nproducing and are losing money as a result of that production, trying \nto provide help to shore up that family farm. Our position is simple. \nWhen prices hit a valley, we want a bridge across that valley so family \nfarmers can get across that valley. We want to build a bridge, and \nother people want to blow up the bridge. But if we don't take the first \nstep to provide some crisis and disaster relief and then follow it very \nquickly in September and October, as I discussed with my colleague from \nIowa and others, with a change in the underlying farm bill, we will not \nhave done much for farmers.\n  Farmers say to me: We very much appreciate some disaster help, but it \nwill not provide the hope that is necessary for me to plant a crop and \nbelieve that I can make it. We need a change in the farm bill. We need \na safety net that we think has a chance to work for us in the future.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nstatement, which is exemplary in its clarity. The arguments the Senator \nhas made, the point he made, this should crystallize clearly what this \ndebate is all about, what is happening, what we are all talking about.\n  I picked up on one thing the Senator said--that under the \nRepublican's proposal the payments would go out without regard to \nwhether someone was producing anything or not; it could actually go out \nto absentee landlords, people who are not on the farm, hadn't even \nplanted anything.\n  As the Senator knows, the AMTA payments that are in their bill go out \nwithout regard to whether they are planting anything or not. It is \nbased upon outdated, outmoded provisions of base acreages and proven \nyields. It goes back as far as 20 years.\n  I wonder if it occurred to the Senator from North Dakota--I heard a \ncouple of Republicans this morning talk about the failed policies of \nthe past. Yet they are basing their payments on a policy that goes back \n20 years, base acreages and proven yields, which any farmer will tell \nyou has no basis in reality as to what is going on in the farm today.\n  I am curious. Does the Senator have any idea why they would want to \nmake payments based on something that is not even happening out there \ntoday? It is not even based on production, not helping the family \nfarmer. I am still a little confused as to why they would suggest that \nkind of payment mechanism rather than what we are suggesting, which \ngoes out to farmers based on the crops they bring in from the fields.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The payment mechanism is called an AMTA payment or a \ntransition payment. This would actually enhance the transition payment. \nThe purpose of a transition payment, by its very name, is to transition \nfamily farmers out of a farm program. It said: Whatever your little \nboat is, let it float on whatever marketplace exists out there. The \nproblem is, they declare it a free market when in fact it is a market \nthat is totally stacked against family farmers. So family farmers \ncannot make it in this kind of system.\n\n  This farm bill that provides transition payments is a faulty concept. \nYet even for disaster relief, they cling to this same faulty concept of \nmoving some income out largely because, I think, they are worried, if \nthey do not cling to that, somehow they will be seen as retreating from \nthe farm bill. I would say: Retreat as fast as you can from a farm bill \nthat has put us in this position on wheat prices.\n  You may think it is totally unfair to say wheat prices have anything \nto do with the farm bill. I don't know. Maybe this is pure coincidence. \nMaybe it is just some sort of a cruel irony that we\n\n[[Page S10091]]\n\npassed a new farm bill and all these prices collapsed. But the point \nis, I was hearing this morning discussions from people who were \nstanding up to say things are really good on the family farm. I did not \nlook closely at their shoes to see whether they had been on a family \nfarm recently. They looked as if they were wearing pretty good pants \nand shirts and so on. It occurred to me, if things are so good on the \nfamily farm, why are we seeing all these farm auctions and all this \nmisery and all this pain and agony with family farmers losing their \nlifetime of investment? Why? Because prices have collapsed. Things are \nnot good on the family farm. The current farm bill doesn't work.\n  People stand here--I guess I can listen to them--they stand here for \nhours and tell us how wonderful things are and how much income the \ncurrent farm bill is spreading in rural America. I would say, however \nmuch income that is, it does not make up for the radical, total \ncollapse of the grain markets. What has happened is, we have a payment \nsystem that says, under Freedom to Farm, when prices are high, you get \na payment that you do not need, and when prices are low, you don't get \na payment that is sufficient to give you the help you need.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield further, the Senator has stated \nit absolutely correctly. I was interested in the chart there of wheat \nprices. I ask the Senator if he would put it back up there again, on \nwheat prices. It just about mirrors corn and soybeans, all the major \nproduction crops in the Southwest.\n  I have an article from the Wichita Eagle, from 1995, I believe. It is \nan article written by the distinguished Senator from Kansas. I think he \nwas a House Member at the time, Senator Roberts. So this article says:\n\n       Good Bill for Farm Reality, by Pat Roberts.\n\n  The first sentence says:\n\n       My Freedom to Farm legislation now before Congress is a new \n     agricultural policy for a new century.\n\n  ``My Freedom to Farm. . . .'' That is by Pat Roberts, now Senator \nRoberts. I want to read to the Senator from North Dakota this paragraph \nin there. He says:\n\n       Finally, Freedom to Farm enhances the farmer's total \n     economic situation. In fact, the bill results in the highest \n     net farm income over the next seven years of any proposal \n     before Congress.\n\n  He says:\n\n       The AMTA payment cushions the Nation's agriculture economy \n     from collapse during the 7-year transition process.\n\n  I have to ask my friend from South Dakota, are your farmers receiving \nthe highest net farm income that they have received ever in any farm \nprogram? Are they receiving the highest farm income? And are your \nfarmers being cushioned by the Freedom to Farm bill?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Iowa, the answer to that \nquestion is, clearly, farm income is collapsing. It is collapsing with \ngrain prices, with commodity prices generally, and family farmers are \nput in terrible trouble as a result of it. Many of them are facing \nextinction.\n  I have here a report from the Economic Policy Institute that \ndescribes the almost complete failure of the current farm bill and \ncurrent strategy. It is written by Robert Scott. It is about an eight-\npage report. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make one final point, and then I will relinquish \nthe floor. I know my colleagues wish to speak.\n  This is a map of the United States. This map shows in red the \ncounties of our country that have lost more than 10 percent of their \npopulation. It shows where people are moving out, not coming in. We \nhave cities growing in various parts of America, but in the center of \nour country, in the farm belt of our country, we are being depopulated. \nPeople are leaving. My home county, which is about the size of the \nState of Rhode Island, was 5,000 people when I left, in population. It \nis now 3,000. The neighboring county, which is about the same size, the \nsize of the State of Rhode Island, had 920 people last year. The fact \nis, people are moving out. Why? Because family farmers cannot make a \nliving.\n  We have had other farm policies that have not worked. I mean we have \nhad Democratic and Republican failures. Both parties have failed in \nmany ways in farm policy.\n  It is just the circumstance today where we have farm prices, in \nconstant dollars, that are at Depression level; and we have a farm \nprogram that, like it or not, was offered by the majority party that \ndoes not work. It does not work at all in the context of what our needs \nare to try to save family farmers.\n  We will have two votes today: One on a disaster package or a price \nrelief package that offers more help, and one that offers less; one \nthat offers some help for disaster relief, and one that does not.\n  A whole series of differences exist between these proposals. My hope \nis that at the end of this day the Senate will have agreed to the \nproposal that Senators Daschle, Harkin, Conrad, myself, and others have \nhelped draft and that we will be able to send a message of hope to \nfamily farmers, to say, we know what is happening, we know we need \nchange. This is the first step. The second step, in September or \nOctober, will be to force a fundamental change in our underlying farm \npolicy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                           Exported to Death\n\n\n                the failure of agricultural deregulation\n\n                          (By Robert E. Scott)\n\n       In 1996, free market Republicans and budget-cutting \n     Democrats offered farmers a deal: accept a cut in farm \n     subsidies and, in return, the government would promote \n     exports in new trade deals with Latin America and in the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO) and eliminate restrictions on \n     planting decisions. In economic terms, farmers were asked to \n     take on risks heretofore assumed by the government in \n     exchange for deregulation and the promise of increased \n     exports.\n       This sounded like a good deal to many farmers, especially \n     since exports and prices had been rising for several years. \n     Many farmers and agribusiness interests supported the bill, \n     and it was in keeping with the position of many farm \n     representatives and most members of Congress from farm states \n     who already supported the WTO, the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA), and the extension of fast-track trade \n     negotiating authority, usually in the name of supporting \n     family farmers.\n       But for family farmers, the Omnibus Farm Bill--and the \n     export-led growth strategy upon which it was based--has been \n     a massive failure. The U.S. farm trade balance declined by \n     more than $13 billion between 1996 and 1998, and prices have \n     plummeted. August U.S. corn prices fell from $4.30 per bushel \n     in 1996 to $1.89, or 56%. Wheat prices fell from $4.57 per \n     bushel in 1996 to $2.46 in 1998, a drop of 46%.\n       The combination of export dependence and deregulation have \n     left increased numbers of family farmers facing extinction. \n     At the same time, U.S. agriculture becomes more centralized \n     in the hands of large farms and national and multinational \n     companies.\n       Contrary to the Department of Agriculture's rosy \n     predictions, the plight of farmers is likely to get worse \n     under current policies. Expanding supplies are likely to \n     outpace the growth in demand for U.S. farm products; \n     restricted access to foreign markets will continue; and the \n     strong dollar, actively supported by the U.S. Treasury, will \n     further depress the prices farmers receive for their goods.\n       It is time to end this cruel hoax on the American family \n     farmer. The U.S. government should: reduce the value of the \n     dollar in order to boost farm prices; shift subsidies away \n     from large farms and corporate farmers to independent, \n     family-run farms; increase expenditures for research, \n     development, and infrastructure; and support new uses for \n     farm products.\n\n\n              freedom to fail: the omnibus 1996 farm bill\n\n       For more than a half-century after the Great Depression, \n     government policies helped create a highly successful U.S. \n     agricultural sector by reducing risks to family farmers. Crop \n     insurance and disaster programs reduced production risk, and \n     a variety of price and income support programs, plus set-\n     aside programs that paid farmers to remove excess land from \n     production, reduced price risks. But the Omnibus 1996 Farm \n     Bill eliminated price and income supports and replaced them \n     with annual income payments, to be phased out, on a fixed \n     declining schedule, over seven years (Chite and Jickling \n     1999, 2). The 1996 farm bill also eliminated the set-aside \n     program, thus giving farmers, in the words of one \n     commentator, ``the freedom to plant what they wanted, when \n     they wanted. . . . With prices rising and global demand \n     soaring, lawmakers and farmers were happy to exchange the \n     bureaucratic rulebook for the Invisible Hand'' (Carey 1999).\n\n[[Page S10092]]\n\n       The rapid growth in U.S. agricultural exports--they more \n     than doubled between 1985 and 1996--encouraged many farmers \n     to buy into the deregulation strategy. But rising exports \n     have not translated into rising incomes. Due to globalization \n     and relentless declines in the real prices of basic farm \n     products, the structure of American agriculture has been \n     transformed, and, as a result, real U.S. farm income has been \n     steady or declining for many years despite the long-run trend \n     of rising exports.\n       In the two decades from 1978 to 1997, real grain prices \n     were slashed in half. Then, in 1998, prices fell an \n     additional 10-20%, pushing many family farmers to the brink \n     of bankruptcy.\\1\\ In this environment, only the largest and \n     most capital intensive farms are able to survive and prosper.\n     Growing concentration throughout the food chain\n       There are about 2 million farms in the U.S., but three-\n     quarters of those generate minimal or negative net incomes \n     (USDA 1996). Since farms with less than $50,000 in gross \n     revenues tend to be primarily part-time or recreational \n     ventures, this section analyzes working farms that generate \n     gross revenues in excess of $50,000 per year.\n       Within this group, the number of large farms is growing \n     while small farms are disappearing at a rapid pace, as shown \n     in Table 1. There were 554,000 working farms in the U.S. in \n     1993. More than 42,000 farms with revenues of less than \n     $250,000 per year disappeared between 1994 and 1997, a \n     decline of about 10%. Nearly 20,000 farms with revenues in \n     excess of $250,000 per year were added in this three-year \n     period, an increase of about 17%. Thus, the U.S. experienced \n     a net loss of about 22,000 farms between 1994 and 1997 alone.\n\n                                             TABLE 1.--CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WORKING FARMS, 1993-98\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                           Size class (annual sales)\n                                                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        $1,000,000\n                                                         or more    $500,000-$999,999  $250,000-$499,000  $100,000-249,999  $50,000-$99,999     Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1993.................................................       14,980          30,876             70,982            224,823          212,531        554,192\n1997.................................................       18,767          34,764             82,984            207,058          187,831        531,404\nPercent change.......................................        25.3%           12.6%              16.9%              -7.9%           -11.6%          -4.1%\nNumber gained or lost................................        3,788           3,888             12,001            -17,765          -24,700        -22,788\nNumber lost with gross incomes of $50,000-250,000....  ...........  .................  .................  ................  ...............      -42,465\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: USDA, Farm Business Economics Briefing Room, Farm Structure Reading Room, A Close-Up Of Changes in Farm Organization (http://\nusda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/).\n\n       Corporate influence is growing throughout the U.S. food \n     supply system. While the share of farms owned by individuals \n     and families (operating as sole proprietors) was roughly \n     constant between 1978 and 1992, at about 85% of all farms, \n     the output share of such farms declined during this period \n     from about 62% to 54% (USDA 1996). Corporations absorbed most \n     of this production lost by sole proprietors between 1978 and \n     1992. Moreover, an increasing number of family farmers are \n     raising crops under contract for big purchasers.\n       Corporate control is becoming much more concentrated both \n     upstream and downstream from farmers. On the input side, \n     considerable consolidation is taking place among firms that \n     supply farmers with seeds and chemical inputs. A small number \n     of companies are assuming control of the seed production \n     business, including Monsanto, Dupont, and Novartis (Melcher \n     and Carey 1999, 32).\n       The story is similar on the distributional side. Grain \n     distribution, for example, which has been tightly controlled \n     by a handful of companies since the 19th century, is becoming \n     even more concentrated. Recently, Cargill has proposed to \n     purchase Continental's grain storage unit, which would result \n     in a single firm that would control more than one-third of \n     U.S. grain exports (Melcher and Carey 1999, 32).\n\n\n                 international trade: the siren's song\n\n       The growth in agricultural exports, especially in the first \n     half of 1990s, suggested to small farmers that sales to \n     foreign markets were the key to solving their problems. \n     However, export markets have proven to be more volatile than \n     domestic ones, and globalization has increased the \n     vulnerability of farmers to sudden price swings.\n\n                 TABLE 2--U.S. AGRICULTURAL TRADE BALANCE WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES,\\1\\ 1990-98\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                Changes:\n                 Country/region                      1990         1996       1998 \\2\\  -------------------------\n                                                                                          1990-96      1996-98\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorld..........................................       17,292       27,994       14,756       10,702      -13,238\nEurope.........................................        5,228        4,835          606         -393       -4,229\nNAFTA..........................................        1,488        1,787          691          299       -1,096\n    Canada.....................................        1,587          133         -781       -1,454         -914\n    Mexico.....................................          -98        1,654        1,472        1,752         -182\nAsia...........................................       14,147       22,249       14,655        8,102       -7,594\nRest of world..................................       -3,572         -877       -1,196        2,695         -319\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Census basis; foreign and domestic exports, f.a.s.\n\\2\\ Estimated--incomplete data for all countries.\n \nSource: U.S. Department of Commerce, Foreign Trade Highlights, Internet: http://www.ita.doc.gov/cgi-\nbinotea_ctr?task=readfile=hili; and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Trade of the\n  U.S., Internet: http://www.econ.ag.gov/db/FATUS/.\n\n     Unreliable export markets\n       The U.S. agricultural trade balance with the rest of the \n     world increased by almost $11 billion between 1990 and 1996 \n     (Table 2), then declined by $13.2 billion between 1996 and \n     1998. This drop in the volume of exports, which was equal to \n     a 6% decline in farm revenues, was compounded by a sharp \n     decline in domestic commodity prices (discussed below). These \n     two factors combined in 1997 and 1998 to severely depress \n     farm incomes.\n       Closer examination of regional trends in U.S. farm trade \n     shows that only a limited number of markets were open to U.S. \n     farm products. The U.S. agricultural trade balance with \n     Europe declined sharply between 1990 and 1998, as shown in \n     Table 2. During that time exports to Europe fell by about $2 \n     billion while U.S. imports increased by $3 billion (U.S. \n     Department of Commerce 1999; USDA 1999b).\n       U.S. trade problems with Europe result from continued high \n     subsidies to European farms and European resistance to \n     certain U.S. farm products, such as hormone-treated beef. The \n     Uruguay Round trade agreements were designed, in part, to \n     reduce agricultural subsidies, but European farm spending \n     actually increased from $46.0 billion in 1995 (the year \n     before the agreements went into effect) to $55 billion in \n     1997.\\2\\ During the same period, U.S. government payments to \n     farmers were $7 billion, less than 13% of the European \n     level.\\3\\\n       Under NAFTA and the earlier U.S.-Canada Free Trade \n     Agreement (which went into effect in 1989), the volume of \n     farm trade has significantly increased throughout the region. \n     However, the net result has been a small but significant \n     decline in the U.S. farm trade surplus with Mexico and \n     Canada. This fact contradicts the U.S. Trade Representative's \n     statement that ``NAFTA has been a tremendous success for \n     American agriculture'' (Huenemann 1999).\n       NAFTA has also resulted in a massive shift in the structure \n     of trade and production within North America. U.S. exports of \n     corn and other feed grains (such as sorghum) have increased, \n     but U.S. imports of fruits, vegetables, wheat, barley, and \n     cattle have all increased much more. For example, U.S. grain \n     exports to Canada (primarily corn and other feed grains) \n     increased by 127% between 1990 and 1998, but at the same time \n     U.S. imports of wheat from Canada increased by 249%, from $79 \n     million in 1990 to $278 million in 1998. Similarly, U.S. corn \n     exports to Mexico increased by 47% during that period, while \n     cattle and calf imports from Mexico soared by 1,280%.\\4\\\n       Since the trade balance with Europe and North America was \n     relatively flat from 1990 to 1996, what was the source of \n     strongly growing demand for U.S. farm products in the 1990s? \n     Answer: the trade balance with Asia increased by $8 billion \n     (Table 2). Unfortunately for U.S. farmers, though, the demand \n     that pulled in U.S. farm exports to Asia was driven by the \n     same inflationary bubble that ultimately caused the world \n     financial crisis. An unprecedented inflow of short-term \n     capital into Asia stimulated a huge growth in consumption. \n     When this capital flowed out even more quickly in the wake of \n     the Thai financial crisis in July 1997, the U.S. agricultural \n     trade balance with Asia collapsed back to its 1990 level.\\5\\\n       Thus, the boom in U.S. agriculture in the early 1990s, \n     which convinced farmers that trade liberalization was the \n     solution to their problems, was built on the false foundation \n     of a speculative bubble. Increased trade has certainly \n     increased the volatility of farm incomes, but it has yet to \n     improve their average level. Globalization has also stacked \n     the\n\n[[Page S10093]]\n\n     deck against family farmers, since they tend to be under-\n     capitalized and more vulnerable to financial cycles in \n     comparison to large and diversified corporate farms.\n     Globalization and future farm prices\n       The U.S. Department of Agriculture has fueled expectations \n     that global demand for U.S. agricultural products will \n     increase in the future. Its most recent baseline forecasts \n     predict that commodity prices, net farm income, and U.S. \n     exports will all recover rapidly in 2000 and climb steadily \n     thereafter.\\6\\ The USDA has also forecast that U.S. \n     agriculture would benefit from further trade liberalization. \n     For example, it estimated that the proposed Free Trade \n     Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) ``that includes the United \n     States would cause annual U.S. farm income (in 1992 dollars) \n     to be $180 million higher than it otherwise would be'' (Raney \n     and Link 1998, 2).\n       This forecast is particularly surprising because the same \n     report also predicts that the FTAA will reduce the U.S. trade \n     balance. Specifically, it predicts that the FTAA will have a \n     larger impact on U.S. farm imports than on exports (Raney and \n     Link 1998, 2), thus increasing the current U.S. agricultural \n     trade deficit with Latin America. The reported income effects \n     include only ``efficiency gains'' from the shift of resources \n     from one crop to another, and exclude the losses from \n     declining demand for U.S. farm products and from rising \n     imports resulting from deregulated trade. The report does \n     acknowledge that the reported gains ``are very small changes \n     in U.S. farm income'' and that:\n       ``. . . the short-run adjustment costs for some farm \n     households could be large. Hence, the debate on the \n     acceptability of an FTAA may hinge on its \n     distributional consequences rather than on the gains to \n     the entire economy or to the agricultural sector as a \n     whole.'' (Raney and Link 1998, 38)\n       The FTAA report further assumes that the economy will be at \n     full employment and that there are no adjustment costs due to \n     changes in trade. Moreover (as the author note), the impacts \n     of agricultural trade deficits and structural change on the \n     farm sector are excluded from the study.\n       Similar predictions were made about the benefits of NAFTA \n     and the Uruguay Round trade agreements that created the WTO. \n     U.S. farmers were supposed to benefit because they are the \n     world's low-cost producers of many types of grain and \n     livestock. As we have seen, it did not turn out that way.\n       Are the USDA's predictions that rising exports will cause \n     farm prices to increase in the future likely to be any more \n     accurate now? An economic analysis (see the Appendix for \n     methodological details) of the various forces that influence \n     U.S. commodity prices--namely, (1) U.S. income (in terms of \n     gross domestic product, or GDP), (2) the real (inflation \n     adjusted) U.S. exchange rate, and (3) worldwide average crop \n     yields (which reflect the influence of technology on crop \n     supplies)--shows that U.S. farm prices are unlikely to rise \n     in the future unless U.S. agricultural policies are \n     substantially revised.\n       Looking at U.S. corn and wheat over the past 26 years, \n     income, somewhat surprisingly, seems to have only a weakly \n     significant effect on price. Furthermore, the changes in U.S. \n     income associated with the Asian crisis have not reduced \n     grain prices, but this result is not strong, statistically \n     speaking.\\7\\\n       Exchange rates, on the other hand, have large and \n     statistically significant effects on farm prices. Each 1% \n     increase in the value of the dollar generates a 1.1% decline \n     in the price of corn and a 1.5% decline in the price of \n     wheat. Thus, the 16% appreciation in the value of the U.S. \n     dollar that occurred between 1995 and 1997 is responsible for \n     17 to 24 percentage points of the decline in U.S. corn and \n     wheat prices, respectively.\\8\\\n       World commodity yields also have a large and significant \n     effect on prices. As yields per acre rise, prices fall. The \n     expansion in world supplies of each commodity depresses its \n     price. While the growth in income has only a weak effect on \n     prices, technology and the growth in world agricultural \n     productivity has a strong, negative impact on prices over \n     time.\\9\\\n       These results show why farmers have been misled about the \n     benefits of trade liberalization. Previous rounds of trade \n     negotiations have failed to generated sustained, reliable \n     growth in demand for U.S. farm products. In addition, the \n     diffusion of advanced agricultural technologies (the ``green \n     revolution'') around the globe has had a depressing effect on \n     U.S. farm prices, despite, or perhaps because of, the \n     benefits generated for farmers and consumers throughout the \n     developing world.\n\n\n                       Time for a new farm policy\n\n       There is nothing wrong with expanding trade in agriculture \n     as long as it can be accomplished in ways that benefit U.S. \n     farmers. However, unless the U.S. government is willing to \n     address such fundamental problems as global excess crop \n     supplies and rising currency values, then pushing for freer \n     trade in agriculture will be counterproductive. It is time to \n     stop artificially expanding trade without regard for the \n     consequences.\n       The Omnibus 1996 Farm Bill was a complete failure. It \n     failed to generate export-led growth, and it transferred \n     substantial risks to farmers with no visible benefits. Given \n     the diffusion of technology to the rest of the world, and \n     because other countries seek to maintain their own food \n     security, agriculture will never be a substantial growth \n     industry for the U.S. However, for the same reason, the U.S. \n     needs a viable farm sector, one that can deliver a high and \n     rising standard of living for family farmers and consumers. A \n     number of policies could help achieve these goals, including:\n       Carefully managed reductions in the value of the dollar;\n       The shift of agricultural subsidies away from large farms \n     and corporate farmers to independent, family-run farms;\n       An increase in expenditures for research and development, \n     and the construction of infrastructure and distribution \n     systems for new, higher-valued products that can be produced \n     with sustainable technologies and that meet consumer demand \n     for high-quality, niche, and specialty foods such as organic \n     products and humanely raised livestock; and\n       The exploration of other possibilities for stimulating \n     agricultural consumption (such as the conversion of biomass \n     to energy) to build domestic demand for agricultural \n     products.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Madam President.\n  For the last 20 minutes, I have listened to my colleague from North \nDakota with some degree of clarity discuss the issue that is true in \nhis State today and true in most areas of American agriculture. I will \nin no way attempt to modify or suggest any different kind of impact on \nthe family farm, but I suggest that most family farms in Idaho today \nare multimillion-dollar operations, and we should not attempt to invoke \nthe image of a small farm, a husband and wife, struggling to stay \nalive.\n  A husband and wife and family team in production agriculture today \nare struggling to stay alive in an industry that recognizes their \ninvestment in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars.\n  There is no question that the character of American agriculture has \nchanged. While some are still caught\n\n[[Page S10095]]\n\nup in the rhetoric of the family farm--and there are still some small \nfarming units--most of those who farm small units today recognized some \nyears ago that their life could not be made there unless they \nsupplemented it with outside income. That, of course, has been the \ncharacter of the change in production agriculture for the last good \nnumber of decades--true in Idaho, true in North Dakota, true in \nMississippi, true in almost every other agricultural State in our \nNation.\n  How do I know that? That is what the statistics show.\n  But in 1965 and 1966, as a young person, I was given a unique \nopportunity to travel through our Nation on behalf of agriculture as a \nnational officer of FFA, Future Farmers of America. I was in almost \nevery agricultural State in this Nation speaking to young farmers and \nyoung ranchers.\n  I happened to have had the privilege of staying on many of those \nfarms and ranches. For the course of 1 year, I saw American agriculture \nlike few are given the opportunity to see it. I must tell you, it was \nan exciting time because I met wonderful people, I saw a unique \nlifestyle that is true in many instances today, and I did see and feel \nthe heartland of America as few get the opportunity to experience.\n  While I was traveling, I gave many speeches. The speech oftentimes \nstarted like this: That a family farmer or a farmer in American \nagriculture today produces enough for him or herself and 30 other \npeople. That was 1965.\n  Today, if I were that young FFA officer traveling the Nation, my \nspeech would have to change, because I would say that that farmer or \nrancher produces enough for him or herself and 170 to 180 additional \nAmericans.\n  Has the family unit changed? Oh, very significantly. In almost all \ninstances, it is four or five times larger than it was in 1965 and \n1966. But it is phenomenally more efficient and much more productive. \nBecause of those efficiencies, instituted by new technology or \nbiogenetics, we have seen great productivity. So it isn't just a \nmeasurement of crops produced against prices for those crops; it is a \ncombination of the whole.\n  I think it is very important that we portray American agriculture \ntoday for what it is and for what it asks from us.\n  In 1965 and 1966, it was not just Government and politicians that \nsuggested farm policy in this country ought to change; it was American \nagriculture itself that came to us in 1965 and 1966 and said: Get \nGovernment off our backs. American agriculture has changed. We don't \nwant to farm to a program. We want to farm to a market. We don't want \nto be restricted in limited acreages. We don't want to be restricted in \nlimited markets. We want the ability to be flexible to move with the \nmarket.\n  Congress listened. Out of that listening came the Federal Agriculture \nImprovement and Reform Act of 1996, which is now called Freedom to \nFarm. The Senator from North Dakota said it is a failure. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is wrong. It has met every objective it was intended \nto meet--expanded markets, expanded production, with flexibility for \nthe individual producer. All of those goals that were a part of Freedom \nto Farm have been met today.\n\n  Today, before the Ag Committee, we heard about a comprehensive study \nthat said agricultural income in the decade of the 1990s will surpass \nany other decade, at a time when the number of farmers has gone down \nand productivity has gone up dramatically. That is all part of the good \nnews of the story.\n  So it is not an abject failure, unless you did not vote for it \nbecause you did not believe in it in the first place, and you really do \nwant Government controls, and you really do want a Government plan to \nwhich farmers farm instead of the market. My guess is, that is part of \nwhat the Senator from North Dakota was talking about. That is not what \nI am here to talk about today. That is where we differ substantially.\n  But we do not differ on the other issue. That is the issue of the \ncurrent commodity price crisis in production agriculture across our \nNation and across the world. That is very real today. Many of our \ncommodities are finding their price in the marketplace at or below \nDepression-era prices. That in itself is a crisis, and that we should \nrespond to.\n  Last year, we did not cast a deaf ear on production agriculture in \nthis country. The taxpayers of this country, recognizing the plight the \nAmerican producer in agriculture was in, gave handsomely. Billions of \ndollars flowed into production agriculture, and directly through to the \nfarmer, and to the rancher in some instances. As a result of that, farm \nincome was substantially buoyed. That will happen again this year. But \nit will happen in the context of Freedom to Farm.\n  We are not going to go in and start changing long-term farm policy \nuntil the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Idaho can \nagree that Freedom to Farm was an abject failure--when, in fact, I do \nnot believe it was; and I think the Senator from North Dakota would be \nhard pressed, looking at the facts and the intent, to argue that it was \neither.\n  So we are here today not to talk about a long-term policy change but \nto talk about the current crisis. It is a crisis that is not just \ntaking place within this country; it is a commodity crisis that is \nworldwide.\n  Let's talk about 1996, 1997, and part of 1998. That is when we \ncrafted a new farm bill. That is when commodity prices were higher than \nthey had ever been around the world, and we drained all of our \nreserves, and we were told never again would we see low prices. But \nthere were some things missing from that ``never again'' argument. We \ndidn't anticipate a general downturn in world economies, especially the \nAsian economy, an Asian economy that had increased its overall import \nof agricultural foodstuffs from the United States by nearly 27 percent \nin the period of a 5- to 6-year span. Those imports are down by 11 \npercent today. Those are the facts. Is that a direct result of Freedom \nto Farm policy failing? I suggest that it isn't. I don't think the \nSenator from North Dakota would disagree.\n\n  Now, what has that caused? It has plummeted commodity prices in our \ncountry. We agree that there is a current farm crisis, and we agree \nthat that crisis could extend itself for some time to come. We agree \nthat Congress ought to respond to it so we don't lose those production \nunits and the families and the human side of it that is so critical \nacross our country and to smalltown Idaho just as much as smalltown \nNorth Dakota.\n  The difference, at least in the current situation of the moment, is \nthe heavy hand of politics, tragically enough. Last year we were able \nto agree, and we worked at crafting a bipartisan package. This morning, \nwhile we were there in the Ag Committee holding a hearing with the \nSecretary, all of a sudden the committee room emptied. I wondered where \nthey had gone. The chairman said: Well, they have gone out to hold a \npress conference with the Vice President. The heavy hand of \nPresidential politics now tragically plays at this issue. It shouldn't \nhave to be that way and, in the end, it won't be that way, if we are to \ncraft the right kind of policy to deal with a crisis that isn't \nDemocrat or isn't Republican, but it is at the heartland of America's \nfundamental production unit, American agriculture.\n  The chairman of the Ag Subcommittee of Appropriations has struggled \nmightily over the course of the last several weeks to try to see if we \ncouldn't arrive at a package that would respond. Our goal is not to add \nhundreds of billions of dollars to programs that don't have any sense \nof immediacy or any sense of getting money directly through to the \nfarmer. Our bill is substantially smaller in that regard than the bill \noffered by the minority leader of the Senate. But our bill, when it \ncomes to money to production units, money to farmers, and money to \nranchers, is there. It is real and it is the same dollar amount.\n  I am willing to talk farm policy, and I am willing to debate it, but \nnot in the short-term and not in the immediate sense of an emergency, \nbecause it is awfully hard to argue that the emergency at hand was \nproduced by Freedom to Farm.\n  Let me read briefly from a report called ``Record and Outlook,'' put \ntogether by a very responsible group called the Sparks Company out of \nMcLean, VA. This report is called ``Freedom to Farm, Record and \nOutlook,'' prepared for the Coalition for\n\n[[Page S10096]]\n\nCompetitive Food in the Agricultural System.\n  Here is their analysis. Most people say that the Sparks Company is \nwidely recognized as reputable and is nonpartisan in its analyses of \nthose issues that it examines.\n  Here is what they say:\n\n       The recent slowing of the farm economy primarily reflects \n     two major factors: Farmers response worldwide to mid-decade \n     record high prices. . .\n\n  In other words, what they are saying was those prices in 1996 and \n1997 sent a message to American agriculture: Gear up your production. \nThey sent a message to world agriculture: Gear up your production. \nConsumption and prices are here to stay. And that is what happened, and \nworldwide production is at an all-time record. They go on:\n\n       . . .and the downturn in the economic and financial health \n     of one region of the world, Asia, which also is the largest \n     market for U.S. farm and food products.\n\n  I have already mentioned the tremendous ramp up in the increase in \npurchases of agricultural foodstuffs in Asia and now the dramatic \ndecline.\n\n  The study concludes that both the high record prices of 1995, 1996, \nand part of 1997, and the more recent readjustments, are the result of \n``ordinary market developments and reactions, with some unusually good \nweather patterns helping boost output, while the economic downturn in \nAsia and elsewhere has weakened the prices. As a result, the current \nmarket downturn reflects temporary, rather than fundamental market \nchanges.''\n  Temporary problems, but a real crisis. Permanent problems? They say \nnot so. So if you are going to change permanent policy, you ought to be \nable to determine that there is first a permanent problem. That is what \nI think the Senator from North Dakota has failed to argue, while he and \nI would agree on the sense of immediacy to the current crisis.\n  The report goes on to talk about modest shortfalls in harvests and \nyields during 1993 through 1995, during the time when these markets \nwere ramping up. Output fell below the 10-year trend and stocks \nplummeted. In other words, storage and surplus. Strong world economic \ngrowth then stimulated demand and record high grain and oilseed prices; \nworld planting and harvests above trends in the United States and \nworldwide during 1996 through 1998; also good weather and high grain \nand oilseed yields, especially in the United States, rapidly rebuilt \ndepleted stocks in spite of significantly above-trend consumption \nduring that period. In other words, we were pushing production, but the \nworld was consuming. Significant increases in non-U.S. production \ncompeting for growing world markets largely in response to record high \nprices of the mid-1990s. For example, all of the very considerable \nabove-trend wheat production has been outside the United States, while \nthe share of increased production outside the United States has been 44 \npercent for corn and 35 percent for soybeans.\n  Lastly, they point out that the downturn in economic and financial \nhealth of key world markets, especially Asia, the largest U.S. export \nmarket, has increased pressure on U.S. prices, although world grain and \noilseed use has been well above trend during the last 3 years.\n  What is the point of those comments? The point is that no matter how \nwe would have designed the policy, we were working against a world \nsituation, both economically and climactically, and productionwise that \nwould have been very difficult to foresee. We did not foresee it, nor \nwas it debated in 1995 and 1996, as we were crafting Freedom to Farm. \nWe didn't recognize it in 1997. Toward the tail end of 1997, it became \nan indicator of problems to come. By 1998, it was very clear, and \nCongress responded. It is now 1999 and Congress will respond again, \nwith a multibillion-dollar direct aid package to production \nagriculture.\n  I said before the Ag Committee today and before Secretary Glickman \nthat I am willing, starting next year, to review Freedom to Farm. I \ndon't think production agriculture is going to walk away from the \nfreedoms and the flexibility it has. Is there a way of crafting a \nsafety net or something that causes some adjustments over time? It is \npossible. I would not suggest that it isn't. But the rest of the story \nof Freedom to Farm that we have not successfully matched yet, but \nsomething that Congress, Democrat and Republican, agreed with and \npromised production agriculture with the passage of Freedom to Farm in \n1996, were two other elements.\n  One was a risk management practice, better known as crop insurance. \nWe have placed that money in the budget, but we can't yet agree on a \npackage that is bipartisan in character, that meets the regional \ndifferences within our country, certainly the regional differences \nbetween the Midwest and Idaho or the Midwest and the South or the \nNortheast. If we had had a comprehensive risk management crop insurance \npackage today, the very real drought that Washington, DC, and States \neast of the Alleghenies are in at this moment would have been \ndramatically offset if farmers had had that kind of risk management \ntool. But we have not yet agreed as to how to make it flexible and \ndiversified in a way that meets those kinds of needs of specialty crops \nand the uniqueness of agriculture across this country. So a promise \nmade; we have not fulfilled it yet.\n  The other area, of course, is the expansion of world trade. The \nSenator from North Dakota is right. We are not trading in world markets \nlike we should. Let me tell you, Bill Clinton and company have been \nasleep at the switch now for many years. Do they have a division down \nat the Department of State that goes out and aggressively markets on a \ndaily basis American agricultural surpluses? No, they don't. We offered \nthem and provided them the tools to move aggressively in the markets. \nThere was a bit of a yawn down at the Department of Agriculture, and \nthat yawn has continued for the last good number of years. So point the \nfinger, I am; but I am pointing the finger at the very agencies of our \nGovernment that are responsible for breaking down those political \nbarriers between a consuming market somewhere else in the world and a \nproduction unit here in the United States. We have not done that well, \nand we should. We promised it, in part.\n\n  Last year, I and Senators from the other side of the aisle stood \ntogether and were able to knock down the sanctions against Pakistan and \nIndia to move markets. This year, at our urging--and I applaud the \nPresident; now that I have criticized him, let me applaud him for \nbringing forth an Executive order that said that foodstuffs and medical \nsupplies would not be subject to sanction. That was 3 months ago, and 3 \nmonths later, in the time of an agriculture crisis, they are just \ngetting the regulations out.\n  Well, now, give me a break, Mr. President. You mean your bureaucracy \ntakes 3 months to write a regulation that says farmers can supply a \nworld market that they were denied? There is a lot of blame to be \nshared here, but, Mr. Vice President, you were on the Hill today \ntalking about a farm crisis. Last I checked, the Department of \nAgriculture and State Department were under your watch, and for 3 long \nmonths you have sat and watched as the bureaucracy ground out \nregulations that allow access to world markets. I am sorry, Mr. \nPresident and Mr. Vice President, there is blame to be shared all \naround.\n  Let me shift just a little of it to you, Mr. Vice President, and you, \nMr. President. The spirit is in the right place, but couldn't you have \ncut to the chase? Couldn't we be moving grains, rice, and food \ncommodities, and lentils into mid-Asian and the Central Eastern markets \ntoday like we should be? Well, we will be by fall and into the winter, \nthanks to a policy you put in place, Mr. President. But 3 months later, \nwe are finally beginning to see its regulations. Late is better than \nnone at all. I will accept that and we will move on. But, again, open \nthe world markets.\n  It is political barriers that are out there, not market barriers. \nThose are political barriers that only governments can knock down. When \nit is nation-to-nation, our Government at the Federal level has to be \nresponsible, and we fail to be.\n  My credit goes to the chairman of our Senate Agriculture Committee \nwho, for several years, has been pushing legislation to pull down those \nbarriers. Last year, he offered it on the floor. It passed. This year, \nit will pass this Senate again, and I hope it passes the Congress. I \nhope the President can\n\n[[Page S10097]]\n\ndeal with it, and I hope he will sign it. Those are long-term \nprovisions, but once in place, they are a legitimate and responsible \nrole for Government to participate in.\n  Manipulating the market, shaping the price? Absolutely not. We have \nto let the marketplace work its will. But it is very important that \nGovernment play the role it should play, and that is in dealing with \nthe political barriers of trade, most assuredly in times of need, \nproviding some safety nets. We did that last year, and we are going to \ndo it again this year. I hope in the end we can craft a crop insurance \nplan that will provide the risk management tools that we have said to \nproduction agriculture we would provide.\n  Well, those are the circumstances in which we find ourselves today. \nIn the course of the next few hours, the Senate will have an \nopportunity to vote on two very different measures, in the sense of a \ntotal package. They are very similar in the dollars and cents that go \ndirectly to production agriculture. I hope that, in the end, out of \nthis can come a bipartisan package. There is a great deal in the \nDaschle-Harkin package that may be OK at some point down the road; but \nmy guess is not without hearings held and no understanding of some \nbroad policy changes that are at this moment not necessarily \njustifiable in this time of dealing with crises, both a price crisis \nand the situation that deals with weather disaster.\n\n  Those are the circumstances as I see it. I hope my colleagues will \nvote with the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee \nin supporting his amendment and not allowing it to be tabled, so we can \nget at a clear vote and finalize this work today. If that can't be \ndone, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join \nwith us in seeing if we can make some adjustments in a final package. \nBut I believe that the package offered up by the chairman is certainly \nin good faith and responds in an immediate way to need, and that the \nmoney can move directly to production agriculture, sending a very \ncritical message to the families and the men and women engaged in \nagriculture in our economy that we care and we understand the \nimportance of them and what they do for all of us as Americans, and \nAmericans are responding by a substantial ag package of nearly $7 \nbillion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, a lot of us have listened quite \nintently, and some of us not very intently, to the debate. Very simply, \ncutting to the chase, the question before us is whether to adopt an \nagriculture emergency assistance bill in the amount of roughly $10 \nbillion--$10.6 billion, I think--that is proposed by Members \nessentially on this side of the aisle, or, in the alternative, a bill \nthat is about half that much.\n  The main difference between the two is not only the amount, but also \nthe failure, in my judgment, of the bill on the other side to provide \ndrought assistance. It is emergency drought assistance. We have all \nwatched on television in the last several days how dry so much of \nAmerica is and how farmers' crops are not growing and are not going to \nbe harvested. In some parts of the country, it is not only drought; \nparadoxically, strangely, it is flooding. There is too much moisture in \nsome parts of the country, making it impossible for farmers to grow a \nproductive crop.\n  Compounding that, there is a very low price. According to the wheat \nproducers and barley producers, livestock, hogs--you name it--the \nprices are just rock bottom, and they have been very low for a long \ntime. So it is a combination of very low prices, historically low \nprices, for some commodities, and the weather.\n  The outlook is not good. The outlook for increased prices in the \nbasic commodities we are talking about, as well as livestock, is grim. \nNobody can project or foresee a solid, sound reason why prices \nnecessarily are going to go up in the next several years.\n  What conditions are going to cause prices to go up? What is going to \nchange or be different? To be truthful, there isn't much we can see \nthat is going to be much different. Producers are going to still \nproduce. Other countries, particularly emerging and developing \ncountries, are going to try to produce more agricultural products than \nthey now are producing. On top of that, there is the phenomenon of a \ngrowing concentration of economic power in the beef packing industry, \nor in the grain trade, where the middlemen, if you will--that is, the \ntraders, the packing plants, and retailers--are making money but the \nproducers are not. That is not going to change in the foreseeable \nfuture. At least I don't see anything that will cause that change.\n  So, essentially, we are here today because farmers are getting deeper \nand deeper and deeper in trouble. Their prices are continually falling. \nI hope my colleagues took a good look at the chart presented by my good \nfriend, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan--the one that showed \nin current dollars what the price of wheat was in 1930, 1940, 1950, and \n1960. The current price of wheat in today's dollars is roughly $2 a \nbushel. Back in 1930, in current dollars, adjusted for inflation, it \nwas about $7.50 a bushel. In 1940 and in 1950--I have forgotten the \nchart, but I think it was as high as maybe $13 or $14 a bushel.\n  You can see how the price generally has declined over the years for \nfarmers, and it has declined greatly. This is not just a minor drop in \nprice. It is a precipitous drop in price. It is steady. It is constant.\n  As I said, I can't see much that is going to cause a significant \ndifference unless we in the Congress and in the country make the \nchanges, which I will get to in a few minutes.\n  On the other hand, the prices that farmers pay for their products \nover the same period of time have risen dramatically-- whether it is \nthe prices the farmers pay for fertilizer, for gasoline, for tractors \nor combines, for fencing, or for labor costs. You name it.\n  All of the costs that farmers pay have continually risen to a very \nsteep trend over the past 20 or 30 years since the Depression, and at \nthe same time prices that farmers get for their products generally have \nfallen, although there was a period several years ago where prices were \nhigh--$5, $6, or $7 a bushel. That was about 5, 6, 7, or 8 years ago, \nas I recall. But generally the trend is down.\n  Why has this happened? It has happened for a couple of reasons: One, \nmany more countries are producing products--wheat, barley, and so on \nand so forth. Second, as I mentioned, the concentration of economic \npower in the retail industry, in the wholesale industry, and in the \npacking industry, but not a concentration of power for the farmers.\n  On top of that, recently there is the Asian downturn where the Asian \neconomies a couple of years ago began to deteriorate. Their purchasing \npower dropped dramatically. They devalued their currencies in order to \ntry to prop themselves up. As a consequence, American exports to Asia \nfell dramatically--in combination with the low demand, particularly \nfrom Asia, and the higher supply, particularly in countries producing \nand, on top of that, the drought and too much rain in some parts of the \ncountry.\n  So we are here today to try to decide what the size of the emergency \nassistance should be.\n  I submit that we should not only make the direct payments to farmers \nbut we also should accommodate the drought. We should accommodate the \nfarm disaster that has beset the farmers in addition to the economic \ndisaster.\n  That is just a short-term, immediate solution. We should get on it \nright away, and we should get it passed this week, lock, stock, and \nbarrel--all of it passed this week to give farmers a little bit of \nhope.\n  Then, to begin to give farmers a little more hope for the future, we \nhave to pass a modification to the so-called Freedom to Farm bill. We \nhave to pass a new farm bill.\n  I remember when Freedom to Farm was debated. Most farmers I talked to \nin my home State of Montana were very leery and very nervous about this \nFreedom to Farm bill. A lot of them--I daresay a majority of them--went \nalong with it because at that time prices were a little higher. As I \nrecall, it was about one-plus a bushel. The so-called AMTA payments \nwere a little higher. There was more money in farmers' pockets. But \nfarmers knew--the ones I talked to, and I talked to a\n\n[[Page S10098]]\n\nwhole bunch of them--that we would get on with it then, but on down the \nroad there was going to be a real problem, and probably times were not \ngoing to be nearly as good as they were then. But we kind of swept that \nproblem under the rug and thought we would cross that bridge when we \ngot there.\n  We are there. It has happened. We are in trouble. Farmers know it. So \nlet's just get this thing passed. But we very quickly have to begin to \naddress the peaks and the valleys in the prices that farmers face.\n  I would like to remind folks in the cities that farmers are in a much \ndifferent situation from most any other business person because farmers \ncannot control their price. The price is determined by the vagaries of \nthe market, the vagaries of weather, and it is international; it is an \ninternational price in most cases. They have virtually no control over \ntheir prices. Take any other businessperson. He or she can raise or \nlower their prices to sell to retailers or to sell to consumers. There \nare ways to adjust to help maximize their return.\n  Moreover, farmers cannot control their costs. They have to pay what \nthat farm implement dealer charges. They have to pay what that \nfertilizer costs. They just have to pay that price. They have virtually \nno control over their costs. Any other businessperson has a lot of \ncontrol over his or her costs--either by downsizing, laying a few \npeople off here or there, making other adjustments, or cutbacks. Big \nbusinesses can certainly make big adjustments to costs, and have, with \nmajor downsizing. The farmer can't do that. The farmer has no control \nover costs and virtually no control over prices.\n  That is why we have to have some kind of legislation that evens out \nthe peaks and valleys and gives farmers a modicum of a safety net. We \nneed that desperately, and, for the sake of farmers, we need to get \nthat passed.\n  One final point: This is a subject for a later day. But we need a \nlevel international playing field. We do not have it today. I give a \nlot of credit to our USTR, to the administration, and to others who \nhave worked to try to make it more level. They have worked harder, if \nthe truth be known, than other administrations have. We are nowhere \nclose to the position where we have to be.\n  I will mention two subjects, and then I will close. One is export \nsubsidies. We need an end to world export subsidies for agriculture. \nThey have to be eliminated.\n  Today the European Union accounts for about 86 percent of all the \nworld's agricultural export subsidies. We Americans account for about 1 \nto 2 percent.\n  Europeans have 60 times the agricultural export subsidies that we \nhave. That is a very great distortion of the market. Agricultural \nexport subsidies are paid to European farmers if they export. What is \nthe farmer going to do in Europe? He exports. He gets a subsidy for \nit--and a big, healthy subsidy for it. That is to say nothing about all \nthe internal price supports the Europeans have that are much greater \nthan ours.\n  The ministerial in Seattle begins at the end of this year. As we \napproach the next WTO, one of our main objectives, one of our main \ngoals should be the total elimination of agricultural export subsidies. \nThat is going to help. That is going to help reduce the worldwide \nsupply just a little bit. And every little bit helps. I have a lot of \nother ideas about what we can do as well, but that is one that is very \ncritical.\n  Point No. 2: In general, on the WTO, there are a lot of things we \nhave to do to level the playing field so that Americans are no longer \nsuckers and taken for granted to the degree that we have been.\n  But to sum it all up, let's pass this agriculture emergency aid bill \nimmediately. Let's pass the bill that makes sense, the one that helps \nfarmers. And that is the one that not only puts some money back into \nfarmers' pockets for the short term but also addresses the drought, \nwhich the other bill does not address. It addresses the disaster caused \nin some parts of the country by excessive flooding and rain.\n  Really, what is happening is that the farmer is in intensive care. \nThe farmer needs an oxygen mask, and the farmer needs a blood \ntransfusion. That is where we are. We have to give the farmer the \noxygen mask. We have to give the farmer the blood transfusion so that \nthe farmer is no longer in intensive care.\n  That oxygen mask and that blood transfusion is this bill. It is the \nbill that is sponsored by the Democratic leader and the Senator from \nIowa. That is the bill that is going to take care to get that patient \nback out of intensive care. The next step, which we have to take very \nsoon, is to get that patient rehabilitated and get that patient some \nphysical therapy. It will take some other procedures in the hospital so \nthat the farmer can compete in the real world as a real person again. I \nhope we get to that point very quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I urge my colleagues, on both sides \nof the aisle, to vote for the Harkin-Daschle farm crisis aid amendment. \nThis legislation is the desperately needed response for many thousands \nof American farmers and their families whose survival is threatened. \nThis is precisely the situation that obligates us to use our authority \nto enact emergency spending, and to provide enough funding to save our \nfarmers and their livelihoods. This is a crisis that demands the \nSenate's immediate approval of emergency spending, and the Harkin-\nDaschle amendment is the step we must take now to respond to a genuine \nand severe crisis.\n  My plea is for the farmers I represent in West Virginia. Yesterday, \nthe President declared all 55 counties of West Virginia a federal \ndrought disaster area, along with over 30 counties from neighboring \nstates. In West Virginia, the relentless drought has dried up our \ncrops, drained our streams, and brought death to livestock and despair \nto thousands of farmers suffering these horrendous losses.\n  Yesterday, with the senior Senator of West Virginia and Agricultural \nSecretary Glickman, I visited the farm of Terry Dunn in Charles Town, \nWest Virginia. We witnessed the tragic effects of the drought on his \nfarm, and sat down with farmers across the state to hear their similar \nstories. The drought has devastated agricultural production in West \nVirginia in a way that even old-time farmers have never seen.\n  Because of the desperate situation, Senator Byrd has once again \nstepped in to ensure that help will be on the way. Through his dogged \nefforts working with the sponsors of the Harkin-Daschle amendment, \nthere are various sources of funds that will be available for West \nVirginia's farmers--and, I emphasize this point, funds that will also \nbe available to farmers in similar straits in Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania. There is nothing partisan or parochial \nabout voting for this amendment and the drought assistance included. \nAll of us have a responsibility to respond to crises like the one \ncreated by the drought.\n  I share the feelings of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \nhave risen to extol the virtues of family farmers and rural America. I \ntruly believe that farmers may be the hardest working people--day in, \nday out, morning, noon and night--in all the land.\n  Now, these farmers are being hurt by acts of nature totally beyond \ntheir control. We have a choice to make today that will decide just how \nwilling we are to help our farmers when they are in such dire need. We \ncan decide that we owe it to our farmers to stand with them in this \ntime of severe crisis, and adopt the Harkin-Daschle amendment that will \ntruly address their needs. Or we can settle for the far smaller level \nof funding provided by the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Cochran, that won't be nearly \nenough help.\n  For anyone who represents a drought-stricken state, there really is \nno choice. The Harkin-Daschle amendment is the humane and right thing \nto do. And for anyone who represents states and counties that have \nreceived disaster assistance after a tornado or hurricane or sweeping \nfires have struck, or following a crippling flood, this is the time to \nextend the same kind of immediate help to a different but very real \ndisaster.\n  We have heard for some time that rural America is in crisis. I doubt \nthat many people in this body think of West Virginia when agriculture \nand farming are the topic. But in fact, in West Virginia thousands of \nfarmers and their\n\n[[Page S10099]]\n\nfamilies labor hard to grow a variety of crops and raise livestock. \nThey are farmers who have rarely asked for help from anyone, but today \nthey are facing the crisis of a lifetime, and they do not want to give \nup the life and work they love.\n  I am asking my colleagues to vote for the Harkin-Daschle amendment \nbecause it will help the West Virginia farmers who have been the victim \nof two years of historic drought conditions that have ravaged their \nfields, orchards, and herds. Some of these families have run the same \nfarms since before West Virginia was admitted to the union, and now \nthey are in danger of losing everything.\n  Farmers in my state and many others need the Senate to act and to \nprovide a level of assistance that matches the magnitude of the crisis. \nWe have the means to do that today--in the form of the Harkin-Daschle \namendment. We have the authority to do that today--by voting for \nemergency funding in a time of real crisis. We have the obligation to \nrespond, not along partisan lines and not only if we represent farmers \nin need--but because a disaster has struck that requires the entire \nSenate to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana for his powerful statement and for the empathy that he \nagain demonstrates for the people in rural America. He has been an \nextraordinary leader on the agriculture issue, as well as on so many \nissues relating to the farmer over the years. Again, his eloquence this \nafternoon clearly illustrates the degree to which he understands their \nproblem and the degree to which he is committed to solving it.\n  There is a silent death in rural America today--a death that is \npervasive, a death that increasingly is affecting not only farmers but \npeople who live in rural America, whether it is on the farm or in the \ntown. Thousands upon thousands of family farmers and small businessmen \nand people who run the schools and run the towns are being forced to \nchange their lives--are being forced to leave their existence in rural \nAmerica in large measure because it isn't economically viable.\n  The situation we have all called attention to over the course of the \nlast 24 months has worsened. Just in the last 12 months, more than \n1,900 family farmers have left the farm in South Dakota alone.\n  So there can be no question, this situation is as grave as anything \nwe will face in rural America at any time in the foreseeable future. \nThe question is, what should we do about it? Our response is the \namendment that Senator Harkin and I have offered. I will have more of \nan opportunity to discuss that in a moment.\n  Let me say, regardless of what legislation I have offered, and what \nlegislation may have been offered on the Republican side, I think there \nare five factors that should be included, five factors that ought to be \nconsidered as we contemplate what kind of an approach we in the Senate \nand in the Congress must subscribe to if we are going to respond to the \ndisastrous situation we find in rural America today.\n  The first is that this must be immediate. We cannot wait until \nSeptember, or October, or November, at least to take the first step. I \nrealize the legislative process is slow and cumbersome, but if we don't \nstart now, we will never be able to respond in time to meet the needs \ncreated by the serious circumstances we face today. First and foremost, \nin an emergency way, this has to be responsive to the situation by \nallowing the Senate to work its will and do something this week.\n  Second, it has to be sufficient. The situation, as I have noted, is \nalready worse than it was last year. Last year, we were able to pass a \n$6 billion emergency plan. I believe $6 billion this year is a drop in \nthe bucket, given the circumstances we are facing in rural America \ntoday. Our bill recognizes the insufficiency of the level of commitment \nwe made in emergency funding last year. Our bill is sufficient. Our \nbill recognizes the importance and the magnitude of this problem and \ncommits resources to it: $10.7 billion. Groups from the Farm Bureau to \nthe Farmers Union to virtually every farm organization I know have said \nwe cannot underestimate how serious this situation is. We recognize \nthat, provide the resources, and provide the sufficient level of \ncommitment that will allow Members to address this problem.\n  So, No. 2, it has to be sufficient.\n  No. 3, it has to be fair. Our country is very diverse. I heard \nSenator Sarbanes talk about the disastrous circumstances we are facing \nright now in Maryland. Maryland is different. We don't have a drought \nin South Dakota, we have floods. We have low prices. We have \ncommodities that cannot be sold because they cannot be stored. We have \nagricultural situations, regardless of commodity, that are the worst \nsince the Great Depression in terms of real purchasing power. \nSoutherners have different crop problems. We have to recognize that \nthere are regional differences and there are differences in \ncommodities. Our emergency response has to address them all.\n  We also have to recognize that we must respond to the disaster that \nis out there. Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have drafted \nlegislation that, at least in its current form, does not respond at all \nto the disaster. There is no disaster commitment in that legislation. \nFor a lot of reasons--its insufficiency, its lack of fairness to \ncommodities, its lack of appreciation of the problems within regions, \nthe fact that it doesn't respond to the disaster--this side is \nconvinced that if we were to pass the Republican bill today, it would \nnot do the job.\n  I congratulate my colleagues for joining in responding to the \nsituation, but I don't think it is broad enough. I don't think it is \nsufficient enough. I certainly don't think it is fair enough, given the \ncircumstances we are facing today.\n  The final factor is simply this: As my colleague from Montana said, \nemergency assistance alone will not do it. We passed emergency \nassistance last year and here we are, back again, less than a year \nlater, with an urgent plea on the part of all of agriculture to provide \nthem with additional assistance. Why? Because the market isn't working. \nWhy is the market not working? There are a lot of reasons, but I argue \nfirst and foremost it is not working because we don't have an \nagricultural policy framework for it to work.\n\n  Freedom to Farm is not working. We can debate that on and on and on, \nbut there are more farm organizations, there are more economic experts, \nthere are more people from all walks of life, and there are more policy \nanalysts who are arguing today that we have to change the framework, \nthat we have to reopen the Freedom to Farm bill. That is a debate for \nanother day.\n  Today, this week, the debate must be: can we provide sufficient \nemergency assistance to bridge the gap to that day when we can achieve \nbetter prices, a better marketplace, more stability, and greater \neconomic security?\n  In just a moment I will move to table the Republican plan. This is in \nkeeping with an understanding I have with the majority leader and the \ndistinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee. It would be my \nhope, once it is tabled, we can have a debate on the Democratic \nalternative and have a vote on that at some point in the not-too-\ndistant future, once people have had the chance to be heard. Then, \nhopefully, we will find some resolution.\n  I think it is important at the end of the day, or no later than the \nend of the week, for the Senate to have agreed on something. I don't \nthink it is enough to simply have a Republican vote and a Democratic \nvote and leave it at that. It is my hope that we can work together to \nresolve the deficiencies in the Republican bill and listen to them as \nthey express themselves on what it is about the Democratic bill with \nwhich they are uncomfortable. At the end of the week, we simply cannot \nclose and leave without having acted successfully on this issue. It is \ntoo important. It sends the wrong message if we simply walk away \nwithout having accomplished anything.\n  I am very hopeful we can accomplish something, that as Republicans \nand Democrats we can come together to send the right message to farmers \nthat we hear them, to send the right message to rural America that we \nunderstand, and that we are prepared to respond.\n  As I noted, we have two versions that have not yet been reconciled. \nBecause I don't believe the Republican plan is sufficient, because I \ndon't think it is fair, because it doesn't respond to all\n\n[[Page S10100]]\n\nregions and all commodities, I believe today we can do better than that \nand we must find a way with which to do better than that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the leader for yielding before he makes a motion. \nI will not take more than a couple of minutes. I didn't get a chance to \nmake a couple of points earlier in the day.\n  I want to say a few words about the great work of the Senator from \nWest Virginia. I opened the New York Times this morning and saw his \npicture. He was standing in a drought-stricken cornfield in West \nVirginia yesterday with the Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary \nGlickman. He called me on the phone yesterday before the Secretary had \ngotten there. We talked about the terrible drought situation facing the \nfarmers in West Virginia. Senator Byrd wanted to make sure that we \naddressed that situation, which we have in our bill, to address the \nsevere drought situation not only in West Virginia but on the entire \neast coast. I also heard personally from Senator Byrd on the great \nproblem facing our livestock farmers. So we have placed in this \namendment an amount of $200 million to be added to Section 32 funds to \nbe used for assistance to livestock producers who have suffered losses \nfrom excessive heat and drought in declared disaster areas.\n\n  Again, I commend Senator Byrd from West Virginia for bringing this to \nour attention so we were able to put this amount of money into the bill \nfor livestock producers. I also want to mention a couple of other \nthings that were not said earlier.\n  We have some situations where crops have suffered damage, some in \n1998 and some in 1999, where the existing farm programs are not \nadequately addressing the situation and the problems. So we provided \n$500 million in our amendment to respond to these situations, in other \nwords, to take a comprehensive view of the disasters that have struck \nmany farmers around the country. We have problems with the citrus crop \nin California, with apples and onions in New York, that I understand is \na $50 million problem. We expect the Secretary to also address that \nsituation with crops in New Jersey, New Mexico, and I know in other \nStates.\n  We have done all we can in our bill to accommodate the request to \naddress these issues in a comprehensive manner in disaster payments. \nAgain, I point out we take care of those disasters in our bill. Those \nare not addressed in the bill put forward by the other side.\n  Last, I point out that Section 32 funding is also available to \npurchase commodities to reduce surpluses in a lot of different areas. \nThat is why Section 32 funding is so important. I expect at least $3 \nmillion would be available to make up the existing shortfall in the \nTEFAP funding under our proposal.\n  I thank Senator Daschle again for his great leadership on this bill. \nWe may have to continue to do some work, but I agree with our leader, \nwe have to do something before we leave here this week. I thank him for \nhis leadership and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me reiterate my admiration and gratitude to the \nSenator from Iowa. It has been his effort on the floor. He has managed \nour side in this regard. He has led us in working to come up with a \ncomprehensive approach. No one has put more effort and leadership and \ncommitment into this than has Senator Harkin. I am grateful to him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the minority leader.\n\n\n                         emergency farm relief\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Daschle amendment \nto provide relief to the farmers of this nation who now suffer from the \nirony of an economic crisis in rural America at a time when the rest of \nthe nation is enjoying one of our history's greatest period of economic \nprosperity. Senator Daschle's amendment will bring much needed relief \nto America's farmers who face the real threat of a failed market and, \nin some cases, farmers who are caught in the grips of one of the worst \ndroughts of this century.\n  Last year, Congress provided similar relief to farmers totaling \nnearly $6 million. The amendment offered by Senator Daschle is in the \n$10 billion range. Without question, these are huge sums of money and \nthis Congress should not recommend their expenditure without serious \nconsideration of the need and the consequences. However, I would like \nto remind my colleagues that during the farm crisis of a decade ago, \nfarm spending for commodity price support programs in some years \nexceeded $25 billion. By comparison, the Daschle amendment when coupled \nwith USDA farm outlays under current law, especially when adjusted for \ninflation, are modest by comparison.\n  Ask any farmer across America, including dairy farmers in Wisconsin \nwho a few months ago witnessed the greatest drop in milk prices in \nhistory, and you will learn just how serious the current farm crisis \nis. The Daschle amendment is necessary to protect our farmers and their \nability to protect our national food security. We can point to many \ndifferent reasons why the farm economy is now suffering. But more \nimportantly, action is needed to deal with the immediate problem. \nFarmers now suffer from a failed safety net and Senator Daschle's \namendment will help patch the holes in that safety net until one of \ngreater substance and success can be put in place.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at this point I move to table the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1500, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) and \nthe Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) would vote ``no.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 249 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Domenici\n     Hatch\n       \n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I now withdraw the amendment I offered on \nbehalf of Senator Cochran, amendment No. 1500.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1506 To Amendment No. 1499\n\n     (Purpose: To provide emergency and income loss assistance to \n                        agricultural producers)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr.\n\n[[Page S10101]]\n\n     Kerrey, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1506 to amendment No. 1499.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on \nthe motion to table that I just made at 5 p.m., with the time between \nnow and then equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader, for the \npurpose of scheduling, as I understand it, this will be the last vote \nand we will return to the dairy debate following this, is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond, I understand that, \ndepending on how this vote goes, there may be a second-degree amendment \nthat would be offered perhaps by Senator Ashcroft. But after that is \ndispensed with, that would be the final vote of the day, I believe, \nonce we dispense with this whole process. Then we can go on to debate \ndairy, and the vote on dairy cloture will occur in the morning. We \nwould have time for debate on cloture tonight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, time is equally \ndivided, so we have about 7 minutes on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, who controls time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized on the Democrats' time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is less than 15 minutes remaining before \nthe 5 o'clock vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we just had a vote on a package that was \nproposed by the other side which would have gone out in direct payments \nto farmers as sort of income support for the low prices this year. The \nmotion to table was unsuccessful. But I note that the vote was 51-47, a \nvery close vote, to be sure. So now, under the previous arrangement, \nthe first-degree amendment offered by Senator Daschle and I, and others \non this side, is now the pending amendment.\n  I would like to explain for a couple of minutes the differences \nbetween what we have proposed and what was previously voted on. The \npackage that was previously voted on was basically direct payments to \nfarmers, AMTA payments, transition-type payments, which would go out.\n  Our package is a lot more comprehensive in that it addresses not only \nthe income loss of farmers this year because of disastrously low \nprices, but our proposal also has $2.6 billion in there for disaster \nassistance. It covers such things as the 30-percent premium discount \nfor crop insurance, so we can get farmers to buy more crop insurance \nall over America. We have money in there for 1998 disaster programs \nthat were not fully compensated for with money from last fall's \ndisaster package. We have some livestock assistance programs, Section \n32 funding, related to natural disasters, and flooded land programs. I \nmight also point out that because of the disastrous drought affecting \nthe East Coast, we have money in our proposal that would cover disaster \npayments to farmers up and down the Middle Atlantic because of the \nsevere drought that is happening.\n  I might also point out that because of the need to get this money out \nrapidly to farmers, we have adequate funds in our disaster provision \nfor staffing needs for the Farm Service Agency, so they can get these \nfunds out in a hurry to our farmers.\n  I also point out that in the proposal now before us, we have an \nemergency conservation program for watershed and for wetlands \nrestoration. We have some trade provisions that I think are eminently \nvery important. They include $1.4 billion that would go for \nhumanitarian assistance. This would be to purchase oilseed and \nproducts, and other food grains that would be sent in humanitarian \nassistance to starving people around the world. That was not in the \nprevious amendment we voted on.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. In one second, I will.\n  Also, we have some emergency economic development because the \ndisasters that have befallen our farmers and the low grain prices have \naffected many of our people in the smaller communities. We have funds \nfor those problems also.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator can emphasize \ndisaster relief. As the Senator indicated--and I knew this--the \nprevious initiative we voted on by the majority party, and was not \ntabled, that did not include disaster relief. We know disaster is \noccurring. Drought is spreading across the country. Disaster relief is \nnecessary. Is it the case that the proposal we just voted on had no \ndisaster relief and the proposal we will vote on at 5 o'clock, which \nyou and I and so many others helped draft, does include disaster \nrelief; is that not a significant difference?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right. There \nwas no disaster assistance in the other bill. There is disaster \nassistance in ours--$2.6 billion that would cover the droughts, cover \nthe floods, and cover a lot of the natural disasters that have befallen \nfarmers all over America. That is a big difference in these two bills. \nThat is encompassing the bill that we now have before us.\n  Lastly, I would like to say that the payments that go out under our \nbill go out to producers and go out to actual farmers. Under the bill \nthat we just voted on, some of the payments would go out to people who \nmaybe didn't even plant a thing this year. They may not have even lived \non a farm. This has to do with 20-year-old base acreages and program \nyields. So a lot of money can go out to people who aren't farming any \nlonger. Our payments go out to actual farmers and people who are \nactually out there on the land.\n  I yield to my friend from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  I ask the Senator to yield for a question.\n  I want to underscore the point about disaster relief in the \nNortheast. We have farmers who are hurting in my State of New York. \nFurther south, in the middle Atlantic States, the drought is probably \nthe worst it has been in this century. It is awful. In my State, it \ngoes from county to county. Some have had some rain. Many have not. In \nother States, it is the whole State.\n  The fact that this proposal has money for disaster relief and the \nother doesn't is going to mean a great deal for the Northeast, I would \npresume.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely. In response to my friend from New York, \nabsolutely for New York and all the States in the upper Northeast. It \nis not only just the price problem that you have. You have some \ndisasters hitting you up there, and no money to help those farmers is \nincluded in their bill. That is why it is so important that this bill \nis passed and not tabled.\n  I hope Senators will recognize that in this bill it is not only \nincome support, but it is also disaster payments to farmers.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 19 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve that time in case our leader wants to use it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \nit will be equally to both sides.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that a couple of \nother colleagues wish to speak. I don't see them. There is only a \nminute left. We are not going to delay this vote.\n\n[[Page S10102]]\n\n  I again compliment the distinguished Senator from Iowa and my other \ncolleagues for their effort to get us to this point. I think for rural \nAmerica this is one of the most important votes we are going to cast \nthis session. Whether or not we send a clear message about the \nseriousness of this situation, the breadth and the depth of this \nsituation, whether we really understand the magnitude of the problem \nwill be determined by how this vote turns out.\n  If I had my way, we would do a lot more. But at the very least, we \nmust do this. There are millions of people who are going to be watching \nto see whether or not the Congress gets it --whether or not the \nCongress understands the magnitude of the problem, whether or not we \ncan fully appreciate the fact that people are being forced off the \nfarms and ranches today, whether or not that happens, and whether or \nnot we understand how serious this situation is will be determined in \nthe next 20 minutes.\n  I must tell you, Mr. President, that this is a very critical vote. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to table this \namendment. Join with us in support. Let's send the right message to \nAmerican agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for the proponents of the amendment \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no Senator who is seeking \nrecognition on this side. The issue has been debated fully. I think we \nare prepared to go to vote.\n  I yield the time on this side on the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nDemocratic Emergency Relief Package for Agriculture. I am pleased to be \na cosponsor of this critical amendment. American farms are struggling \nto survive. This package creates a safety net for our farmers who are \nfacing a devastating drought.\n  I support this amendment for three reasons. First it will help our \nfarmers in Maryland who are suffering through an extreme drought. \nSecond, it will help us maintain our agri-economy in the United States. \nThird, it is comprehensive because it helps farmers in all regions of \nthe country.\n  My state of Maryland is suffering from the most severe drought in the \nState's history. Last week, Governor Glendening declared a state-wide \ndrought emergency. This is the first time in Maryland's history that \nthe Governor has had to take such drastic measures. Up to this point, \nwater conservation efforts have been voluntary. Now, Marylanders will \nbe required by law to conserve water. The United States Geological \nSurvey officials are calling the drought of 1999 possibly the century's \nworst in the Mid Atlantic region. We can't stand by and let our farmers \nface this drought on their own. These are hard working, tax paying \nAmericans who are facing a crisis. If we don't help them, we all lose.\n  Maryland has now been plagued by drought for the third consecutive \nyear. The drought has destroyed between 30 percent and 80 percent of \nthe crops in nineteen counties in Maryland. Loss of soybean, tobacco, \nwheat and corn crops is making this a very tough season for Maryland \nfarmers. Our farmers need our help. Our farmers are losing crops and \nthey are losing money--without help, they might lose their farms. \nCouple the drought with the record low prices, high costs and a glut in \nthe market and that spells disaster for Maryland farmers.\n  I am already fighting with the rest of the Maryland delegation to \ndesignate Maryland farmland as disaster areas because of the drought. \nThis means the Department of Agriculture will provide emergency loans \nto our farmers. But we need to do more. Loans need to be paid back. \nLoans do not provide any real long term assistance for our farming \ncommunity. We must also provide grants for these farmers who are \nsuffering most from the drought. The Democratic package contains direct \npayments to help our farmers. These grants could mean the difference \nbetween saving the family farm or selling out to the highest bidder.\n  Mr. President, the second reason I support this package is because it \nsupports our family farms. Agriculture is a critical component of the \nU.S. economy. Our country was built on agriculture. Agriculture helps \nus maintain our robust economy. It is what fills our grocery stores \nwith fresh, plentiful supplies of safe food for our families. It allows \nus to trade with other countries and build global economies and \npartnerships. It allows us to assist other countries whose people need \nfood. Agriculture is the number one industry in the State of Maryland. \nWe need to make sure U.S. agriculture is strong. We cannot allow \nnatural disasters to ruin this crucial sector by putting farms out of \nbusiness for good. These are good farmers who, through no fault of \ntheir own, have been put in devastating situations. These are farmers \nwe need. I will not stand by and allow them to go under. We must pass \nthis farm package to save our farmers.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I support this package because it supports \nfarmers in all regions of the country. The combination of low prices, \nlack of adequate crop insurance and natural disasters has made it a \nchallenge to draft a package that helps everyone. Different areas of \nthe country suffer from one or all of these contingencies. As I \nmentioned, Maryland suffers from all three. This makes it especially \nhard for us. It also makes it especially vital that we pass this farm \nrelief package today.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote to help our American farmers \nand to save our farms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1507 To Amendment No. 1499\n\n(Purpose: To provide stability in the United States agriculture sector \n     and to promote adequate availability of food and medicine for \n  humanitarian assistance abroad by requiring congressional approval \n    before the imposition of any unilateral agricultural or medical \n         sanction against a foreign country or foreign entity)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my intention to send an amendment \nto the desk.\n\n[[Page S10103]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. May we have order, please. This is an important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. And I am grateful to the Senator for \nasking for order in the Chamber.\n  I intend to send an amendment to the desk relating to something that \nI think is very important to the members of the agricultural community \nin the United States of America.\n  This is an amendment that relates to farmers because it relates to \ntheir ability to sell the things they work hard to produce. Currently, \nit is possible for the President of the United States to sanction--\nmeaning, to curtail--the right of farmers to export and sell that which \nthey produce on their farms.\n  The farmers work hard, they get a bumper crop, and then, because the \nPresident would decide that he wanted to make some foreign power or \nanother respond to his interests or his requirements, or our interests \nor our requirements, the President would impose an embargo, a trade \nembargo, which would forbid our agriculture community to export corn or \nwheat or soybeans--agricultural products--to these other countries.\n  Sanctions do play an important and vital role in the U.S. foreign \npolicy. But I think when you talk about unilateral sanctions that the \nGovernment of the United States enters into alone, and you talk about \nfood and medicine as the subject of sanctions, you have to ask yourself \na variety of different questions that I think really result in sort of \na different conclusion about food and medicine type sanctions than a \nlot of other sanctions.\n  Put it this way. I think it is important that we make sure we do not \nprovide countries with the wrong kind of hardware, the wrong kind of \ncommercial assets. But it makes very little sense, in most \ncircumstances, to say to other countries: We are not going to let you \nspend money on food; we are not going to let you spend money on \nmedicine.\n  This amendment, which I will be offering, is an amendment that is \ndesigned to involve the Congress in the important decision about \nwhether or not we should have sanctions that relate to food and \nmedicine that are unilaterally imposed by the United States of America, \nnot in conjunction with any other powers.\n  To summarize the kind of regime that would be specified in this \namendment, the bill would not tie the hands of the executive by making \nit necessary for the President to get the consent of Congress. The \nPresident's hands wouldn't be tied. He could still get sanctions. He \nwould simply have to have the agreement of the Congress so that while \nthe President would need the agreement of Congress, his hands would not \nbe tied. He would literally have to shake hands with Congress before he \nembargoes agriculture or medicine. The amendment would not restrict or \nalter the President's current ability to impose broad sanctions with \nother nations. It certainly does not preclude sanctions on food and \nmedicine. It simply says the President may include food and medicine in \na sanction regime, but he must first obtain congressional consent.\n  We did add a special provision to this amendment with regard to \ncountries that are already sanctioned. For the seven countries under a \nbroad sanctions regime, we want to afford the President and the \nCongress some time to review the sanctions on food and medicine on a \ncountry-by-country basis. Therefore, the bill would not take effect \nuntil 180 days after it is signed by the President. This gives both \nbranches of Government enough time to review current policy and to act \njointly, as would be necessary if jointly they were to decide that \nsanctions against food and medicine should be maintained.\n  There are some exceptions. If Congress declares war, there is no \nquestion about it; the President should have the authority to sanction \nfood and medicine without congressional approval. The President's \nauthority to cut off food and medicine sales in wartime obviously \nshould exist and would continue to exist.\n  The bill specifically excludes all dual-use items and products that \ncould be used to develop chemical or biological weapons. There are not \nmany agricultural or medicinal products that have military \napplications, but the bill provides safeguards to ensure our national \nsecurity is not harmed.\n  We made sure that no taxpayer money could be used to subsidize \nexports to any terrorist governments. We specifically exclude any kind \nof agricultural credits or guarantees for governments that are sponsors \nof international terrorism. However, we do allow credit guarantees to \nbe extended to private sector and nongovernmental organizations. This \ntargeted approach helps us show support for the very people who need to \nbe strengthened in these countries, and by specifically excluding \nterrorist governments, we send a message that the United States will in \nno way assist or endorse the activities of nations which threaten our \ninterests.\n  Just last week, the American Farm Bureau and all State farm bureaus \nacross the Nation released an ag recovery action plan. It requested $14 \nbillion in emergency funding. I think it is a serious request. It is \nnot a request that I take lightly. We are now considering proposals in \nthe Congress from about $7- to $11 billion. We need to be addressing \nthe emergency needs of farmers, but we also need to reduce our own \nbarriers that our own farmers suffer under such as unilateral \nagricultural embargoes.\n  The USDA estimated that there has been a $1.2 billion annual decline \nin our economy during the mid-1990s as a result of these kinds of \nembargoes. The National Association of Wheat Growers estimated that \nsanctions have shut U.S. wheat farmers out of 10 percent of the world's \nwheat market. The Washington Wheat Commission projects that if \nsanctions were lifted this year, our wheat farmers could export an \nadditional 4.1 million metric tons of wheat, a value of almost half a \nbillion dollars to the United States and to American farmers. American \nsoybean farmers could capture a substantial part of the soybean market \nin sanctioned countries. For example, an estimated 90 percent of the \ndemand for soybean meal in one country, 60 percent of the demand for \nsoybeans in another. Soybean farmers' income could rise by an estimated \n$100- to $147 million annually, according to the American Soybean \nAssociation.\n\n  For us to raise barriers for the freedom of our farmers to market the \nthings they produce and hold them hostage to our foreign policy \nobjectives would require that we could get great foreign policy benefit \nfrom these objectives. And there isn't any clear benefit.\n  One of the most ironic of all the case studies about agricultural \nsanctions was the study of our grain embargo against the Soviet Union \nin the late 1970s. Indeed, there we were upset about activities in the \nSoviet Union, so we indicated we wouldn't sell to the Soviet Union the \ngrain we had agreed to sell to them. It was something like 17 million \ntons.\n  It turns out that by canceling our agreements, the Soviets went to \nthe world market, according to the best studies I know of, and they \nsaved $250 million buying grain on the world market instead of buying \nit from us. So our embargo not only hurt our own farmers but aided the \nvery country to which we had directed our sanction. It seems to me we \nshould not be strengthening our targets when we are weakening American \nfarmers through the imposition of unilateral sanctions on food and \nmedicine--the idea somehow that we allow foreign governments to starve \ntheir people and to spend their resources on things that destabilize \nregions of the world, telling their people: We can't have food in this \ncountry, the U.S. won't sell us food, when I think we should be glad \nfor any country to buy things like soybean and wheat and rice and corn \nso that they are not buying things that are used to destabilize their \nneighbors or weaponry and the like. I believe it is important for us to \nsay to our farmers that we are not going to make them a pawn in the \nhands of people for international diplomacy. The rest of America \ncontinues to go merrily forward, and they are bearing the brunt because \nthey operate in a world marketplace where there are markets for these \ncommodities that, in the event the foreign powers want them, they get \nthem and replace them very easily.\n\n[[Page S10104]]\n\n  It is with that in mind that this amendment has been constructed, \ncarefully constructed, and designed to respect the need for sanctions \nwhere they are appropriate. When we engage in sanctions multilaterally, \nthis does not come into play. This is designed to affect unilateral \nsanctions on food and medicine, and it doesn't prohibit them. It simply \nsays that in order for the President to impose them, he would have to \ngain the consent of the Congress.\n  I am pleased that there is a long list of individuals who have been \nwilling to cosponsor this amendment with me. Frankly, this amendment is \na combination of provisions that were in a measure Senator Hagel of \nNebraska and I had proposed. We have come together to work on it. \nSenator Baucus, Senator Roberts, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator \nDodd of Connecticut, Senator Brownback of Kansas, Senator Grams of \nMinnesota, Senator Warner of Virginia, Senator Leahy of Vermont, \nSenator Craig of Idaho, Senator Fitzgerald of Illinois, Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Sessions, Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, Senator Landrieu, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Conrad, Senator Inhofe and others have been \nwilling to cosponsor this amendment. I think it is an important \namendment. I am pleased to have this opportunity to offer the \namendment.\n\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], for himself, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Grams, Mr. Warner, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n     Fitzgerald, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. \n     Landrieu, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Chafee, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1507 to amendment No. 1499.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that James Odom \nof my staff be granted the privilege of the floor during today's \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor of the Ashcroft amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pending \namendment regarding agricultural sanctions reform. One only has to run \na search for legislation regarding sanctions to see that economic \nsanctions reform has become a key issue for the 106th Congress. I am \npleased to be the cosponsor of several pieces of legislation that seek \nto address the problem of current U.S. sanctions policies.\n  In particular, I am pleased to be the cosponsor of Senator Lugar's \nbill, S. 757, which seeks to create a more rational framework for \nconsideration of future U.S. sanctions. While I strongly support the \namendment currently pending before the Senate, this is only the first \nstep in addressing economic sanctions reform. It is my hope Congress \nwill continue to work in a bipartisan manner to make our sanctions \npolicy more focused and effective.\n  I am sure it comes as no surprise to my colleagues from farm states \nthat there is a crisis in rural America. It is a crisis that is \nthreatening the very foundations of family-based agriculture. Export \nmarkets have shrunk, commodity prices have plummeted, and rural incomes \nhave decreased at an alarming rate. Yet while this is occurring, both \nCongress and the President have continued to pursue a foreign policy \nthat places restrictions on our agricultural producers, closes off \nmarkets, and lowers the value of commodities.\n  Too often, we have used the blunt instrument of unilateral economic \nsanctions--including restrictions on the sale of U.S. agricultural \nproducts--as a simple means to address complex foreign policy problems. \nThese agricultural sanctions end up hurting the most vulnerable in the \ntarget country, eroding confidence in the United States as a supplier \nof food, disrupting our export markets, and placing an unfair burden on \nAmerica's farmers.\n  Mr. President, I do not mean to suggest we will bring relief to rural \nAmerica by simply reforming our sanctions policy. The crisis in \nagriculture is principally a result of the failure--not of our foreign \npolicy--but of our farm policy. It is time to rewrite the farm bill to \nsafeguard producer incomes and to stop the outmigration from our rural \ncommunities. Those who argue sanctions are the sole cause of the \nproblems in agriculture fail to realize the challenges we are facing \nrequire a more comprehensive solution. However, while we work to \nimprove farm legislation, we cannot continue to ask our farmers to bear \nthe brunt of U.S. foreign policy decisions.\n  The amendment we are currently considering would be a positive first \nstep in addressing sanctions reform. Under current law, agricultural \nand medicinal products may be included under a sanctions package \nwithout any special protections against such actions. However, if this \namendment is adopted, agricultural products and medicine would be \nprecluded from any new unilateral sanctions unless the President \nsubmits a report to Congress specifically requesting these products be \nsanctioned. Congress would then have to approve the request by joint \nresolution. Furthermore, should an agricultural sanction be imposed, it \nwould automatically sunset after two years. Renewal would require a new \nrequest from the President and approval by the Congress.\n  This amendment undoubtedly sets a high standard for the imposition of \nunilateral economic sanctions for food and medicine. It is a standard \nthat seeks to end the practice of using food and medicine as a foreign \npolicy weapon at the expense of our agricultural producers.\n  Mr. President, the strong support we are receiving from commodity \ngroups is a testament to the importance of this amendment to our \nagricultural producers. Organizations such as the American Soybean \nAssociation, the National Corn Growers Association, and the National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers--groups that represent America's farmers--\nsupport this amendment because they understand the costs and \nconsequences associated with unilateral economic sanctions.\n  Mr. President, this measure will help our agricultural producers by \nreturning some common sense to the imposition of U.S. sanctions. I urge \nmy colleagues to join with the cosponsors of this amendment to take the \nfirst step toward economic sanctions reform.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Ashcroft \namendment. As every other Member of this institution, I understand the \nhardship in American agriculture. I know the suffering of American \nfamilies, and I know something of the problem of the policy. This \namendment is based on a false promise. We are telling the American \nfarmer that with all of his problems, a significant difference in his \nlife can be made if only we can stop these sanctions.\n  It is a false promise. All of these countries combined, their total \nimportation of agricultural products is 1.7 percent of agricultural \nimports.\n  So even if they bought nothing from Canada, nothing from Argentina, \nnothing from Australia, and nothing from Europe, altogether it would be \n1.7 percent of these imports. What is the potential of these countries \nthat we are being told markets will open by the Ashcroft amendment? How \nmuch money is it that these people have to spend to help the American \nfarmer? In North Korea, the total per capita annual income of a North \nKorean is $480. In Cuba, it is $150.\n  Mr. President, the American farmer is being told: There is a rescue \nhere for you. Rather than deal with the substantive problems of \nAmerican agriculture at home, we have an answer for you. We are going \nto open up importation and export to all these terrorist nations, and \nthat will solve the problem. Really? With $150 in purchasing power in \nCuba? The purchasing power of the North Koreans?\n  The fact of the matter is, to the extent there is any potential in \nthese countries to purchase American agricultural products, the \nadministration has already responded. There may not\n\n[[Page S10105]]\n\nbe much of a potential, but what there is, we have responded to.\n  Last week, the administration permitted the limited sale of food and \nagricultural commodities to these countries by licenses on a country-\nby-country basis. We did so for a responsible reason. If the North \nKoreans are going to import American agricultural products, we want to \nknow who is importing them and who is getting them--in other words, \nthat they are going to go to the people of North Korea and not the \nmilitary of North Korea. If they are going to Cuba, we want to know the \nCuban people are getting them, not the Cuban military. The same goes \nfor Iran and Libya.\n  The potential of what Mr. Ashcroft is asking we have already done but \nin a responsible way. Indeed, potentially, with Iran, Libya, and Sudan, \nthis could be $2 billion worth of sales to those countries--but \nensuring that they go to people--not militaries, not terrorist sects, \nbut the people. Here is an example of the policy the administration has \nhad since May 10 with regard to Cuba. Regulations permit the license \nand sale of food and commodities on a case-by-case basis if they go to \nnongovernment agencies, religious organizations, private farmers, \nfamily-owned businesses. If your intention is to sell food to any of \nthose entities, you can get a license and you can do it. To whom can't \nyou sell? The Communist Party, the Cuban military for re-export by the \nCuban Government for Fidel Castro.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri solves no problem \nand simply contradicts the administration's policy of ensuring that \nthis goes to the people we want to be the end users. The same is true \nin North Korea. Today, the United States is in a humanitarian \nassistance program to North Korea. Over $459 million worth of food has \nbeen donated to North Korea through the World Food Program. UNICEF has \ndone the same. But we send monitors. When the food arrives in North \nKorea, we monitor that it is going to the people of North Korea, not \nthe military. We want to know the end users.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Missouri will be a wholesale change \nin American foreign policy. Sanctions that have been in place since the \nKennedy administration, through Johnson, Nixon, Carter, and Reagan, \nwill be abandoned wholesale--a radical change in American foreign \npolicy.\n  What are the nations and what are the policies that would be changed? \nI want my colleagues to walk down memory lane with me. Before you vote \nto end the policy of 30 years of American administrations, I want you \nto understand who will be getting these food exports, without licenses, \nwhich are not required to ensure the end users. I cannot be the only \nperson in this institution who remembers Mr. Qadhafi, his destruction \nof an American airliner, his refusal to bring the terrorists to justice \nwho did so to Pan Am 103. We are now in an agreement with Libya to \nbring those terrorists to trial. Now, in the middle of the trial, while \nthere is an agreement, this amendment would lift the sanctions and \nallow the exportation of those products.\n\n  The Sudan. Sanctions have not been in place long. In an act I am sure \nmy colleagues recall, Mr. bin Laden's lieutenants plotted and executed \nthe destruction of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August \n1998; 224 people were murdered. The administration appropriately \nresponded with sanctions, prohibiting the exportation of products of \nany kind to the Sudan. The amendment of the Senator from Missouri would \nlift those sanctions.\n  North Korea. The intelligence community and the Japanese Government \nhave put us on notice that, in a matter of weeks or months, the North \nKorean Government may test fire an intermediate to long-range missile \ncapable of hitting the United States. We are in discussions with the \nNorth Koreans urging them not to do so. We have entered into a limited \nhumanitarian food program to convince them not to engage in the design \nor testing of an atomic weapon. The amendment of the Senator from \nMissouri would negate that program, where we already sell food, knowing \nits end use and end sanctions.\n  Iran. The administration has already entered into a program where we \ncan license the exportation of food to Iran if we know its end use. But \nonly this year, the administration again noted that Iran supports \nterrorist groups responsible for the deaths of at least 12 Americans \nand has funded a $100 million program to undermine the Middle East \npeace process, giving direct bilateral assistance to every terrorist \ngroup in the Middle East, undermining Israel and American foreign \npolicy.\n  Cuba. In October 1997, the United States found that the Cuban \nGovernment had murdered four Americans and found them guilty of gross \nviolations of human rights. Last year, 12 Cubans were indicted in \nFlorida for a plot to do a terrorist act against American military \nfacilities in Florida. The United States already licenses food to Cuba, \nwhere we know the end use. The amendment of the Senator from Missouri \nwould allow the wholesale exportation of food to Cuba despite these \nindictments, gross human rights violations, and 30 years of American \nforeign policy.\n  I respect the concern of the Senator from Missouri for the American \nfarmer. I understand the plight. But let's deal truthfully with the \nAmerican farmer, his family, and his plight. The Cuban family who earns \n$150 a year, through their purchasing power, is not going to salvage \nAmerican agriculture. If Cuba was capable of importing food today, they \nwould do so from Argentina, Canada, or Europe. They don't because they \ncan't, because they have no money. The same is true of North Korea. If \nNorth Korea had the money to import food, they would do so from every \nother nation in the world that does not have sanctions on them. They \ndon't because they can't, because they can't afford it, because they \nhave no money. You are making an offer no one can accept--an answer to \nthe American farmer that has no substance. I don't believe there is a \nsingle farmer in America who either believes this argument or, even if \nit would be successful, even if they did have money, would want to \nprofit off the misery of others who are victims of this kind of \nterrorism.\n  I, too, represent an agricultural State. Farmers in the State of New \nJersey--the Garden State--are also suffering.\n  I have yet to find one American farmer--good Americans, patriotic \nAmericans--who believes the answer to their problem is selling Qadhafi \nproducts, or the Iranians. American farmers--all of the American \npeople--have long memories.\n  These people are outlaws. Every one of these nations is on the \nterrorist list. Is our policy to put nations on the terrorist list \nbecause they kill our citizens, bomb our embassies, destroy our planes, \nand then to say: It is outrageous but would you like to do business? \nCan we profit by you? We know our citizens have been hurt. But, you \nknow, that was yesterday; now we would like to make a buck.\n  Please, my colleagues, don't come to this floor and argue that you \nare contradicting the foreign policy of Bill Clinton. You are. And you \nare undermining his negotiations as to the North Korean missile tests \nand atomic weapons, and you are undermining our efforts to bring people \nto justice in Libya and for human rights in Cuba. But don't come to \nthis floor and just claim you are undermining Bill Clinton. Half of \nthese sanctions were put in place by Ronald Reagan and George Bush. \nThis is 30 years of American foreign policy with a single vote, with a \nstroke of a pen, that you would undermine.\n  Some of you may be prepared to forget some of the things through all \nof these years. Maybe some of these acts are distant. But my God. \nSaddam, the destruction of American embassies? Some of those families \nare still grieving. We haven't even rebuilt the embassies. We are still \nclosing them because of terrorist threats. The man who masterminded it \nis still being hunted.\n  The Sudan?\n  This is our idea of how to correct American foreign policy? My \ncolleagues, I want to see this amendment defeated. But, indeed, that is \nnot enough.\n  If from North Korea to the Sudan to Iran there is a belief that you \ncan just wait the United States out, that we are the kind of people who \nwill forget that quickly, who will profit in spite of these terrible \nactions against our people, what a signal that is to others.\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\n What a signal it is to others who engage in terrorism.\n  I do not hold a high standard with whom we do business. Business is \nbusiness. Politics is politics. But there is a point at which they \nmeet. These rogue nations, identified after careful analysis of having \nengaged in the sponsoring of international terrorism, deserve these \nsanctions. On a bipartisan basis, we have always given them these \nsanctions. Don't desert that policy.\n  Bin Laden in his cave in Afghanistan, Abu Nidal in the Middle East \nare even now plotting against Israel and the peace process.\n  I don't know whether the American farmer will know of or appreciate \nthis vote. But I know that in those capitals in those countries where \nthe people committed these acts it will be noted.\n  This is not a partisan affair. I am very proud that from Connie Mack, \nwho has joined this fight for some years, to the distinguished chairman \nof the committee, Chairman Helms, to Bob Graham, to our own leadership \nin Harry Reid, to, indeed, the majority leader, Senator Lott, they have \nall joined in defeating this amendment because it is right for American \nforeign policy.\n  Let's do justice to the American farmer by dealing with the \nsubstantive problem--not dealing with excuses, and not dealing with \nother matters. We do nothing by fooling the American farmer. The \nAmerican farmer stands shoulder to shoulder with every other American \nagainst terrorism and the defense of our country and its interests.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to strongly support this amendment. I am a \ncosponsor. As Senator Ashcroft noted, it is the blending of Senator \nAshcroft's bill and my bill that produced this amendment.\n  This amendment establishes a basic principle: Food and medicine are \nthe most fundamental of human needs and should not be included in \nunilateral sanctions.\n  The rate of change in today's world is unprecedented in history. \nTrade, and particularly trade in food and medicine, is the common \ndenominator that ties together the nations of the world. American \nexports of food and medicine act to build bridges around the world. It \nstrengthens ties between people and demonstrates the innate goodness \nand humanitarianism of the American people.\n  This amendment recognizes that there could be reasons to restrict \nfood and medicine exports and recognizes that, in fact, sometimes \nunilateral sanctions are in the best interests of this Nation's \nsecurity. We do not take that ability away from the President of the \nUnited States. That is not what this amendment does. We all recognize \nthat there are times when unilateral sanctions should, in fact, be in \nthe arsenal of our foreign policy tools, but it also recognizes that \nthe Congress should have a role in that decision.\n  This amendment recognizes that there are circumstances where export \ncontrols may be necessary, such as in times of war, if it is a dual-use \nitem controlled by the Commerce Department, or if the product could be \nused in the manufacture of chemical or biological weapons. That is not \nthe debate here. That is not the debate.\n  But we have had a long and sad history in understanding what \nunilateral sanctions do to those who impose them. We don't isolate \nCuba. We don't isolate China. We don't isolate any nation other than \nour own interests when we say: We will not sell you our grain, our \nmedicines.\n  Do we really believe that in the world we live in today a nation \ncannot get wheat from Australia, from Canada, or cannot get soybeans \nfrom Brazil? The fact is that the world is dynamic. It has always been \ndynamic. The challenges change. The solutions to those challenges, the \nanswers to those challenges, must be dynamic as well.\n  We need to send a strong message to our customers and our competitors \naround the world that our agricultural producers are going to be \nconsistent and reliable suppliers of quality and plentiful agricultural \nproducts.\n  I heard the discussion on the floor of the Senate today about this \namendment--talking about, well, my goodness, are we trying to fix the \nproblems of farmers with this amendment with sanctions reform? No. No, \nwe are not.\n  But I think it is important we understand that this is connected. \nThis is linked. Trade reform and sanctions reform were, in fact, part \nof the commitment that this Congress made to our agricultural community \nin 1996.\n  We need to lead. We need to be creative. We need to be relevant. We \nneed to connect the challenges with the policy. USDA, for example, \nreports that the value of agricultural exports this year will drop to \n$49 billion. That is a reduction from $60 billion just 3 years ago. \nAmerican agriculture is already suffering from depressed prices and \nreduced global markets, as we have heard very clearly today, making \nsanctions reform even more important. Again, let's not blur the lines \nof this debate.\n  I noted as well the debate today on the floor regarding the Iranian \npiece of sanctions reform.\n  Let's not forget that when America broke diplomatic relations with \nIran, Iran was the largest importer of American wheat in the world. I \nthink, as has been noted, Iran this year will import almost $3 billion \nworth of wheat. Are we talking about just the commercial interests and \nthe agricultural interests of America and national security interests \nbe damned? No, we are not talking about that.\n  This amendment gives the President the power, when he thinks it is in \nour national security interests or in our national interests as he \ndefines those through his policy, to impose unilateral sanctions. \nHowever, he does it with the Congress as a partner; the Congress has a \nsay when we use unilateral sanctions.\n  This is not just about doing what is right for the American farmer \nand rancher, the agricultural producer. This amendment also makes good \nhumanitarian and foreign policy sense. Our amendment will say to the \nhungry and oppressed of the world that the United States will not make \ntheir suffering worse by restricting access to food and medicine.\n  I have heard the arguments; I understand the arguments. I don't \nbelieve I live in a fairyland about where the food goes, where the \nmedicine goes. We understand there always is that issue when we export \nfood, sell food, give food to dictators, to tyrants. We understand \nrealistically where some of that may be placed.\n  To arbitrarily shut off to the people, the oppressed masses of the \nworld, food, medicine, and opportunities is not smart foreign policy. \nIt is not smart foreign policy. It will make it harder for an \noppressive government, the tyrants and dictators, to blame the United \nStates for humanitarian plights of their own people. In today's world, \nunilateral trade sanctions primarily isolate those who impose them.\n  For those reasons and many others that Members will hear in comments \nmade yet this afternoon on the floor of the Senate, I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to take a hard look at what we are doing, what \nwe are trying to do, to make some progress toward bringing a unilateral \nsanctions policy into a world that is relevant with the borderless \nchallenges of our time. I believe we do protect the national interests \nof this country, that we sacrifice none of the national interests on \nbehalf of American agriculture. In fact, this amendment accomplishes \nboth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am struck with some of the inconsistencies within this \namendment. I appreciate my colleague's elucidation as to their \nsignificance.\n  Under ``New Sanctions,'' it states:\n\n       . . .the President may not impose a unilateral agricultural \n     sanction or a unilateral medical sanction against a foreign \n     country or a foreign entity for any fiscal year, unless--\n\n  And there are certain exceptions. In terms of ``new sanctions,'' we \nare speaking as to presidentially imposed.\n  Under ``Existing Sanctions'' it says:\n\n       . . .with respect to any unilateral agricultural sanction \n     or unilateral medical sanction that is in effect as of the \n     date of enactment of this Act for any fiscal year. . . .\n\n  As my colleague knows, some of the sanctions that would be covered by \nthis\n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\nexisting sanctions language are congressionally imposed, not \npresidentially imposed.\n  The question I have is, Why make the distinction for new sanctions, \nthat they must be presidentially imposed, assumedly reserving to \nCongress the right to impose a new sanction? Yet with old existing \nsanctions, the amendment wipes out both those that were presidentially \nas well as those which had been sanctioned by action of Congress. What \nis the rationale?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I will yield to Senator Ashcroft. That is in his part of \nthe bill. Our two bills were melded together.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I respond to the question of the Senator from \nFlorida?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Florida for his question.\n  This bill is to harmonize the regime of potential sanctions and \nbasically requires an agreement by the President and the Congress for \nany unilateral sanction that would be expressed by this country against \nexporting agricultural or medicinal commodities to other countries.\n  This results in having to come back to reestablish any existing \nsanctions, and that has been considered in the drafting of this bill. \nThis bill is not to go into effect for 180 days after it is signed by \nthe President, to give time for the consideration of any sanctions that \nexist in the measure, and if the President and Congress agree that \nthere are additional sanctions to be levied unilaterally against any of \nthese countries, then those can in fact be achieved.\n  The intention of the bill is to give the Congress and the President \nthe ability to so agree on those issues.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To continue my question, I don't think that was quite \nresponsive to the issue I am raising.\n  In the Senator's opening statement, the principal argument was that \nwe should not allow the President to unilaterally be imposing these \nsanctions, and in terms of new sanctions as outlined on page 4, you \nclearly restrict the application by the President of the prohibition to \nthose that are unilateral.\n  As it relates to existing sanctions, this language appears to sweep \nup both sanctions that were unilaterally imposed by the President, such \nas the one against Sudan last year, as well as those that were imposed \nby action of Congress, such as the legislation that bears the name of \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee which was adopted some \ntime ago. That was an action which had the support of the Senate, the \nHouse of Representatives, and was signed into law by the President of \nthe United States.\n  Who else does the Senator want to have sanctioned in order to be an \neffective statement of policy of the United States of America?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in response to the inquiry of the \nSenator from Florida, it is clear that the intent of this bill and the \nlanguage which would be carried forward is that sanctions should be the \njoint agreement between the Congress and the President. This bill does \nset aside existing sanctions and establish a singular regime in which \nsanctions would exist unless another bill or enactment changed that.\n  Now, a Congress in the future could impose, with the agreement of \nsanctions, sanctions in a regime that was contradictory to this bill \nbecause Congress always has the capacity to change the law. One law we \npass today doesn't bind future Congresses from changing that law and \nfuture enactments.\n  I think the Senator from Florida is correct that this measure sets \naside existing sanctions and requires that future sanctions, be they \ninitiated by the Congress or by the President of the United States, \ninvolve an agreement between the executive and the legislative \nbranches. There is a timeframe during which that is to happen provided \nfor in this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Continuing with the questions, would the Senator from \nMissouri be amenable to a modification of this amendment to make the \nexisting sanctions provision on page 5 consistent with the new \nsanctions standards on page 4?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am willing to consider and would like \nto have an opportunity to discuss that. I am pleased during the course \nof the debate this evening to see if something can be worked out. If \nthe Senator from Florida believes there is progress to be made in \naddressing that, we would be pleased to talk about those issues.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could move to another provision, which is beginning \nat line 12, we have the ``Countries Supporting International \nTerrorism'' section, which reads:\n\n       This subsection shall not affect the current prohibitions \n     on providing, to the government of any country supporting \n     international terrorism, United States government assistance, \n     including United States foreign assistance, United States \n     export assistance, or any United States credits or credit \n     guarantees.\n\n  What is missing from that set of prohibitions is prohibitions against \ndirect, unaided commercial sales. As I gather from the Senator's \nearlier presentation of this amendment, it is his intention that a \nnonassisted commercial sale between a U.S. entity and one of these \nterrorist states would be acceptable, i.e., would not be subject to \ncontinued prohibitions?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is our intention, absent an agreement by the \nPresident of the United States and the Congress, to so embargo such \nsales. Such entities would be able to use their hard currency to buy \nfrom American producers, agricultural or medicinal products. Our \nunderlying reasoning for that is that when these governments invest in \nsoybeans or corn or rice or wheat, they are not buying explosives; they \nare not repressing their population. As a matter of fact, if we could \nget them to use all of their currency to buy American farm products \ninstead of buying the capacity to repress their own people or \ndestabilize other parts of the world, we want them to do that. The \nconspicuous absence here, obviously, is we will not provide credit for \nthem which would release them to spend their hard currency in these \ncounterproductive ways.\n  So the philosophy of this measure is such that we think any time \nthese people will spend money on food and medicine, they are not \nspending their resources on other things which are much more \nthreatening, not only to the United States but to the community of \nnations at large.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The concern I have is that what essentially we have, or \nwhat the Senator proposes to do--I hope we do not follow this \nsuggestion--is to say, if you are a sufficiently rich terrorist state, \nyou can afford to buy the products without any of the credit or other \nassistance that is often available in those transactions. If you are \nrich enough to be able to make the purchase without depending upon \nthat, then these prohibitions that are currently in place--by action of \nthe Congress or action of the President or, in the case of several of \nthese, by action of both the Congress and the President--will not \napply. But if you are a poor terrorist country and cannot afford to buy \nthe food unless you have one of these subsidies, then you are \nprohibited. Is it that a rich terrorist state gets a preference over a \npoor terrorist state?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. No, I do not think so. I really think what we are \nsaying is no matter how much money you have, if you are a terrorist \nstate we would rather have you spend that money on food and medicine \nthan we would have you spend that money on weaponry or destabilizing \nyour surrounding territory. No matter how much money you have or you do \nnot have, we are willing and pleased to have you spend that to acquire \nthings that will keep you from oppressing individuals.\n  I suppose you could argue rich terrorist states are going to be \nbetter off than poor terrorist states. I think that is something that \nexists independent of this particular proposal of this particular \namendment. Rich nations, be they good, bad or indifferent, generally \nare better off than poor ones. But I think it is pretty clear that we \ndo not have an intention of saying we are going to take a regime which \nis in power and we are going to sustain it by allowing it to displace \nwhat would otherwise be its purchases of food by providing credit so \nthey can then use their hard currency to buy arms or other things that \nwould be repressive.\n\n  Our intention is to make sure, if the money is spent, they spend it \non food and medicine to the extent we can have them do so.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is it a fair characterization of subsection 4 that \ncommercial\n\n[[Page S10108]]\n\nsales of food and medicine to a rich terrorist state are acceptable; \ni.e., would be exempt from the current licensing provisions but \nhumanitarian sales, that is, sales that qualify for one of the various \nforms of U.S. Government assistance to a poor terrorist state, would \ncontinue to be subject to those licensing requirements?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think one of the things we have sought to do in this \nlegislation is to indicate we are not at war with the people of many of \nthese regimes. As a matter of fact, these regimes are at war with their \npeople. Our intention is to be able to provide food and medicine to \nthose people because we are not at war with them. As a matter of fact, \ntoo frequently their government is.\n  That means we are willing to sell it to them. We are willing to sell \nit to nongovernmental organizations, to commercial organizations, even \nto governments, if the governments will put up the money for it. I find \nthat to be an acceptable indication that we are not against the people \nof these countries; we are against these countries' repressive, \nterrorist ways.\n  The terror is worse on their own people, in most of these cases. When \nwe align ourselves with the people, align ourselves with the population \nin terms of their food and in terms of their health care and in terms \nof their medicine, that is good foreign policy. It shows the United \nStates, while it will not endorse, fund or sustain, creditwise, a \nterrorist government, is not at war with people who happen to have to \nsustain the burden of living under a terrorist government.\n  So, yes, this allows people in those settings to make purchases if \nthey have the capacity to do so. But it does not allow the government \nto command the credit of the United States, and in our view it should \nnot.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So I think the answer to the question is yes. That raises \nthe question: I notice before the amendment was sent to the desk there \nwas a handwritten insertion in the title of the amendment. The original \ntitle had said, ``to promote adequate availability of food and medicine \nabroad by requiring congressional approval. . ..'' In the handwritten \ninsertion, the prepositional phrase was added so it now reads ``promote \nadequate availability of food and medicine for humanitarian assistance \nabroad by requiring congressional approval. . ..'' It seems actually \nthe substance of the amendment does quite the opposite of the \nprepositional phrase.\n  The substance of the amendment says if you are rich enough to be able \nto buy at commercial standards, you can avoid the necessity of \nlicensing and all of the constraints that have been imposed by action \nof Congress, action of the President, or both on terrorist states. But \nif you are a poor terrorist state and have been sanctioned by Congress \nor the President, or both, and would require some assistance in order \nto be able to get food, then you are still subject to all of these \nlicensing requirements.\n\n  So the actual substance of the amendment is inconsistent with the \nmodification that was made in the title. I suspect I know why that was \ndone.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Let me just say, if it is permissible for me to \nrespond, I thank the Senator from Florida for his careful questioning \nand the opportunity to make a response. I think this is a very \nconstructive way to handle this.\n  I do not think there is anything that is not humanitarian about \nallowing nongovernmental organizations, commercial organizations, to \nbuy food so people can eat. I think that is humanitarian. I do not find \nthat to be inconsistent with the title. I do not think in order to have \nthe character of being assistance and humanitarian, they have to be \ngifts or they have to be credit guarantees. The mere fact that \nAmericans would make possible the sale of vital medicinal supplies and \nvital food supplies in a world marketplace to people who are hungry and \npeople who need medicinal care is humanitarian.\n  We do make it possible for certain kinds of nongovernmental \norganizations and commercial organizations to get credit, but we simply \ndraw a line in extending credit to governments which have demonstrated \nthemselves to be unwilling to observe the rules of human decency and \nhave been perpetrators of international terrorism and propagators of \nthe instability that such terrorism promotes in the world community.\n  So it is with that in mind that we want people to be able to eat, \nunderstanding that the United States is not at war with the people of \nthe world but has very serious disagreements with terrorist \ngovernments. We want people to be able to get the right kind of \nmedicinal help, understanding that we are not at war with people who \nare unhealthy and who need help medicinally, and understanding that \nwhen people get that kind of help, and understand that the United \nStates is a part of it, it can be good foreign policy for the United \nStates.\n  But we do not believe that addressing the needs of the Government \nitself, especially allowing them to take their hard currency to buy \narms, by our providing them with credit guarantees for their purchase \nof foodstuffs, would be appropriate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the answers to the questions, \nand I think the summary of those answers is that we have established an \ninconsistent policy as between actions of the Congress relative to new \nsanctions and to existing sanctions.\n  Second, we have established a policy that, if you are a rich \nterrorist state and have the money to buy food at straight commercial \nstandards, you can do so; if you are a poor terrorist state that would \nrequire the access to some of these various trade assistance programs, \nthen you cannot buy American food.\n  I do not believe this is an amendment that, once fully understood, \nthe Members of the Senate will wish to be associated with.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Florida, \nMr. Mack.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair.\n  First, I want to address a point that was made a few moments ago, an \nargument that went something like this: If we were to open up our \nmarkets, that action would, in essence, allow terrorists or countries \nto buy more food products. I just think that is fundamentally wrong. I \nthink in fact they are buying all of the product that they can afford \nto buy now. And I would make the case that if they buy the product from \nus at a cheaper price because of it being subsidized, we are in fact \nsubsidizing terrorist states.\n  So I just fundamentally disagree with where the proponents of this \namendment are going.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MACK. Sure.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is it the Senator's belief that somehow all our \nagricultural products are subsidized; therefore, it would be cheaper \nthan the world market price?\n  Mr. MACK. Again, I say to my colleague who has raised this question \nthat I do find it strange that at just the time when Members are coming \nto the floor and asking the American taxpayer to come to the aid of the \nAmerican farmer, they are at the same time asking us to lift sanctions \nto allow them to sell products to terrorist states.\n  I think, in fact, there is a connection between what is happening \ntoday--that is, some $6-$7 billion, depending on what this bill finally \nturns out to produce, $8-$9 billion in aid to American farmers, just \nafter a few months ago with the additional aid to the American farmer--\nthat you would find it appropriate to say to the American taxpayer: Now \nthat you have given us this aid, we would like to have permission to \nsell our product to terrorist countries. I just find that \nunsupportable.\n  I thank the Senator for raising the question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is not the question I raise. But if I may ask, the \nSenator's answer, then, is that he thinks what we are talking about in \ndisaster assistance to farmers in this aid is a subsidy that would \nallow us to sell below world market prices, and that is why we will not \ndo that?\n  Mr. MACK. It clearly is a subsidy to the American farmer. What kind \nof effect it will have on the world price I do not think I am qualified \nto say. But it seems to me it is clear that if in fact there is a \nsubsidy being received by the American farmer, that farmer could sell \nthe product at a lower price.\n\n[[Page S10109]]\n\n  I thank the Senator for his question.\n  Mr. President, I oppose trade with tyrants and dictators, and I \nemphatically oppose subsidized trade with terrorist states. Again, make \nno mistake, that is exactly what this amendment does. Specifically, \nwith my colleagues from Florida, New Jersey, and the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we oppose the amendment to \nprevent any action by this body to limit the President of the United \nStates' ability to impose sanctions on terrorist states.\n  We had a similar vote last year, in which 67 Senators voted to oppose \ntrade with terrorists. At the risk of stating the obvious, let me try \nto explain once again why the Senate should not change this position.\n  Freedom is not free. I know my colleagues understand this simple \naxiom--this self-evident truth. But today we hear from our colleagues \nthat the farmers of our Nation are undergoing a difficult time. So \ntoday, they have put before us a fundamental question: Does this great \nNation, the United States of America, support freedom, or do we support \nterror?\n  A few weeks ago, as I was preparing a statement on another issue, I \ncame across a letter from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In \nthis letter the Dalai Lama says, and I quote, ``America's real strength \ncomes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and \nprinciples on which it was founded.''\n  How may times have my colleagues been with me when a visiting head of \nstate delivered to us the same message as the Dalai Lama's? I will \nprovide one example.\n  Last summer, the President of Romania addressed a joint session of \nCongress. He began his remarks by reminding us that Romania considered \nthe United States the country of freedom and the guardian of \nfundamental human rights all over the world. He went on to say:\n\n       Throughout its history, your country has been a beacon of \n     hope for the oppressed and the needy, a source of inspiration \n     for the creative, the courageous and the achieving. It has \n     always been, and may it ever remain, the land of the free and \n     the home of the brave.\n\n  We are a nation founded on principles--the principles of freedom, \nliberty, and the respect for human dignity. And our commitment to these \nprinciples gives us our real strength today. It is that simple.\n  I began this statement by posing a question on freedom versus terror. \nWe know, even take for granted, the answer to that question--the United \nStates opposes terror. But what about the strength or our commitment to \nthese principles? On occasion, a short-term crisis can blind us--cause \nus to lose sight of our values and their importance to who we are and \nfrom where we derive our strength.\n  Today's debate typifies one such moment. The poster which has been \nshown on this floor indicates the issue before us with respect to \nterrorist nations and their leaders--Qadhafi, Castro, and others.\n  In exchange for very limited market expansion, some would take away \nthe President's authority to restrict trade with six terrorist \nregimes--six countries whose combined markets represent a mere 1.7 \npercent of global agricultural imports; yet these minor importers \nperpetrate or harbor those who commit the world's greatest acts of \nterror.\n  Some would have us open trade in agricultural products with these \nterrorists--in effect placing our principles up for sale. So what is \nthe strength of our commitment to these principles? If we are to choose \nfreedom over terror, what price should we expect to pay? There can be \nno doubt in anyone's mind the value of our commitment to freedom \ncertainly exceeds the U.S. share of 1.7 percent of the world's \nagriculture market.\n  But for those who may actually find this less clear than I do, it \ngets easier. The request by those who wish to trade with terrorists \ngets more extreme. With this amendment to language providing subsidies \nof U.S. agriculture, we are in effect being asked to subsidize global \nterrorism. The supporters of this amendment are asking the taxpayers of \nthe United States to subsidize American farmers, who will then sell to \nterrorist states.\n  The United States must not subsidize terrorist regimes. I find it \nunconscionable that we would even consider such a proposal. When two \ncountries engage in a trade, even if just one commodity is being \nexported, both countries benefit from the exchange. So by opening \nagriculture exports to Iran, Sudan, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea, \nwe are offering direct support to the regimes in power. If they chose \nto purchase from the United States, they would be doing so because they \nsee it as being in their best interest. Their benefit would be greater \nin this case because the products sold to terrorists would be \nsubsidized by the U.S. taxpayer.\n  Terrorism poses a direct threat to the United States. The terrorist \nthreat was considerable during the cold war when the Soviet Union and \nits allies often backed movements or governments that justified the use \nof terror. The threat is even greater today, when chemical or \nbiological weapons, no bigger than a suitcase, can bring death and \ndevastation to tens of thousands of people. The deaths in the World \nTrade Center bombing or in Pan Am 103 remind of us what terrorism can \nproduce. Another important reminder is the image of American \nhumanitarian aircraft being blown out of the sky by Cuban Air Force MiG \nfighters in the Florida Straits. We are moving from a world where \nterrorists use dynamite or rifles to one where they may use a weapon of \nmass destruction. The world today is more dangerous in many ways than \nit was 10 years ago, and the form of that danger is terrorism, which \nmakes it even more dangerous for the United States to engage in trade \nwith terrorist states.\n\n  So where does this leave us? With this simple principle--the United \nStates must not trade with any nation that supports terrorism in any \nway, direct or indirect. We must insist that there can be no business-\nas-usual approach to nations that threaten our national security and \nnational interests. We are well aware of the counterarguments. If we \ndon't sell, some other country will, so what is the point? Or why not \nsell food? You can't turn wheat into a bomb, can you? Well, maybe not, \nbut it is possible for a government that supports terror to use our \nfood exports to win popular support, and it is possible to use the \nmoney saved by purchasing subsidized American goods for yet more \nterror.\n  We can all agree that the United States must stand for freedom and \nagainst terror, and I hope the strength of our commitment to this \nprincipled stand runs deep. Today we are being asked how deeply are we \ncommitted to opposing terrorism. Make no mistake, our principles \nprovide the real source of America's strength. If we are serious about \nbattling terrorism, there can be no compromise with terror and no trade \nwith terrorist nations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of Senator Ashcroft's \namendment, of which I am a cosponsor. Before getting into the specifics \nof Senator Ashcroft's amendment, I want to lay the table a little bit \nby describing what I have heard in the agricultural community in my \nState and to talk for a moment about a farm rally that I attended last \nSaturday in Plainfield, IL. At that rally, which was held on the \nSchultz farm in Plainfield, IL, there were more than 500 farmers, not \njust from Illinois but from all over the country. There were farmers \nfrom as far away as Washington State and from Oklahoma and from the \nSouthern and Eastern States as well.\n  The one message I heard, talking to the farmers, not just those from \nIllinois but those from all across the country, was that there is a \nsevere crisis in agriculture right now. Crop prices are at almost \nrecord low levels, if you consider the effects of inflation. The prices \nare low not just for corn and soybeans but also for hogs and wheat, and \nthe list goes on.\n  On top of that, we are seeing a trade situation now in which the \ncountries in the European Union, to whom we used to export large \namounts of our grain and livestock products, are, with increasing \nfrequency, raising not just tariff barriers to the importation of \nAmerican agricultural goods but also\n\n[[Page S10110]]\n\nnontariff barriers, pseudoscientific trade barriers, objections to the \nsafety of our food, objections for which very few in the scientific \ncommunity have said there is any basis.\n  Also we have seen a slump in the economy in Asia. The near depression \nin Asia in the last year has caused a severe drop-off in the amount \nthey are importing from the United States and from our farmers in this \ncountry. On top of that, as was said earlier today, some parts of our \ncountry are experiencing drought, other parts floods. Farmers have \ncomplaints, as we all know, about the tax code and its consequences \nthat are particularly felt by family farmers who can't deduct health \ninsurance, for example, who have a very hard time meeting the \nobligations of the death tax, which taxes their family farms at 55 and, \nin some cases, 60 percent of their value when a farmer dies.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Cochran and the Agriculture \nAppropriations Committee have come up with some short-term relief that \nI think most of us agree is needed. I think Senator Cochran's bill will \nbe adequate to meet the challenges we now have in the short term.\n  I am concerned that we not just address the short term, Mr. \nPresident. I think it is very important that we think about long-term \nsolutions for the farm crisis in this country so that we don't have to \ncome back every year and face ongoing crises year after year. Perhaps \nthe best thing we can do for the long-term survival and success of our \nAmerican farmers is to improve the trade climate.\n  Several years ago, we passed the Freedom to Farm Act. The farmers in \nmy State of Illinois frequently say: You gave us the freedom to farm, \nbut you didn't give us the freedom to trade. What good is that freedom \nto farm, that freedom to plant all the acres we wish, if we don't have \nthe freedom to sell our products abroad as we need?\n  So I think it is very important that we work on a variety of fronts \nin the trade area. I favor fast track trade negotiating authority for \nour President. I think that normal trade relations with China would \nhelp our farmers. Accession of China into the WTO would be helpful. \nAgriculture needs a seat at the trade table next fall in the \nnegotiations for the Seattle round of the multilateral trade \nnegotiations. We need to have representatives from the USDA right there \nwith Charlene Barshefsky when we are negotiating trade issues next \nfall. We also need strong enforcement of WTO trade disputes and, of \ncourse, open access for our GMO food products in Europe.\n  One step toward improving the trade climate for our Nation's farmers \nis the pending amendment that Senator Ashcroft and I and a number of my \ncolleagues have cosponsored. I am rising today to support that \namendment to exempt food and medicine from unilateral sanctions. \nUnilateral sanctions on food and agricultural products clearly hurt \nAmerican agriculture more than anyone else. The target country simply \nbuys its food from some other country, leaving less money in our \nfarmers' pockets. When the U.S. Government decides to sanction food and \nagriculture, it simply tells our international competitors to produce \nmore to meet the excess international demand. Once American agriculture \nloses these markets to our foreign competitors, our reputation then as \na reliable supplier is tarnished, making it difficult for us to regain \nthese markets for future sales.\n  Our agricultural trade surplus totaled $272 billion just 3 years ago \nin 1996. But this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects \nthat our ag trade surplus will have dwindled to approximately $12 \nbillion. Reversing this downward trend in the value of our exports \nthrough effective sanctions policy reform should be a top priority of \nthis Congress. America's farmers demand it and they deserve it. We \nshould be responsive.\n\n  The current slump in commodity prices makes significant sanctions \npolicy reform even more timely and necessary. In fact, recent estimates \ncalculate the cost of U.S. sanctions at $15 to $19 billion annually. \nThese potential sales could give a significant boost to our rural \neconomy, if only they were allowed by the Federal Government. Free and \nopen international markets are vital to my home State. Illinois' farm \nproducts sales generate $9 billion annually, and Illinois ranks third \nin this country in agricultural exports.\n  In fiscal year 1997 alone, Illinois agricultural exports totaled $3.7 \nbillion and created 57,000 jobs for the State of Illinois. Needless to \nsay, agriculture makes up a significant portion of my State's economy, \nand a healthy export market for these products is important to all my \nconstituents. For this reason, I am proud to cosponsor Senator \nAshcroft's amendment.\n  The amendment simply exempts food and medicine from unilateral \nsanctions, unless the President submits a report to Congress requesting \nthat agriculture be sanctioned and the Congress approves the request by \njoint resolution. With commodity prices where they are, and with the \nSeattle round of trade negotiations looming on the horizon, we must act \nquickly to unbridle the farm economy from the tight reins of current \nU.S. sanctions policy.\n  Mr. President, I note that Senator Ashcroft has crafted this \namendment so that there are escape hatches that, in severe cases, the \nPresident, working with Congress, can, if he absolutely believes it \nnecessary, go forward and maintain sanctions in a particular case and \nperhaps, in some cases, we in Congress will deem that advisable.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kim Alexander \nbe granted floor privileges during the consideration of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft. I have listened to \nthe arguments of both sides to this point and have found them \ninteresting. I certainly join Senator Fitzgerald in noting that \nIllinois is a great agricultural State. I have visited that State \nregularly over the past several months, including most recently on \nMonday, in Lincoln, IL, meeting with farmers who are, in fact, \nsuffering from perhaps one of the worst price depressions that they \nhave witnessed in decades. They need help. That is why the underlying \nbill, the Agriculture appropriations bill, and the emergency bill that \nis part of it, is so important.\n  It has been portrayed during the course of this debate that \naddressing the question of unilateral sanctions involving food and \nmedicine exports from the United States will be of some assistance to \nthe farmers. I think that is possible. But I have to concede that the \ncountries we are talking about are generally so small as to not have a \nmajor impact on the agricultural exports of the United States.\n  I believe the Senator from New Jersey, who opposes this amendment, \nmentioned that we are talking about a potential export of 1.7 percent \nof our entire agricultural export budget. That is not the kind of \ninfusion of purchasing in our agricultural economy that will turn it \naround. So I don't believe this amendment, in and of itself, is a major \nagricultural amendment, although it clearly will have some impact on \nagriculture. But I do believe it stands for a proposition that is worth \nsupporting. Let me tell you why.\n\n  First, I believe that we have learned over the course of recent \nhistory that unilateral sanctions by the United States just don't work. \nWhen we decide on our own to impose sanctions on a country, it is \nusually because we are unhappy with their conduct, so we will stop \ntrade or impose some sort of embargo to show our displeasure. You can \nunderstand that because some of the actions we have responded to were \nhorrendous and heinous. The bombings of embassies and other terrorist \nacts raise the anger of the American people, and through their elected \nrepresentatives, we respond with sanctions. That is understandable, and \nit is a natural human and political reaction.\n  I think we would have to concede that over time those unilateral \nsanctions have very little impact on the targeted country. In the time \nI have served on Capitol Hill, for about 17\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\nyears, I can only think of one instance where the imposition of \nsanctions had the desired result, and that, of course, was in the case \nof South Africa. It was not a unilateral sanction by the United States. \nWe were involved in multilateral sanctions with other countries against \nthe apartheid regime in South Africa, and we were successful in \nchanging that regime.\n  But as you look back at the other countries we have imposed \nunilateral sanctions on, with the United States standing alone, you can \nhardly point to similar positive results. So I think we have learned a \nlesson well that merely imposing those sanctions alone seldom \naccomplishes the goals that we seek.\n  I do note, in reviewing this amendment by Senator Ashcroft, as has \nbeen noted by others, he makes allowances for the United States to \ncontinue to impose unilateral sanctions under specific situations. Of \ncourse, if there is a declaration of war, and certainly if the \nPresident comes to Congress and asks that we impose sanctions for \nproducts which may in and of themselves be dangerous, such as high \ntechnology and the like, products which have been identified by the \nDepartment of Commerce as being dangerous to America's best interests.\n  I applaud the Senator from Missouri for making those provisions. It \ngives any administration the wherewithal to impose unilateral sanctions \nin extraordinary cases. But I understand this amendment to suggest that \nif we are not dealing with extraordinary cases, we should basically be \nwilling to sell food and medicine to countries around the world.\n  I have found it interesting that my colleagues who oppose this \namendment have come to the floor to describe these potential trading \npartners as tyrants, dictators, and terrorist states. One of the \nSenators came to the floor with graphic presentations of some of the \ndictators in these countries. Not a single person on the floor this \nevening would make any allowance for the terrible conduct by some of \nthese terrorist regimes. But I must remind my colleagues during the \ncourse of this debate that, after World War II, we were engaged in a \ncold war that went on for almost five decades, which involved the \nSoviet Union and China. During that cold war, some terrible things \noccurred involving those countries and the United States.\n  We expended trillions of dollars defending against the Soviet Union \nand trying to stop the expansion of communism. We decided they were our \nmajor target, and so many debates in the Senate and in the House were \npredicated on whether or not we were stopping, or in any way aiding, \nthe growth of communism.\n  Despite this cold war's intensity, which more or less monopolized \nforeign relations in the United States for half of this century, we \nfound ourselves during that same period of time trading and selling \nfood to Russia, the Soviet Union, and selling foodstuffs to China and \nother countries. I guess we adopted the premise that former Senator \nHubert Humphrey used to say should guide us when it comes to this \neconomy. We asked him whether he would sell food to the Communists and \nhe said, ``I will sell them anything they can't shoot back at me.'' I \nthink it was a practical viewpoint that, when it gets down to it, we \nare not the sole suppliers of food in the world. For us to cut off food \nsupplies to any given country is no guarantee they will starve. In \nfact, they can turn to other resources.\n  So those who would say to us we should impose unilateral sanctions on \na country such as Cuba, I think, have forgotten the lesson of history \nthat, not that long ago, we were selling wheat to Russia at a time when \nwe were at the height of the cold war. I think that is a lesson in \nhistory to be remembered.\n  The second question is whether or not we should, as a policy, exempt \nfood and medicine when it comes to any sanctions. I believe that is the \ngravamen of the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. I think \nhe is right. I say to those who believe that by imposing unilateral \nsanctions involving the sale of food and medicine from the United \nStates on these dictatorial regimes we will have some impact, please \ntake a look at the pictures of the dictators that you presented for us \nto view this evening.\n  Now, I have been watching Mr. Castro in the media for over 40 years \nand I don't see him thin and emaciated or malnourished. He seems to be \nfinding food somewhere, as do many other people in states where we have \nour differences. But I do suspect that when you get closer to the real \npeople in these countries, you will find they are the ones who are \ndisadvantaged by these sanctions on food and medicine.\n  Let me tell you, there was a report issued 2 years ago by the \nAmerican Association for World Health, ``Denial of Food and Medicine: \nThe Impact of the U.S. Embargo on Health and Nutrition in Cuba.'' It \nconcluded that:\n\n       The U.S. embargo of Cuba has dramatically harmed the health \n     and nutrition of large numbers of ordinary Cubans.\n\n  The report went on to say:\n\n       The declining availability of foodstuffs, medicines, and \n     such basic medical supplies as replacement parts for 30-year-\n     old x-ray machines is taking a tragic human toll. The embargo \n     has closed so many windows that, in some instances, Cuban \n     physicians have found it impossible to obtain life-saving \n     machines from any source under any circumstances. Patients \n     have died.\n\n  I quote from a letter I received from Bishop William Purcell from the \nDiocese of Chicago who told me his experience in visiting villages.\n  He said:\n\n       I was especially struck by the impact of the American \n     embargo on people's health. We saw huge boxes of expired bill \n     samples in a hospital. Other than those, the shelves of the \n     pharmacy were almost bare. We talked with patients waiting \n     for surgeons who could not be operated upon because their X \n     ray machines from Germany had broken down. A woman was \n     choking from asthma from lack of inhaler.\n\n  I hope you will pay particular attention to this. The bishop says:\n\n       At the AIDS center, plastic gloves had been washed and hung \n     on a line to dry for reuse. The examples of people directly \n     suffering from the impact of our government's policy after \n     all of these years was sad and embarrassing to see.\n\n  That was in the letter he sent to me. But many other religious groups \nin the United States have reached the same conclusion. The U.S. \nCatholic Conference and others have termed our policy with Cuba \n``morally unacceptable.''\n  I don't come to the floor today to in any way apologize or defend the \npolicies of Fidel Castro in Cuba or for shooting the plane down in \n1997. That was a savage, barbaric act. No excuse can be made for that \ntype of conduct. But when we try to focus on stopping the conduct of \nleaders such as Castro by imposing sanctions that embargo food and \nmedicine, I don't think we strike at the heart of the leadership of \nthese countries. Instead, we strike at poor people--poor people who \ncontinue to suffer.\n  Many folks on this floor will remember the debate just a few weeks \nago when we were shocked to learn that India and Pakistan had detonated \nnuclear devices. This was a dramatic change in the balance of power in \nthe world, with two new entries in the nuclear club. Countries which we \nsuspected were developing nuclear weapons had in fact detonated them to \nindicate that our fears were real.\n  Under existing law, we could have imposed sanctions on India and \nPakistan at that time to show our displeasure. We did not. We made a \nconscious decision to vote in the Senate not to do that. We concluded, \neven at the risk of nuclear war in the subcontinent, that it was not in \nour best interests or smart foreign policy to impose these sanctions.\n  So you have to ask yourself, why do we continue to cling to this \nconcept when it comes to Cuba, that after some 40 years this is the way \nwe are going to change the Cuban regime?\n  I think the way to change the regime in Cuba and many other countries \nhas been demonstrated clearly over the last decade. Think about the \nBerlin Wall coming down and the end of communism in Eastern Europe. It \nhad as much to do with the fact that we opened up these countries after \nyears of isolation. Finally, these countries saw what the rest of the \nworld had to offer. They understood better what lifestyle and quality \nof life meant in the Western part of the world, and when they compared \nthat to the Communist regime, they started racing for democracy.\n  That, to me, is an indication of what would also happen in Cuba. If \nwe start opening up trade in food and medicine\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\nand other relations with that country, I predict that we would have \nmuch more success in bringing down an objectionable regime than \nanything we have done over the past four decades.\n  We have learned the lesson from the cold war. We know you cannot \nbring a country to its knees by denying export of food and medicine. We \nshould also know that the best way to end dictatorial and totalitarian \nregimes is to open trade, open commerce, and open channels of \ncommunication.\n  The amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Missouri is \nan attempt to address not only the agricultural crisis that faces \nAmerica but, from my point of view, a much more sensible approach to a \nforeign policy goal which all Americans share.\n  Let us find ways to punish the terrorists and punish those guilty of \nwrongdoing. But let us not do it at the expense of innocent people, \nwhether they are farmers in the United States or populations overseas \nwhich are the unwitting pawns in this foreign policy game.\n  I support this amendment. I hope my colleagues will join in that \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I join with my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, and others in urging the \nadoption of this amendment with respect to exempting exports of food \nand medicine from U.S. sanctions regimes.\n  Mr. President this amendment is quick, simple, and straight forward--\nit would exempt donations and sales of food, other agricultural \ncommodities, medicines and medical equipment from being used as an \neconomic weapon in conjunction with the imposition of unilaterally \nimposed economic sanctions.\n  Since last year, we have heard about the serious economic crisis that \nconfronts America's heartland and is bankrupting American farm \nfamilies. Not only do American farm families have to worry about \nweather and other natural disasters which threaten their livelihood. \nThey also must worry about actions of their own government which can do \nirreparable harm to the farm economy by closing off markets to American \nfarm products because we happen to dislike some foreign government \nofficial or some policy action that has been taken. Time and time again \nunilateral sanctions on agricultural products have cost American \nfarmers important export markets. Time and time again the offending \nofficial remains in power or the offensive policy remains in effect.\n  On July 23 of last year, President Clinton stated that ``food should \nnot be used as a tool of foreign policy except under the most \ncompelling circumstances.'' On April 28 of this year, the Clinton \nAdministration took some long overdue steps toward bringing U.S. \npractice in this area into conformity with the President's \npronouncement. It announced that it would reverse existing U.S. policy \nof prohibiting sales of food and medicine to Iran, Libya, and Sudan--\nthree countries currently on the terrorism list.\n  In announcing the change in policy, Under Secretary of State Stuart \nEizenstat stated that President Clinton had approved the policy after a \ntwo-year review concluded that the sale of food and medicine ``doesn't \nencourage a nation's military capability or its ability to support \nterrorism.''\n  I am gratified that the administration has finally recognized what we \ndetermined some time ago, namely that ``sales of food, medicine and \nother human necessities do not generally enhance a nation's military \ncapacities or support terrorism.'' On the contrary, funds spent on \nagricultural commodities and products are not available for other, less \ndesirable uses.\n  Regrettably, the Administration did not include Cuba in its announced \npolicy changes. It seems to me terribly inconsistent to say that it is \nwrong to deny the children of Iran, Sudan and Libya access to food and \nmedicine, but it is all right to deny Cuban children--living ninety \nmiles from our shores, similar access. The administration's rationale \nfor not including Cuba was rather confused. The best I can discern from \nthe conflicting rationale for not including Cuba in the announced \npolicy changes was that policy toward Cuba has been established by \nlegislation rather than executive order, and therefore should be \nchanged through legislative action.\n  I disagree with that judgement. However, in order to facilitate the \nlifting of such restrictions on such sales to Cuba, and to prevent such \nsanctions from being introduced against other countries in the future, \nI have joined with Senators Ashcroft, Hagel, Roberts, Leahy and others \nin offering the amendment that is currently pending. Not only would it \ncodify in law the administration's decision with respect to Iran, \nLibya, and Sudan, it would also create a politically viable way for \nsuch sanctions to be lifted from Cuba, unless the President and the \nCongress both take the affirmative step of acting to keep them in \nplace.\n  What about those who say that it is already possible to sell food and \nmedicine to Cuba? To those people I would say, ``if that is what you \nthink, then you should have no problem supporting this legislation.''\n  However, I must tell you, Mr. President, that the people who say that \nare not members of the U.S. agricultural or pharmaceutical industries. \nAsk any representative of a major drug or grain company about selling \nto Cuba and they will tell you it is virtually impossible.\n  The Administration's own statistics speak for themselves. Department \nof Commerce licensing statistics prove our point:\n  Between 1992 and mid-1997, the Commerce Department approved only 28 \nlicenses for such sales, valued at less than $1 million, for the entire \nperiod. In 1998, following the introduction of procedures to ``expedite \nlicense reviews'' Commerce reported that, three licenses valued at $19 \nmillion were approved, however no exports occurred because of \ndifficulties with on-site verification requirements.\n  Even if these three exports had occurred, the assistance being \nprovided to the Cuban people would be minuscule. To give you some \nperspective: prior to the passage of the 1992 Cuba Democracy Act which \nshut down U.S. food and medicine exports, Cuba was importing roughly \n$700 million of such products on an annual basis from U.S. \nsubsidiaries.\n\n  Moreover, since Commerce Department officials do not follow up on \nwhether proposed licenses culminate in actual sales, the high water \nmark for the export of U.S. medicines to Cuba over a four and one half \nyear period doesn't even represent roughly .1% of the exports of U.S. \nfood and medicines that took place prior to 1992.\n  For these reasons we feel strongly that the complexities of the U.S. \nlicensing process, coupled with on-site verification requirements, \nserve as de facto prohibitions on U.S. pharmaceutical companies doing \nbusiness with Cuba. Do we really believe that aspirin or bandaid are \npossible instruments of torture that mandate the U.S. companies have in \nplace a costly on-site verification mechanism to monitor how each \nbottle of aspirin is dispensed?\n  I cannot come up with a rationale for arguing that we are on strong \nmoral grounds in barring access to American medicines and medical \nequipment. American pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment \nmanufacturers are dominant in the international market place with \nrespect to development and production of state of the art medicines and \nequipment. In some cases there are no other foreign suppliers that make \ncomparable products--particularly in the case of the most life \nthreatening diseases such as cancer.\n  How can we justify denying innocent people access to drugs that could \nsave them or their children's lives. How can we justify prohibiting \naccess to vaccines that ensure the protection of the public health of \nan entire country or large segments thereof, simply because we disagree \nwith their government leaders? I don't believe we should.\n  Food sales to Cuba continue to be prohibited as well, despite the so \ncalled January measures promulgated by the Clinton Administration. At \nthat time, the outright prohibition on the sale of food was modified to \nprovide a narrow exception to that prohibition. With the change in \nregulations, the Commerce Department will now consider licensing, on a \ncase-by-case basis, sales of food ``to independent non-government \nentities in Cuba, including religious groups, private farmers and \nprivate sector enterprises such as restaurants.''\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\n  For those of my colleagues who have any knowledge about the Cuban \neconomy they will immediately know that this translates into virtually \nzero sales of food to Cuba. Yes, there are some private restaurants in \nCuba--so called paladares--but they are run out of family homes serving \nat most ten to twelve people at lunch and dinner on a daily basis. \nThese small operations are hardly in any position logistically or \nfinancially to contract with foreign exporters, navigate U.S. and Cuban \ncustoms in order to arrange for U.S. shipments to be delivered to their \nrestaurants--shipments that are otherwise barred to the Cuban \ngovernment. Who are we kidding when we say it is possible to sell food \nin the current regulatory environment.\n  I don't believe except in the most limited of circumstances that we \nshould deny food and medicine to anyone. I take strong exception to \nargument that we are doing it for the good of the Cuban people or the \nLibyan people--that we are putting pressure on authorities to respect \nhuman rights in doing so.\n  The highly respected human rights organization, Human Rights Watch--a \nsevere critic of the Cuban government's human rights practices--\nrecently concluded, that the ``(U.S.) embargo has not only failed to \nbring about human rights improvements in Cuba,'' it has actually \n``become counterproductive'' to achieving that goal.\n  America is not about denying medicine or food to the people in Sudan, \nin Libya, or in Iran, and it shouldn't be about denying food and \nmedicine to the Cuban people either, certainly not my America.\n  Let me be clear--I am not defending the Cuban government for its \nhuman rights practices or some of its other policy decisions. I believe \nthat we should speak out strongly on such matters as respect for human \nrights and the treatment of political dissidents. But U.S. policy with \nrespect to Cuba goes far beyond that--it denies eleven million innocent \nCuban men, women and children access to U.S. food and medicine.\n  That is why I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and \nrestrict future efforts to water down its scope.\n  The United States stands alone among all of the nations of the world \nas an advocate for respecting the human rights of all peoples \nthroughout the globe. In my view denying access to food and medicine is \na violation of international recognized human rights and weakens the \nability of the United States to advocate what is otherwise a very \nprincipled position on this issue. It is time to return U.S. policy to \nthe moral high ground.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, \nand Senator Hagel, Senator Fitzgerald, Senator Craig, Senator Lincoln, \nSenator Conrad, Senator Brownback, the Presiding Officer, Senator \nWarner, and all of the others who are cosponsors of this amendment.\n  It is a very solid, thoughtful, precise amendment that principally, \nof course, allows us to be involved as a legislative branch if \nunilateral sanctions are going to be imposed. That is not a radical \nidea. We have seen the effects of the importance and the significance \nof unilateral sanctions.\n  Certainly those who represent the farm community can speak not just \ntheoretically about this but in practice as to the damage that can be \ndone. It certainly is hard enough to have to face weather conditions, \ndrought, and floods. But when you have to also face unilateral \ndecisions that deny your community the opportunity to market in certain \nareas, that can make the life of a farm family even more difficult.\n  I happen to agree with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nand others who have made the case that if we are truly interested in \ncreating change, it is not in the interest of our own Nation to take \nactions which would deny innocent people--be they the 11 million \ninnocent people who live 90 miles off our shore in Cuba, or in other \nnations--the opportunity to benefit from the sale of medicine and food \nsupplies that can improve the quality of their life.\n  It is radical, in my view, to impose that kind of a sanction, \nparticularly unilaterally. That is not my America. My America says we \nwill do everything we can to get rid of dictators and to change \ngovernments which deny their people basic rights. But my America \ndoesn't say to the innocents who live in these countries that if we \nhave food that can make you stronger, if we have medicine that can make \nyou healthier, we are going to deny the opportunity for the average \ncitizens of these countries to have access to these products through \nsale. That is not my America.\n  I live in a bigger, a larger country, which has stood as a symbol of \nunderstanding, of human decency, and of human kindness, even with \nadversaries that have taken the lives of our fellow citizens--in a \nVietnam, in a Germany, in other nations around the globe. My America, a \nbig America, at the end of those conflicts has reached out to people in \nthese nations to get them back on their feet again.\n  Today, I say to you that in these countries around the globe that \nstill, unfortunately and regretfully, use the power of their \ninstitutions to impose human rights violations, we will do everything \nin our power to change these governments but we will not deny these \npeople food and we will not deny them medicines through sale.\n  That is what Senator Ashcroft, Senator Hagel, and others are trying \nto achieve. I think it is a noble cause and one we ought to bring \nDemocrats and Republicans together on in common effort and in common \npurpose to change the system that is fundamentally wrong and a denial \nof the fundamental things that we stand for as a people.\n  That does not suggest in any way that we applaud, or agree with, or \nback, or in any way want to sustain the policies of Fidel Castro, or \nthe leader of Sudan, or Iran, or Lybia. It says that when unilateral \nsanctions are being imposed, we ought to have some say in all of that, \nand we don't believe generally that the imposition of unilateral \nsanctions, except under unique circumstances which the Senator from \nMissouri and his cosponsors have identified in this bill, ought to deny \npeople in these countries--the average citizen--the benefit of our \nsuccess in food and medicine. I applaud them for their efforts. I am \ndelighted to be a cosponsor of their amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the Ashcroft food and \nmedicine sanctions reform amendment. While I would prefer this \namendment addressed all unilateral sanctions, not just food and \nmedicine, I support the amendment as a good start to reforming our \nsanctions policy. As a cosponsor of the Lugar Sanctions Reform Act, I \nbelieve it is long overdue that the administration and the Congress \nthink before we sanction.\n  It makes no sense to punish the people of a country with which we \nhave a dispute. Denying food and medicine does nothing to penalize the \nleaders of any country. Government leaders can always obtain adequate \nfood and medicine, but people suffer under these sanctions, whether \nthey are multilateral or unilateral. Those two areas should never be a \npart of any sanction.\n  At the same time our farmers suffer from the lingering effects of the \nAsian financial crisis as well as those in other areas of the world, we \neither have, or are debating, sanctions that further restrict markets \nfor our farmers and medical supply companies. And denys that food and \nmedical supplies to some of the worlds most needy.\n  Since most of our sanctions are unilateral, it makes no sense to deny \nour farmers and workers important markets when those sales are being \nmade by our allies.\n  I need not remind any of you that we are still experiencing the \naftermath of the Soviet grain embargo of the late 1970's when the \nUnited States earned a reputation as an unreliable supplier.\n  Another example of how we have harmed our farmers is the Cuban \nembargo. For 40 years this policy was aimed at removing Fidel Castro--\nyet he is still there. This is a huge market for midwestern farmers, \nyet it is shut off to us. Because Cuba has fiscal problems, many of its \npeople are experiencing hardship. Those who have relationships with \nCuban-Americans receive financial support, but those who don't need \naccess to scarce food and medical supplies. This bill does not aid the \ngovernment, as U.S. guarantees can only be provided through NGO's and \nthe private sector not armies, not\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\nto terrorists. Currently, donations are permitted, as well as sales of \nmedicine, but they are very bureaucratically difficult to obtain, and \nthey don't help everyone. Our farmers are in a good position to help \nand they should be allowed to do so.\n  I applaud Senators Aschroft and Hagel for their work to ensure \nfarmers and medical companies will not be held hostage to those who \nbelieve sanctions can make a difference. Any administration would have \nto get congressional approval for any food and medicine sanction. This \nis our best opportunity to help farmers and provide much-needed food \nsupplies to the overage people in these countries, and to show the \nworld we are reliable suppliers. I urge the support of my colleagues \nfor this long overdue amendment. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my intention to raise a point of \norder. Before I do so, I will provide some context.\n  We have entered into a unanimous consent agreement to govern the \ndisposition of this legislation. That unanimous consent agreement \nstates that during the consideration of the agricultural appropriations \nbill, when the Democratic leader or his designee offers an agricultural \nrelief amendment, no rule XVI point of order lie against the amendment \nor amendments thereto relating to the same subject.\n  The question is, Does this amendment to the amendment offered by the \nDemocratic leader on agricultural relief constitute an amendment \nrelating to the same subject? Let me anticipate what might be \nconsidered by the Parliamentarian.\n  In the underlying amendment, there is reference made to two \nagricultural programs: The Agricultural Trade Development and \nAssistance Act of 1954 and section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949. \nBoth of those statutes are again referenced in the amendment that has \nbeen offered by the Senator from Missouri.\n  Where are they offered in the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMissouri? They are offered in the section of the amendment which is the \ndefinitions, so they are stated to be agricultural programs and then \nlisted in the definition section.\n  I can find no other reference to those specific statutes other than \nin the definition section, raising the question as to whether they were \ninserted in the definition section in order to attempt to overcome what \nwas the clear purpose of the unanimous consent agreement, which was to \nprovide a narrow exception to the rule XVI prohibition against \nlegislating on an appropriations bill.\n  Even beyond that, I point out on page 6, in one of the most \nsignificant provisions of this amendment, the provision that relates to \ncountries supporting international terrorism, the only potential \nrelevance of defining those pieces of legislation is to exclude them \nfrom the operation of this amendment. So they are put in the definition \nsection so they can be removed from the operation of this amendment on \npage 6. Clearly, in my opinion, that is a specious attempt to gain the \nadvantage of the unanimous consent agreement.\n  One final point. During the colloquy I had with the Senator from \nMissouri, I think he was quite candid in saying that the purpose of \nthat support for the international terrorism section was to draw a \ndistinction between commercial sales of agricultural and medical \nproducts, which were approved under this amendment, could be made \nwithout any of the existing conditions such as a license, and sales \nthat were made on a humanitarian basis through one of these various \nU.S. trade or export of agricultural products provisions which \ncontinued to be prohibited.\n  We have the ironic circumstance that the humanitarian provision is \nprohibited but commercial sales are rendered acceptable by this \namendment.\n  Yet in the headline, the footnote, the summary of this amendment, by \na handwritten insertion, the prepositional phrase is inserted which \nsays ``for humanitarian assistance.'' The purpose of inserting that \nspecific reference is clearly just to establish the most tenuous \nconnection to the underlying bill and to attempt to create the facade \nthat this amendment has something to do with humanitarian assistance, \nwhere, by the very description of the Senator from Missouri, it is for \ncommercial, not assisted humanitarian agricultural, sales.\n  Mr. President, with that description of what I think the amendment \nis, what the underlying amendment and what the purpose of the unanimous \nconsent agreement was, which was a narrow exception for agricultural \nrelief amendments and amendments to that amendment which related to the \nsame subject, since this fails to meet that standard, I raise the point \nof order under rule XVI that this amendment constitutes, clearly, \nexplicitly, legislation on an appropriations bill and therefore, under \nrule XVI, is out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement precludes making a point of \norder for an amendment that is considered relevant. This is considered \na relevant amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, inasmuch as the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Missouri, however well intentioned, would have the effect of \nlifting restrictions on trade with terrorist states or governments and \nwould allow trade with the coercive elements of these repressive, \nhostile, regimes, I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as an individual who has spent \nhis entire life involved in agriculture. I am extremely concerned about \nthe current state of the agricultural economy. Farmers and ranchers in \nmy state of Montana and across America cannot afford another year of \nzero profit. Price declines for agricultural commodities have had a \ndevastating impact on agricultural producers in Montana and the economy \nof the entire state, which depends so heavily on agriculture. The \nfarmers and ranchers in Montana have suffered too much already. With \ncontinued low prices, many agricultural producers have been forced to \nsell the farms and ranches many have spent their entire lives working.\n  They seem to have all the cards stacked against them. Agricultural \nproducers face high numbers of imports\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\nas well as a downward trend in demand for their product. Further, the \nworld market is not providing adequate opportunities for international \ntrade. The European Union continues to place non-scientific trade \nbarriers on U.S. beef as well as bans on Genetically Modified grain \nproducts. Asia, usually a strong export market, continues to recover \nfrom the economic flu and many of our other trade partners have been \nsubjected to sanctions by this administration. Additionally, the value \nof beef and grain imports have decreased dramatically as a percent of \nthe world market.\n  Montana may not be able to survive another year of this economic \nplight. If market prices continue to go down as they have, I am fearful \nthat more farmers and ranchers will be forced out of business. If a \ndrastic measure is not passed in Congress this year, I don't know how \nmuch longer the agricultural community can persevere.\n  As I said before, the impact is not limited to those working the \nfields or raising livestock. Look at Main Street, Rural America. The \nagricultural economy is so bad that other businesses are failing as \nwell. And not just agri-business. No longer is it just the livestock \nfeed store or seed companies that are failing due to the economic \ncrunch. It reaches much further. All kinds and types of businesses are \nfeeling the depressed agricultural economy. Montana is ranked in the \nbottom five per capita income by state, in the nation.\n  Ironically, I also read recently that Montana is rated in a \nnationwide poll as the 7th most desirable place to live in America. \nThat won't be the case much longer if we can't return more of the \neconomic dollar to the agricultural producer. Montana is a desirable \nplace to live because of agriculture. Without the wheat fields and \ngrazing pastures, Montana loses its very being. Without the return of \nmore of the economic dollar to the agricultural producer there will be \nno more farming or ranching and consequently no more wheat fields or \npastures to graze livestock.\n  I have used the comparison before of the agricultural producer \ndrowning. I believe he is. The way I see it, the farmer is drowning in \na sea of debt and many in Congress want to continue to send lifeboats. \nThe problem is, that once the producer makes it into the boat he never \nmakes it to shore. He just keeps paddling trying to keep his head above \nwater, and waiting for the next boat.\n  I want the farmer to get back to land and on his feet. We have to \nprovide them the oars to get to shore and then keep them out of the \nwater. I would like to see a strong agriculture assistance package \npassed and then a base for long-term benefits, in the form of laws on \ncountry of origin labeling, crop insurance reform and mandatory price \nreporting.\n  My Montana farmers and ranchers need help now. They need a package \nthat provides solid short-term assistance. They need AMTA payments at \n100% to bring the price of wheat per bushel to a price that will allow \nthem to meet their cost-of-production. Additionally, they need funding \nfor specialty crops, sugar and livestock.\n  I don't agree with many of the provisions included in the Democratic \npackage. Funding for cotton and peanuts does not help my agricultural \nproducers. Neither does $300 million for the Step 2 cotton program. \nThese provisions bump the price tag up significantly and seem to help \nother areas of the country more than the Northwest.\n  However, all agriculture is in dire straits. Montana needs funding \nand they need it fast. Thus, I will vote for the package that gets that \nmoney to my producers as quickly as possible.\n  I believe that AMTA is the most effective way to distribute the \nfunding that grain producers need. The Republican package contains 100% \nAMTA payments, which will bring the price of wheat up to $3.84. It also \ncontains important provisions for specialty crops, lifts the LDP cap \nand encourages the President to be more aggressive in strengthening \ntrade negotiating authority for American agriculture.\n  Freedom to Farm needs a boost. It is a good program, but simply \ncannot provide for the needs of farmers and ranchers during this kind \nof economic crunch. From 1995 to 1999, $50.9 billion have been \ndistributed as direct payments. This tells us that commodity prices are \nnot going up. Farmers and ranchers are not doing better on their net \nincome sheets.\n  We need to let Freedom to Farm work. I believe it will. When more of \nthe economic dollar is returned to the producer and when the farmer or \nrancher receives a price for commodities that meet the cost-of-\nproduction. For now, we must keep the agricultural producer afloat. An \nassistance measure which will provide them a means to stay in business \nat a profitable level is the only way to do that this year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I travel around the country, I see the \ndevastation caused by the ongoing drought in many sections of the \ncountry. Crops are stunted and dying, fields are dusty, streams and \nlakes are drying up. Many farmers are still reeling from the effects of \nlast year's Asian economic crisis. Clearly, some form of assistance is \nneeded to prevent the demise of more of America's family farms, and I \nsupport efforts to provide needed government aid to farmers and their \nfamilies.\n  Both pending proposals specify that aid to farmers is to be \nconsidered emergency spending, which is not counted against the budget \ncaps. Mr. President, again, I recognize the dire circumstances that \nhave many Americans in the agriculture industry facing economic ruin. \nHowever, already this year, the Senate has approved appropriations \nbills containing $7.9 billion in wasteful and unnecessary spending. \nSurely, among these billions of dollars, there are at least a few \nprograms that we could all agree are lower priority than desperately \nneeded aid for America's farmers.\n  My colleagues should be aware that every dollar spent above the \nbudget caps is a dollar that comes from the budget surplus. This year, \nthe only surplus is in the Social Security accounts, so this farm aid \nwill be paid for by further exacerbating the impending financial crisis \nin the Social Security Trust Funds. And every dollar that is spent on \nfuture emergencies comes from the surplus we just promised last week to \nreturn to the American people in the form of tax relief. It is the same \nsurplus that we have to use to shore up Social Security and Medicare, \nand begin to pay down the national debt.\n  Unfortunately, though, it seems to be easier to slap on an emergency \ndesignation, rather than try to find lower priority spending cuts as \noffsets.\n  Once again, Mr. President, Congress is taking its usual opportunistic \napproach to any disaster or emergency--adding billions of dollars in \nnon-emergency spending and policy proposals to the emergency farm aid \nproposals.\n  The competing amendments pending before the Senate contain provisions \nthat provide special, targeted relief to certain sectors of the \nagricultural community. For example, in addition to the billions of \ndollars of assistance payments for which all farmers would be eligible:\n  Both proposals single out peanut producers for special direct \npayments to partially compensate them for low prices and increasing \nproduction costs.\n  The Republican proposal also provides $50 million to be used to \nassist fruit and vegetable producers, at the Secretary of Agriculture's \ndiscretion.\n  Both proposals give the Secretary of Agriculture broad authority to \nprovide some kinds of assistance to livestock and dairy producers, the \nonly difference being the amount of money set aside for this \nunspecified relief. The Democrats set aside $750 million, the \nRepublicans $325 million.\n  Both proposals set up more restrictive import quotas and new price \nsupports for cotton producers.\n  Both proposals provide $328 million in direct aid for tobacco \nfarmers.\n  The Republican proposal also specifically targets $475 million for \ndirect payments to oilseed producers, most of which is to be paid to \nsoybean producers.\n  The Democrat proposal, which is about $3 billion more expensive than \nthe Republican proposal, expands to address non-agricultural disaster-\nrelated requirements, such as wetlands and watershed restoration and \nconservation, short-term land diversion programs, and flood prevention \nprojects. It also establishes a new $500 million disaster reserve \naccount, in anticipation of future disasters, I assume. But the \nproposal then adds a number of very narrowly targeted provisions and\n\n[[Page S10116]]\n\nprovisions wholly unrelated to the purposes of aiding economically \ndistressed farmers, including:\n\n       --$40 million for salaries and expenses of the Farm Service \n     Agency, apparently to administer $100 million in new loan \n     funds;\n       --$100 million for rural economic development;\n       --$50 million for a new revolving loan program for farmer-\n     owned cooperatives;\n       --$4 million to implement a new mandatory price reporting \n     program for livestock;\n       --$8 million for a new product labeling system for imported \n     meat;\n       --$1 million for rapid response teams to enforce the \n     Packers and Stockyards Act; and\n       finally,\n       --$15 million for a Northeast multispecies fishery.\n\n  These provisions have no place in a bill to provide emergency \nassistance to America's farmers. There is an established process for \ndealing with spending and policy matters that are not emergencies. It \nis the normal authorization and appropriations process, where each \nprogram or policy can be assessed as part of a merit-based review. Many \nof the provisions I have listed above may very well be meritorious and \ndeserving of support and funding, but the process we are following here \ntoday does not provide an appropriate forum for assessing their \nrelative merit compared to the many other important programs for which \nnon-emergency dollars should be made available. I think even some of \nthe potential recipients of these non-emergency programs would agree \nthat they should be considered in the normal appropriations and \nauthorization processes.\n  There is one special interest provision of the Republican proposal \nthat I would like to discuss further and that I intend to address \ndirectly in an amendment later in the debate. The Republican proposal \ngives the already heavily subsidized sugar industry one more perk--\nrelief from paying a minuscule assessment of just 25 cents on each 100 \npounds of sugar. This tiny tax raised just $37.8 million last year, and \nwas supposed to be the sugar industry's sole contribution to reducing \nannual budget deficits. Thanks to their successful lobbying, for the \nnext three years, big sugar will not have to pay this assessment if the \nfederal government has a budget surplus. While the assessment was \ninitially imposed to help reduce annual budget deficits, which \nfortunately have been eliminated as a result of the Balanced Budget \nAct, what about the $5.6 trillion national debt?\n  This little bit of targeted tax relief for big sugar comes on top of \na $130 million per year government-subsidized loan program for sugar \nproducers, and price supports that cost American consumers over $1.4 \nbillion a year in higher sugar prices at the store. The sponsors of the \nproposal make no claim that this provision is in any way related to a \ndisaster or drought-related economic crisis in the sugar industry that \nwould merit its inclusion in this emergency farm aid bill. Its \ninclusion simply adds one more perk to the already broad array of \nspecial subsidies for big sugar companies.\n  I intend to offer an amendment later during the debate on this bill \nto terminate taxpayer support of the sugar industry. If the Republican \nfarm aid proposal is adopted, as I expect it will be, I will include in \nmy amendment a proposal to strike this newly created perk for big \nsugar.\n  Mr. President, I am going to support the more modest Republican \nproposal, regardless of the outcome of my amendment to eliminate the \ninequitable and unnecessary sugar subsidies. But I do so only because \nof the real economic hardship faced by many of our nation's farmers and \ntheir families.\n  I abhor the continuing practice of attaching pork-barrel spending to \nany and every bill that comes before the Senate, especially when real \ndisasters are cynically exploited to designate pork as emergency \nspending. This kind of fiscal irresponsibility undermines the balanced \nbudget and hinders debt reduction efforts, exacerbates the need to \npreserve and protect Social Security and Medicare, and threatens \nefforts to provide meaningful tax relief to American families.\n  Once again, I can only hope that the final farm aid proposal will be \ntargeted only at those in need--America's farmers. I urge the conferees \non this legislation to eliminate the provisions that solely benefit \nspecial interests who have once again managed to turn needed emergency \nrelief into opportunism. I also urge the conferees to seek offsets for \nthe additional spending in this bill, to avoid again dipping into the \nSocial Security surplus and putting our balanced budget at risk.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be no further votes this evening. The discussion regarding the \ndairy issue will occur from 9 a.m. until 9:40 a.m. on Wednesday, with \nthe cloture vote occurring at approximately 9:45 a.m.\n  Assuming cloture is not invoked on Wednesday morning, I anticipate \nthe Senate will resume consideration of the pending Ashcroft amendment, \nwhich is an amendment to the disaster amendment by Senators Harkin and \nDaschle.\n  Also, if an opportunity does present itself, I understand that there \nwill be another disaster-related amendment by Senator Roberts and \nSenator Santorum. Of course, that will be in line behind the other \namendments because of procedure. But at the appropriate time there is a \nplan by those two Senators, and others, to offer another amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10116-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to provide incentive grants to improve the quality of child \ncare; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                child care quality incentive act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a crisis that is \naffecting the families of this country. That crisis is the child care \nsystem, the ability to obtain safe, affordable, high-quality child \ncare.\n  Today there are an estimated 13 million children, 6 million of them \ninfants and toddlers, who require some form of day care. For working \nfamilies, the price of this day care is exceedingly difficult to meet \neach and every day.\n  Full-day child care ranges from $4,000 to $10,000 a year. For some \nlow-income families, that represents 25 percent of their income.\n  This is a huge obligation. We have, I fear and believe, the \nresponsibility to ensure that we can help these families meet this \nobligation to protect their children. Not only is this necessary simply \nfor the custodial protection and care of children, it is necessary for \ntheir enhancement, their advancement, for their intellectual \ndevelopment.\n  We have discovered over the last several years, because of all the \nresearch that is being done at the National Institutes of Health, and \nother places, the crucial role of the early development of children in \ntheir ultimate intellectual and social development as adults.\n  We know if we have good, nurturing care in the early days of life, \nthis care will lead to better cognitive performance later on. It will \nincrease classroom success. It will lead to more fully developed \nindividuals who can cope with the challenges of this next century that \nis just upon us.\n  So our investment in child care is not simply something that is \naltruistic--something we want to do because it is for the kids and for \nworking families--it is in the best interests of this country in order \nto provide for the citizens of this country of the next century.\n  We know also, as we look around, that one of the problems in child \ncare, I say to Senators, is that because of the low reimbursement rates \nthat the child care centers receive from the States, that they are not \nable to retain good employees and that they are not able to train the \nemployees they can retain--particularly in this booming economy we see \ntoday.\n  So what you have in so many child care centers is a situation where \nthey cannot retain their employees, they cannot attract the very best \nemployees, they do not have the resources to fully develop the \npotential for these employees, and as a result, ultimately, children \nsuffer.\n  In fact, there have been numerous studies. The one that I found most \ndisturbing is one where four States were studied in the United States, \nand it was found that in those States only one out of seven child care \ncenters provided care that promoted the healthy development of the \nchild. Even more shocking, one in eight of these child care centers \nactually provided care that threatened the health of the child. We have \nto do something about it.\n\n  Prior to welfare reform, there was a law on the books that said the \nState, when they were subsidizing day care for low-income parents, had \nto at least try to achieve the 75th percentile in terms of their \nreimbursement rate. What that means is that they had to have a \nreimbursement rate that could at least meet the cost of 75 out of 100 \nof the centers in their particular State. That has gone by the wayside. \nBut in order to keep quality in our child care system, we have to get \nto reimbursement rates that will, in fact, provide the resources for \nchild care centers to have quality, enhancing care to benefit the \nchildren of this country.\n  What has also been abandoned in the last several years is even the \nattempt by the States to go ahead and do surveys of the market so they \nknow what it costs different child care centers to provide care and \nknow what it costs for the parents to send their children to day-care \ncenters. Having abandoned these market surveys, essentially there is no \nconnection between their subsidy rate and, in fact, the cost of day \ncare. So working families who receive these subsidies--and there are \nmore and more families who are receiving subsidies as we move welfare \nrecipients to work--have no correlation between what they are getting \nand essentially what the cost of child care is in the real world.\n  What I have done, along with some of my colleagues, is introduce \nlegislation that would, in fact, give the States an incentive, first to \ndo their market surveys, to find out the cost of day care in their \ncommunities, and then to strive to meet those market rates.\n  I have been very pleased to be joined by Senators Chris Dodd and Ted \nKennedy, who are leaders in the field of improving child care in this \ncountry, together with Senators Feinstein, Inouye, and Murray in \nintroducing the Child Care Quality Incentive Act. Essentially, this \nlegislation would establish a new mandatory pool of funding, $300 \nmillion each year over the next 5 years, as part of the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. This funding would be an incentive for \nStates to first conduct a market survey and then to make significant \nmovement towards raising their subsidy rates to that market rate. In so \ndoing, we can directly contribute to the bottom line of these child \ncare centers. They, in turn, can retain personnel, train their \npersonnel, and create a more enhancing environment for the development \nof children. This, I think, is a goal we should have.\n  Increased reimbursement rates also expand the number of choices \nparents have in finding quality child care.\n  We will also, I hope, at the same time try to increase the overall \nscope of the child development block grants. One of the consequences of \nsimply increasing funding for the child care development block grant, \nis many States will not increase the subsidy they pay for children; \nthey will simply try to enroll more children. This puts centers in a \nvery cruel dilemma because the more children they have at that far-\nbelow-market rate the greater the economic pressure on the centers.\n  The program I am presenting today with my colleagues would do what \nchild care providers have argued must be done, and that is to give them \nadditional resources so they can, in fact, improve the quality of day \ncare--not simply the number of children in day care but the quality of \nday care. If we do these things we are going to be in a strong position \nto face the challenges ahead.\n  One of the greatest challenges for working families is the cost of \nday care for their children. I have been very pleased to note that this \nlegislation has been endorsed by the USA Child Care, the Children's \nDefense Fund, Catholic Charities of the United States, the Child \nWelfare League of America, the YMCA of the United States, the National \nAssociation of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, the National \nHead Start Association, the National Child Care Association and a host \nof other agencies and organizations throughout the country. They \nrecognize, as I do, and as my colleagues who are introducing this \nlegislation do, that we can talk a lot about child care, we can \nemphasize how important it is to families, we can stress the importance \nto our economy and to our long-run future in this country, but until we \nput real resources to work, we will not be able to meet the real needs \nof families. These needs grow each day.\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\n  I urge strong support for this legislation. Again, I thank and \ncommend my colleagues who have joined me in this effort: Senators Dodd, \nKennedy, Feinstein, Inouye, and Murray, and encourage others to join \nus. I believe if we make this investment in quality child care, we will \nbe making one of the most important investments we can make in the \nfuture of this country and in the individual future of families \nthroughout the United States.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a copy of the legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1475\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that \n     much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and \n     nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care \n     and education leads to increased cognitive abilities, \n     positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of \n     long-term school success, and greater likelihood of long-term \n     economic and social self-sufficiency.\n       (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including \n     6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day \n     in child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1 \n     in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy \n     development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care \n     that threatens the safety and health of children.\n       (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $10,000 per \n     year.\n       (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child \n     care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal \n     subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. For \n     families with young children and a monthly income under \n     $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent \n     of their income.\n       (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, the maximum the State \n     will reimburse a child care provider for the care of a child \n     who receives a subsidy, are too low to ensure that quality \n     care is accessible to all families.\n       (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care \n     children get and whether families can find quality child care \n     in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates \n     force child care providers to cut corners in ways that lower \n     the quality of care for children, including reducing number \n     of staff, eliminating staff training opportunities, and \n     cutting enriching educational activities and services.\n       (7) Children in low quality child care are more likely to \n     have delayed reading and language skills, and display more \n     aggression toward other children and adults.\n       (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child \n     care as child care providers are able to attract and retain \n     qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional \n     training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and \n     purchase basic supplies and developmentally appropriate \n     educational materials.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the \n     quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child \n     care payment rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide an increase in payments for physician services provided in \nhealth professional shortage areas in Alaska and Hawaii; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           health professional shortage in alaska and hawaii\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nco-sponsored by my colleagues Senator Stevens, Senator Akaka, and \nSenator Inouye which will help to alleviate some of the financial \nhardships that currently face physicians who practice in remote areas \nof Alaska and Hawaii.\n  Access to health care is the over-riding problem for Alaska's \nelderly. Almost weekly, I receive letters from seniors in Alaska who \ntell me that their doctor is no longer willing to accept Medicare \npatients. Why? Because doctors in rural areas lose money on Medicare \npatients.\n  In a 1987 report to Congress, the Physician Payment Review Commission \nrecognized that low Medicare payments in rural areas affect physicians' \nwillingness to see Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\nIn response, Congress provided a 10 percent bonus payment for all \nphysician services provided in rural areas with the greatest degree of \nphysician shortages. Unfortunately, reimbursement rates continue to be \ninadequate in Alaska and Hawaii where physicians must contend with \nextreme remoteness and high transportation costs. Alaska is currently \n70 percent medically underserved.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today will increase the bonus \npayment for rural physicians in Alaska and Hawaii to 20 percent. By \nincreasing these payments, physicians in Alaska and Hawaii will be \nbetter able to cover the additional costs which accompanies the \ndelivery of health care in remote areas. Furthermore, this legislation \nwill go far in helping Alaska and Hawaii retain current physician \nstaffs and better meet the needs of Alaskan Native and Hawaiian Native \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to provide equitable access for foster care and adoption services \nfor Indian children in tribal areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    Improving Foster Care and Adoption Services for Native American \n                                Children\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with \nSenator McCain and Senator Inouye, an important bill to correct an \ninequity in the law affecting many Native American children. Every \nyear, for a variety of often tragic reasons, thousands of children \nacross the country are placed in foster care. To assist with the cost \nof food, shelter, clothing, daily supervision and school supplies, \nfoster parents of children who have come to them through state agency \nplacements receive money through Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. \nAdditionally, States receive funds for administrative training and data \ncollection to support this program. Unfortunately, because of a \nlegislative oversight, many income-eligible Native American children \nplaced in foster care by tribal agencies do not receive foster care and \nadoptive services to which all other income-eligible children are \nentitled.\n  Not only are otherwise eligible Native children denied foster care \nmaintenance payments, but this inequity also extends to children \nadopted through tribal placements. Currently, the IV-E program offers \nsporadic assistance for expenses associated with adoption and no \nassistance for training professional staff or parents involved in the \nadoption absent a tribal-state agreement.\n  In many instances, these children face insurmountable odds. Many come \nfrom abusive homes. Foster parents who open their doors to care for \nthese special children deserve our help. These generous people who are \nwilling to take these children into their homes shouldn't have \nsleepless nights worrying about whether they have the resources to \nprovide nourishing food or a warm coat, or even adequate shelter for \nthese children. This legislation will go a long way to ease their \nconcerns.\n  Currently, some tribes and states have entered into IV-E agreements, \nbut these arrangements are the exception. They also, by and large, do \nnot include funds to train tribal social workers and other program \nadministrators. This bill would authorize tribes to operate IV-E \nprograms in the same manner as states. Upon approval of a tribal plan \nby HHS, the tribe would be able to provide services to income-eligible \nchildren under its custody. The bill would also allow children in \ntribal custody to receive foster care payments where a tribe chooses \nnot to operate the entire program if adequate arrangements are made \nbetween the tribe and the state for provision of child welfare services \nand protections required by Title IV-E.\n  The bill we are introducing today would:\n  Authorize reimbursement of Title IV-E entitlement programs for tribal \nplacements in foster and adoptive homes;\n  Authorize tribal governments to receive direct funding from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services for training and administration \nof IV-E programs (tribes must have HHS-approved programs);\n  Allow the Secretary flexibility to modify the requirements of the IV-\nE law for tribes if those requirements are not in the best interest of \nNative children and if the tribal plans include alternative provisions \nthat would achieve the purpose of the requirement that is altered or \nwaived; and\n  Allow continuation of tribal-state IV-E agreements.\n  In a 1994 report, HHS found that the best way to serve this \nunderfunded group is to provide direct assistance to tribal governments \nand qualified tribal families. This bill would not reduce the \nentitlement funding for states, as they would continue to be reimbursed \nfor their expenses under the law. I strongly believe Congress should \naddress this oversight and provide equitable benefits to Native \nAmerican children under the jurisdiction of their tribal governments, \nand I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1478\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor legislation \nwith my colleagues, Senators Daschle and Inouye, to amend the Social \nSecurity Act and extend eligibility for Indian tribes to fully \nimplement, like states, the Title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption \nAssistance Act. This important legislation will finally allow Indian \nchildren living in tribal areas to have the same access to services of \nthe Title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program enjoyed by \nother children nationwide.\n  The purpose of the Title IV-E program is to ensure that children \nreceive adequate care when placed in foster care and adoption programs. \nThe Title IV-E program operates as an open-ended entitlement program \nfor eligible state governments with approved plans. State governments \nreceive funding for foster care maintenance payments to cover food, \nshelter, clothing, school supplies, and liability insurance for income-\neligible children placed in foster homes by state courts, and for \nrelated administrative and training costs.\n  While Congress intended that the Title IV-E program should benefit \nall eligible children, Indian children who are under the jurisdiction \nof their tribal court are not eligible. When enacted, the Title IV-E \nlaw did not properly consider that Indian tribal governments retain \nsole jurisdiction over the domestic affairs of their own tribal \nmembers, particularly Indian children.\n  State administrators have attempted to meet the intended goals of \nthese programs by extending their efforts to Indian country. However, \nadministrative and jurisdictional hurdles make it nearly impossible to \nprovide these services. As a result, Indian children in need of foster \ncare and child support are not accorded the same level of service as \nother children nationwide. Tribal governments, who are legally \nresponsible for Indian children in foster care, are not entitled to \nfederal reimbursement for children placed in foster care by a tribal \ncourt, unless the tribe, as a public agency, enters into a cooperative \nagreement with the state.\n  A cooperative agreement may not sound all that difficult, but in \nreality, such an agreement can prove impossible. Rather than providing \nincentives, current law more often discourages states from entering \ninto agreements with tribes. For example, a state is accountable for \ntribal compliance with Title IV-E requirements. If a tribe cannot \nfulfill a matching requirement, the state must assume the costs on \nbehalf of the tribe in order to retain federal funds. It is entirely \npossible that states could lose their Title IV-E funds if tribal \nrecords were out of compliance.\n  State-tribal relations are not always productive, particularly when \ndisputes arise over issues unrelated to child welfare. Providing this \ndirect eligibility for tribal governments, with the same accountability \nand enforcement requirements, will resolve such problems. State \nagencies have indicated that direct participation by the tribes would \nhelp address an overburden of casework and preclude tension over \njurisdictional issues.\n  I want to make clear that enactment of this legislation will in no \nway supplant or discourage State-tribal agreements. Existing agreements \nwill be honored, while allowing Indian tribes to directly access needed \nresources for further protection for income-eligible Indian children.\n  I also want to comment briefly on efforts made by the Administration \nto implement a limited pilot program to provide direct authority to \ntribes to administer the Title IV-E and Title IV-B programs. The 1997 \nAdoption and Safe Families Act authorized up to ten demonstration \nprograms. Five demonstration programs have been approved by the \nAdministration to meet the needs of Indian children. I applaud the \ninitiative, but this limited approval will not extend to any other \ntribe who may choose to administer their own programs and the needs of \nmany Indian children will still be unmet. I sincerely hope the \nAdministration would seek to include five more tribes as participants \nin the demonstration program.\n  We sought to include similar eligibility provisions in the 1996 \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, but were unsuccessful \nin finding the necessary off-sets to pay for this program.\n  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that this legislation \nwould cost $236 million over a five-year period, which generally \namounts to less than one percent of total Federal Title IV-E \nexpenditures. While this legislation does not currently include any \nidentified off-sets to pay for adding tribal eligibility for this \nentitlement program, I have assurances from Senators Daschle and Inouye \nthat the inclusion of off-sets, prior to final passage, will in no way \naffect the Social Security Trust Fund or increase the federal debt. We \nhave pledged to work together to find necessary and agreeable off-sets \nfor this program.\n  Mr. President, enactment of this legislation will bring an end to the \ndisparate treatment of eligible Indian children under Title IV-E \nprograms. I urge my colleagues to correct this unfair oversight and \nmake the benefits of the Title IV-E entitlement program available for \nall children as intended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Lott, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n  Hagel, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Mack, and Mr. \n                               Sessions):\n\n  S. 1479. A bill a amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to empower teachers, improve student achievement through high-\nquality professional development for teachers, reauthorize the Reading \nExcellence Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions.\n\n\n                        teacher empowerment act\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr President, today I am joined with my colleagues, \nSenators Lott, Collins, Brownback, Hagel, Coverdell, Gorton, Mack, \nVoinovich and Sessions in introducing the Teacher Empowerment Act \n(TEA). This Act is similar to H.R. 1995 which recently passed the \nHouse.\n  The bill provides a little over $2 billion annually over 5 years by \nconsolidating funds for Title II of ESEA, GOALS 2000 and Classroom Size \ninto one flexible funding stream for the purposes of increasing teacher \nquality and the number of high quality teachers in our schools.\n  Over 300 studies have found that the number one contributor to \nstudent achievement is a highly qualified teacher. Outside of parental \ninvolvement, no other factor has as much impact on determining whether \na student will succeed or fail in school. Unfortunately, we know that \nover 25% of those who enter the teacher workforce are poorly qualified \nto teach. Furthermore, we know that many teachers who are already in \nthe classroom lack necessary skills or do not possess adequate \nknowledge of the subject area in which they teach.\n  Since teacher quality is the most significant determinant to student \nsuccess and there is a shortage of high quality teachers in our \nschools, it is readily apparent that we need to focus our efforts on \nincreasing teacher quality. Nothing else will improve our public \nschools or lead to increased student achievement as much as increasing \nthe number of high quality teachers in our schools.\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\n  TEA improves teacher quality by requiring that professional \ndevelopment activities increase teacher knowledge and skills as well as \nstudent achievement. TEA builds upon extensive research on what type of \nprofessional development activities improve teacher knowledge and \nskills. First and foremost high quality professional development \nactivities must be directly related to the curriculum and subject area \nin which the teacher provides instruction. Second, they must be of \nsufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting \nimpact. TEA only funds those professional activities that meet these \nrequirements and only if the activities are tied to challenging State \ncontent and student performance standards.\n  Not only does TEA improve teacher quality, but it gives school \ndistricts the ability to recruit and retain high quality teachers. Many \nschool districts, especially inner city and rural school districts, are \nunable to either attract or retain high quality teachers. Blanket \nclassroom size reduction proposals, which call for reduced class size \nat all costs, only exacerbate the situation.\n  A recent Rand study found that California's classroom size initiative \nled to more uncredentialed, underqualifed teachers and an increase in \nteacher aides (rather than teachers) providing direct instruction to \nstudents. Inner city schools in Los Angeles actually witnessed a \ndecrease in the number of qualified teachers, as many of those that \nwere qualified left the inner city schools when jobs opened up in more \naffluent schools.\n  Clearly, school districts must be given the resources to not only \nrecruit, but also to retain, high quality teachers. TEA does this \nthrough a variety of measures. It permits school districts to award \ndifferential pay to retain and recruit teachers in high need subject \nareas, such as math and science. It permits schools to provide signing \nbonuses to retain their best teachers and reduce the rate of attrition.\n  It permits school districts to establish incentive programs to \nattract and hire highly skilled and knowledgeable teachers. It permits \nschools to recruit individuals who have had careers outside of teaching \nbut whose life experience provides a solid foundation for teaching. \nAnd, it permits schools to invest in teacher mentors and master \nteachers; studies and teacher polls have found that hiring master \nteachers who mentor new teachers improves both teacher quality and the \nlikelihood that new teachers will stay and thrive at the school.\n  In addition to promoting high quality professional development \nprograms and to giving school districts the ability to retain, recruit \nand train high quality teachers, TEA also promotes a number of \ninnovative common sense reforms, such as tenure reform, teacher \ntesting, merit-based performance systems, teacher academies, and \nalternative certification programs.\n  TEA also creates Teacher Opportunity Payments (TOPS), payments that \nwould be provided directly to teachers so they can choose their own \nprofessional development. Teachers have reported that professional \nactivities selected by the school districts are often not as helpful as \nthose activities they might have selected themselves. Under TOPS, if a \ngroup of teachers is not satisfied with the professional opportunities \noffered by the school district, they could request that the LEA pay for \nthem to attend a professional development program of their choice, \nprovided the program met the professional activity requirements under \nthe Act. This means that science teachers could attend a local \nuniversity that has a reputation for intensive professional development \nprograms in math and science; programs that they otherwise might not \nhave had the opportunity to attend.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor TEA. TEA gives States and schools \nthe resources and the flexibility to use those resources to retain, \nrecruit, train and hire highly qualified teachers.\n  I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1479\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nthe Teacher Empowerment Act, which is legislation introduced by my \nfriend and colleague Senator Gregg. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this legislation, which responds to several critical needs \nfacing American education. In particular, it addresses teacher quality \nand quantity. It addresses local control of educating our children. It \nrequires accountability to parents and students. In short, it is a plan \nto ensure that every child in America is prepared for global \ncompetition in the 21st Century.\n  The Teacher Empowerment Act recognizes the expertise of our state and \nlocal governments in educating our children. American parents trust \ntheir teachers and principals to make appropriate educational decisions \nfor their children. In reality, Washington bureaucrats have called the \nshots for far too long. The results indicate that in lieu of \nachievement, we now have reams of paperwork and a myriad of programs to \naddress local problems at the national level. We can and must do \nbetter.\n  The Teacher Empowerment Act puts decision making authority back into \nthe hands of local schools. It encourages states to implement \ninnovative teacher reforms and high quality professional development \nprograms to increase teacher knowledge and student achievement. Local \nschools would be encouraged to fund innovative programs such as teacher \ntesting--a concept which I have strongly supported and which this body \nsupported last year in a bipartisan vote--as well as tenure reform, \nmerit-based pay, alternative routes to teacher certification, \ndifferential and bonus pay for teachers in high need subject areas, \nteacher mentoring, and in-service teacher academies.\n  Our children are counting on us to ensure that they receive an \neducation second to none. That starts with exceptional teachers and \nschools that are\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\nable to address the individual needs of its students. This bill returns \nto local schools the ability and authority to accomplish these goals. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url":

Sense of the Senate Regarding Access to Items and \n     Services Under the Medicare Program.\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Total hospital operating margins with respect to items \n     and services provided to medicare beneficiaries are expected \n     to decline from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1997 to negative \n     4.4 percent in fiscal year 2002.\n       (2) Total operating margins for small rural hospitals are \n     expected to decline from 4.2 percent in fiscal year 1998 to \n     negative 7.1 percent in fiscal year 2002.\n       (3) The Congressional Budget Office recently has estimated \n     that the amount of savings to the medicare program in fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2002 by reason of the amendments to that \n     program contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is \n     $206,000,000,000, exactly double the level of cuts expected \n     when the bill was enacted.\n       (4) Health care providers are beginning to provide fewer \n     health care services to medicare beneficiaries in both urban \n     and rural areas as a result of the implementation of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (5) The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2000 recognized that Congress has the responsibility to \n     review payment levels under the medicare program to ensure \n     that medicare beneficiaries have access to high-quality \n     health care services.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should--\n       (1) reject further reductions in the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act;\n       (2) reject extensions of the provisions of the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997; and\n       (3) target new resources for the medicare program that--\n       (A) address the unintended consequences of the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997; and\n       (B) ensure the access of medicare beneficiaries to high-\n     quality skilled nursing services, home health care services, \n     teaching hospitals, inpatient and outpatient hospital \n     services, and health care services in rural areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10128-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CRAPO (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1505\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Craig) \nsubmitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill \n(H.R. 2466) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior \nand related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and \nfor other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 10, line 16, after ``herein,'' insert ``of which \n     $500,000 of the amount available for consultation shall be \n     available for development of a voluntary-enrollment habitat \n     conservation plan for cold water fish in cooperation with the \n     States of Idaho and Montana (of which $250,000 shall be made \n     available to each of the States of Idaho and Montana), and''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10128-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10128-S10132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HARKIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1506\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. \nLincoln, and Mr. Sarbanes) proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1499 \nproposed by Mr. Daschle to the bill, S. 1233, supra; as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 1, line 3, strike all that follows \n     ``Sec.'' to the end of the amendment and insert the \n     following:\n       __.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfellow Kentuckian and friend Charles Bennett Greenwood of Central City, \nwho died July 16, 1999, at his home.\n  Charles, or C.B. to his friends, was a unique individual who loved \nhis home state of Kentucky and revered life in small-town Central City. \nYou see, C.B. lived all of his 93 years within a four block area of \ndowntown Central City. Almost all of the milestones of his life \noccurred within the same four blocks of Central City. C.B. never went \naway to college and took very few vacations. It was obvious to \neverybody who knew him that C.B. was satisfied with his view of the \nworld from Central City.\n  C.B. was born to William H. and Viola ``Louisa'' Greenwood on March \n6, 1906, at the family home on Fourth Street and went to school just a \nfew hundred feet from his birthplace. In 1934, C.B. and his bride, \nLouise Batsel, were married at the minister's residence on Third \nStreet, just one block away from the homeplace. All of C.B.'s \nchildren--daughter Margaret Ann Long of Oklahoma City; and sons Charles \nJr., William and David of Central City--were born at their home on \nFourth Street.\n  Incredibly, C.B. never worked more than four blocks from his \nbirthplace. In the 1920s, C.B. worked for J.C. Batsel Meat Market and \nPerry Drugstore and in 1932, he went to work for J.C. Penney, all of \nwhich were located downtown. In 1945, C.B. purchased Barnes Mercantile \nClothing Store on Broad Street, again just four blocks away from his \nbirthplace and residence. He worked at the store until he retired in \n1989. For 75 years C.B. walked to and from his jobs in downtown Central \nCity in deep snow or 100 degree weather.\n  An active community leader, C.B. was a member of the First Baptist \nChurch of Central City, and served on both the Central City Council and \nthe Central City School Board. C.B. was laid to rest in the Rose Hill \nCemetery in Central City, four city blocks from where he was born, \nlived his life, raised his children, worked and ran his business, and \nserved his community.\n  In today's highly mobile society, few people live their lives like \nC.B., rooted in their hometown. C.B. was a special person who was happy \nin his life and lived life to the fullest. I express my condolences to \nC.B.'s family--his wife, Louise, and children, Charles, Jr.; my close \nfriend Bill and his wife Leslie; and David, and Margaret; 10 \ngrandchildren, 9 great-grandchildren, and one great-great \ngrandchild.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10133-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO HIS HOLINESS KAREKIN I, CATHOLICOS OF THE ARMENIAN ORTHODOX \n                                 CHURCH\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to His \nHoliness Karekin I, Catholicos of the Armenian Orthodox Church. His \nHoliness passed away on June 29, 1999 at the Holy See of Etcmiadzin, \nArmenia.\n  In 1997, I had the opportunity to meet personally with His Holiness, \nthe supreme patriarch of the Armenian Church, in Yerevan. I was moved \nby his devotion to his church and the love and compassion he had for \nall people. His Holiness Karekin I was not only respected and loved by \nArmenian people throughout the world, but his wisdom, compassion and \ncourage was renowned in international religious circles. Throughout his \nlife, His Holiness traveled to many countries, including the United \nStates and my home state of Rhode Island, to strengthen and reconfirm \nthe faith of the Armenian community. He was truly an inspiration to all \nwho knew him.\n  His Holiness dedicated more than fifty years to his faith, and his \ndevotion raised him rapidly to the highest ranks of the Church. He was \nborn in the village of Kessab, Syria in 1932 and was ordained as a \npriest in the Church's celibate order in 1949 after his graduation from \nthe Armenian Church Seminary in Antilias, Lebanon. His Holiness was \nrecognized as an exceptional scholar and sent to Oxford University for \ntheological studies. After completing his studies, he returned to \nAntilias to serve as Dean of the seminary. His Holiness was recognized \nfor his leadership skills by being asked to lead church dioceses in \nIran and the United States. In 1977, he was elected Catholicos of the \nCatholicosate of Cilicia, based in Lebanon.\n  The people of Armenia elected Karekin I Supreme Catholicos of the \nArmenian people in 1995. Karekin I was the first Catholicos in \ncenturies to reign within an independent Armenian state. His Holiness \nworked tirelessly for the spiritual revival of the Armenian Orthodox \nChurch in Armenia. His Holiness also decentralized the infrastructure \nof the church in Armenia by adding new diocese throughout the country, \nand he restored churches and monasteries which had been closed during \nthe era of Soviet rule.\n  The Armenian people throughout the world are mourning the death of \nHis Holiness, and Armenia will be paying tribute to his extraordinary \nlife by holding a period of national mourning through August 8.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with the Armenian community in \nremembering the legacy of hope, courage, and compassion left by His \nHoliness Karekin I.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10133-4", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10133-S10134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LELAND PERRY\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this Friday, on the campus of \nBrigham Young University, in Provo, Utah, the family, friends, former \nassociates and successors of Leland M. Perry will gather to honor his \nquiet but substantial contributions to the dynamic growth and greatness \nthat characterizes BYU.\n  Leland Perry, who marks his 98th birthday on August 23, and who still\n\n[[Page S10134]]\n\nlives in Provo, was the director of the physical plant at BYU from \nApril 1947 to July 1957, when he and his late wife, McNone Perry, set \ntheir vocations aside for several years to organize and preside over \nthe West Spanish American Mission of the LDS Church.\n  Afterward, Mr. Perry went on to head the physical plant at Ricks \nCollege in Idaho, which is also an institution in the system of higher \neducation affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints, during that college's explosive building program. From there, \nhe was appointed director of all physical plants in the LDS Church's \nhigher education system, except BYU, until he retired in the mid 1960s.\n  Leland Perry directed BYU's physical plant during a time when the \nuniversity was beginning an era of enormous growth; and, from the \naccount I have heard, it is clear that he played an important role \nduring that critical period.\n  One especially noteworthy example typifies his vital contributions. \nIn 1955, he learned about a new concept for heating widely spread, \nisolated buildings, in a more efficient and less costly way, using \npressurized water, which was heated to levels much higher than the \nboiling point, and combined with a method of forced circulation. Until \nthen, steam was commonly used in such settings, delivered through pipes \nfrom a central heating plant. Heat engineering was still a young \nscience, so he took it upon himself to learn all he could about this \nnew technique. He then advocated its use in modernizing the BYU \nphysical plant.\n  Leland Perry did such a good job in mastering the concept and then in \nexplaining and advocating the system that his idea was accepted, and \nBYU because the first university in the United States to install and \nuse it campus-wide. Since then, virtually all other campuses of any \nsize have followed BYU's lead, savings untold millions of dollars for \nAmerican colleges and universities--and for students--nationwide.\n  At the dedication ceremony for the new system in 1957 former BYU \nPresident William F. Edwards said, ``Leland caught the vision of a new \nidea and had the courage to promote the idea.''\n  The physical plant of any major facility or complex of buildings is \neasy to take for granted. We tend not to notice the pipes and the \nboilers and the controls unless they break down. But they are the \nstructural bones and the circulatory system that make our buildings \nuseful, comfortable, and practical.\n  I might mention that I was a student at BYU during Leland's tenure as \nplant manager. I confess that I did not fully appreciate at the time \nthat there was heat in the library, the classrooms and in the dorms \nbecause of Leland Perry.\n  Leland Perry, like many Utahns, is truly a pioneer. With humility and \ndedication, he has made the vocation of caring for Utah's physical \nplant a calling. And, he led the way through the last half of this \ncentury and created the standards applied to his successors who will \nlead us into the next century.\n  I want to join my fellow Utahns and fellow Cougars in commending \nLeland Perry for his years of service and in wishing him a happy 98th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10134-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10134-S10135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SIGURD OLSON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute one \nof our nation's most beloved nature writers and dedicated wilderness \nconservationists, Mr. Sigurd Olson. As an architect of the federal \ngovernment's protection of wilderness areas, as well as a poetic voice \nthat captured the importance of these pristine sites, Mr. Olson left us \nand our children a legacy of natural sanctuaries and an ethic by which \nto better appreciate them.\n  Mr. President, 1999 marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of \nSigurd Olson. Over the July recess, I had the opportunity to travel to \nNorthern Minnesota to commemorate and celebrate Sigurd Olson's life and \nwork. I think it is fitting that the Senate take this opportunity to \nhonor the life of Mr. Olson, who sadly passed away 17 years ago, and to \nrenew our dedication to continue his legacy of wilderness preservation.\n  Born in Chicago in 1899, Sigurd Olson and his family soon moved to \nthe beautiful Door County Peninsula of Wisconsin. It was there that he \nformed his life-long attachment to nature and to outdoor recreation. \nHalf a century later, he described what he experienced as a boy along \nthe coast of Green Bay:\n\n       A school of perch darted in and out of the rocks. They were \n     green and gold and black, and I was fascinated by their \n     beauty. Seagulls wheeled and cried above me. Waves crashed \n     against the pier. I was alone in a wild and lovely place, \n     part of the dark forest through which I had come, and of all \n     the wild sounds and colors and feelings of the place I had \n     found. That day I entered into a life of indescribable beauty \n     and delight. There I believe I heard the singing wilderness \n     for the first time.\n\n  A few years after graduating from the University of Wisconsin in \nMadison, Olson moved to northeastern Minnesota. He traveled and guided \nfor many years in the surrounding millions of acres of lakeland \nwilderness--what eventually became the Boundary Waters Canoe Area \nWilderness--and he grew convinced that wilderness provided the \nspiritual experiences vital to modern society. It was this conviction \nthat formed the basis of both his conservation and his writing careers. \nAs he said at a Sierra Club conference in 1965:\n\n       I have discovered in a lifetime of traveling in primitive \n     regions, a lifetime of seeing people living in the wilderness \n     and using it, that there is a hard core of wilderness need in \n     everyone, a core that makes its spiritual values a basic \n     human necessity. There is no hiding it. . . . Unless we can \n     preserve places where the endless spiritual needs of man can \n     be fulfilled and nourished, we will destroy our culture and \n     ourselves.\n\n   Olson became an active conservationist in the 1920's, fighting to \nkeep roads, dams and airplanes out of his ``special place'' in \nnortheastern Minnesota. He went on to serve as the president of both \nthe National Parks Association and the Wilderness Society. Yet, perhaps \nhis greatest contribution to conservation came during his tenure as an \nadvisor to Secretary of the Interior from 1959 to the early 1970's, \nwhen he helped draft the Wilderness Act, which became law in 1964 and \nestablished the U.S. wilderness preservation system that still exists \ntoday.\n  While I never knew Sigurd Olson, those who worked with ``Sig,'' as he \nwas called, were infected by his unwavering commitment to the Boundary \nWaters and his desire to help people truly understand the meaning and \nlegacy of wilderness.\n  Central to Olson's agenda was his perseverance as public advocate for \nthe Boundary Waters, in spite of the sometimes quite open hostility \nthat he faced in taking that stand. Twenty-two years ago on July 8, \n1977, a public field hearing was held at Ely High School on Congressman \nFraser's bill that became the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act \nof 1978. Sigurd Olson, then 77 years old, stepped forward to testify in \nthe midst of hisses, catcalls and boos from the roughly thousand-person \ncrowd that packed the hearing. Despite the fact that an effigy in his \nlikeness was hanging outside the school, he testified, saying in part:\n\n       Some places should be preserved from development and \n     exploitation for they satisfy a human need for solace, \n     belonging, and perspective. In the end we turn to nature in a \n     frenzied chaotic world to find silence--oneness--wholeness--\n     spiritual release.\n\n  I am inspired by Sigurd Olson's actions in my own work, as I have \nbeen inspired by my predecessor in the United States Senate Gaylord \nNelson. I also share Olson's great respect for America's public lands \nand for the Boundary Waters.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, I recently visited the Boundary Waters \nand spent a day canoeing in the pristine area that Olson loved so \ndearly on the Hegman Lake chain. His words, from his first book, The \nSinging Wilderness, best describe the experience:\n\n       The movement of a canoe is like a reed in the wind. Silence \n     is part of it and the sounds of lapping water, bird songs, \n     and wind in the trees. It is part of the medium through which \n     it floats, the sky, the water, the shores. . . . There is \n     magic in the feel of a paddle and the movement of a canoe, a \n     magic compounded of distance, adventure, solitude, and peace. \n     The way of a canoe is the way of the wilderness, and of a \n     freedom almost forgotten. It is an antidote to insecurity, \n     the open door to waterways of ages past and a way of life \n     with profound and abiding satisfactions. When a man is part \n     of his canoe, he is part of all that canoes have ever known.\n\n  In addition to canoeing the Hegman Lakes, I also had an opportunity \nto visit Listening Point on Burntside Lake with Sigurd Olson's son, Bob \nOlson, and Bob's wife, Vonnie Olson.\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\n Many people have a special place where they go to experience nature. \nPerhaps it is a park, or a campsite, or a favorite hiking trail. For \nSigurd Olson, it was a cabin on a tree-covered glaciated point of rock. \nHe called it his ``Listening Point,'' and it is at the center of his \nbook of the same name.\n\n  In his book, Sigurd Olson talks about that place on Burntside Lake \nfrom his first night sleeping there under the stars to the eventual \nbuilding of his cabin:\n       ``From this one place I would explore the entire north and \n     all life, including my own,'' he writes. ``For me, it would \n     be a listening-post from which I might even hear the music of \n     the spheres.''\n\n  From his cabin, Olson also experienced the wonder and danger of \nsignificant storms in the Boundary Waters, an experience nearly \nidentical to my own. Over the Fourth of July weekend this year, shortly \nbefore I arrived, serious winds hit the Boundary Waters, downing trees \nin a quarter of the wilderness area.\n  I was comforted to learn, as I arrived at Listening Point to see Bob \nOlson clearing trees from the driveway, that Listening Point has \nweathered significant storms before. Sigurd Olson writes of another \nstorm, and its aftermath in Of Time and Place:\n\n       As we approached Listening Point we could see the damage, \n     trees down and twisted, blocking the road to the cabin. We \n     chopped and hacked our way through to the turnaround and \n     found the trail to the cabin was a crisscross of broken \n     treetops, a jackstraw puzzle of tangled debris. It was \n     unbelievable; I looked at the trees, remembering how over the \n     years we had treasured each one of them. . . .\n  Olson continues:\n       I sometimes wonder about the meaning of such things as this \n     tornado--why it happened, why it leapfrogged over some areas \n     and hit others. We paddled to the islands beyond Listening \n     Point and saw where many trees had been blown over, all old \n     landmarks along the shore. They would lie there for many \n     years until they, too, would sink into the soil and \n     disappear.\n  Mr. President, I have been a defender of the Boundary Waters, and my \nconstituents adore this area.\n  I have also joined in the fight to protect the public lands of \nSouthern Utah, and have sponsored legislation to have the lands of \nwilderness potential in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore \nidentified. All my efforts are linked to unfinished business that \nSigurd Olson began in the Boundary Waters and to his commitment to \ndesignating and protecting our country's special wild places.\n  In addition to conveying my own admiration for Sigurd Olson, I rise \ntoday to share the reflections of my own home state. Wisconsinites have \na special fondness for Sigurd Olson for several reasons. Olson, who \nbegan his environmental education as a kid from Northern Wisconsin who \nloved the outdoors, turned out to be a serious conservationist whose \nname is among the greatest conservationists of the Twentieth Century. \nWith his special wilderness writing, Olson was a reformer who didn't \ncome across as self-important.\n  Second, Wisconsinites truly appreciate an accomplished outdoor \nenthusiast turned advocate. That's a rarity in politics, especially \nthese days. Olson will be long remembered for his character and \nfundamental decency in defense of the wilderness he loved. On behalf of \nmyself and the citizens of my state, as well as all Americans, I wish \nSigurd Olson a very happy birthday. We are a greater country for his \ndedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10135-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO FREDERICK A. MEISTER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, my home state, the great \nCommonwealth of Kentucky is known throughout the world for many fine \nthings--fast horses, bluegrass countryside, the best burley tobacco in \nthe world and winning basketball teams. And of course, Kentucky is also \nknown as the home of fine Bourbon whiskey.\n  Bourbon is interwoven through the history, heritage and economy of \nour Commonwealth. First developed in 1797 by an early settler from \nVirginia named Elijah Pepper who settled in Versailles, Kentucky and \nbuilt a still behind the Woodford County Courthouse, Bourbon is a \ndistinctively Kentucky product that still plays an important role in \nour state's economy.\n  For the past nineteen years, the interests of this deeply rooted \nKentucky industry have been served very well by a gentleman with no \nKentucky roots of his own: a man from the snowy plains of Minnestoa--\nFrederick A. Meister. For the past nineteen years, Fred Meister has \nserved as President and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the \nUnited States (DISCUS). He is planning to retire soon and I wanted to \ntake this opportunity to thank him, on the behalf of the many \nKentuckians who are employed by the distillery industry throughout our \nCommonwealth for a job well done.\n  While the leadership of many Washington trade associations seems to \ncome and go, Fred's tenure at DISCUS stands out as a distinguished \nexception. For almost two decades, the millions of Americans who choose \nto drink in moderation could not have had a more zealous advocate. At \nthe same time, Fred and DISCUS have wisely taken a hard line against \ndrunk driving and other forms of reckless drinking.\n  Whether the issue has been taxes, free trade or the First Amendment \nfreedom of distillers to advertise their products on television and \nradio, Fred has been there making a persuasive case for the spirit \nindustry's legitimate commercial interests. No one has fought harder or \nmore effectively on these issues than Fred Meister.\n  At the same time, Fred and DISCUS long ago recognized that the \nbeverage alcohol industry mut do its part to stop drunk driving and \nother forms of reckless drinking. Under Fred's leadership, the industry \nhas made great progress in this regard.\n  Under his leadership, DISCUS has successfully developed model \nlegislation, the Drunk Driving Prevention Act, which has encouraged \nmany states to pass life saving laws preventing drunk driving, \nincluding a ban on open containers and ``zero tolerance'' for underage \nconsumption. Fred was among the first to call for the establishment of \nthe Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving. Subsequently, he served \nwith distinction on this panel. Under Fred's leadership, DISCUS has \nmaintained and enforced a strict Code of Good Practice governing the \nadvertising and marketing of distilled spirits. In 1991, the majority \nof the DISCUS companies made a multi-million dollar investment to form \nan organization known as the Century Council which went on to develop a \nnumber of life saving programs aimed at the problems of underage \ndrinking, drunk driving and, most recently, college binge drinking.\n  As Fred Meister steps down from the leadership at the Distilled \nSpirits Council, he leaves behind him a proud and positive legacy and \nhe leaves behind an industry that is both commercially strong and \nsocially responsible.\n  I know that I can safely speak on the behalf of the thousands of \nKentuckians who earn their living in the distilling industry when I say \n``Congratulations and thank You'' to Fred Meister for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10135-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10135-S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      APPRECIATION TO JOHN BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on Friday, August 6, 1999 John Bradley \ncompletes a two year assignment to the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. In view of his outstanding performance and contributions to \nthe Committee and our country's veterans, I am taking this occasion to \nrecognize John.\n  In mid 1997, the Committee was without a professional staff member \nwith expertise in veterans' health care delivery system. I turned to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs for the temporary assignment of such \na person. In truth, I anticipated retaining whoever was assigned only \nuntil such time as my Staff Director was able to interview and propose \na permanent professional staff member. VA's then Acting Secretary \nHerschel Gober agreed to the detailing of John Bradley since John had \nserved a similar assignment to this Committee in the 103rd Congress.\n  John Bradley turned out to be the consummate professional and the \nsearch for a permanent professional staff member was halted. A veteran \nof the Vietnam conflict and a career employee of the VA with over 25 \nyears of service, primarily with the Veterans Health Administration, \nJohn made an immediate impact. With the Committee's legislative agenda \ncompleted, he directed with great professional skill the rigors of \nstaff conferencing with his House counterparts.\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\n  It also soon became apparent that John was not a bureaucrat or intent \non maintaining the status quo. In fact, he is an intellectual and \ninnovative thinker who is willing to explore new ideas to advance the \ncause of veterans health care.\n  During his assignment to the Committee, John played a major role in \nshaping the following legislation: the Veterans' Health Care \nImprovements Act of 1998, the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998, \nand the Veterans Compensation Cost of Living Adjustment Act of 1998. \nAdditionally, John has spent many hours this year working on S. 1076, \nthe Veterans Benefits Improvements Act of 1999 which I hope will pass \nthe Senate soon.\n  Upon his departure and on behalf of the Committee, I extend my deep \nappreciation to John for his courage, his innovation, his \nprofessionalism and, above all, his enduring concern for veterans. He \nshall be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/03/senate-section/article/S10136-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2465), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report. (The conference report is \nprinted in the House proceedings of the Record of July 27, 1999.)\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to bring before the \nSenate the Military Construction Conference Report for fiscal year \n2000.\n  Mr. President, this conference report was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last week by a vote of 412 to 8. It was sent to the \nSenate late last week and now awaits or final passage.\n  We have worked hard with our House colleagues to bring the Military \nConstruction Conference to a successful conclusion.\n  It reflects a strong bipartisan effort of behalf of the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Both bodies took a different perspective on the allocation of \nmilitary construction funding for the Department of Defense.\n  However, in the final conference report, we met our goals of \npromoting quality of life initiatives and enhancing mission readiness.\n  Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to highlight. It \nprovides a total of $8.37 billion for military construction.\n  Even though this is an increase of $2.9 billion over the President's \nbudget for fiscal year 2000, it is still a reduction of $79 million \nfrom what was appropriated last year.\n  The conferees rejected the administration proposal to incrementally \nfund military construction and family housing projects throughout the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Instead the conferees believed that fully funding these projects was \nessential for the well being and moral of the men and women who serve \nin uniform.\n  Some 43 percent of the bill is allocated to family housing--a total \nof $3.6 billion. This includes new construction, improvements to \nexisting units and funding for operation and maintenance of that \nhousing.\n  We strongly protected quality of life initiatives. We provided $643 \nmillion for barracks, $22 million for child development centers, and \n$151 million for hospital and medical facilities.\n  We provided a total of $695 million for the Guard and Reserve \ncomponents. Overall this represents an increase of $560 million from \nthe President's budget request.\n  Many of those projects will enhance the readiness and mission \ncapabilities of our Reserve and Guard forces, vital to out national \ndefense.\n  I would like to thank my ranking member, Senator Murray, for her \nassistance and support throughout this process. She and her staff was \nextremely helpful.\n  I commend this product to the Senate and recommend that it be signed \nby the President without delay.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nthis conference report on the fiscal year 2000 military construction \nappropriations bill--the first of the 13 regular appropriations bills \nto be completed this year.\n  This is a good bill, leaner than we would wish but sufficient to meet \nthe Services' most pressing military construction needs, particularly \nin terms of readiness and quality of life projects. The projects funded \nin this bill will give the men and women of our armed forces--and their \nfamilies--a wide array of improved facilities in which to work, to \ntrain, and to live.\n  In my home state of Washington, for example, this bill provides \nnearly $129 million in funding for 16 different military construction \nprojects plus $9 million for Army family housing at Fort Lewis.\n  Congress was faced with a difficult situation this year when the \nPentagon, in a radical departure from regular procedure, requested \nincremental funding for the entire slate of fiscal year 2000 military \nconstruction projects. Thanks to the cooperation of Chairman Stevens \nand Ranking Member Byrd, and to the efforts of Senator Burns on the\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n\nSubcommittee, it didn't happen. What's more, we included language in \nour Committee report directing the Administration to fully fund all \nmilitary construction requests in future budgets.\n  Unfortunately, this bill reflects a continued decline in the amount \nof money that is being allocated to military construction. This year's \nbill is funded at a level of $8.374 billion, which is $76 million less \nthan the fiscal year 1999 bill. And this is at a time when funding for \nthe Defense appropriations bill is heading toward a major increase. \nMilitary construction does not have the glamour of some of the gee \nwhiz, high-tech items in the defense bill, but it is an integral part \nof readiness and quality of life in the military. If military \nconstruction is underfunded, we will wind up undercutting our nation's \nwar fighting capability. We must not allow that to occur.\n  We will continue to fight the good fight for military construction \ndollars, ably led by our chairman, Senator Burns, who is an extremely \neffective advocate for the needs of the military and a pleasure to work \nwith on the Committee. I thank Senator Burns, and Senators Stevens and \nByrd, for their unflagging support, and I also thank the Subcommittee \nstaff for their hard work on this bill.\n  This is a good bipartisan conference report, and I urge my colleagues \nto accept it so that it can be sent to the President without delay and \nbecome the first fiscal year 2000 regular appropriations bills to be \nsigned into law.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the conference report be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the conference report be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
