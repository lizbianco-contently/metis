KARL KENNETH STEGALL\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it has been an honor to be with Dr. Karl \nStegall this morning and to be blessed by his prayer. He is pastor of \nthe First United Methodist Church of Montgomery, AL. First Methodist is \none of the great Methodist churches in Alabama, and, in fact, of all of \nMethodism. It has had two of its pastors become United Methodist \nbishops. Indeed, Karl himself was endorsed by the 600 pastors and 600 \nlaity of the Alabama-West Florida Conference for the Episcopality \nseveral years ago.\n  Karl grew up in rural Alabama, not too far from where I did. It is \nconsidered to be a poor county, and a poor area, but not poor in things \nthat matter. He even came over to Camden once and won the beef \ncompetition with the FFA.\n  But he has not forgotten his heritage. He has served in his career at \nFirst United Methodist Andalusia, First Bonifay, Whitfield Memorial, \nand was district superintendent. For the last 18 years, he has been \npastor of First Methodist.\n  It has been a heavenly match. That great gothic church, with its \nsoaring ceiling and buttresses and superb choir, has blossomed under \nhis leadership. Attendance has grown. Young people are everywhere. The \nchurch has expanded and grown in so many different ways to bless the \ncommunity. He served as a leader on the Board of Global Ministries of \nthe United Methodist Church and always fought aggressively to ensure \nthat every dollar contributed, as I have heard him say, from the small, \nindividual church men and women, was spent wisely and effectively.\n  He is loved by all, but he has courage and is willing to speak \nforcefully. He recently delivered a sermon when Alabama was considering \nwhether or not to adopt a lottery. He questioned the wisdom of having \nthe State encourage people to invest their money in random chances to \nbe rich. That sermon was received very well, passed all over the State, \nand the State eventually rejected that choice.\n  His wife, Brenda, and he have been partners throughout their \nministry, and they have two daughters. He is a beloved minister by his \ncongregation, by his fellow ministers, and respected by all in the \ncommunity.\n  He is a Christian clergyman of the finest kind. While he would have \nbeen successful in any profession, he chose to give his life to the \ngreatest profession.\n  By his fine prayer today, we are blessed. By his life and ministry, \nthe people of his church have been blessed. And by his presence today \nhe serves as a recognition of the constant and superb service delivered \nby tens of thousands of ministers throughout this Nation who daily \nenrich the lives of their parishioners; who serve them in times of \nillness and sickness; who minister to them in times of emotional \nstress, divorce, and all kinds of family challenges; who celebrate with \nthem marriages and births. Those thousands and thousands of ministers \nwho do that daily are not run by the Federal Government. They are not \npaid by this Government, but they are there, serving their faith and \ntheir Lord.\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\n  So we are, indeed, delighted to have with us today one of our finest \nChristian ministers in the State of Alabama, Dr. Karl Stegall.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9406-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Under the previous order, the joint resolution \nis advanced to third reading.\n  The joint resolution (H. J. Res. 109) was ordered to a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be up to 7 hours for final \ndebate, with 6 hours under the control of the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, and 1 hour under the control of the Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Stevens.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As an opening statement on this continuing resolution \nthat is now before the Senate, I want to state that this is a simple 6-\nday continuing resolution. This bill will fund ongoing Federal programs \nat the same rate and under the same conditions as currently applied to \neach agency of our Federal Government.\n  The continuing resolution now pending before the Senate is in the \nsame form as those passed in previous years to bridge Federal spending \nuntil the full year's appropriations acts are completed. This committee \nhas made good progress this week in advancing work on the fiscal year \n2001 bills. The energy and water bill was filed last night and should \nbe taken up in the House later today. Work is nearly completed on the \nInterior appropriations bill, and the conference on the Transportation \nbill will meet later today. I want to assure all of our colleagues of \nour determination to complete the work of the Appropriations Committee \nwithin the next week, to meet the target adjournment date of Friday, \nOctober 6.\n  Hopefully, this will be the only CR needed for the remainder of the \nconsideration of the appropriations bills for the fiscal year 2001.\n  A second continuing resolution may, however, be needed to ensure the \nPresident has the required period that the Constitution gives him to \nreview the bills that are passed by the House and Senate as conference \nreports once they are presented to the President.\n  Mr. President, we are in a difficult situation this year because we \nare adjourning this evening and will not be here through the full \nperiod of September. We will miss 2 days of the time we would otherwise \nhave to complete our work. Therefore, it is necessary that the Senate \napprove this continuing resolution.\n  I urge the Senate to do so and we will strive to complete our work \nwithin the next week.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in order that I do not lose the time \nallotted to me, 1 hour, I ask unanimous consent that the time of the \nquorum call not be charged against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the item before the Senate, the \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.J. Res. 109. The Senator from West Virginia \ncontrols 6 hours and the Senator from Alaska 1 hour.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Has any time been charged against----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has used 3 minutes. \nThere has been no time charged against the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, to begin with, I should say that I intend to support \nthe short-term continuing resolution. I think it is very important that \nwe do so. But I have reserved this time for the purpose of expressing \nconcerns about what is happening to the Senate and, in particular, what \nis happening to the appropriations process. Several of my colleagues \nwill join me as we move through the morning and the afternoon. I shall \ndo so without, of course, pointing my finger of criticism at any \nSenator, naming any Senator. I merely want to talk about what is \nhappening to our Senate, its rules, its processes. And I intend to \nabide by the rules concerning debate. I say that at the start.\n  Mr. President, section 7, article I, of the U.S. Constitution, \nstates: ``All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of \nRepresentatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments \nas on other bills.''\n  Let me quote again the last portion of section 7, article I: ``but \nthe Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills,'' \nmeaning the Senate may propose or concur with amendments on any bill, \nwhether it is a revenue bill or otherwise. When I say ``bills,'' I \ninclude, of course, resolutions.\n  Thus, Mr. President, the organic law of our Republic assures \nSenators--all Senators; Republicans and Democrats--the right to offer \namendments, not only to bills for raising revenue, but also ``other \nbills.''\n  The requirement that revenue bills shall originate in the House of \nRepresentatives grew out of the Great Compromise, which was entered \ninto on July 16, 1787. It was this Great Compromise that provided for \nequality of the States in the Upper House, with each State, large or \nsmall, having two votes. And, but for which, the Constitutional \nConvention would have ended in failure, and instead of a United States \nof America, which we have today, we would have had, in all likelihood, \na ``Balkanized States of America'' from sea to shining sea--from the \nAtlantic to the Pacific--from the Canadian border to the Gulf of \nMexico. The small States at the Constitutional Convention were adamant \nin their demands for equal status with the large States in the Upper \nHouse, regardless of size or population, so that the small State of \nRhode Island, for example, had an equal vote in the Senate with the \nlarge State of New York which was larger and with a greater population. \nAll States are equal in this body.\n  When the large States yielded to the small States in this regard, the \nway was open and paved for eventual success in the attainment of the \nConstitution which was then sent to the States for ratification. As a \npart of that compromise, the large States demanded that revenue bills \noriginate in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S9407]]\n\n  Thus, the freedom to offer amendments in the Senate is assured by the \nConstitution of the United States. And what about the freedom to speak? \nWhat about the freedom to debate? Is that assured in the Senate? Yes. \nSection 6 of article I of the United States Constitution states:\n\n       And for any speech or debate in either House, they shall \n     not be questioned in any other place.\n\n  So I cannot be questioned in any other place. James Madison, who was \na Member of the other body could not be questioned in any other place. \nNo Senator could be questioned in any other place. But what about the \nfreedom to debate at length; in other words, what about a filibuster? \nIs there any limitation on debate in the Senate today? No, except when \ncloture is invoked, or when there are time limitations set by unanimous \nconsent of all Senators.\n  Debate could be limited under rule 10 of the 1778 rules of the \nContinental Congress, by the adoption of the previous question. \nLikewise, when the Senate adopted its 1789 rules under the new \nConstitution, debate could be limited by invoking the previous \nquestion. However, in its first revision of the Senate rules in 1806, \nthe Senate dropped the motion for the previous question. As a matter of \nfact, Aaron Burr, when he left the Vice Presidency in 1805, recommended \nthat the previous question be dropped. Until 1917, when the first \ncloture rule was adopted, there was no limitation on debate in the \nSenate, unlike the House of Representatives, where the previous \nquestion can still be moved even today.\n  As we all know, of course, 60 votes are required in the Senate to \ninvoke cloture and thus limit debate. The previous question not being \nincluded in the Senate rules, just what is the ``previous question''? \nThomas Jefferson in his ``Manual'' explains it as follows: ``When any \nquestion is before the House, any member may move a previous question, \n`Whether that question (called the main question) shall now be put?' If \nit pass in the affirmative, then the main question is to be put \nimmediately, and no man may speak anything further to it, either to add \nor alter . . . if the nays prevail, the main question shall not then be \nput.''\n  Hence, the use of the motion to put the previous question is an \neffective way to end debate and vote immediately on the main question.\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows--the Chair being \noccupied at the moment by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nBunning--in the other body, the previous question can be used to end \ndebate, if a majority of the Members there so desire. But that is not \nso in the Senate. It was so until 1806, but no more in the Senate.\n  Of the various legislative branches throughout the world today, only \n60 are bicameral in nature, and of these 60 bicameral legislatures \naround the world, only the Upper Houses of the U.S. and Italy are not \nsubordinated to the Lower House. Senators should understand what a \nprivilege it is to serve in the U.S. Senate. The U.S. Senate is the \npremiere Upper Chamber in the world, two of the main reasons being that \nin the U.S. Senate there exists the right of unlimited debate and the \nright to offer amendments.\n  Another singular feature of the U.S. Senate is in the fact that it is \nthe forum of the States. It is not just a forum; it is the forum of the \nStates. The Senate, therefore, represents the ``Federal'' concept, \nwhile the House of Representatives, being based on population, \nrepresents the ``national'' concept in our constitutional system. In \nthe very beginning, the Senate was seen as the bulwark of the State \ngovernments against despotic presidential power; it was the special \ndefender of State sovereignty. It was meant to be and exists today as \nthe special defender of State sovereignty. The Senate was also seen as \na check against the ``radical'' tendencies which the House of \nRepresentatives might display.\n  I have been a Member of this body now for 42 years, and the longer I \nserve, the more convinced I am of the efficacy of the Senate rules as \nprotectors of the Senate's right to unlimited debate and the Senate's \nright to amend. The Senate is not a second House of Representatives, \nnor is it an adjunct to the House of Representatives. It is a far \ndifferent body from the House of Representatives. And it is a far \ndifferent body by virtue of the Constitution and by virtue of Senate \nrules and precedents. The Constitution and the Senate rules have made \nthe Senate a far different body from the House of Representatives.\n  Thomas Jefferson, in his Manual of Parliamentary Practice, emphasized \nthe importance of adhering to the rules:\n\n       Mr. Onslow, the ablest among the Speakers of the House of \n     Commons, used to say, ``It was a maxim he had often heard \n     when he was a young man, from old and experienced Members, \n     that nothing tended more to throw power into the hands of the \n     Administration, and those who acted with a majority of the \n     House of Commons, than a neglect of, or departure from, the \n     rules of proceedings; that these forms, as instituted by our \n     ancestors, operated as a check and control on the actions of \n     the majority, and that they were, in many instances, a \n     shelter and protection to the minority, against the attempts \n     of power.'' So far, the maxim is certainly true--\n\n  Continued Mr. Onslow, speaking of the British House of Commons--\n\n     and is founded in good sense, as it is always in the power of \n     the majority, by their number, to stop any improper measure \n     proposed on the part of their opponents--\n\n  The minority--\n\n     the only weapons by which the minority can defend themselves \n     against similar attempts from those in power are the forms \n     and rules of proceeding which have been adopted as they were \n     found necessary, from time to time, and become the law of the \n     House--\n\n  He was talking about the law of the House of Commons--\n\n     by a strict adherence to which the weaker party--\n\n  Meaning the minority--\n\n     can only be protected from those irregularities and abuses \n     which these forms were intended to check, and which the \n     wantonness of power is but too often apt to suggest to large \n     and successful majorities.\n\n  Now there you have it from the mother country, from the House of \nCommons. So when we speak of rules, Mr. Onslow laid it out very clearly \nas to the supreme importance of the rules as protectors of a minority.\n  Jefferson went on to say:\n\n       And whether these forms be in all cases the most rational \n     or not is really not of so great importance. It is much more \n     material that there should be a rule to go by than what that \n     rule is; that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in \n     business not subject to the caprice of the Speaker--\n\n  Jefferson is talking about the Speaker of the House of Commons, and \nhe is also referring to the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\n     --or capriciousness of the members.\n\n  Once more, this is Jefferson talking:\n\n       It is much more material that there should be a rule to go \n     by than what that rule is; that there may be a uniformity of \n     proceeding in business not subject to the caprice of the \n     Speaker or capriciousness of the members. It is very material \n     that order, decency, and regularity be preserved in a \n     dignified public body.\n\n  Nothing could be more true than Jefferson's observations which I have \nread in part.\n  Now, Mr. President, my own experience with the Senate rules compels \nme to appreciate the wisdom that Vice President Adlai Stevenson \nexpressed in his farewell address to the Senate on March 3, 1897. I \nbelieve his observation is as fitting today as it was at the end of the \n19th century. Let me say that again. I believe his observation is as \nfitting today, as we close the 20th century, as it was at the end of \nthe 19th century. Here is what he said:\n\n       It must not be forgotten that the rules governing this \n     body--\n\n  The Senate--\n\n     are founded deep in human experience; that they are the \n     result of centuries of tireless effort in legislative halls, \n     to conserve, to render stable and secure, the rights and \n     liberties which have been achieved by conflict. By its rules, \n     the Senate wisely fixes the limits to its own power. Of those \n     who clamor against the Senate, and its methods of procedure, \n     it may be truly said: ``They know not what they do.'' In this \n     Chamber alone are preserved without restraint--\n\n  This is Adlai Stevenson talking here--\n\n     two essentials of wise legislation and of good government: \n     the right of amendment and of debate. Great evils often \n     result from hasty legislation; rarely from the delay which \n     follows full discussion and deliberation. In my humble \n     judgment, the historic Senate--preserving the unrestricted \n     right of amendment and of debate, maintaining intact the \n     time-honored parliamentary methods and amenities which \n     unfailingly secure action after deliberation--possesses in \n     our scheme of government a value which cannot be measured by \n     words.\n\n  How true. I hope that Senators will read again these words that were \nspoken by our ancestors concerning the\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\nimportance of the rules and precedents, the importance of amendments, \nthe right to amend, and the importance of the freedom to debate at \nlength. I hope Senators will read this.\n  We all know that the Senate is unique in its sharing of power with \nthe President in the making of treaties, and in its confirmation powers \nwith respect to nominations, as well as in its judicial function as the \nsole trier of impeachments brought by the House of Representatives. The \nSenate is also unique in the quality that exists between and among \nstates of unequal territorial size and population. But we must not \nforget that the right of extended, and even unlimited debate, together \nwith the unfettered right to offer amendments, are the main \ncornerstones of the Senate's uniqueness. The right of extended debate \nis also a primary reason that the United States Senate is the most \npowerful Upper Chamber in the world today.\n\n  The occasional abuse of this right has a painful side effect, but it \nnever has been--I am talking about the right to debate at length; I am \ntalking about filibusters, if you please --never will be fatal to the \noverall public good in the long run.\n  The word ``filibuster'' has an unfortunate connotation. But there \nhave been many useful filibusters during the existence of this \nRepublic. I have engaged in some of them. There has not been a real, \nhonest to goodness old-type filibuster in this Senate in years and \nyears.\n  Without the right of unlimited debate, of course, there would be no \nfilibusters, but there would also be no Senate, as we know it. The good \noutweighs the bad. Filibusters have proved to be a necessary evil, \nwhich must be tolerated lest the Senate lose its special strength and \nbecome a mere appendage of the House of Representatives. If this should \nhappen, which God avert, the American Senate would cease to be ``that \nremarkable body'' about which William Ewart Gladstone spoke--``the most \nremarkable of all the inventions of modern politics.''\n  Without the potential for filibusters, that power to check a Senate \nmajority or an imperial presidency would be destroyed.\n  The right of unlimited debate is a power too sacred to be trifled \nwith. Our English forebears knew it. They had been taught by sad \nexperience the need for freedom of debate in their House of Commons. So \nthey provided for freedom of debate in the English Bill of Rights in \n1689. And our Bill of Rights, in many ways, has its roots deep in \nEnglish parliamentary history. As Lyndon Baines Johnson said on March \n9, 1949: ``. . . If I should have the opportunity to send into the \ncountries behind the iron curtain one freedom and only one, I know what \nmy choice would be. . . . I would send to those nations the right of \nunlimited debate in their legislative chambers. . . . If we now, in \nhaste and irritation, shut off this freedom, we shall be cutting off \nthe most vital safeguard which minorities possess against the tyranny \nof momentary majorities.''\n  I served with Lyndon Johnson in this Senate when he was the majority \nleader. We had some real filibusters in those days. I sat in that chair \nup there 22 hours on one occasion--22 hours in one sitting--almost a \nday and a night. So Lyndon Johnson was one who could speak with \nauthority based on experience in that regard.\n  Arguments against filibusters have largely centered around the \nprinciple that the majority should rule in a democratic society. The \nvery existence of the Senate, however, embodies an equally valid tenet \nin American democracy: the principle that minorities have rights.\n  I am not here today to advocate filibusters. I am talking about the \nfreedom of debate--unlimited debate, if necessary.\n  Furthermore, a majority of Senators, at a given time and on a \nparticular issue, may not truly represent majority sentiment in the \ncountry. Senators from a few of the more populous states may, in fact, \nrepresent a majority in the nation while numbering a minority of votes \nin the Senate, where all the states are equal. Additionally, a minority \nopinion in the country may become the majority view, once the people \nare more fully informed about an issue through lengthy debate and \nscrutiny. A minority today may become the majority tomorrow.\n  Take the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example. From the day that \nSenator Mike Mansfield, then the majority leader, submitted the motion \nto proceed to the civil rights bill to the day that the final vote was \ncast on that bill, 103 calendar days had passed--103 days on one bill, \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. That is almost as many days on one bill \nin 1964 as the Senate has been in session this whole year to date.\n  Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution thought of the Senate \nas the safeguard against hasty and unwise action by the House of \nRepresentatives in response to temporary whims and storms of passion \nthat may sweep over the land. Delay, deliberation, and debate--though \ntime consuming--may avoid mistakes that would be regretted in the long \nrun.\n  The Senate is the only forum in the government where the perfection \nof laws may be unhurried and where controversial decisions may be \nhammered out on the anvil of lengthy debate. The liberties of a free \npeople will always be safe where a forum exists in which open and \nunlimited debate is allowed. It is not just for the convenience of \nSenators that there be a forum in which free and unlimited debate can \nbe had. More importantly, the liberties of a free people will always be \nsafe where a forum exists in which open and unlimited debate is \nallowed. That forum is here in this Chamber.\n  The most important argument supporting extended debate in the Senate, \nand even the right to filibuster, is the system of checks and balances. \nThe Senate operates as the balance wheel in that system, because it \nprovides the greatest check of all against an all-powerful executive \nthrough the privilege that Senators have to discuss without hindrance \nwhat they please for as long as they please. Senators ought to reflect \non these things. There is nothing like history and the experience of \nhistory that can teach the lessons that we can learn from the past. A \nminority can often use publicity to focus popular opinion upon matters \nthat can embarrass the majority and the executive.\n  Mr. President, we have reviewed briefly these facts about the U.S. \nSenate: (1) That it is a legislative body in which the smaller states, \nlike the State of West Virginia, like the State of Kentucky, like the \nState of Rhode Island, the State of Wyoming, the State of Montana, \nregardless of territory or the size of population, are equal to the \nlarger states in the union, with each state having two votes; (2) that \nit is a forum of the states and, from the beginning, was representative \nof the sovereignty of the individual states within the federal system; \n(3) that aside from its uniqueness with respect to treaties, \nnominations, and impeachment trials, the Senate is unique among the \nUpper Chambers of the world in that it is a forum in which amendments \ncan be offered to bills and resolutions passed by the Lower House, and \nin which its members have a right to unlimited debate. The Senate has, \ntherefore, been referred to as the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. Because of its members' rights to amend and to debate without \nlimitation as to time, Woodrow Wilson referred to the Senate as the \ngreatest Upper Chamber that exists. Because of its unique powers, the \nrecord is replete throughout the history of this republic with \ninstances in which the Senate has demonstrated the wisdom of the \nFramers in making it the main balance wheel in our Constitutional \nsystem of separation of powers and checks and balances. It is a chamber \nin which bad legislation has been relegated to the dust bin, good \nlegislation has originated, and the people of the country have been \ninformed of the facts concerning the great issues of the day. Woodrow \nWilson, himself, stated that the informing function of the legislative \nbranch was as important if not more so than its legislative function.\n  It has checked the impulsiveness, at times, of the other body, and it \nhas also been a check against an overweening executive. In the course \nof the 212 years since its beginning in March 1789, the Senate has, by \nand large, fulfilled the expectations of its Framers and proved itself \nto be the brightest spark of genius that emanated from the anvil of \ndebate and controversy at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia \nduring that hot summer of 1787. However, over the last\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\nfew years, however, I have viewed with increasing concern that the \nSenate is no longer fulfilling, as it once did, its raison d'etre, or \npurpose for being.\n  More and more, the offering of amendments in the Senate is being \ndiscouraged and debate is being stifled. I can say that because I've \nbeen here. Quite often, when bills or resolutions are called up for \ndebate, the cloture motion is immediately laid down in an effort to \nspeed the action on the measure and preclude non germane \namendments. Mike Mansfield, when he was leader, seldom did that. During \nthe years that I was leader, I very seldom did that. The Republican \nleaders Baker and Dole seldom did that.\n\n  Following my tenure as majority leader, that has been done \nincreasingly. I am not attempting to say that Mike Mansfield or I were \ngreat leaders at all; I am not attempting to do that. But I am saying \nthat through Johnson's tenure, for the most part, through Mansfield's \ntenure, through my tenure as majority leader and through the tenures of \nHoward Baker and Bob Dole, the Senate adhered to its rules and \nprecedents; seldom did it do otherwise.\n  Moreover, the parliamentary amendment tree is frequently filled as a \nway of precluding the minority from calling up amendments. I filled the \nparliamentary tree on a very few occasions. I, again, have to call \nattention to my own tenure as majority leader because through the \ntenures of Johnson and leaders before Johnson on both sides of the \naisle, the rules of the Senate were virtually considered sacred.\n  The minority is also frequently pressured to keep the number of \namendments to a minimum or else the particular bill will not even be \ncalled up--or, if it is pending, the bill will be taken down unless \namendments are kept to a minimum. That is happening in this Senate.\n  Unlike the House of Representatives, there is no Rules Committee in \nthe Senate that serves as a traffic cop over the legislation and that \ndetermines whether or not there will be any amendments and, if so, how \nmany amendments will be allowed and who will call up such amendments. \nOn occasion, the House Rules Committee will determine perhaps that one \namendment will be called up by Mr. So-and-So. But not so with the \nSenate. We don't have a Rules Committee that serves as a traffic cop.\n  Could there be a desire on the part of the Senate majority leadership \nto make the Senate operate as a second House of Representatives? Of the \n100 Senators who constitute this body today, 45, at my last count, came \nfrom the House of Representatives--45 out of 100. At no time in my \nalmost 42 years in the Senate have I ever entertained the notion that \nthe Senate ought to be run like the House of Representatives, where \namendments and unlimited debate are often looked upon as alien to the \nlegislative process. What is the hurry? What is the hurry? There is \nample time for the offering of amendments and for debating them at \nlength, if the Senate will only put its shoulder to the wheel and work.\n  We still have 7 days, just as there were in the beginning of \ncreation. The calendar doesn't go that far back, but we still have 7 \ndays a week. And we still have 24 hours a day, as was the case in \nCaesar's time. And the edict of God, as he drove Adam and Eve from the \ngarden and laid down the law that by the sweat of his brow man would \neat bread--that edict is still the case. We still have to eat bread and \nwe still are supposed to earn our living through the sweat of our brow. \nNothing has changed.\n  We have plenty of time. And we get paid. I am one who gets paid for \nmy work in the Senate. I don't like Sunday sessions, but we have had a \nfew over the years. I am against Sunday sessions. But I am not against \nworking on Saturdays. During that civil rights debate, which I was \ntalking about a while ago, there were six Saturdays in which the Senate \nwas in session. It is not an unheard of thing.\n  It is far more important for the Senate to engage in thorough debate \nand for Senators to have the opportunity to call up amendments than it \nis for the Senate to have many of the Mondays and Fridays left unused \ninsofar as real floor action is concerned.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will very shortly.\n  It is far more important for the Senate to engage in thorough debate, \nand for Senators to have the opportunity to call up amendments, than it \nis for the Senate to be out of session on Mondays and Fridays. It seems \nto me that we should be more busily engaged in doing the people's \nbusiness.\n\n  Instead, it seems to me--and, of course, I am not infallible in my \njudgments--it seems to me that the Senate is more concerned about \nrelieving Senators who are up for reelection--and I am one of them this \nyear--relieving Senators who are up for reelection from the \ninconvenience of staying on the job and working early and late, than in \nfulfilling our responsibilities to our constituents. Some might \nconclude that it is more important for Senators to have Mondays and \nFridays in which to raise money for a reelection campaign than it is \nfor us to give to our constituents a full day's work for a full day's \npay.\n  Now I am glad to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia in the form of a \nquestion--the segue is better now than when I asked the first question \nbecause what I want to say to the Senator from West Virginia is, I \nhaven't been here nearly as long as you have been here, but I have \nseen, in the 18 years I have been here, how things have changed. Why \nhave they changed? Because of the unbelievable drive to raise money. \nEverybody has to raise money. On Mondays, on Tuesdays, on Wednesdays, \non Thursdays, on Fridays, on Saturdays, and, I am sorry to say, on \nSundays. I say to my friend from West Virginia, don't you think that is \nthe biggest problem around here, the tremendous, overpowering demand \nfor money because of television?\n  In the form of a dual question: Don't you think, if we did nothing \nelse but eliminate corporate money, which the Congress in the early \npart of last century, or by the Senator's reasoning this century, early \n19----\n  Mr. BYRD. Not by the Senator's reasoning, but because it is the 20th \ncentury still, until midnight December 31 this year. Regardless of what \nthe media says, regardless of what the politicians say, this year is \nstill in the 20th century.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend in the form of a question: In the early \npart of this century, Congress had the good sense to outlaw, in Federal \nelections, corporate money. Of course, the Supreme Court changed that a \nfew years ago. I ask the Senator, wouldn't we be well served if we \neliminated, among other things, corporate money in campaigns on the \nFederal level in any form or fashion?\n  Mr. BYRD. There is no question about that, if one looks at the facts \ncarefully. Having been majority leader and having been minority leader, \nI can testify as to the pressures that are brought on the majority and \nminority leaders by Senators who have to get out and run across this \ncountry, holding out a tin cup as it were, saying: Give me, give me, \ngive me money.\n  I have had to do that. In 1982, I had an incumbent in the other body \nfrom West Virginia who ran against me. I had to go all over this \ncountry. I had to go to California. I had to go to New York. I had to \ngo to Alabama. I had to go to Texas. I was all over the country. But I \ndidn't go during the Senate workdays, and in those days, the Senate \nworked. I had to go on Sundays, for the most part.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. One last question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Wouldn't the Senator acknowledge things are much worse \ntoday than they were in 1982?\n  Mr. BYRD. They are much worse, and they are growing worse and worse \nand worse every day and every election. It is a disgrace and it is \ndemeaning. The most demeaning thing that I have had to do in my \npolitical career is to ask people for money.\n  When I was majority leader in the 100th Congress, former Senator \nDavid Boren of Oklahoma and I introduced legislation to reform the \ncampaign financing system.\n  I am not one of the ``come lately boys'' in this regard. I, as \nmajority leader then, and former Senator David Boren introduced that \nlegislation. The other side of the aisle--I do not like to point to the \nother side of the aisle as so many Senators today, unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n\nlike to do--but the other side of the aisle--namely, the Republicans in \nthe Senate in that instance--voted consistently eight times against \ncloture motions that I offered to bring the debate to a close. There \nwere four or five Republicans who did break from the otherwise solid \nbloc and voted with the Democrats on that occasion to break the \nfilibuster against the campaign financing bill.\n  Go back to the Record. Read it. Senators might do well to go back to \nthe Record and see who those Senators were who broke from the \nRepublican bloc. A handful broke from the Republican bloc and voted to \nend the filibuster against that campaign financing bill. Eight times I \noffered cloture motions. No other majority leader has ever offered \neight cloture motions on the same legislation in one Congress. And \neight times I was defeated in my efforts to invoke cloture.\n  Chapter 22, Verse 28 of the Book of Proverbs--we are talking about \nSolomon's sayings now for the most part--admonishes us: ``Remove not \nthe ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.'' We seem to be doing \njust the opposite. The Founding Fathers' grant to us of the right to \namend and the right to unlimited debate has been, I believe, shifted \noff course, to the point that these two well-advised attributes of \npower are being voided, and for what reason? Could it be that the \nSenate Republican leadership fails to appreciate and fully understand \nthe Senate, fails to understand American Constitutionalism, and fails \nto understand the purposes which the constitutional framers had in mind \nwhen they created the Senate. Or might we suppose that the senatorial \npowers that be are simply determined to be a Committee of Rules unto \nthemselves and are determined to try to remold the Senate into a second \nHouse of Representatives? The fact cannot be ignored that 45 of the 100 \nMembers of today's Senate came here from the House of Representatives. \nA political observer might also be surprised to find that 59 of today's \n100 Senators came to the Senate subsequent to my final stint as \nmajority leader.\n  Noble are the words of Cicero when he tells us that ``It is the first \nand fundamental law of history that it neither dare to say anything \nthat is false or fear to say anything that is true, nor give any just \nsuspicion of favor or disaffection.''\n  I believe that no less a high standard must be invoked when \nconsidering the Senate of today and comparing it with the Senate of the \npast. Having spent more than half of my life in the Senate, I would \nconsider myself derelict in my duty toward the Senate if I did not \nexpress my concerns over what I see happening to the Senate.\n  Who suffers, whose rights are denied, whose interests are untended \nwhen a Senate minority is denied the right to amend and when a Senate \nminority is denied the right and opportunity to fully debate the issues \nthat confront the Nation? Is it the individual Senators themselves? Is \nit I? Do I suffer? No. It is their constituents, it is my constituents \nwho are being denied these opportunities and these rights. It is not \nSenator so-and-so who, in the final analysis, is being denied the full \nfreedom of speech on this Senate floor or who is being shut out from \noffering an amendment--it is Senator so-and-so's constituents, the \npeople who sent him or her to the Senate.\n  If the Senate is intended to be a check against the impulsiveness and \npassions of the other body, is not the ability of the Senate to be such \na check reduced in direct proportion to the denial to its Members of \nthe opportunity to amend House measures?\n  In accordance with the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in \nthe House of Representatives and, by custom, most appropriations bills \nlikewise originate in the House, but under the guarantees of the \nConstitution, as those guarantees flowed from the Great Compromise of \nJuly 16, 1787, the Senate has the right to amend those revenue and \nappropriations bills.\n  But if the opportunity for Senators to amend is reduced, or even \ndenied, as is sometimes being done, the Senate as an equal body to that \nof the House of Representatives is being put to a disadvantage. The \nHouse can open the door to legislation on an appropriations bill, but \nif the Senate, if the 100 Senators are denied the opportunity to offer \namendments, or are limited in the number of amendments which Senators \nmay offer, the Senate is thereby denied the opportunity to go through \nthat door with amendments of its own, through the door that the other \nbody has opened, and is denied the potential for the achievement of \ntruly good legislation in the final result, and that opportunity is \naccordingly lessened and the likelihood of legislative errors in the \nfinal product is increased.\n  If the Senate is a forum of the States, in which the small States are \nequal to the large States, and if this ability of the small States to \nacquire equilibrium with the large States serves as an offset to the \nHouse of Representatives where the votes of the States are in \nproportion to population sizes, then when the Senate is denied the \nopportunity to work its will by the avoidance of votes on amendments, \nare the small States not the greater losers? My State, for one. The \nSenator from Alaska's State is one.\n  If the framers saw the Senate as a powerful check against an \noverreaching executive at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, when \nfree and unlimited debate is bridled and the right of Senators to offer \namendments is hindered or denied, is not the Senate's power to check an \noverreaching President accordingly whittled down, especially in \ninstances where such a check is most needed?\n  I am gravely concerned that, if the practices of the recent past as \nthey relate to enactment of massive, monstrous, omnibus appropriations \nbills are not reversed, Senators will be reduced to nothing more than \nlegislative automatons. Senators will have given away their sole \nauthority to debate and amend spending bills and other legislation. \nMuch of that authority will have been handed over, by invitation of \nCongress itself, to the Chief Executive.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I, \nand other chairmen of appropriations subcommittees in this Senate are \nexperiencing this right now.\n  Only yesterday, in a conference on the Interior Appropriation bill, I \ncalled attention to the fact that when I came to Congress 48 years ago, \nthe Members of the House and Senate in that day would have stood in \nutter astonishment, to see in that conference, on an appropriations \nbill, the agents of the President of the United States sitting there \narguing with Senators and House Members and advancing the wishes of a \nPresident.\n  There they sat in the House-Senate conference. And they tell the \nconferees what the President will or will not accept in the bill. If \nthis is in the bill, he will veto it. If this is not in the bill, he \nwill veto it, they say.\n  So, appropriators of the House and the Senate, get ready. You have \ncompany. There are other appropriators in this Government other than \nthe elected Members of the House and Senate. There are administration \nex officio members of the Appropriations conference--believe it or \nnot--who sit like Banquo's ghost at the table when the appropriations \nare being administered out. What a sad--what a sad--thing to behold.\n  I said that in the meeting yesterday, as I have said it before in \nmeetings. And I don't mean it to insult or to derogate the agents of \nthe President. They are doing their job, and they are very capable \npeople. I have to apologize to them when I say that. They are there \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  And why are they there? The fault lies here. Because we dither and \ndither almost a full year through. We put off action on appropriations \nbills until the very last, when we are up against the prospect of \nadjournment sine die, when our backs are to the wall, and then the \nPresident of the United States has the upper hand. His threats of veto \nmake us scatter and run. The result is that all of these bills--or many \nof them--are crammed into one giant monstrous measure, and that measure \ncomes back to this House without Senators having an opportunity to \namend it because it is a conference report. It is not amendable --not \namendable. So it is our fault. It really is. And it has been happening \nin these recent years. So much of that authority will have been handed \nover, by invitation of Congress itself, in essence, to the Executive.\n  For fiscal year 1999 an omnibus package was all wrapped together--\nSenators will remember this--an omnibus\n\n[[Page S9411]]\n\npackage was all wrapped together and run off on copy machines--it \ntotaled some 3,980 pages--and was presented to the House and Senate in \nthe form of an unamendable conference report. Members were told to take \nit or leave it. If you do not take this agreement, we will have to stay \nhere and start this process over. We will have to call Members back to \nWashington from the campaign trail, back to Washington from town \nmeetings, and back to Washington from fundraisers. Senator, the gun is \nat your head, and it is loaded. You do not know what is in this \npackage, Senator 3,980 pages put together by running the pages--3,980 \npages--through copy machines.\n  Not a single Senator, not one knew what was in that conference \nreport, the details of it. No one Senator under God's heaven knew, \nreally, everything that he was voting on. You do not know what is in \nthis package, we are essentially told, but you either vote for it or we \nwill stay here and start all over again. And in the final analysis, we \nwill come up with about the same package.\n  We know that these legislative provisions made up more than half of \nthe total 3,980 pages. So what we did there, as we did in fiscal year \n1997 and as we did again in fiscal year 2000 was put together several \nappropriations bills into an unamendable conference report, and Members \nwere forced to vote on what was essentially a pig in a poke without \nknowing the details.\n  Do the people of this country know that? Do they know this? Do they \nknow what is happening?\n  In 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, a reporter from the \nSaturday Evening Post asked John Maynard Keynes, the great British \neconomist, if he knew of anything that had ever occurred like that \ndepression. Keynes answered: Yes, and it was called the Dark Ages, and \nit lasted 400 years.\n  Well, I can say, as one who lived through that depression in a coal \nmining town in southern West Virginia and was brought up in the home of \na coal miner, I can say that we are now entering the ``Dark Ages'' of \nthe United States Senate.\n\n  Now, when Keynes referred to the Dark Ages being equal to the \ndepression or vice versa and I refer to the Dark Ages of the Senate, \nthis is calamity howling on a cosmic scale perhaps, but on one point, \nthe resemblence seems valid, that being, the people never fully \nunderstood and don't fully understand today the forces that brought \nthese things into being.\n  If the people knew that we had a 3,980-page conference report in \nwhich we, their elected representatives, didn't know what was in it, \nthey would rise up and say: What in the world is going on here? It is \nour money that Senators are spending. You are blindfolded and you have \nwax in your ears. You don't even know what is in that bill.\n  Is this the way we want the House and the Senate to operate? Is this \nwhat Senators had in mind when they ran for the United States Senate? \nIf we continue this process, Senators will not be needed here at all. \nOh, you can come to the Senate floor once in a while to make a speech \nor to introduce a bill or to vote on some matter, but at the end of the \nsession, when the rubber hits the road and we get down to what is and \nwhat is not going to be enacted in all areas--appropriations, \nlegislation, and tax measures--most Senators won't be needed. Most of \nus will not be in the room with the President's men. We won't be in the \nroom.\n  I have seen times when the minority, Democrats in the House and \nSenate, were not in the room. Who was in the room? The Republican \nmajority, the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the \nSenate. They were in the room. Who else? Who was there to represent us \nDemocrats? Who was there? The executive branch was there, its agents. \nWe were left out. The Democratic Members of the House and Senate, not \none, not one sat in that conference. I wasn't in it. I was the ranking \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  So most of us will not be in the room when the decisions are made. \nThe President's agents will be there. They will carry great weight on \nall matters because we have to get the President's signature. Having \nsquandered the whole year in meaningless posturing and bickering back \nand forth, we will have no alternative, none, but to buckle under to a \nPresident's every demand. And when that hideous process is mercifully \nfinished, we will then call you, Senator, and let you know that we are \nnow ready to vote on a massive conference report, up or down, without \nany amendments in order. Take it or leave it, Senator. Take it or leave \nit, Senator Daschle. You are the minority leader. You will be left out. \nTake it or leave it; here is the conference report.\n  We are in danger of becoming an oligarchy disguised as a Republic. \nYou may well spend all of your time campaigning or speechmaking or \ndoing constituent services back home, you will have very little to say \non legislation or appropriations or tax matters.\n  There is sufficient blame to go around for this total collapse of the \nappropriations process. Our side feels muzzled. The majority leader has \na very difficult job. I know. I have been in his shoes. He has to do \nthe best he can to meet the demands of all Senators.\n\n  Part of the solution has to be a greater willingness to work together \non both sides of the aisle to ensure that ample opportunities are \nprovided, early in the session, outside of the appropriations process \nto debate policy differences. We simply must force ourselves to work \nharder, beginning earlier in the session, to ensure that we do not \ncontinue to abuse the Constitution, abuse the Senate, and ultimately \nabuse the American people by following the procedure that has resulted \nin these omnibus packages in 3 of the last 4 years, and which, I fear, \nis about to be resorted to again this year.\n  I do see some rays of hope because we have awakened the leadership. I \nmust say, after our squawking and screaming and kicking, the \nadministration this year is insisting that Democrats sit at the table \nwhen the crumbs are being parceled out. They insisted because the \nminority leader has insisted on it and because other voices in the \nSenate have been complaining.\n  Cicero said: ``There is no fortress so strong that money cannot take \nit.'' The power of the purse is the most precious power that we have. \nIt was given to the two Houses by the Constitution, the bedrock of our \nGovernment. It was put here--not down at the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue.\n  I have tried to do my part to help Senators understand our \nconstitutional role. We are the people's elected representatives and \nthey have entrusted us with their vote; those people out there who are \nwatching through the cameras have entrusted us with their vote. That \ntrust must not be treated lightly. This is especially true when it \ncomes to matters that involve appropriations. We are spending their \nmoney.\n  Each of you who is watching through that electronic medium, we are \nspending your money.\n  We are stewards of the people's hard-earned tax dollars. They expect, \nand they ought to demand, that we spend those dollars wisely, and that \nwe scrutinize what we fund and why we fund it.\n  The Senate is the upper House of a separate branch of Government, \nwith institutional safeguards that protect the people's liberties.\n  Which party commands the White House at a given time should make no \ndifference as to how we conduct our duties. We are here to work with, \nbut also to act as a check on the occupant of the White House, \nregardless of who that occupant is. And we are here to reflect the \npeople's will. We are not performing the watchdog function when we \ninvite the White House--literally invite the White House--behind closed \ndoors and play five-card draw with the people's tax dollars.\n  Mr. President, I fear for the future of this Senate. I think the \npeople are very disenchanted with Congress and with politics in \ngeneral. They are catching on to our partisan bickering and they don't \nlike what they hear and see.\n  The people are hungry for leadership. They ask us for solutions to \ntheir problems. They expect us to protect their interests and to watch \nover their hard-earned tax dollars. They entrust us with their \nfranchise and they ask that we ponder issues and debate issues and use \ntheir proxy wisely. They ask that we protect their freedoms by holding \nfast to our institutional and constitutional responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\n  Too often, we lose sight of the fact that partisan politics is not \nthe purpose for which the people send us here. We square off like \npunch-drunk gladiators and preen and polish our media-slick messages in \nsearch of the holy grail of power or a headline. I am a politician; I \ncan say that. We fail to educate the people and ourselves on issues of \nparamount and far-reaching importance for this generation and for the \nnext generation. It is a shame and it is a waste because there is much \ntalent in this Chamber, and there is much mischanneled energy. This \nSenate could be what the framers intended, but it would take a new \ncommitment by each of us to our duties and to our oaths of office. And \nit would take a massive turning away from the petty little power wars \nso diligently waged each week and each month in these Halls.\n  Our extreme tunnel vision has been duly noted by the American people, \nI assure Senators. The American people are a tolerant lot, but their \npatience is beginning to fray.\n  And when their disappointment turns to dismay, and finally to \ndisgust, we will have no one to blame but ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I have more to say, but I see other Senators. If they \nwish to speak on this subject, I will be glad to yield them time. Does \nthe distinguished Senator from California wish to speak?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would really appreciate the opportunity \nto comment on some of the Senator's points and then make a couple other \npoints. As I understand it, the Senator controls the time; is that \ncorrect?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I control the time from the beginning, 6 hours.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I respectfully request about 20 minutes of that time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I gladly yield 20 minutes to the very \ndistinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, who is, I have to \nsay, the most respected Senator in this Chamber. When he speaks, I do \nthink that both sides listen. I believe that his remarks today are not \npartisan at all. I think that he has been critical of both sides and he \nhas been critical of the administration.\n  I want to pick up on some of Senator Byrd's remarks. I had the honor \nof serving on the Appropriations Committee for a period of time. \nSenator Feinstein now holds that seat, and who knows, maybe some day I \nwill be able to reclaim it. California is such a large State that I \nthink there is a real understanding on my side of the aisle that one of \nus should be sitting on that committee.\n  In that situation you have a much greater chance to speak for your \nState, and to talk about the priorities of your State.\n  Right now my dear friend, Senator Feinstein, is recuperating from a \nterrible fall and a terrible injury to her leg. I want to say to \nSenator Feinstein--if you are watching, because I know you are in the \nhospital--we are thinking of you and we wish you well. I will do \neverything I can to speak for both of us when it comes to the issues \nthat face our State.\n  But, in particular because of her injury, I think at the moment I am \non that list. The Senator could add us on that list of the 23 ``have \nnots,'' although we are praying that Senator Feinstein will be back \nnext week in time to be there. But even if she is back, the fact is, \nwhen that private session is called to look at this big omnibus bill--\nthe Senator from West Virginia has described it--very few will be in \nthat room. I compliment the administration for insisting that the \nDemocratic leadership be in that room.\n  I had the honor to serve in the House for 10 years of my life. It was \na great experience for me. I know many others, including the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, had that privilege. But I ran for the Senate in a \nvery risky political move--no one thought I would ever make it here--\nbecause I wanted the chance to do more. I wanted the chance to operate \nunder the Senate rules and to offer any amendments that I wanted to at \nany time.\n  Now I find with this particular leadership that I am precluded from \ndoing that. I am precluded from fighting for my State. When I hear that \nbills were going straight to the conference and bypassing the Senate \nand the ability of the Senator from Iowa to offer an amendment--even \nthough he serves on that committee, there is still time even when you \nare on the committee. You wait until you get to the floor to offer the \namendment. We all know that is the way it goes because sometimes you \ncan't win in the committee but you have a chance to make your case on \nthe floor with unlimited debate and an opportunity to show your charts \nand make your point.\n  I find myself here in a circumstance where I, in behalf of the people \nof California, basically have no say on these bills.\n  As Senator Byrd rightly points out, I think anyone in this Senate \nChamber who says they know what is in a huge omnibus package with 3,000 \npages, not to mention report language and colloquy, is simply dreaming \nbecause we know there is just so much we are capable of. When you do \none appropriations bill at a time, you can concentrate on that and read \nthat bill. You can be briefed on that bill. If you want to offer an \namendment, you can do so. You can make your case for your State.\n  There is one issue on which the Senator from West Virginia and I do \nnot agree. I respect his view so much. But I come on a different side. \nI think it is so important that we should be allowed to raise other \nimportant issues that we believe this Senate ought to vote on, even if \nit voted on it before. I say to my friend that some of these issues are \nso important. Now that we are in the middle of a Presidential election, \nthey are being raised by both Governor Bush and Vice President Gore, \nand we ought to have another chance to vote on them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if I might ask the Senator to yield on \nthat point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the Senator. I want to say a few more things \non my own time about Senator Byrd's presentation this morning, but I \nalso want to respond to the point that my friend from California is \nmaking about being able to offer amendments to the appropriations bills \nthat come up.\n  I ask the Senator from California: I do not know if we agree on this, \nbut I think if we had more of an opportunity to act as a Senate, to \nbring legislation out and to be able to consider bills that we might be \ninterested in, that we wouldn't have to do them on appropriations \nbills. But because we are prevented from doing so, many times it is \nonly the appropriations bills where we can offer them.\n\n  I ask the Senator from California if she would maybe--I see her \nnodding her head--agree with that decision; if we had that opportunity \nto act as a Senate and to bring authorizing bills out here to be able \nto offer those amendments, then we wouldn't have to do that on \nappropriations bills.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree with my friend. I sit on some authorizing \ncommittees, such as the Environment and Public Works Committee. There \nare so many good bills that we could bring forward, but the leadership \ndoes not want to do that. Frankly, I think it is because they would \nrather not run this place like the Senate. They want to run it like the \nHouse with strict controls where the Rules Committee decides what can \nhappen.\n  Frankly, I have to think that there are some amendments on which they \ndon't want to vote. I think we are then forced in the circumstance that \nmy friend from West Virginia--my hero, if I might say, in this Senate--\nbelieves is inappropriate. But we are in a circumstance where we are \ncommitted, for example, to vote on a prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare. We are so committed to making sure that class sizes could be \nreduced by putting 100,000 new teachers in, and we don't get the \neducation authorizing bill. We only get the appropriations bill.\n  It forces us--I agree with my friend--to be in the situation that is \nnot good for the Senate. As my friend said, it is the ``Dark Ages of \nthe Senate.'' Those are powerful words. This is a man who thinks about \nthat. When he says we are in the ``Dark Ages,'' I think we have to \nlisten. We are in the Dark Ages because we don't want to debate \nauthorizing bills. We are forced to try to offer amendments on \nappropriations bills, which delays the situation, which\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\nmakes leadership say they are not going to bring the bill forward, and \nwhich makes them send them straight to conference to avoid the chance \nfor amendments. The vicious circle continues.\n  I think I am not being a Senator. We never know how long we are going \nto be in this Chamber. In many ways, it is up to our electorate. In \nmany ways, it is up to God to give us good health to be here and do \nthis. It is up to our families to see how long they can take it. So we \nwant to have a chance to legislate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from California \nwill yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to clarify one thing.\n  The distinguished Senator from California earlier, I think, indicated \nthat she and I were in disagreement on this. We are not. In the Senate, \nthere is no rule of germaneness except when cloture is invoked and \nexcept when rule XVI is invoked. But a rule XVI invocation can be \nwaived only by a majority vote--not a two-thirds vote but by a \nmajority. We have done that many times.\n  When a Senator has raised the question of germaneness, I have from \ntime to time voted with that question to make that germane. She and I \nreally are not in disagreement. She has well stated, and so has the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, the reasons why so many Senators are \nforced to offer legislative amendments on appropriations bills. It is \nbecause the legislative measures are not brought up in the Senate. So \nthey have to resort to the only vehicle that is in front of them, that \nbeing an appropriations bill.\n  Look at this calendar. This calendar is filled with bills, many of \nthem which have never gone to the committee. Many of them have been put \ndirectly on the calendar through rule XIV, and they have never been \nbefore a committee. They went before a committee in the House, come \nfrom the House, and are put directly on the Senate calendar, or bills \nare offered by Senators, brought up, and through rule XIV are placed on \nthe calendar.\n  I counted the number of items on this calendar the other day that \nhave been placed directly on the calendar for one reason or the other, \none being rule XIV. I counted the number. I don't remember what it was. \nThere are quite a wide number of amendments that are on the calendar \nthat have never seen or experienced any debate in a Senate committee. \nWe have 71 pages making up this calendar. Senators who want to offer \namendments have to understand, there is nothing but appropriations \nbills to which to offer amendments.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am absolutely delighted we are on the same side on this \npoint. The frustration level of Senators, as my friend Senator Harkin \npointed out in his very to-the-point-question, is that we have no other \noption but to turn to these priorities that our people are asking \nMembers to take care of, and try to offer these amendments. Then we \nhave a majority that doesn't want them.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I want to point out to the Senator from West Virginia, regarding the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, this is the \nfirst time since it was enacted in 1965 we have not reauthorized it. \nWhy? There is no reason we cannot debate the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act before we adjourn.\n  I am certain reasonable minds on both sides would agree to time \nlimits. No one wants to filibuster the bill. Offer the amendments. But \nthe way things are today, if someone has ideas on what we want to do on \neducation in this country, they are precluded from doing so. It is \nstill stuck on the calendar, for the first time since 1965. S. 2, the \nNo. 2 bill of this Congress, and it is still on the calendar. We \nhaven't had a chance to act.\n  I say to my friend from California, the Senator from West Virginia \nreferred to returning back to the Dark Ages. I was thinking about that \nwhen the Senator was speaking. Someone remarked to me that: All this \ntalk about rules and procedure is gobbledygook. Who cares? That is \ninside ball game stuff around here, and it doesn't really matter on the \noutside.\n  I know it sounds like inside ball game stuff when we talk about rules \nand procedures, rule XVI and things such as this. The Senator mentioned \nthe Dark Ages; I got to thinking about the Dark Ages. That is an \nappropriate allegory because the reason they were the Dark Ages is that \nwe didn't have rules, we didn't have laws, it was uncivilized. In order \nfor us to be civilized, we said there are certain rules by which we \nshould live.\n  We have these rules in the Senate so that we don't live in the Dark \nAges. They have a lot to do with people's lives outside of the beltway \nof this city. I think the Senator's mentioning of the Dark Ages is very \nappropriate. That is what we are returning to. We are returning to a \nrule-less kind of Senate where whoever is in charge calls the shots. \nThat is what the Dark Ages was about: Whoever had the power ran \neverything. It was a lawless society. Through the years we developed \nour rules.\n  There is a reason the Senate is the way it is. Read the Senator's \n``History of the Senate.'' There is a reason the Founding Fathers set \nup the Senate the way it is. It is to allow some of the smaller States \nand others to have their say and to have their equal representation so \nthey aren't bound up by the rules of the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the distinguished Senator from California yield me \ntime to respond to the distinguished Senator from Iowa?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield an additional 15 minutes overall to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa said something here which is a \ntruism--among other things--that there are many who look upon the rules \nand the precedence of the Senate as gobbledygook, as inside baseball.\n  Now I daresay those same narrow-minded, uninformed people, whoever \nthey are, would say the very same about this Constitution of the United \nStates or this Declaration of Independence, both of which are in this \nlittle book which I hold in my hand. They would say the same thing \nabout the Constitution of the United States, and those rules of the \nSenate are there by virtue of this Constitution. I urge them to read \nthe Constitution again.\n\n  I also urge them to read what Thomas Jefferson said, what Vice \nPresident Adlai Stevenson said, what Lyndon Johnson said, and what \nother great leaders who are now in the past said about the right to \namend and the right to debate.\n  I will say what Adlai Stevenson said: They know not what they do.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Sometimes--I am not mentioning any names--sometimes we talk with \ncolleagues about the rules. There is kind of a smirk: Oh, yes, we have \nbusiness to do around here. And there is sort of--I detected it \nlately--there is sort of: ``Well, the rules are the rules, but if we \nhave the votes, we don't care.''\n  That is a terrible attitude. As the Senator from West Virginia said, \nit really returns us to the Dark Ages when we were a lawless, ruleless \nsociety.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend to stay on his feet because I want to \ncontinue this discussion.\n  When I was a child, I learned how a bill becomes a law. We always had \nthat book in school, how a bill becomes a law. A bill starts out; \nsomeone authors it on one side, the Senate; someone authors it in the \nHouse. If it is a money bill, it has to go through the House first. And \nthen each House, the House and the Senate, will act on the bill. If \nthere are differences, it will go to conference. Those differences are \nworked out. If they are worked out--either body will vote on them--it \ngoes to the President; he says yea or nay. If he issues a veto, two-\nthirds to override; if he signs it, it is a law. We learned this.\n  I say to my friend, it almost seems to me that what is happening is \nunconstitutional. I do not have a law degree. But we don't see these \nbills coming through the Senate for Senators to comment on. Sometimes \nwe get a bill through here and it is not controversial. We will agree \nto a 2-, 3-, 5-minute time agreement. But at least we have a chance to \nlook at it. That is our job. If\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\nwe don't look at it and it does some harm to our people, that is our \nfault.\n  But if bills never come here and if they are sent directly into a \nconference committee and bypass the Senate, this says something is very \nwrong, that we are not doing what we are supposed to do according to \nthe Constitution. I honestly wonder whether there couldn't be some kind \nof lawsuit by some citizen out there who looks at this and says: The \nway the Senate is operating, I have no voice in this because my Senator \nis bypassed. As Senator Byrd shows in his chart, 23 States are not on \nappropriations. They don't even have a chance to utter a word in the \ncommittee.\n  I was wondering, not being a lawyer, as the Senator is a lawyer, \nwhether there isn't some kind of lawsuit waiting to happen. This isn't \nthe way a bill is to become a law.\n  I think this could be considered taxation without representation. For \nsome of these cases, some colleagues could say to their people: I \ndidn't know; I didn't have a chance; I could only vote no or aye at the \nend; I voted aye because there were so many good things in the omnibus \nbill; but there were 23 bad things, but I had to keep the Government \ngoing.\n  I think we are treading on some dangerous ground.\n  I am happy to yield if my friend has a comment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the Senator asking a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would love to have my friend comment on this.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree, in large measure, with everything the \ndistinguished Senator is saying. I seriously doubt that a lawsuit--I \nseriously doubt if that would hold up. But anyhow, it is a good \nthought.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. When I go home to meet my constituency, they, as \ntaxpayers, will say to me: Senator, what did you think about page 1030 \nin that omnibus bill? Did you actually get a chance to vote on it? I \nwill say: In the big sense, I guess you could say I had to vote. It was \nall in one package. But I had no choice. I wanted to keep the \nGovernment going.\n  When I raised that issue, it was not for the technical response, but \nI am just suggesting to my friend that it is in many ways taxation \nwithout representation. In any event, if it does not rise to that \nlevel, it is close to that level.\n  I wonder if my friend from Iowa has a comment, or my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was trying to say--I will yield in just a second more--\nI think what is happening is that the foundation on which this Senate \nhas been based is beginning to crumble. It is not all gone yet. But I \nwas thinking, the Senate is like a foundation. If you pull one brick \nout, OK; it still holds. You pull another brick out--the foundation is \nstill strong.\n  What is happening, I believe, and I say this in all candor, the \nmajority side, for the last several years, has been pulling some bricks \nout of the foundation. They pulled one out and no one complained. They \npulled another one out and nothing happened. What concerns me is that \none feeds on another. So if we take back the majority, do we then say \nwe will take out another brick? And then another brick? And then it \nbounces to the other side? Pretty soon the foundation crumbles and \nnobody can point to that first brick and when it was pulled out.\n  That is what I see, a kind of insidious pulling out of the bricks of \nthe foundation of the Senate. Yet since things do happen, at the end of \nthe year there is this big omnibus that is put together and people say: \nThere you go, no big deal. But I predict pretty soon the foundation is \ngoing to start crumbling if we don't stop pulling out the bricks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree with my friend. It is pretty distressing to see \nthis happen to the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd said the other day that many of us in this Chamber don't \nknow how the Senate is supposed to work because when we got here, those \nbricks had started to be pulled out of that foundation. I long for the \ndays when I can tell my grandchildren or great grandchildren that I had \na chance to serve in the greatest deliberative body of the land, and \nthat even on a matter that perhaps only one or two Senators cared \nabout, we had the unfettered right to express ourselves on behalf of \nthe people we represent.\n  As I stand here, I represent, with Senator Feinstein, almost 34 \nmillion people. Imagine that, 34 million people. They have so many \nconcerns, whether it is the cost of prescription drugs, that I know my \nfriend from Iowa just made a brilliant speech on yesterday--and I hope \nhe will continue that today--whether it is just the normal \nappropriations process under which they are able to meet their needs, \nthe highways, the public buildings, all the things they need to keep \ngoing; making sure we have the water and the power to keep this \nincredible State going. We would be the eighth largest nation in the \nworld. We count on the Senate to be able to address our needs.\n  I am so grateful to the Senator from West Virginia for making this \npoint because I think the people need to pay attention. As my friend \nfrom Iowa has said, it may sound as if it is about rules and things \nthat do not impact them. But it impacts them mightily because when I am \nmuzzled by virtue of the fact we don't get a chance to offer \namendments--not that my voice is going to always carry the day, but at \nleast their voice will be heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia yield briefly?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. On what the distinguished Senator is saying, the difference \nbetween a lynching and a fair trial is process.\n  Mr. President, I have to be away from the Senate for about an hour \nand a half. I have to meet with my wife of 63 years, so I must leave \nthe floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no time be charged against my time, time \nthat is under my control, unless that time is being used on the subject \nthat is before the Senate. In other words, if no Senator is on the \nfloor to speak on this subject, and he or she wishes to speak on some \nother subject, that he can get time but that it not be charged against \nthe time on this matter.\n  There are several Senators who wish to speak on this. But for the \nmoment, I am going to take the liberty of yielding control of time--oh, \nthe minority whip is here; he will take care of that matter. He will be \nin control of time. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As a Member of the Senate from the State of \nColorado, I must object until I fully understand the implications of \nthat request and have had a chance to check with leadership.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. OK. That is a reasonable request.\n  I hope in the meantime, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, who is \nthe distinguished minority whip, will be on the floor. I hope he will, \nand he will see to it that Senators will be recognized on time that was \nin the order for my control, if they are going to be recognized, and \nthey not be recognized on that time unless they are speaking on this \nsubject.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I spoke to the Senator from West Virginia yesterday. We \nhave worked today to fill the time, talking about some of the things \nthat would work better in this body about which the Senator has spoken \nalready. Senator Harkin is going to speak, and Senator Boxer. We have \nSenator Kennedy coming here at noon. We have Senator Moynihan coming at \n12:30. Senator Conrad is coming. We have a list of speakers and we will \nwork very hard to fulfill the promise to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The last thing I say to the Senator from West Virginia, we were here \nexcept we were working on the Interior conference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, do I have some time remaining on my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I would like to suggest to my assistant leader is, \nafter I finish my 5 minutes, during which I would like to continue \nengaging in a little colloquy with my friend from Iowa, that he be \nrecognized for 30 minutes. Is that acceptable to my friend?\n  Mr. REID. The problem is we have gotten a little out of whack here \nthis morning. I appreciate the patience of my friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could I have 5 minutes then?\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\n  Mr. REID. What we will try to do is have Senator Kennedy start a \nlittle later. He may be a little late anyway. Maybe you will not get \nyour full half hour, but that will be known when the Senator from \nCalifornia gets finished. Then we go to Senator Harkin, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Moynihan.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent, when I complete, Senator Harkin \nhave the floor up to 30 minutes, and if he has to be interrupted by \nSenator Kennedy, he will end his remarks.\n  Mr. REID. I think what we will do is have the Senator recognized for \n10 minutes and if he needs more time he can ask for it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That will be my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In this remaining 5 minutes, I wanted to ask my friend \nfrom Iowa if he will stay on the floor because Senator Kennedy, who is \nour leader on education issues, as we know, in terms of his position on \nESEA, said it looks as though if we don't reauthorize the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act when the funding expires, which is this \nyear--which is this year--it will be the first time since the 1960s, \nsince 1965, that this bill will not have been reauthorized.\n  What I want to ask my friend--I know he is going to take his time to \ntalk about prescription drugs, and I am going to stay here for that. It \nseems to me, with both Presidential candidates out there talking about \neducation, and with huge differences in the two positions; where you \nhave George Bush supporting a voucher system to pull money out of the \npublic schools into the private schools, and you have Al Gore saying he \nwants to do twice as much for education; in terms of budget authority, \nwhere you have Vice President Gore supporting putting 100,000 new \nteachers in the classroom and George Bush opposing it; where you have \nour Vice President supporting school construction, and these are all \ninitiatives that emanated from this side of the aisle with opposition \non the other side. A fair debate. Whether or not we want to continue in \nthe tradition of President Eisenhower, a Republican President who said, \nyes, the Federal Government should step in when there is a void, and \nthat is why he signed the National Defense Education Act saying way \nback in the fifties--the happy days when I was growing up--that if you \ndo not have an educated workforce, you can have the most powerful \nmilitary in the world and it will not matter. Al Gore wants to follow \nin that tradition, but we have the opposition saying the Federal \nGovernment should not have anything to do with it, block grant it, and \nwho knows what will happen.\n\n  Does my friend agree with me--I know he agrees with me; I would like \nhim to talk about this--why is it so crucial we bring this education \nbill to the floor--and do it soon--and we allow this Senate to work its \nwill on the issues that all of America cares about, whatever side one \nis on. Does he not agree this is a stunning departure from tradition \nand history since 1965? We sit here and there is nobody on the other \nside. We have the time to talk when we could be acting on the ESEA.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for pointing this out. It is true, it \nis the first time since 1965 we have not reauthorized the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. What the Federal Government has done since \nthe adoption of that bill, since 1965, as the Senator knows, is we have \nfilled in the gaps.\n  Obviously, education still remains a local and State obligation, as \nwe want it to be, but we recognized there were certain gaps. For \nexample, disadvantaged students: We came up with the title I program to \nprovide needed funds to States to help educate disadvantaged children \nin disadvantaged areas. I do not think there is a Governor anywhere in \nthis country who does not like title I, or educators. Since we set up \ntitle I, it has done great things for our kids. That is at stake here. \nWithout reauthorization, we cannot give guidance and funds to title I.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: for kids with \ndisabilities, is another example of what will slip through the cracks \nin terms of bringing us into the new century and addressing the new \nproblems in education.\n  Teacher training is a very vital component of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act to provide guidance and, yes, support for \nteacher training, for example, in new technologies, such as closing the \ndigital divide. This is all part of that. This will all fall through \nthe cracks.\n  Because of the intransigence of the Republican majority in the \nSenate--we will fund it; I am sure we will get the appropriations bill \nthrough; we will fund it--we will not address the new problems in \neducation which we need to address. We will still be answering the \nproblems of 8 years ago and 10 years ago rather than addressing new \nproblems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired. The Senator from Iowa now controls the time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will be glad to continue the colloquy \nwith the Senator. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be brief. My friend makes such an important point. \nIn this fast moving, global economy we are in, everyone admits \neducation is the key. If all we can do is fund old programs--by the \nway, they are good; we are not going to walk away from them--but if we \ncannot address the new challenges--and my friend mentions specifically \nthe digital divide. Senator Mikulski and I have been working on a very \ngood bill. We let thousands and thousands of foreign workers in here \nwhen we still have a 4-percent unemployment rate--by the way, the best \nin generations, but we do have people who need jobs--we do not have a \nshortage of workers, as Senator Mikulski says, we have a shortage of \nskills.\n\n  My friend is so right to point out that when we do not authorize \nbills and we cannot look at the new solutions and the new challenges, \nwe might as well be living in the last century.\n  I thank my friend for yielding me additional time. I look forward to \nhis presentation on Medicare. I will sit here and listen to his wisdom \non that and maybe he can answer a question or two as he goes about his \npresentation. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I respond in kind by thanking the Senator \nfrom California for pointing out again what is at stake because we are \nnot allowed to offer our amendments. The Senator from California has \ndone a great service not only to the Senate, but to the country, in \npointing out why so many people are disenfranchised in this country \nbecause they do not have a voice with which to speak here if we are \nblocked from offering our amendments. I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for pointing that out.\n  I want to talk about another issue we are, again, blocked from \naddressing in the Senate, and that is the issue of prescription drugs \nfor the elderly. Of all the issues out there that cry out for solutions \nand intervention, this has to be No. 1 on our plate. Anyone who has \ngone to their State and talked with the elderly who are on Social \nSecurity, who are on Medicare, has heard heartrending story after \nheartrending story about how much our seniors are paying out of pocket \nfor prescription drugs.\n  Vice President Gore was in my home State of Iowa yesterday. There is \na story that was running on the news programs and in the newspapers \nthis morning about a 79-year-old woman. I do not know her. I have never \nmet her, to the best of my knowledge. Winifred Skinner, 79 years old, \nfrom, I believe, the small town of Altoona--but I cannot be certain \nabout that--who showed up at a meeting with Vice President Gore and \ntalked about how she goes along the streets and the roadways picking up \naluminum cans because she can get payment for them. I think it is a \nnickel a can, if I am not mistaken. She collects these to make some \nmoney to help pay for her prescription drugs.\n  This is a real person. It is not a phony person. This is a real \nperson with real problems, and she needs some help. We have tried time \nand again to bring this legislation to the Senate floor to openly \ndebate it. If other people have other ideas, let's debate them, have \nthe votes, and let's see what the Senate's position will be, but we are \nprecluded from doing so.\n  Now we have an ad campaign put on by the Republican candidate for \nPresident, Gov. George Bush. This TV ad\n\n[[Page S9416]]\n\ncampaign is being waged across the country to deceive and frighten \nseniors about the Medicare prescription drug benefit proposed by Senate \nDemocrats and Vice President Al Gore. I thought I would take a few \nminutes today, as I will do every day we are in session, to set the \nrecord straight.\n  First, we have to examine Bush's ``Immediate Helping Hand.'' That is \nwhat he calls it, ``Immediate Helping Hand.'' Quite simply, it is not \nimmediate and, secondly, it does not help.\n  Is it immediate? No. The Bush proposal for prescription drugs for the \nelderly requires all 50 States to pass some enabling or modifying \nlegislation. Only 16 States right now have any drug benefit for \nseniors. Many State legislatures do not meet but every 2 years, so we \nmight have a 2-year lapse or 3-year or 4-year lapse in the Bush \nproposal.\n  How do we know this? Our most recent experience is with the CHIP \nprogram, the State Children's Health Insurance Program. We passed it in \n1997. It took Governor Bush's home state of Texas over 2 years to \nimplement the CHIP program.\n  In addition, the States have said they do not want this block grant \nprogram. This is what the National Governors' Association said, \nRepublicans and Democrats, by the way:\n       If Congress decides to expand prescription drug coverage to \n     seniors, it should not shift that responsibility or its costs \n     to the states. . . .''\n\n  But that is exactly what the Bush 4-year program does.\n  Again, keep in mind, the Bush proposal on prescription drugs is a \ntwo-phased program. In the first 4 years, he delegates it to the \nStates. As I pointed out, States do not even want to do it.\n  Secondly, many legislatures do not meet for 2 years.\n  Thirdly, talk about a ``helping hand,'' who gets helped under the \nBush program? If your income is more than $14,600 a year, you are out--\n$14,600 a year, and you are out.\n  What does that mean? It means many of the seniors will not qualify. \nThe Bush plan will only cover 625,000 seniors, less than 5 percent of \nthose who need help.\n  Again, under the Vice President's proposal--and what we are \nsupporting--all you need is a Medicare card. If you have a Medicare \ncard, you can voluntarily sign up for a drug benefit, your doctor \nprescribes the drugs. You go to the pharmacy and you get your drugs. \nThat is the end of it. That is all you have to show.\n  If you are under the Bush program, you are going to have to take your \nincome tax return down, plus probably other paperwork to show your \nassets, to show that you have income of less than $14,600.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would my friend yield on this point for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because I think this is a stunning point that you have \nmade and are amplifying on today. Out of the 34 million senior citizens \nin this country who are covered under Medicare--not to mention the 5 \nmillion disabled; let's throw that out for a moment because they would \nqualify for the Gore plan; let's just focus on the 34 million--how many \nseniors are you saying, if everything went right in their States and \nthey were able to get the enabling legislation--they went to the \nwelfare office, they got the stamp of approval--if it all went right, \nhow many seniors are you estimating would be covered under the Bush \nplan?\n  Mr. HARKIN. According to a recent study, if the experience of state \npharmacy assistance programs is any guide, of the 34 million, about \n625,000--less than 5 percent of those eligible--would sign up for a \nlow-income drug plan.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Less than 700,000 people.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Under the first 4 years of the Bush plan, out of the 34 \nmillion seniors, this new benefit would go to less than 700,000 people. \nAnd those people have to go through the welfare offices. If there is no \nother reason to oppose it, there it is. It is a sham. It does not do \nmuch for hardly anybody.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  I thank the Senator from California for amplifying on that. Because \nGovernor Bush's program is not Medicare; it is welfare. What seniors \nwant is they want Medicare, they do not want welfare.\n  Look at the States. To sign up for Medicare, seniors fill out long, \ncomplex applications in 26 States. They must meet an extensive asset \nand income test in 41 States. And they have to sign up in the welfare \noffice in 34 States. Maybe that is why only 55 percent of eligible \nseniors sign up for Medicaid compared to 98 percent who sign up for \nMedicare.\n  That is what the Bush proposal would do: Send seniors to the local \nwelfare office. Take your income tax returns down, take down other \npaperwork, fill it out, show them what your income and assets are, and \nthen maybe--maybe--you will qualify.\n  As I have said repeatedly, the seniors of this country want Medicare, \nthey do not want welfare. The Bush plan would put them on welfare. \nThen, after the 4 years--the first 4 years of the Bush block grant--\nthen what does his proposal do? His proposal turns it over to the HMOs. \nSo it gets even worse.\n\n  The long-term plan under Governor Bush is tied to privatizing \nMedicare, a move that would raise premiums and force seniors to join \nHMOs. Under the Bush drug plan, there would be radical changes in \nMedicare--radical changes. You would not recognize it today.\n  Premiums for regular Medicare would increase 25 to 47 percent in the \nfirst year alone. Why is that? Why do we say that? Because once you \nturn it over to the HMOs and the insurance companies--which is what the \nBush plan does--after the first 4 years, it shifts to universal \ncoverage, but turns it over to the insurance companies.\n  Obviously, the insurance companies are going to do what we call \ncherry pick. They are going to pick the healthiest seniors and give \nthem a really good deal to join their insurance program. Who does that \nleave in Medicare? The oldest and the sickest. And to cover the \nMedicare costs, under legislation we have that exists, their premiums \nwill go up 25 to 47 percent in the first year alone. That is shocking.\n  But we have to understand that what the Bush proposal is for Medicare \nis the fulfillment of Newt Gingrich's dream to let Medicare ``wither on \nthe vine.'' Governor Bush supported that concept when Mr. Gingrich was \nSpeaker of the House. Governor Bush's proposal fulfills Newt Gingrich's \ndream because by turning it over to the insurance companies, by \nprivatizing Medicare, it would ``wither on the vine.''\n  Governor Bush would leave seniors who need drug coverage at the mercy \nof HMOs. Listen. Under the Bush proposal, who would decide what the \npremiums are going to be? HMOs. Who would decide copayments? HMOs. Who \nwould decide any deductibles? HMOs. Who would even decide the drugs \nthat you can get? It would be the HMOs--not your doctor, not your \npharmacist.\n  Lastly, as someone who represents a rural State and who still lives \nin a town of 150 people, the Bush plan would leave rural Americans out \nin the cold. Thirty percent of our seniors live in areas with no HMOs.\n  In Iowa, we have no Medicare HMOs. Listen to this. Only eight Iowa \nseniors, who happen to live near Sioux Falls, SD, belong to a Medicare \nHMO with a prescription drug benefit. Yet in Iowa, we have the highest \nproportion of the elderly over the age of 80 anywhere in the Nation. \nAnd only eight--count them--elderly, who happen to live near Sioux \nFalls, SD, belong to a Medicare HMO that has a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  Also, HMOs are dropping like flies out of rural areas. Almost a \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage this year alone, \nmostly in rural areas.\n  So, again, our seniors want Medicare. They do not want welfare. The \nBush plan turns it over to the States for the first 4 years. Take your \nincome tax returns down, show how poor you are, maybe you will get \nhelp.\n  The Bush plan for prescription drugs says, if you are rich, you are \nfine. If you are real poor, you are OK. But if you are in the middle \nclass, you are going to pay for it both ways.\n  Lastly, we have to talk about priorities. The Bush priority is $1.6 \ntrillion in tax breaks, almost 50 percent of which goes to the top 1 \npercent of the wealthiest people in this country. For prescription \ndrugs for the elderly, he is proposing $158 billion over the next 10 \nyears. There you go. Those are the priorities right there.\n  So every day we are in session, I will take the floor to point out \nthe fallacies\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\nin Governor Bush's proposal for prescription drugs for the elderly, how \nit will put elderly first on the welfare rolls--they will have to be \neligible for welfare--and then take their income tax returns down; and \nhow, secondly, it will turn it over to the private insurance companies, \nand it will destroy Medicare as we know it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will say one more time, what the seniors of this \ncountry want is they want Medicare; they do not want welfare.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  I think the chart that you have behind you is crucial for people to \nlook at.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I have 5 more minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, of course you can have 5 more \nminutes. We have Senator Landrieu here to speak. And I would say, \nbefore yielding that time to my friend from Iowa, you have painted the \npicture so well that Senator Byrd started today. Because if we had the \nproper process around here, we would have been debating these issues a \nlong time ago.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Exactly.\n  Mr. REID. So I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa. Following \nthat, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends, and I thank the Senator from \nLouisiana for her patience. This is an important point that she made to \nme yesterday and to a number of my colleagues.\n  I think the chart that is behind the Senator from Iowa tells a story \nall America has to see. This tax cut is so enormous, with such enormous \ntax breaks for those at the top--for example, those over $350,000 will \nget back $50,000 a year compared to those at $30,000 who will get back \na few hundred dollars--that it is impossible for Governor Bush to do \nanything real for the American people that the American people want.\n  I asked myself, why would it be that his prescription drug policy \nwould only cover 5 percent of the seniors who need it. The easy answer: \nEven if he wanted to do more--and let's say he does; I will give him \nthat break--he can't do more, because when you look at what he wants to \ndo for the military and what he says he wants to do for education, and \nit goes on, it does not add up. So what happens to Governor Bush is \nthat he has to take tiny little baby steps for things he thinks are \nimportant because he doesn't have the resources because he is committed \nto this enormous tax break, instead of doing what Al Gore has done, \nwhich is to say: Yes, we will give tax breaks, but we will give them to \nthe middle class. We will do it for people who need to send their kids \nto college by helping them with their tuition. We will do it for people \nwho need health care by making that deductible. We will do it for the \npeople who are working hard every day, struggling and fighting to make \nends meet.\n  The last point I will make to my friend is a comment by the president \nof the Health Insurance Association of America, who said:\n\n       Private drug-insurance policies are doomed from the start.\n\n  That is the Bush plan.\n\n       The idea sounds good but it cannot succeed in the real \n     world. I don't know of an insurance company that would offer \n     a drug-only policy like that or even consider it.\n\n  This isn't Tom Harkin talking or Harry Reid talking or Mary Landrieu \nor Barbara Boxer or Zell Miller. This is the head of the Insurance \nAssociation of America.\n  I say to my friend, in closing the extra time he has, the chart \nbehind him tells the story, and this quote tells the story. It is \ntruly, unfortunately, a sham prescription drug plan.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California. She is absolutely \nright. Forty-three percent of these tax breaks go to the top 1 percent, \nwho have an average income of over $915,000 a year. This is where \nGovernor Bush's tax breaks go. Yet Winifred Skinner--age 69, in my home \nState of Iowa--has to go around the streets and the roads and pick up \naluminum cans so she can pay for her prescription drugs. I think that \nsays it all.\n  I thank the Senator from California. I thank the Senator for yielding \nme the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleague from California and \nmy colleague from Iowa in their remarks and thank our colleague from \nIowa for spending the time to point out the important differences in \nthe approaches as we get closer to this election. It is something the \nAmerican people in our democracy will ultimately decide. I thank him.\n  I also point out to my colleague from California that not only would \nwe not be able to afford the right kind of prescription drug plan for \nAmerica because of the huge tax cut proposal that the Governor of Texas \nhas proposed, we would not be able to give the military the added \ninvestments that it may or may not need. We may be debating that, but \nthe generals appeared yesterday to describe how they needed some \nincrease in investments in the military in certain ways and we need to \nmodernize and streamline and save money where we can. But there are \nclearly some areas where we will not even be able to do that, if the \nproposed tax cut plan is in effect. We won't be able to provide the \nkind of Medicare coverage we need, and we will not be able to \nstrengthen our military in the ways that we perhaps need to as we \nrestructure and reshape.\n  Mr. President, our senior Senator from West Virginia has made a very \nimportant point. He has urged all of us in this Chamber to pay \nattention to a very important concept in our Constitution that is in \nthe process of being violated. This affects Louisiana and States such \nas ours. Twenty-three are listed on this chart, as the Senator pointed \nout.\n  No one brings a deeper understanding of the constitutional \nprerogatives and responsibilities of this body than does Senator Byrd, \nour esteemed colleague from West Virginia. I also know that he is \nintimately familiar with the writings of John Jay in one of the most \ncherished pieces of prose regarding our democracy, the Federalist \nPapers. In Federalist No. 64, he writes:\n\n       As all the States are equally represented in the Senate, \n     and by men the most able and most willing to promote the \n     interests of their constituents, they will all have an equal \n     degree of influence in that body, especially while they \n     continue to be careful in appointing proper persons, and to \n     insist on their punctual attendance.\n\n  Although I agree with this, I don't know if our Founding Fathers ever \nthought there would be a day where there were women in the Senate, but \nobviously this quote would apply so that men and women in the Senate \nwould have equal opportunity to represent their States.\n  When we follow these rules, as we can see, our Founding Fathers \nintended this body to represent the great States of our Union equally. \nSadly, after years of hearing of the importance of federalism, the \nSenate is proceeding down a course that makes a mockery of this ideal.\n  I represent one of the 20 States without a member on the \nAppropriations Committee in either Chamber. Currently there is no one \nfrom Louisiana on the Appropriations Committee in the House or in the \nSenate. The only protection a State such as mine--one of the earliest \nadditions to the Union, I might add--has is the power and process of \nthis Chamber. That power and that process is being jeopardized.\n  When the Senate leadership attempts to short-circuit that process, \nthey trample on the rights of States and undermine our very \nconstitutional structure.\n  This Senator will be asked to vote, I am certain, on an enormous bill \nthat I could not possibly have read, that has never passed out of this \nbody, and which I will have no opportunity to amend.\n  Let me say it again. The people in Louisiana, and these 23 States on \nthis chart, will have no opportunity to amend this final bill that is \ngoing to be before us shortly. Our rules were written to give life to \nthe intentions of our Founding Fathers that we have the opportunity to \ndeliberate and amend any measure offered in this body. When we follow \nthose rules, all States are truly equal--the most populous and \nprosperous, as well as the smallest and\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\nmost in need. That is what our Constitution contemplated, but that is \nnot what we are living out today.\n  A measure very important to my State, as many of you know, is the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act. I am concerned by virtue of the \nprocess we are following that this critical legislation, despite the \nsupport of 63 Senators, will not be debated on the Senate floor. That \npotential reality is unfair to Louisiana; it is unjust to the 4.5 \nmillion people who live in my State. It is certainly not what John Jay, \none of our founders, had in mind 200 years ago.\n  I think it is important to warn my colleagues now that this Senator \nintends to defend her State's place in this body. I thank my friend \nfrom West Virginia. I salute him for his ongoing leadership in this \ncause, and I look forward to helping him return this body to its \nappropriate place in the constitutional order. So whether we are \ndebating Medicare or our military or the environment and the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act, I hope that the people of my State \ncan truly be represented in that process. That is why they elected me \nand I plan to defend that right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has asked that I allocate the \ntime that is remaining under the original time given him under the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The Democratic leader will be out in a few minutes to take half an \nhour. When he completes his statement, Senator Kennedy will follow for \nhalf an hour. When he completes his statement at about 1:30, Senator \nConrad will be here to speak for half an hour. Following that, Senator \nDorgan will be here for half an hour. Following that, Senator Johnson \nwill be here to speak for 10 minutes. Senator Durbin will come at \napproximately 2:40 to speak for about a half hour. Senator Kohl will \nspeak around 3 or 3:10. At that time, most of the time will be gone. \nSenator Byrd will have the remaining time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic Leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from California \nand the Senator from Iowa for their extraordinary colloquy this \nafternoon on prescription drugs. There is so much confusion, \nunfortunately, on the issue, largely generated intentionally by the \nother side, hoping to confuse people, obfuscate the question, and \nconfuse the issue. The Senators from California and Iowa have, with \ngreat clarity, redefined it and redescribed it. I hope my colleagues, \nif they did not have the chance to hear them, will read it in the \nRecord tomorrow. It was really an extraordinary contribution. I am \ngrateful to them.\n  Also, I am grateful to the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia for allocating this time. I think it is very important that we \nhave an opportunity to talk about how it is that we got here. I want to \ndevote my comments to the question of how we got here, and I will talk \nabout two things.\n  First, I want to talk about how we got here in the larger context of \nSenate rules and Senate procedure and the practice of the majority \nunder the rules and Senate procedure. And then I want to talk a little \nbit about the schedule itself and how it is we got here, with only two \ndays remaining in the fiscal year, and so much work still incomplete.\n  I think it is very important for us to understand that, procedurally, \nwe have seen the disintegration of this institution in so many ways. I \nhave come to the floor on other occasions to talk about this \ndisintegration. I think this is important for newer Senators to \nunderstand. I see the extraordinarily able new Member from Georgia, a \nSenator who has just joined us, Mr. Miller. I worry about the Senator \n``Millers'' and about the Senator ``Fitzgeralds,'' our current \nPresiding Officer. I worry about those who may not have understood what \nthe Senate institution looked like as an institution years ago.\n  The controversy that we are facing is not about procedural niceties. \nThe right to debate and the right to amend are fundamental rights to \nevery Senator as he or she joins us in this Chamber. Without those \nfeatures, those abilities, we diminish substantially the nature of the \noffice of Senator, the institution of the Senate, and indeed the reason \nwhy Senators come here in the first place.\n  Obviously, we are here to debate the great issues of the day. But how \ndoes one do it if we are relegated to press conferences or other forums \nthat force us to talk about those matters off the floor? This Chamber \nhas been called the most deliberative body in the world. Yet I worry \nabout how little we have actually deliberated this year. And because we \nhave not deliberated, the Senate as an institution has suffered.\n  Unfortunately, over the last few years, I believe the Senate has \nchanged dramatically. We have been denied the opportunity to offer \namendments, as we are right now on the pending legislation, the so-\ncalled H-1B bill. In the entire 106th Congress, we have had only a \nhandful of opportunities where Senators were given their prerogative, \ngiven their fundamental right as a Senator, to do what they came here \nto do: to represent their constituents through active participant in \nthe legislative process here on the floor of the United States Senate.\n  There has been an extraordinary abuse of cloture. Over one-fourth of \nall the cloture votes in history--over 25 percent--have been cast since \n1995.\n  Twenty-five percent of all the cloture votes in history have been \ncast in the last four years. That is one figure I hope people will \nremember.\n  The other one which I think is critical is that we have had more \ncloture votes in 1999 than any other year in history. We broke a record \nthere as well.\n  Under the majority leader's approach, we have also had the most \nfirst-day cloture filings ever. We have never had this many cloture \nfilings on the first day.\n  This is a motion to invoke cloture. This is what it says. They are \nall the same. It is a stock statement.\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     amendment--in this case the marriage tax penalty bill.\n\n  The key phrase is the one we have outlined in yellow: ``To bring to a \nclose debate.''\n  I ask anybody who is even a casual observer of debate: How can you \nclose debate before it has even started? But that is what we are doing. \nA bill is filed. Amendments are filed to the bill in order to close the \nparliamentary tree. That denies us the opportunity to offer amendments. \nThen cloture is filed so we can bring to a closure debate that hasn't \neven begun.\n  We have done that more in 1999--of course we don't know about 2000 \nyet--than in any other year in our history. Of all the cloture votes \ntogether, over all of these years, 25 percent of them were in just the \nlast 4.\n  Under previous leaders, we filed cloture, of course. There were some \ngreat debates about many issues in the past that went on for days and \nweeks and even months. People would be here 24 hours a day. The debates \nwould go on, and a majority leader would be compelled to file cloture \nto bring the debate to a close. Why? Because they had been debating it. \nThat is what they were supposed to do. That is why cloture is supposed \nto be filed. Yet now we find ourselves voting on cloture before we have \nhad even the first hour or the first 5 minutes of debate.\n  We are also rewriting the rules on amendments themselves. Recently, \nwe outlawed nongermane sense-of-the-Senate amendments to appropriations \nbills. We can't do that anymore.\n  The number of amendments have also been grossly restricted. I have \nnever seen, as I have this year, the overly restrictive way with which \nwe have approached virtually every single bill.\n  Take the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the bill we took up \nearlier this year. An average of 39 amendments have been offered to \nESEA reauthorization bill over the last 25 years--39 amendments. Yet \nthis year, only four Democratic amendments to the ESEA bill were \npermitted before the bill was pulled. That's right: historically, there \nwere an average of 39\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\namendments to ESEA bills. This year, Democrats offered four amendments, \nand the bill was gone. We are told we don't have time to complete the \nbill. We are told the Democrats shouldn't even think about offering all \nof these amendments. We are told that bills should be passed with no \namendments at all, or if we must offer amendments, they must meet the \nstrict definition of ``relevant\" used by the parliamentarian.\n  The interesting thing is, nonrelevant amendments have been considered \nOK for the Republican Party in the past. I have a chart that shows some \nof the examples of non-relevant amendments offered when the Republicans \nwere in the minority, and even in some cases when they were in the \nmajority.\n  We had a juvenile justice bill that came up in 1999. The majority \nleader saw fit to offer a ``prayer at school memorial services'' \namendment to a juvenile justice bill. That was OK.\n  We had a Commerce-Justice appropriations bill 2 years ago. It was OK \nto offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on Social Security at that \ntime.\n  We had a supplemental appropriations bill. This was when \nthe Republicans were in the minority, and the Senator from Delaware, \nnow chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, certainly didn't \nsee anything wrong with offering a tax cut amendment to that bill. \nEvidently, that was OK, too.\n\n  Yet now Republicans are saying: Democrats don't have a right to offer \nnonrelevant amendments, nongermane amendments. We can, but you can't.\n  I don't understand that logic. I don't understand how in 1993 when \nthey were in the minority the senior Senator from North Carolina saw \nfit to offer a patent for the Daughters of the Confederacy amendment to \nthe community service bill.\n  I don't see how we could have a Lithuanian independence amendment to \nthe Clean Air Act. I want clean air in Lithuania, but I have to tell \nyou this had nothing to do with clean air in Lithuania. This wasn't \nrelevant. This wasn't germane.\n  There is a double standard here. I hope people understand our \nfrustration as they watch the action and hear the words.\n  We have also trivialized Senate-House conferences over the last \nseveral years. The scope of the conference rule was repealed. Now \nconference reports can include anything and everything--even measures \nthat were never included in either House.\n  That is all part of what got us to the problem we are in now with \nappropriations. All of this, I might say, goes back to the concern the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia shared as he talked about the \nprocedures and the breakdown of the institution. When we repeal the \nscope of conference rule that said things had to be in either the House \nor Senate bill before they could be considered in conference, when we \nrepealed that, we opened up, as our Senator from New Mexico likes to \ncall it, a ``box of Pandoras''--a real box of Pandoras.\n  We now have sham conferences. It is almost like a huge U-Haul truck \nis pulled right up to the front door. We just lob everything in there \nand drive it on down to the White House. Nobody knows what is in that \nbig box of Pandoras. It is put into that truck, hauled down to the \nWhite House, the President signs it, and it becomes law.\n  It is getting worse and worse. Now we find our Republican colleagues \nwant to take what happened in a subcommittee, where maybe a handful of \npeople know anything about it, bypass this Chamber entirely, go into a \nconference, load up that truck, and take it down to the White House. \nThat is why we said no last week. That is why we said you can't marry \nthese bills that have had no consideration on the Senate floor--sham \nconferences.\n  I know why we are doing this. In fact, our colleagues on the other \nside have been very candid about it, both privately and publicly. They \nhave said: We don't want to have to vote on these tough issues. We have \na lot of vulnerable incumbents. We are not going to allow these \namendments if they are going to be problematic.\n  I am sorry if someone is inconvenienced. We have had to do that for \nyears. Casting votes is what being a Senator is all about. If you \noppose a measure, then table an amendment, offer a second degree, offer \nan alternative.\n  There has to be a way of doing it other than gagging this \ninstitution. Forcing cloture votes against imagined filibusters in \norder to cast blame just doesn't work.\n  There are those on the other side who have said we shouldn't have to \nspend more than a couple of days on any one of these bills. We should \nbe able to get these things done within 24 to 48 hours. Why should they \ntake so long? My answer is because this is the Senate. I will get into \ndays in just a minute. We have the days.\n  We have ways with which to ensure we can have a good debate. We can \nwork Mondays and Fridays. We can work after 6. We could do a lot of \nthings to ensure that the days are there. Some of the very finest \npieces of legislation ever to pass the Congress took more than a couple \nof days. Bills sometimes take longer. They are complicated.\n  The majority keeps asking for cooperation. But I think what they \ntruly mean is capitulation.\n  All Senators should be free to debate an amendment. We shouldn't have \nto face these artificial relevancy requirements. Important bills should \nhave their time on the floor. We ought to have good, rigorous debates. \nWe ought to be able to offer amendments. Let's agree to disagree and \nlet's vote and move on. We did that in 1994 with a piece of legislation \nfrom which we still benefit today.\n\n  Every crime statistic is down in America today, every single one. Do \nyou know why that is? That is in part because we passed the COPS \nProgram, the community police program. That is because we have provided \nresources to police officers in ways they didn't have earlier in the \ndecade. Another reason is that we passed an awfully good crime bill in \n1994, the last year Democrats were in the majority.\n  Do you know how long it took? We spent 2 weeks on that crime bill. We \nhad 92 amendments which were proposed, 86 amendments adopted, over 20 \nrollcall votes. That is the way the Senate is supposed to work--a good, \nrigorous debate, and ultimately a product that enjoyed, in this case, \nbroad bipartisan support. Why? Because it was a good piece of \nlegislation. Why? Because everybody had their say. Why? Because it was \nprobably an improved product over what it was when it was first \nintroduced.\n  That ought to be the model. I don't think there was a cloture motion \nfiled in that entire debate. We didn't fill any trees. We didn't say, \nwe have to get this done in 2 days. We didn't say, we don't have time. \nWe said, we are going to do it and we are going to do it right. And we \ndid it right. And 6 years later, we still benefit.\n  We are prepared to work with our colleagues on the other side. We \nonly hope they share the deeply held view about commitment to the \ninstitution, about commitment to the rights of each Senator, about an \nunderstanding of the responsibility for the legacy of this institution \nfor future Senators and for all of this country as we consider the \nfragile nature of democracy itself.\n  I said there were two items. The first was procedural; the second is \nschedule. The majority later said last year:\n\n       We were out of town two months and our approval rating went \n     up 11 points. I think I've got this thing figured out.\n\n  They are sure acting as if they have it figured out. If they were \nmotivated to be out, so their points went up, they have shown it by the \nschedule.\n  This is the schedule for the year. All those red days are days we are \nnot in session. All the blue days are the days we are in session. Look \nat all those red days. Yet we are told: We don't have time. We don't \nhave time to take up appropriations bills. We don't have time to take \nup amendments. We don't have time to take up a legislative agenda.\n  We don't have time? Maybe it is because there is a little more red \nthan there ought to be. The number of days we are scheduled to be in \nsession in the year 2000 is shown: 115. That is the number of days in \nsession in the year 2000. Keep in mind, there are 365 days in the year, \nyet all we could find time for were 115 out of that 365. As it happens, \nthis is the shortest session of the Senate in half a century--since \n1956. In fact, this year's schedule is only two days longer that the \ninfamous do-nothing Congress of 1948.\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\n  The number of days with no votes in the year 2000, out of that 115: \n34. We will be in session for 115 days in session out of 365 days, but \nwe have lopped off a third of those days. On 34 of the 115 days, we \nhave had no votes at all.\n  But there is no time.\n  The number of days on Mondays with votes in the year is shown. Out of \nall the Mondays in this year, we have only had three where we have had \nvotes--three Mondays.\n  On how many Fridays of this year 2000 did we have votes? Six. We did \na little bit better on Fridays than Mondays. Three Mondays with votes; \nsix Fridays with votes.\n  Mondays with votes in September? There it is: One.\n  No time for appropriations bills. No time for all of the issues \nDemocrats wanted to take up. Yet on only 1 Monday in the month of \nSeptember did we have votes.\n  On Fridays in September, we didn't do quite as well. I don't know how \nwe explain no votes on Fridays in September when we have all this work, \nknowing we will bump up against the end of the fiscal year at the end \nof this month. Imagine not having votes on Mondays or Fridays, knowing \nwe have 11 appropriations bills that are yet to be completed.\n  Appropriations bills completed to date? Only two. We are dealing here \nwith numbers most people understand: 1's and 2's.\n  We have done a little calculating because now we are getting into \nmore advanced arithmetic. I said we have been using 1's and 2's and \n0's. We used our calculator to decide how long it would take at this \nrate to complete the work on the remaining 11 appropriations bills, and \nnow we are into triple digits: 572 days to complete work on the 11 \nappropriations bills on this schedule.\n  Finally, there is one more calculation. I am sure people are trying \nto figure that out. If you take the 572 and project it out, I promise \nwe will be finished by April 16 of the year 2002. That is when we \nfinish our work on the appropriations bills using the schedule we have \nadopted in the year 2000: 4/16/02--April 16, 2002. So mark that in your \ncalendars, folks. That is likely to be the year, the month, and the day \nthat we finish our bills using the schedule we have employed this year.\n  Someone once said, 90 percent of success is just showing up. Maybe \nthat is our problem. We aren't showing up. Maybe we ought to show up a \nlittle bit more. Maybe we ought to work on Mondays and Fridays. Maybe \nwe ought to work a little bit longer after 6 o'clock. Ninety percent of \nsuccess is just showing up. Maybe we can be a little more successful. \nWhen we show up, maybe we ought to remember why we are here. Maybe we \nought to remember the prerogatives of every Senator. Maybe we ought to \ncall back the golden days when Senators debated profoundly on the \nissues of the day.\n  Open this drawer: Lyndon Baines Johnson sat at this desk, Mike \nMansfield sat at this desk, Joe Robinson sat at this desk, Robert C. \nByrd sat at this desk. George Mitchell sat at this desk. I don't know \nhow I would explain to my predecessors what has happened to the Senate \nthis year. That is why the same Robert C. Byrd came to the floor this \nmorning. Listen to Robert C. Byrd. Listen to George Mitchell. Go back \nin the Record and listen to Lyndon Baines Johnson, listen to Joe \nRobinson, and remember what Mike Mansfield said.\n  Let's call back the glory of this institution. Let's remember why we \nare here, and we can then all be proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the \nDemocratic leader's excellent statement and comment.\n  I was listening particularly to the wrap-up and recalling a number of \nthe majority leaders with whom I had the good opportunity to serve \nbringing into real relief how at that time we did have the engagement \nof the issues and the resolution of questions of public policy.\n  That was the time-honored tradition of this body. It hails back to \nthe time of the Constitutional Convention and our Founding Fathers and \nwhat they believed we ought to be about.\n  I hope his words will be taken to heart by our colleagues as \nwelcoming into these final days of this session.\n  We are now in the final days of this session. This afternoon, we will \nmark the end of the current fiscal year by passing a bill--a continuing \nresolution--that acknowledges that Congress was unable to complete its \nwork. So now we're going to put government funding on auto-pilot while \nour Republican friends figure out what to do.\n  We started this year--the first of the new millennium--with great \nhope. We were going to pass new laws to meet the urgent needs of \nfamilies across America--to improve health care and education, and \nprovide jobs for working families. The question is, did American \ntaxpayers get their money's worth?\n  So far in this first year of the new millennium, we have enacted: 27 \nlaws naming new federal buildings; 7 laws granting awards to \nindividuals; 3 technical corrections to existing laws; 4 laws \nestablishing small foreign assistance projects; 4 commemoratives, and 2 \nlaws establishing new commissions.\n  We found time in our busy schedules to pass a sense of Congress \nresolution calling for democracy in a Latin American country. We \nrelocated people from one South Pacific atoll to another. We encouraged \nthe development of methane hydrate resources. We allowed the Interior \nDepartment to collect new fees for films made in our parks. We \neliminated unfair practices in the boxing industry. We renamed the \nWashington Opera as the National Opera. We passed a new law providing \nassistance to neotropical migratory birds.\n  I have no doubt that each of these laws was necessary. But nowhere on \nthe list did we pass the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to \nstrengthen the nation's public schools. Nowhere on this list is the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Nowhere do we find a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit for senior citizens. Nowhere is a long-overdue increase in \nthe minimum wage. Nowhere does Congress strengthen our laws against \nhate crimes. Nowhere on the list are new gun laws to keep our schools \nand communities safe.\n  If ever a ``Do-Nothing'' label fit a Congress, it fits this ``Do-\nNothing'' Republican Congress.\n  Our country as a whole is enjoying an unprecedented period of \nprosperity--the longest period of economic growth in our nation's \nhistory. But for millions of Americans, it is someone else's \nprosperity. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, a person earning \nthe minimum wage earns only $10,700 a year--$3,400 below the poverty \nline for a family of three.\n  Over the past three decades, the extraordinary benefits of our record \nprosperity have been flagrantly skewed in favor of the wealthiest \nmembers of society. We are pleased with the Census Bureau Report this \nweek showing that the poverty rate dropped to its lowest level since \n1979. Yet, poverty has almost doubled among full-time, year-round \nworkers since the late 1970s--from about 1.5 million to almost 3 \nmillion by 1998, according to a June 2000 Conference Board report.\n  Today, the top one percent of households have more wealth than the \nentire bottom 95 percent combined.\n  Yet, despite this historic period of economic growth, minimum wage \nworkers are not able to afford adequate housing. The National Low \nIncome Housing Coalition recently found that the current minimum wage \nfails to provide the income necessary to afford a two bedroom apartment \nin any area of this country.\n  Often, workers are putting in longer hours on the job, and more \nfamily members are working. A study released by the Economic Policy \nInstitute this month shows that in 1998, lower income families are \nworking 379 more hours a year than they were in 1979.\n  The increase in working hours for African American and Hispanic \nfamilies is even more dramatic. Middle-class African American families \nwork an average of 9.4 hours more per week than their white \ncounterparts. Hispanic families work five hours a week more than whites \nat every income level.\n  Parents are spending less and less time with their families--22 hours \nless a week than they did 30 years ago, according to a study last year \nby the Council of Economic Advisers. Serious health and safety problems \nresult when employees are forced to work long hours. A recent front \npage article in the New York Times told the story of Brent Churchill, a \npower lineman, who died in an on-the-job accident after working two and \na half days on a total of 5 hours of sleep.\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\n  There are signs that at least House Republicans are finally coming \naround to our way of thinking. They have offered the President a plan \nto raise the minimum wage. This positive development gives us real hope \nthat we can raise the pay of the lowest paid workers before we adjourn. \nBut we cannot misuse an increase in the minimum wage as an excuse to \ncut workers' overtime pay, as the GOP proposes. The overtime pay \nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act have been in place for over \n60 years, and they protect the rights of 73 million Americans.\n  Republicans also want to use any minimum wage legislation as a \nvehicle to repeal protections from millions of Americans who work hard \nas inside salespeople, funeral directors, embalmers, and computer \ntechnicians. These changes would punish these workers for advances in \ntechnology that have made businesses more efficient. They would take \naway basic protections from precisely those occupations where long \nhours are most at issue.\n  The Republican proposal also freezes the guaranteed cash wage for \nwaiters and waitresses, and other tip employees. These men and women \nare usually among the lowest paid workers and often struggle to make \nends meet.\n  Finally, the tax breaks in the Republican proposal are not \nreasonable. They total $76 billion over ten years, compared to the $21 \nbillion tax cut that was included in the last minimum wage law that was \nenacted in 1996.\n  Congress is quick to find time to vote to increase their own \nsalaries. The increase now pending would mean a raise of over $4,000 a \nyear. Yet, we have not found the time to pass an increase in the \nminimum wage to benefit hard-working, low-income Americans at the \nbottom of the economic ladder. Each day we fail to act, families across \nthe country fall farther behind. The dollar increase we propose now \nshould have gone into effect in January 1999. Since then, minimum wage \nworkers have lost over $3,000 due to the inaction of Congress.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage. \nThey agree that work should pay, and that the men and women who work \nhard to earn the minimum wage should be able to afford clothing for \ntheir children and food on their tables.\n  Minimum wage workers should not be forced to wait any longer for the \nfair increase they deserve. We have bipartisan support for this \nincrease and we are not going to go away or back down. No one who works \nfor a living should have to live in poverty.\n  Mr. President, these charts depict parents working harder. This \ncharts the hours worked by families with children in the bottom 40 \npercent of income. It is a comparison of the percent of increase in \nhours worked from 1979 to 1998. This 13.8 percent represents an average \nincrease of 379 hours of work a year, compared to hours worked in 1979. \nIt is just slightly less for white full-time workers. What we are \nfinding out for Hispanics is it is 5 hours more a week than for white \nworkers, and for African Americans it is 9 hours more. For white \nworkers you have a 337 hour increase, and you almost double that for \nAfrican American workers.\n  Let's see what that has meant in terms of where they rate in America \nin terms of the distribution of income. The bottom fifth of families \nhave declined by 15 percent, even though they are working close to 400 \nhours a year longer than they were working 20 years ago. They have \nfallen behind, about a 15 percent decline in their living. For the \nmiddle fifth it is about a 12 percent advantage, and the top fifth, a \n73 percent advantage.\n  If you took a chart--I will explain this on the next presentation--\nand divide the total workforce in fifths, from 1948 to 1975, you would \nfind them virtually all identical. All of America moved together during \nthose years. In the immediate period after World War II, all America \nmoved together.\n  As a result of hard work and ingenuity, individuals who were \nsuccessful experienced enhanced prosperity, which is fine. But all \nAmericans who were prepared to work moved along together. Now we are \nseeing this extraordinary skewing at lower incomes of people working \nharder and harder and falling further and further behind.\n  This is another chart which indicates the purchasing value of the \nminimum wage is gradually declining. The poverty line is increasing \nwhich results in more and more American workers working harder and \nlonger and falling into poverty, with all the implications for \nthemselves and their families.\n  This next chart is extraordinary. It shows the expansion of \nproductivity. We have heard we cannot increase the minimum wage because \nwe have lost our edge in productivity. One can see from this chart the \nexplosion in productivity. The blue line is a decline in real wages.\n  Historically, wages used to keep pace with the increase in \nproductivity because that affects the actual cost to the employer. If \nthe employees are going to be more productive, they ought to \nparticipate in the benefits of increasing profits and increasing \nproductivity. But that is not happening, and it is not happening among \nthe low-income workers.\n  This next chart shows the purchasing power again. In 1968, it was \n$7.66; it is now $5.15. Without an increase, it will fall to $4.90, the \nlowest in the history of the purchasing power of the minimum wage. At a \ntime of the greatest economic prosperity of any country in the world, \nthe income of those individuals who are working 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year is the lowest it has been in the history of the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage. That is absolutely crazy.\n  We have been denied an opportunity to vote on this issue. Why don't \nwe vote on it and see how the Members feel about it? Why don't we just \ngo ahead and take the vote? But, no, we are denied that opportunity. It \nis unacceptable that we are leaving here without doing so. That is one \npart of the unfinished business our leader, Senator Daschle, talked \nabout.\n  The Glenn Commission Report on Math and Science Teaching released \nyesterday is a clear call to action to do more to put qualified math \nand science teachers in the Nation's classrooms.\n  As the commission emphasized, we need greater investments in math and \nscience at every level. This commission is made up of distinguished \neducators, public officials, school administrators, school boards, \nlocal personnel, State national directors, and chaired by our good \nfriend and colleague, Senator John Glenn, who spent such a great deal \nof time in service in the Senate focusing on and giving life to the \nissues of math and science training. He provided great leadership. We \nare very much in his debt for that effort. Now for the last 2 years, he \nhas chaired a very outstanding commission, and they made their \nrecommendations yesterday.\n  As the commission emphasized, we need greater investments in math and \nscience at every level--federal, state, and local--to significantly \nincrease the number of math and science teachers and improve the \nquality of their preparation.\n  We have made some significant progress in recent years, but we cannot \nafford to be complacent. In our increasingly high-tech economy, high \nschool graduates need strong math and analytical skills in order to be \ncompetitive in the workplace. In addition, schools face record-high \nenrollments that will continue to rise, and they also face serious \nteacher shortages.\n  Recruiting, training, and retaining high-quality teachers, \nparticularly math and science teachers, deserve higher priority on our \neducation agenda in Congress. We should do all we can to see that \nschools have the Federal support they deserve. The need is especially \nurgent in schools that serve disadvantaged students.\n  The commission's timely report gives us new bipartisan momentum to \naddress these fundamental issues more effectively.\n  The report calls for a $3.1 billion investment a year by the federal \ngovernment for recruiting, mentoring, and training teachers--with most \nof it for professional development activities. The question is, how \nfast can Congress respond? Can we act this year, or will we lose \nanother year?\n  I propose that in the fiscal year 2001 appropriations, we make a down \npayment on the Glenn Commission recommendation investing $1 billion in \nteacher quality programs, including Title II of the Higher Education \nAct, and the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, which makes \nmath and science a priority.\n  Math and science appropriations is about $335 million. It is in \nplace. It has\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\nthe confidence of educators. It is focused on math and science. We can \ntake the initiative to enhance that program, following the Glenn \nrecommendations. We can do that as our appropriators are meeting with \nthe administration in these last 2 weeks.\n  Title II of HEA is vastly underfunded this year at $98 million and \nthe Eisenhower Program is vastly underfunded at $335 million.\n  By committing $1 billion now, for the coming year, we will be making \na needed down payment toward meeting the Nation's teaching needs.\n  No classroom is any better than the teacher in it. The Glenn \nCommission report is our chance in Congress to tackle this head on and \ndo what is so obviously needed to improve teacher quality across the \ncountry.\n  It cries out for action, and this is a priority. We should respond to \nit, and we can do something now. We have to provide the resources for \ninvesting in this area, I believe.\n  Finally, in the debate over prescription drugs, one of the most \nimportant reasons for Congress to act and act promptly has often been \noverlooked. The best source of comprehensive, affordable health \ninsurance coverage for senior citizens is through employer retirement \nplans. In fact, the combination of Medicare and so-called employer \nwrap-around coverage is the gold standard for health insurance coverage \nfor the elderly.\n  But private retirement coverage is in free fall, with ominous \nimplications for all retirees. In the three year period from 1994 to \n1997, the proportion of firms offering retiree health coverage dropped \nby 25 percent. In 1998, and 1999, another 18 percent dropped coverage.\n  We know one-third of the elderly have no prescription drug coverage. \nNone. Another third have employer-based coverage.\n  From 1994 to 1997, it dropped 25 percent. From 1997 to 1999, it \ndropped another 18 percent. All the indicators are going through the \nbottom. We are seeing dramatic reductions in coverage. We are seeing \nthat prescription drugs are increasingly less relevant in terms of HMOs \nbecause the HMOs have been putting in a cap of $1,000 and sometimes \n$500 in the last 3 years, capping the amount they will actually provide \nfor the senior citizens. And many of them are moving out of parts of \nthe country.\n  The Medigap program is prohibitively expensive. The only people who \nare guaranteed prescription drugs with any degree of certainty and \npredictability are the poorest of Americans under the Medicaid program.\n  We can do better. We must do better. We can do better even as we are \nin the last 2 weeks of this session.\n  A 1999 survey of large employers by the consulting firm of Hewitt \nAssociates found that 30 percent of these firms said they would \nconsider dropping coverage over the next 3 to 5 years. So we have a 25-\npercent reduction from 1994 to 1997; an 18-percent reduction from 1997 \nto 1999; and now the prediction of another 30 percent who are going to \nlose it over the period of the next 3 years.\n  We know what is happening. The time to act is now.\n  According to a new study for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a central \nreason for this decline is the escalating cost of prescription drugs \nand Medicare's failure to provide coverage. As the study found:\n\n       Prescription drug costs are driving retiree health costs to \n     an unprecedented extent. . . . The drug benefit has \n     represented 40-60 percent of retiree's health costs after \n     accounting for Medicare. Based on current cost trends, Hewitt \n     projects drug benefits to represent as much as 80 percent of \n     total 65+ retiree health costs in 2003.\n\n  The study estimates that President Clinton's plan could save \nemployees as much as $15 billion annually when it is fully phased in. \nThey conclude:\n\n       The financial savings could . . . slow the erosion of \n     retiree health care by lowering the costs for prescription \n     drug benefits, which have been increasing for employers at \n     double-digit rates and are a major source of concern.\n\n  A critical reason for this Congress to act to provide Medicare \nprescription drug coverage for the elderly is the worsening situation \nfacing retirees. But the Republican majority won't act. They won't \nallow a vote. Just 3 days ago, they declared that Medicare prescription \ndrug coverage is dead for this year. Their own proposals are not what \nsenior citizens want and need.\n  The differences between the two parties are clear on this issue. Vice \nPresident Gore and Governor Bush have proposed two very different \nresponses to this problem. The Gore plan provides a solid benefit under \nthe existing Medicare program. Under the leadership of Senator Graham \nand Senator Robb, the Senate has already voted on a bipartisan plan \nthat would achieve the objectives of the Gore proposal. With the \nsupport of only a few more Republicans, a real prescription benefit can \npass this year, so that all our senior citizens can get the prompt help \nthey need.\n  Shown on this chart are the Gore and Bush plans. You have the \ncomparisons. The Gore plan would be implemented in 1 year. The Bush \nplan is 4 years, with revenue-sharing with the States or block grants \nto the States. We would have to appropriate the money. Then, if there \nis, according to Governor Bush, a significant reform of the Medicare \nsystem, within that significant reform of the Medicare system--I don't \nknow whether he means just the privatization or not--a prescription \ndrug program could be included. You have that versus starting in a year \nfrom now.\n  Secondly, with regard to the guaranteed benefits--this is a crucial \ndifference--what does this ``Yes'' shown on the chart mean on \nguaranteed benefits? It means this: When a senior goes into a health \ndelivery system needing a prescription drug, the doctor prescribes what \nprescription drug that senior needs, and the rest is arranged through \nthe Medicare system in terms of the payment. But the doctor decides.\n  As shown over here on the chart, under the Bush proposal it is going \nto be the HMO. They are going to be the ones making the decision. We \ncan't even get the HMO reform here in the Senate. Now they are \nsuggesting that we have a whole new system of benefits that are going \nto go through that system, where the HMOs and bean counters, who too \noften put profits ahead of patients, are going to make that decision.\n\n  Under the Gore plan, there will be good coverage. It is going to be \ncomprehensive coverage. But under the Bush plan, we don't know what the \ncoverage is going to be because it will be decided by the HMOs. This \nmeans it will be built out of the Medicare system. And this will be \nsome other program that may be built upon HMOs or the private sector, \nwhich have been remarkably unsuccessful in many parts of this country.\n  More than 930,000 people have lost Medicare HMO coverage this year \nalone. Rather than be expanded, the drug program has been in decline. \nSenior citizens need help now. Al Gore's plan provides prescription \ndrugs under Medicare for every senior citizen in 2002. Under the Bush \nproposal, there will be 25 million seniors who will be excluded because \nthey are not eligible under the parameters of the Bush proposal. This \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n  Experience shows that the Bush proposal would take years to put in \noperation. Only 14 States have the kind of insurance plans for senior \ncitizens in operation today. This would be all under the Bush proposal. \nAll 50 States must pass new laws or modify legislation. Only 16 States \ncurrently have any drug insurance program. The CHIP program--the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--was passed in August of 1997, was \navailable in October of 1997; and under Texas law, it took them until \nNovember 1999 to take advantage of it. It took 2 years to take \nadvantage of it. And the money was already there. The Governors have \nalready indicated they do not want the responsibility to develop, even \nwith the funding, a whole new administration to be able to implement \nthe program. So this is really a nonstarter for seniors.\n  It makes no sense to depend on HMOs to provide this crucial benefit. \nThe Bush plan does not provide the stable, reliable, guaranteed \ncoverage that should be a part of Medicare's promise to the elderly.\n  But there is one guarantee under the Bush plan. The benefits are \nguaranteed to be inadequate. The Bush program allocates almost $100 \nbillion less to prescription drug coverage than the Gore plan. The \nreason for this lesser amount is obvious. The Bush approach wastes most \nof the surplus on new tax breaks for the wealthy, and too little is \nleft to help senior citizens.\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that under \nthe similar Republican plan passed by the House of Representatives, \nbenefits would be so inadequate and costs so high that less than half \nof the senior citizens who need the help the most--those who have no \nprescription drug coverage at all--will ever participate. A \nprescription drug benefit that leaves out half of the senior citizens \nwho need protection the most is not a serious plan to help senior \ncitizens.\n  There is still time for Congress to enact a genuine prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare. The administration has presented a strong \nproposal. Let's work together to enact it this year. It is not too \nlate. The American people are waiting for our answer.\n  These are some of the issues I would hope we could still address. We \nought to be able to pass the minimum wage. It is not complicated. It is \nnot difficult. We know what is at play here.\n  We ought to be able to finally get prescription drug legislation. We \nvoted on this in the Senate. A majority of the Members of the Senate \nactually supported a prescription drug program that would be worked \nthrough Medicare. We ought to be able to pass that in the Senate. As I \nmentioned, a majority of the Members already do support it. We ought to \nbe able to get a downpayment on that legislation.\n  We ought to be able to deal with some of the education challenges. \nThat is important. We ought to be able to get the Patients' Bill of \nRights passed, as well as the hate crimes issues, and try to do \nsomething on the gun show loophole, and some other matters. These are \npublic policy matters that I think the American people want us to \naddress. They do not want us to be out here now, as we have spent the \nbetter part of this week, in quorum calls. They want action, and they \nwant action now. We, on this side of the aisle, are prepared to provide \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today as a senior member of the \nBudget Committee to talk about what I see as a breakdown in the budget \nprocess in the Senate. I think every member of the Budget Committee and \nevery Member of the Senate ought to be concerned about what has \nhappened the last several years but even more dramatically this year, \nin what can only be called a virtual meltdown of the budget process.\n  Those who are watching may say, well, what do we care what the budget \nprocess is. We care about the budget outcome. And that is exactly \nright. The most important thing is the budget outcome. But many times \nhow you start has a lot to do with how you end up, and I am afraid we \nhave now developed a disastrous operating procedure around here.\n  We start out with a fiction of a budget; we end up with no \naccountability, no control, and chaos at the end. That is where we are \ntoday. This is chaos. Every Member of the Senate knows that is true.\n  We have a circumstance now where bills are passed in committee, never \ncome to the floor of the Senate, go to a conference committee, the \nDemocrats are locked out of the conference committee, and Senators are \ndenied their right to offer amendments to improve legislation. That is \nnot the way the process is supposed to work. Together we have to mend \nit. If we don't, we are going to have a circumstance where someday, \nwhen the Democrats are going to be back in control, we can operate this \nway. And if you are in the minority and you are locked out and \nprevented from offering amendments, your ability to represent your \nconstituents is badly diminished.\n  This is not just a Democrat issue or Republican issue. This is a \nquestion of how we function in this body. It is in all of our interests \nto have a process where Senators' fundamental rights are protected so \nthey can carry out their fundamental responsibilities.\n  When I say we are in chaos, the story in the Washington Post \nyesterday, front-page story, tells us that is true. Here is the story: \n``Spending Floodgates Open on Hill.'' Congress is moving to approve the \nbiggest spending increase since Republicans took control in 1995. The \nbinge is setting off alarms among fiscal conservatives and threatens to \nabsorb a chunk of the future surplus.\n  ``It is just a free for all,'' said Senator McCain. ``They are all \nequal opportunity pork-barrelers . . . This is the worst ever.''\n  I agree with Senator McCain. This is the worst ever. We have a \nprocess that is broken. The budget resolution is being paid no \nattention. That was predictable because the budget resolution made no \nearthly sense. It wasn't real. It was a fiction. As a result, we have \nno control, no accountability for what follows. Everybody is on their \nown. Every one of these committees is on their own. They are out there \ndividing them up, throwing it in. We are going to have--I predict \ntoday--a stack of paper on our desks, and we are going to be told: Take \nit or leave it; vote for it or the Government will shut down.\n  That is where we are headed. It is very clear to anybody who is \nwatching. That should not be the way we conduct the people's business.\n  What is especially troubling about all this is that we have made \nenormous progress over the last several years, enormous progress in \ngetting our fiscal house in order. We should not put at risk that \nprogress. We should not put at risk the prosperity that has followed \ngetting our fiscal house in order.\n\n  I want to look at the last three administrations and their record on \ndeficits. I think it is instructive as we go into this election season. \nI think it is instructive as we consider what is occurring in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives right now.\n  If we go back 20 years ago, 1981, President Reagan came in. He had \nthe old trickle-down economics. It was a disaster in terms of deficits; \nthe deficits skyrocketed. We went from a deficit of about $80 billion \nto over $200 billion and tripled the national debt during his years. \nFiscally, it was a chaotic time. President Bush came in; the deficit \nwas $153 billion. By the time he left, it was $290 billion--more than \ndouble.\n  That is the record. It is in the books. I know it makes tough reading \nfor some of our friends on the other side, but that is their record on \nthe fiscal health of this country. The fact is, they had a policy of \ndeficits and debt, and those deficits and debt threatened the \nfundamental economic security of the country.\n  In 1993, we had a new administration. This is their record--not a \nquestion; these are the facts. I remember President Reagan used to say \nfacts are stubborn things. He was absolutely right about that. Facts \nare stubborn things.\n  In 1993, the deficit was $255 billion. We passed a 5-year plan to \nreduce the budget deficit and to get it under control. Our friends on \nthe other side said that if we passed that plan, it would crater the \neconomy. That is what they said at the time. They said it wouldn't \nreduce the deficit. They said it would increase it. They said it \nwouldn't reduce interest rates; that it would increase them. They said \nit wouldn't reduce inflation; that it would increase inflation.\n  We can go back now and check the record. They were wrong on each and \nevery count--not just a little bit wrong, completely wrong. Look at the \nrecord.\n  Every year of that 5-year plan, the deficit went down and went down \ndramatically, until we got to the fifth year of the plan and we were \nheaded toward surplus. That is the record. We can look back and see who \nis right and who is wrong. It is just as clear as it can be.\n  The question is, Are we going to put all of this at risk? The \nPresident announced just the other day that we are going to have a $230 \nbillion budget surplus, a $230 billion budget surplus for fiscal year \n2000. Just 8 years ago, we had a $290 billion budget deficit.\n  The results from this fiscal policy have been very clear. Before I \nget to the results, let me show how it happened. How did we get into \nthis position? We got into this position by, in 1992, passing a plan \nthat cut spending and, yes, raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent--\nraised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent. The revenue line went \nup; the spending line came down. We balanced the budget. We created \nsurpluses, and the economic results have been dramatic and \nextraordinarily positive.\n  We now have the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. \nThis was recorded on February 1, 2000, in the Washington Post, the \nheadline, ``Expansion is Now Nation's Longest,'' 107\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\nmonths of economic growth, the longest economic expansion in our \nNation's history.\n  It is not just a record of economic expansion. It is the other \npositive results we obtained as well by getting our fiscal house in \norder: the lowest unemployment rate in 42 years; and on inflation, the \nlowest sustained level since 1965. We have the lowest level of \nsustained inflation in 35 years because we got our fiscal house in \norder. The welfare caseload has been cut in half; the percentage on \nwelfare in the country is the lowest since 1967. This is the record. It \nis very clear. Those of us who supported welfare reform, those of us \nwho supported the budget plan to get our fiscal house in order, those \ndecisions have paid off for the country, and we should not put it all \nat risk.\n  Federal spending as a percentage of our national income is the lowest \nit has been since 1966.\n  Federal spending is the lowest as a percentage of our national income \nsince 1966. These are the kinds of positive results we have developed \nas a result of a budget plan that added up, that made sense, that got \nour fiscal house in order.\n  Some say, gee, income taxes are the highest they have been in a \ngeneration. Not true. The reason we have expanded revenue--yes, we \nraised rates on the wealthiest 1 percent. That is undeniable. That is \ncorrect. That was part of the plan that got our fiscal house in order. \nBut it is also true that we passed sweeping tax cuts, child care \ncredit, expansion of the earned-income tax that dramatically reduced \nthe income taxes of tens of millions of Americans.\n  On March 26 of this year, the Washington Post, on page 1, ran a story \nunder this headline: ``Federal Tax Level Falls For Most; Studies Show \nBurden Now Less Than 10 percent'' on a significant part of the American \npublic.\n  Most Americans, this year, will have to fork over less than 10 \npercent of their income to the Federal Government when they file \nFederal income taxes. The fact is, for many segments of our society, \nincome taxes, combined with payroll taxes, have gone down. That is \nbecause of the expansion of the earned-income tax, and that is because \nof the child credit. In fact, if you compare the tax burden for working \nfamilies--according to the Tax Foundation, this is for a family earning \n$68,000 in 1999--from 1975--this is both income taxes and payroll \ntaxes--their tax burden declined from 10.4 percent to 8.9 percent.\n  That is not Kent Conrad's numbers; those are the numbers from the Tax \nFoundation.\n  The Washington Post, in that same story, pointed out:\n\n       For all but the wealthiest Americans, the Federal income \n     tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in 4 decades, \n     according to a series of studies by liberal and conservative \n     tax experts, the Clinton administration, and two arms of the \n     Republican controlled Congress.\n\n  This is the record and these are the facts with respect to what has \nhappened to the income tax burden. Because we have gotten our fiscal \nhouse in order, we have seen a substantial reduction in the publicly \nheld debt. We are in a position, if we make no other changes in law, to \npay off the publicly held debt of the United States by the year 2009. \nWe all understand there are proposals for additional spending and for \ntax cuts that will move that back.\n  The fact is, if we made no changes in current law, we could pay off \nthe publicly held debt in the country by the year 2009. In fact, we are \nright here on this scale. We have already started paying down the debt. \nIn the last 3 years, we have paid down, I think, over $300 billion of \npublicly held debt. That is a dramatic transformation, a huge \nimprovement.\n  Let me just be clear. I give most of the credit to our side of the \naisle which, in 1993, passed a 5-year budget plan that did most of the \nheavy lifting. We didn't have a single vote from the other side of the \naisle. But it is also true that in 1997 we finished the job with a \nbipartisan effort. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, that was good that we were able to come together in 1997 and do \nsomething together to finish the job.\n  Now the question is: Do we stay on this course or do we go off in \nsome other direction and go back to what I consider the bad old days of \ndebt, deficits, and decline? I hope not. I hope we avoid going back in \nthe deficit ditch.\n\n  Let's look ahead. Here is what we are told now. Over the next 10 \nyears, the projections are--remember, they are projections, and \nprojections can change--telling us we can count on $4.6 trillion of \nsurplus. That is extraordinary, the turnaround that has been \naccomplished. First of all, remember that those are projections. They \nhave improved by a trillion dollars in the last 6 months. They could go \nthe other way in the next 6 months. Let's remember, they are \nprojections.\n  Two, let's remember the $2.4 trillion--more than half of it--is from \nSocial Security. I think both sides have agreed that we are not going \nto raid Social Security--at least we agreed rhetorically we are not \ngoing to raid Social Security. Another almost $400 billion is Medicare. \nSo you add those two together, and that is $2.8 trillion of the $4.6 \ntrillion, Medicare and Social Security, and that leaves about $1.8 \ntrillion of non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus.\n  When I look at the budget plan of Governor Bush, it doesn't add up. \nIt just doesn't add up. This is what concerns me about derailing the \nprogress we have made and going back into the deficit ditch. Let me go \nthrough the math. I don't think it can be challenged.\n  We have the projected surplus of $4.6 trillion. The Social Security \nsurplus is $2.4 trillion. The Medicare surplus is $400 billion. That \nleaves a remaining non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus of $1.8 \ntrillion over the next 10 years that has been projected. The Bush tax \ncut is--his large main proposal costs $1.3 trillion. The other tax cuts \nthat he has endorsed in the campaign are another $300 billion. The \ninterest cost of those tax cuts is another $300 billion. So he has \ncompletely wiped out the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus. It \nis gone, poof.\n  Then he has an additional problem that is very big. He has \nrecommended Social Security privatization. The transition cost of that \nproposal--or proposals like that one--is about $1 trillion. Where does \nthat come from? Where does that $1 trillion come from? Is he going to \ntake it out of the Social Security surplus? If he does, he has violated \nthe pledge everybody has made here not to raid the Social Security \nsurplus because that money is needed to meet the promises that have \nbeen made to existing Social Security recipients. If he takes that $1 \ntrillion out of there, that undermines Social Security solvency because \nit is a transfer of money to allow people to set up private accounts.\n  Now, in addition to that, he has used every penny of the non-Social \nSecurity, non-Medicare surplus for tax cuts. Where is the additional \nmoney for defense? He made a big point in this campaign that we are not \nat the level of readiness we should have. Where is he going to get any \nmoney to deal with that when all of his money--non-Social Security and \nnon-Medicare surplus--goes for tax cuts? Where is he going to get the \nadditional money for education he has called for in this campaign? It \ndoesn't add up.\n  What worries me very much is that we are going to go right back into \nthe deficit ditch we just crawled out of. What a mistake that would be; \nwhat a tragedy for this country it would be to go back to deficits and \ndebt and ultimate economic decline. I hope very much our colleagues \nwill avoid that mistake.\n  Let me just say that it isn't just the Bush plan that threatens that, \nin my judgment. I am also worried about those who have massive new \nspending ideas because this fiscal responsibility, this course that we \nhave embarked on to get our fiscal house in order, can be threatened in \nseveral different ways. One way is this Bush plan which, to me, is a \nfinancial disaster for the country if we ever adopt it. I hope very \nmuch that we do not. That would put us right back in the deficit ditch. \nBut another way to threaten it is out-of-control spending. When you \ndon't have a budget process that has any discipline to it, doesn't have \nany reality to it, you allow this kind of spending frenzy that is now \ngoing on in the committees to emerge. There is no accountability, no \nplan, and there is fundamentally no discipline.\n  I hope some colleagues are listening. We did a little calculation \nabout what is out there going through the committees.\n\n[[Page S9425]]\n\n  The $60 billion 1-year effect they are talking about in the \nWashington Post is dwarfed by the 10-year effect because we are talking \nabout a 10-year effect of $450 billion by decisions that are being made \nin some closed room somewhere where one-half of Congress is being \nexcluded. That is not the way to do business.\n  I hope very much that people on both sides who do not want to see us \nreturn to the bad old days of deficits and debt will get together in \nthese final hours and agree that there has to be a better way of doing \nour business. I know it is not going to change this year, but I hope \nvery much that next year we get back to a budget process that has some \nintegrity to it and some discipline to it because if we fail, I fear \nvery much that we are going to go right back to the bad old days of \ndeficits and debt. That would be a profound mistake for the country.\n  As one considers how far we have come and the dramatic improvements \nthat we have made, they weren't easy. I know about the votes in 1993 to \nput in place a 5-year budget plan to get our fiscal house back in \norder. People lost their political careers as a result. That is not the \nbiggest sacrifice to make. I know that. But the fact is, it was hard. \nIt passed by a single vote in this Chamber. It passed by a single vote \nover in the House.\n  We have had such incredible prosperity in part because of the result \nof those decisions that created the framework so that the American \npeople's hard work, ingenuity, and creativity could lead this economic \nresurgence. But we see other people who are hard-working and creative \nliving in a failed system. We see it in Russia. We see it in other \nparts of the world. The fact is that we have a system that works \nbecause the monetary and fiscal policy of the United States over the \nlast 8 years has been a good one, has been a sound one, and has been an \neffective one. But it can all be lost. It can be jeopardized. We can go \nright back very easily to deficits and debt. All we have to do is pass \nmassive tax cuts that do not add up and pass massive new spending plans \nin concert with those tax cuts, and we will be right back to deficits, \ndebt, and ultimate economic decline.\n  This is a matter of choices. It is a matter of choices for those of \nus who serve in Congress. It is a matter of choices for the American \npeople as they go to the polls. I trust the wisdom of the American \npeople. I trust the wisdom of my colleagues in Congress. I think when \npeople have both sides of the story, they make pretty good judgments. \nPart of our responsibility is to make certain that people get both \nsides of the story.\n  I think I have made the point that Governor Bush has most of his \npriority placed on tax cuts. That really jeopardizes the fiscal \ndiscipline that we have achieved. As I look at what he has proposed, \nand the $2.2 trillion, which is the surplus without Social Security, \nand you look at his plan and the additional tax cuts and the interest \nlost as a result of those tax cuts, you can see not only that he is \nusing up the entire non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus, he is \nusing up almost entirely the surplus not counting Social Security. That \nis not a balanced plan. That is a plan that has enormous risk to it.\n  On top of that, his tax cuts aren't fair. He gives 53 percent of the \nbenefit to the top 35 percent of the American people. That is the \nanalysis by the Citizens for Tax Justice. The lowest 60 percent of the \nincome earners in America get 11 percent of the benefits.\n\n  Again, that is not just Kent Conrad talking; that is not just \nCitizens for Tax Justice talking.\n  Senator John McCain in his campaign pointed out that 38 percent of \nGovernor Bush's tax cut goes to the wealthiest 1 percent. That is \nSenator John McCain's analysis of Governor George Bush's tax plan.\n  What is the fairness in that? Thirty-eight percent of the benefit \ngoes to the wealthiest 1 percent?\n  The Governor is fond of saying that the surpluses are not the \nGovernment's money; it is the people's money. He has that exactly \nright. This money is the people's money. Absolutely. The question is, \nwhat should be done with the people's money? His idea is to give 38 \npercent of that to the wealthiest 1 percent. What kind of a plan is \nthat? Wouldn't it be better to take the people's money and pay off the \npeople's debt?\n  That is what I believe ought to be the top priority. Let's dump this \ndebt. Let's get rid of it once and for all, especially before the baby \nboomers start to retire. We have a window of opportunity that is going \nto last about another 12 years. This is the time to dump the debt.\n  I offered a budget plan to my colleagues that would use 72 percent of \nthese surpluses for debt elimination, 12 percent for tax relief, 12 \npercent for high priority domestic needs such as defense and education \nand health care. That, to me, is a set of priorities for the American \npeople. This plan of Governor Bush does not add up.\n  John McCain said it well in his campaign. He said: ``More \nimportantly, there is a fundamental difference here,'' talking about \nthe difference between himself and George Bush. ``I believe we must \nsave Social Security. We must pay down the debt. We have to make an \ninvestment in Medicare. For us to put all of the surplus into tax cuts \nI think is not a conservative effort. I think it is a mistake.''\n  That was John McCain. John McCain had it right. There is nothing \nconservative about this plan that has been put forward by Mr. Bush. It \nis a radical plan.\n  On the notion that the Bush budget doesn't add up, again, it is not \njust my analysis. This appeared in the Wall Street Journal.\n\n       Both candidates agree they could afford to set aside Social \n     Security revenues which account for about $2.4 trillion of \n     the projected surplus. That leaves roughly $2.2 trillion.\n\n  Of course, they have not subtracted out the Medicare money. They go \non to say: ``Mr. Bush has a larger problem. His proposals most likely \nwouldn't fit even under CBO's $2.2 trillion surplus'' of non-Social \nSecurity money.\n  They are right. It doesn't fit within the funds. That leaves an \nenormous vulnerability. I hope before we leave that all of us will \nthink very seriously about what the priorities are.\n  When I compare Gore and Bush on the question of budgets, Gore is \nproposing a plan that pays off public debt by 2012. He has $3 trillion \nof the surplus dedicated to dumping the debt; George Bush about half as \nmuch.\n  These are pretty straightforward facts. The fundamental question is, \nwhat is our priority? I believe the top priority ought to be to dump \nthis debt, to pay off this debt. In fact, the plan I have offered would \ndevote even more of the projected surplus that Mr. Gore does to \neliminating debt.\n  Every economist who has come before the Budget Committee and the \nFinance Committee has said the highest and best use of these projected \nsurpluses is to eliminate the national debt and do it now while we have \na window of opportunity before the baby boomers start to retire. I \nbelieve that. I agree with that.\n  I hope we establish budget plans that have that fundamental principle \nand put that priority where it should be--on eliminating this debt \nwhile we can, because when the baby boomers start to retire, the \nnumbers are going to turn against us in a very, very aggressive way. \nThis is our opportunity. I hope we take it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the discussion \ntoday on the floor of the Senate about process and procedure and where \nwe find ourselves near the end of this session. I will speak to the \ncomments made earlier today by my colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, and perhaps speak a bit about the comments made by my colleague, \nSenator Conrad, especially about fiscal policy.\n  First, let me talk about process. As I do so, let me acknowledge that \nit cannot be an easy job to try to schedule and arrange and deal with \nthe House and the Senate, and pass all the legislation, authorization \nand appropriations bills, that are necessary. A lot of people over many \nyears have had the responsibility of doing that and many people aspire \nto that responsibility. One of the circumstances of control is that \nthose who win the most seats in the Senate and the House then become \nchairmen and leaders, majority leaders, chairmen of committees; and the \nresponsibility of having those jobs, of course, means bearing the \nburden of having to schedule and trying to arrange to make certain that \nCongress\n\n[[Page S9426]]\n\nworks the way it ought to work and passes the legislation on time and \nin regular order.\n  It is not an easy job. My colleague, Senator Byrd, who spoke earlier \ntoday, served as a distinguished majority leader in this Congress. He \nalso served as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He has had the \nresponsibility to try to find a way to get this Senate to move and get \nit to move on time and discharge its duties on time. Many others have \ndone so, as well, including the distinguished Senator, Mr. Mitchell, \nmost recently, as well as Senator Dole, and so many others over many \nyears, going back to Lyndon Johnson, and decades and decades before \nthat.\n  In this Congress, the 106th Congress, things have changed some. What \nhas changed, it seems to me, is we have missed most of the deadlines. \nThere doesn't seem to be a cogent plan by which we will meet the \ndeadlines or meet our responsibilities. I want to show some charts that \ndescribe what has happened this year. The red on this calendar shows \nthe number of days the Senate was not in session. As shown, a fair part \nof January, February, and March, a fair part of a number of months of \nthis year, were days in which we had no session in the Senate.\n  There is some reason for some of that. We have work periods, when \nSenators go back to their States and meet with their constituents. That \nis understandable. That has always been the case. However, there needs \nto be some balance with respect to the number of days we are working \nhere and the amount of time that is available to pass legislation that \nmust be passed.\n  This is the situation as we near the first of October: The Senate has \nbeen in session only 115 days this year; only 115 days have we been in \nsession. Of those 115 days, 34 of those days included no votes at all. \nIn most cases, not much was done, perhaps only morning business for \nmost of the day. Of the 115 days in session, there were no votes on 34 \nof those days. In fact, there were only three Mondays during this \nentire year in which there were any votes. For practical purposes, we \ndon't have a Monday in the Senate. On the issue of Fridays, there were \nonly six Fridays in this year in which there were votes.\n  What can be concluded from this is we have a Senate that really isn't \nin session much on Mondays or Fridays. Then the question is, what is \nleft? Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays--except for weeks when the \nSenate isn't in session at all. That is what results in 115 days in \nsession, 34 of which there weren't any votes.\n\n  Now we come to the end of this fiscal year with a lot of legislation \nyet to be completed. Only 2 of the 13 appropriations bills have been \nsigned by President Clinton. That means 11 of them are as of yet \nincomplete. In September, we have only had votes on one Monday. This is \nthe period of time in which we are trying to finish everything. We have \nhad no votes on Fridays in September. It is difficult to get all of \nthis work done, appropriations bills and other measures that need to \nget passed, if we are not in session.\n  I mentioned before we have 2 appropriations bills that are complete; \n11 of them are, as of yet, incomplete. October 1 is the date by which \nthe President is to have signed all of the appropriations bills. It is \nthe first day of the new fiscal year. What we have is a circumstance \nwhere most of the work that needs to be done by that moment is not \ncompleted.\n  I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I serve with a very \ndistinguished chairman of that committee, Senator Stevens. I am not \ncoming to the floor to be critical of Senator Stevens. I think he does \nan extraordinary job. I am serving on the agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee. The chairman of that subcommittee is Senator Cochran from \nMississippi. I am not here to be critical of Senator Cochran. I think \nhe is an extraordinary Senator. I think it is a privilege to work with \nSenator Stevens and Senator Cochran. I think they do an extraordinary \njob. They are Republicans; I am a Democrat. I think they are good \nSenators.\n  I am not here to say they haven't done their work. I am saying this \nprocess, the fashion in which the House and the Senate have worked this \nyear, has just not worked at all. It has become tangled in a morass of \ndifficulty that has prevented Members from doing what we need to do.\n  We have discovered someone put bills together that in some cases have \nnot been considered by the Senate; in other cases they have not been \nthe subject of a conference, and marry up various pieces of \nlegislation, bring them to the floor and say: Well, let's just have one \nvote on this omnibus bill that has two or three different \nappropriations bills in it.\n  That might sound efficient if you haven't done your work and you \nreach the end of the fiscal year, but efficiency is not what protecting \nthe interests of all Senators or the interests of all Americans is \nabout. The process by which we are able to debate public issues in this \nSenate, and by which we are able to get the best of what everyone has \nto offer, the best of the ideas, and the competition from debate, is a \nprocess in which we bring a piece of legislation to the floor, an \nappropriations bill to the floor, and say, all right, you come from \ndifferent areas of the country; you come with different philosophies; \nyou come representing different constituencies; now have at this.\n  This is what we have tried to do in the committee. If Members have \nbetter ideas, let's hear them. If Members have the votes to convince \nthe majority of the Senate to support their idea, let's see. Just bring \nthese ideas to the floor of the Senate. Have votes on them. In that \nmanner, we develop public policy. Wide open debate is the essence of \ndemocracy. That is the way democracy works.\n  An old friend of mine back home used to love politics. He used to \nsay: They don't weigh votes; they count votes.\n  That is the way the Senate should work: Have the debate, have the \nvote, count it up, and the winner wins. That becomes the process of \nmaking public policy.\n  We have a long and distinguished history in this body. I have learned \na lot listening to Senator Byrd over the many years, talking about the \nhistory of the Senate. His history goes back to the Roman Senate and \nbeyond. One cannot help but serve here and understand there is a \ntradition, a tradition that we must respect as we conduct our business \non behalf of the American people. We are not here by ourselves. We are \nnot standing just in our shoes. We are here because our constituents \nhave said: Represent us in this democracy; go to the Senate and give it \nthe best you have, adding your voice to the votes that come from the \nhills and valleys of this country, and participate in the making of \npublic policy.\n  The process we are seeing now all too often prevents that from \nhappening. I am on a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee that \nI am reading about every day in the newspapers. I am a conferee, in \nfact. But there has been no conference.\n  Two days ago, I got a call from somebody saying it is going to be \nbrought to the floor of the House and the Senate tomorrow. I said, \n``What is?'' They said, ``A conference report.'' I said, ``I am a \nconferee and there has not been a conference. How can there be a \nconference report?''\n  But that is what is happening around here all too often. I think we \nneed to get back on track and decide there is a process we should \nrespect, a process that represents regular order and a process that \nprotects the rights of all Senators to participate in the making of \npublic policy.\n  What is the agenda here? Why are we so passionate about this, talking \nabout this process? Because the process allows everyone in this Chamber \nto come here and witness for the public policy they want, to try to \nkeep this country ahead.\n  Let me go through a list of them briefly. Some of my colleagues have \ndone so. My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, just talked \nabout fiscal policy. The process, if followed the way tradition would \nhave us follow it, would allow us, in a year such as this, to grab \nahold of this fiscal policy issue and evaluate what do we do. This is a \nnew time. We now have expected surpluses in our future. What a \nremarkable change from the understanding that every year we were going \nto have a deficit and it was going to continue to grow, to mushroom out \nof control. All of a sudden that is gone. We have a new reality. We \nhave fiscal policy surpluses.\n\n[[Page S9427]]\n\n  I have told audiences from time to time the two enduring truths about \npolitical existence in the last 40 years or so in our public lives, the \ntwo enduring truths that overshadowed or at least represented a \nfoundation for all of the decisions were: No. 1, we had a cold war with \nthe Soviet Union, and, No. 2, we had budget deficits that just kept \ngrowing. Those were the two enduring truths that had an impact on \neverything else we did.\n  Think of this: Those two truths are now gone. There is no Soviet \nUnion. The cold war is over. And there is no budget deficit. What a \nremarkable change in a short period.\n  So my colleague came to the floor a few moments ago and talked about \nfiscal policy given these new truths, the fact we may have budget \nsurpluses in the years ahead. The question then is, What do we do with \nthem? So we need to have a debate about that. Some come to the floor of \nthe Senate and say: We know what to do with expected surpluses. Even \nbefore the surpluses exist, let's get rid of these surpluses by \nproviding very large tax cuts and let's make sure the largest tax cuts \ngo to those who have the largest incomes in this country. So they come \nto the floor with $1 trillion, or $1.3 trillion, in tax cuts over the \nnext 10 years. This is before we even have the surpluses. Economists \nwho can't remember their home telephone numbers tell us they know what \nis going to happen 3, 5, 7 and 10 years from now.\n  I come down on the side on which my colleague comes down; that is, we \nought to be mighty conservative and cautious about this. For the first \nstep, maybe we ought to pay down some of the Federal debt. If you run \nup the debt during tough times, what greater gift could you give to \nAmerica's children than to reduce the Federal debt during good times? \nThat is step No. 1.\n  Step No. 2, sure, if there is room, let's provide some tax cuts in a \nway that invests in opportunities for America's families, working \nfamilies. Would it not be a nice thing for those people who are \nreaching up and struggling to afford to be able to send their kids to \ncollege to say: The cost of sending your kids to college you can deduct \non your income tax; you can deduct the cost of tuition. What a good \ninvestment that would be, and what a nice way to have a tax cut in a \nway that incentivizes families to send their child to school: Reduce \nthe debt, provide some tax cuts in ways that say to working families, \nwe are going to try to help you.\n\n  Then make some other investments. It is not a circumstance that \neverything that goes out of here is spent. Some of it is invested. Our \nfuture, 10 years, 20, 40, 60 years from now, is going to depend on what \nwe invest in that future today. I mentioned education, but there are \nmore issues than just education.\n  The question of fiscal policy--what do we do, and how do we do it--is \na very important question. The way we get to that and have the votes on \nit and have an expression of what we want to do, what the American \npeople want to do, is have all the ideas here and vote on them. That is \nawfully inconvenient for some because we have to cast all these votes \nand some people want to just vote on the things they want and prevent \nthe things other people want. It is inconvenient. That is democracy. \nSure, it is inconvenient to give the other person their opportunity to \nbring their ideas to the floor of the Senate, but that is democracy. \nDemocracy is not always convenient. It is not always efficient. It is \nso far above any other form of government known to mankind we can \nhardly describe the difference, but it may be inconvenient.\n  The issue that has been raised today about process is to say that \ninconvenience is actually designed into this system, to make sure we do \nnot move rapidly, we do not move with haste, to ensure we do not move \nriding on a wave of passion that will require us or persuade us to do \nthings we will later regret. That is the way the Senate was developed. \nNobody ever suggested the way the Senate was going to react to things, \nor the way the Senate was going to discuss public policy, was going to \nbe efficient. In fact, those framers, Madison, Mason, Franklin, and so \nmany others--Thomas Jefferson, who contributed from abroad when he was \nserving this country--did not want a system that created a Senate that \nwas efficient so, in an afternoon, you could grab a big public policy \nand decide you would each get 10 minutes, have a little vote on a \ncouple of amendments, and that was it because we needed it to be \nconvenient for us.\n  No, they created a far different system. This body has been known \nfrom time to time as the body in which the great debates of democracy \ntake place. But I fear that is changing because some, I think, do not \nunderstand the value of debate. Debate is never a waste of time. Debate \nis always a contributor to knowledge. Debate, from the best to the \nleast of those who come to public service, contributes in some way to \nthe whole of democracy.\n  I have been to the floor of the Senate many times talking about \nanother issue on the agenda. I just talked about fiscal policy. There \nare other things I want to get done. One area where my colleague and I \nmay disagree from time to time--some say you should not be repetitious \nin trying to push your agenda. In some cases I think repetition is \nnecessary. For example, minimum wage. We have a lot of families out \nthere who are working at the bottom of the economic ladder. In fact, a \nreport came out 2 days ago that said we have 3 million people working \n40 hours a week who are living in poverty in this country. There are 3 \nmillion workers working 40 hours a week, full time, living in poverty. \nDo you know why? Because they are working right at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder.\n\n  Who is out there in the hallways, clogging the hallways of the U.S. \nCapitol, saying: Do you know what my business is on Thursday here in \nthe U.S. Capitol? I am here on behalf of the low-income folks. I am \nhere on behalf of the voiceless, those not too involved in politics \nbecause they are struggling just to work, to make the minimum wage, \ntrying to get home and feed their kids. The hallways are not flooded \nwith people representing those folks. These hallways are crowded with \npeople representing the privileged, people representing the largest \ncorporations in America, people representing those who have done very \nwell in this country, at the upper income scales. They have great \nrepresentation.\n  Good for them. Everybody deserves that in a democracy. But my point \nis, when it comes time to debate public policy on a range of issues and \nit comes time to discuss the minimum wage, who stands for those \nfamilies? The people who work the night shift, the people who work the \nnight shift in the hospital for minimum wages, who are moving the bed \npans around and changing the beds and helping people up and out and \nwalking around--who is here speaking for them? The people who are \nworking in the convenience stores at 2 a.m. for a minimum wage, who are \ntrying to raise a family and do not have the skills to get a better job \nand are trapped in one of these cycles of poverty--who is here speaking \nfor them?\n  The hallways are not crowded, in this Capitol Building, with people \npaid to represent those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I think \nfrom time to time it is important, even if rebuffed once, twice, or six \ntimes in a year, to say increasing the minimum wage for those who are \nstruggling at the bottom of the economic ladder is important; if we do \nnot get it the first time, we have a vote the second time; if we don't \nget it the second time, we have a vote the third time.\n  Yes, that is inconvenient, too, but it seems to me the rules of this \nsystem also allow for those who are passionately interested in pushing \nfor those who do not have much voice in this political system.\n  Patients' Bill of Rights is another issue that gets caught in this \nprocess. Speaking of process, the Patients' Bill of Rights is the most \nremarkable piece of legislation. If I can for a moment describe the \nPatients' Bill of Rights as an issue and describe it through the \nexperiences of people who have been gripped in the vice of a system \nthat does not work for them, a woman who is hiking in the Shenandoah \nMountains falls off a 40- or 50-foot cliff, breaks multiple bones, and \nfalls into a coma. She is taken to a hospital in an ambulance, lying on \na gurney in a coma with very severe injuries. She miraculously \nrecovers, only to find that her HMO and managed care organization sends \nher a bill saying: We are not going to cover your emergency room \ntreatment because you did not get prior approval for emergency room \ntreatment.\n  This is a woman hauled into the emergency room in a coma suffering\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\nserious injuries from a massive fall and told: You did not get prior \napproval for emergency room treatment.\n  Or little Ethan Bedrick; Ethan Bedrick is a young boy. This is a \npicture of young Ethan. He was told he had a 50-percent chance of \nwalking by age 5. He was born with pretty severe disabilities from \ncerebral palsy. He had a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5. He \nneeded rehabilitative therapy, and his managed care organization said \nhaving a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 is ``insignificant'' \nand, therefore, we deny coverage for the therapy.\n  Think of that. It is insignificant for a young boy to have a 50-\npercent chance of being able to walk and, therefore, the managed care \norganization says: We deny coverage.\n  Is there a Patients' Bill of Rights that ought to provide rights to \nEthan Bedrick, provide rights to the woman who falls off a cliff and is \nhauled into a hospital unconscious? Or, if I may take one more moment \nto describe the woman who testified at a hearing Senator Harry Reid and \nI had in the State of Nevada, a mother who stood up and told us that \nher son was dead, 16 years old; he had leukemia.\n  At the moment when he needed the treatment that would give him a \nchance to survive this leukemia, the HMO said no. Only later--much \nlater--did they finally say yes, and it was too late; he was too weak. \nShe held up his colored picture at this hearing and, through tears, she \ntold us about her son. Her son, Chris Roe, died October 12, 1999, on \nhis 16th birthday. I will never forget the moment when his mother, \nSusan, held up a picture and said: My son looked up at me from his bed \nand said: Mom, how can they do this to a kid like me?\n  He was denied the treatment that would have given him the \nopportunity--not a guarantee, but the opportunity--to deal with his \ncancer, and he died.\n  This young boy was told to fight his cancer and then fight his \ninsurance company at the same time; take on both folks: You go ahead \nwage this cancer fight, but then you are going to have to fight us to \nget coverage for the things you need that might give you a chance at \nlife.\n  The question is: Mom, how can they do this to a 16-year-old kid like \nme? And his mother, through tears, held up this colored picture of this \nyoung, 16-year-old boy and asked: How could they have done this?\n  Should Congress pass a Patients' Bill of Rights? What about the \nprocess there? The House of Representatives passed a bipartisan \nPatients' Bill of Rights, a real one, and sent it to conference. This \nSenate has a right to do this. They passed what I call a ``patients' \nbill of goods,'' an empty vessel, and sent it to conference so the \nSenate could say: We passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. But we did not.\n  A Republican Member of Congress, Dr. Norwood, and a Republican Member \nof Congress, Dr. Ganske--do not take it from me; take it from them--\nsaid the Senate took a pass on this issue. They passed an empty vessel. \nWhat the Senate did is a step backward, not forwards.\n  Should we have the opportunity in this process in the Senate to have \nanother vote on this? Things have changed. The last time we voted on \nthis, we came up one vote short. This time, it will be a tie vote, \nbased on what we know to have happened in the interim. With a tie vote, \nthe Vice President will cast a vote to break the tie, and this Senate \nwill send to conference a Patients' Bill of Rights that is a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  It says you have a right to know all of your medical treatment \noptions, not just the cheapest. You have a right to emergency room \ncare. You have a right, if you are being treated for breast cancer, to \ntake your oncologist with you. If your spouse's employer changes health \ncare providers, you can continue with that same cancer specialist who \nhas been working with you 5 or 7 years. You have that right.\n  Should we be able to have another vote on that in the next day or 2 \ndays or 2 weeks? The answer is yes, absolutely yes, because it is \nimportant to young Ethan, it is important to the memory of Chris, and \nit is important to all the others out there who are being told: You \nfight your disease and, by the way, fight your insurance company as \nwell because some of these managed care organizations are much more \ninterested in profit than in your health.\n  I hasten to say, not all. There are some terrific insurance companies \nand some terrific HMOs, and they do a great job, but there are some \naround this country that are doing to patients what I just described, \nsaying to people like young Ethan that the potential to walk is \ninsignificant at 50 percent. We should change that.\n  Do I have passion for these issues? You are darn right. I was elected \nto the Senate and I came here because I wanted to do good things for \nthis country. I want this country to be a better place in which to \nlive, whether it is health care, a Patients' Bill of Rights, adding a \nprescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, eliminating the \nbarriers that prohibit the reimportation of prescription drugs from \nother countries so our people can access less expensive prescription \ndrugs, or gripping the education issues in this country the way we know \nwe should--reducing class size, renovating and repairing crumbling \nschools.\n  I came here because I wanted to do these things. I do not want people \nto prevent us from having the votes on them. I have spoken so often \nabout going into the school with Rosy Two Bears, a little third grader, \nthat I know people are just flat tired of it, but I could care less.\n  She walks into a school classroom that none of us would want our kids \nto walk into. It is a public school. Part of it is 90 years old; part \nof it is condemned. It has one water fountain and two toilets in this \nlittle school. They cannot connect to the Internet. They do not have \ngood recreational facilities, and little Rosy Two Bears looks up at me \nand says: Mr. Senator, will you build us a new school?\n  I cannot do that because I do not have the money, but this Senate \ncan. This Senate can say to Rosy and all the others who are walking \nthrough a classroom door in this country: We want you to walk through a \ndoor of which you are proud. It does not matter where you are, who you \nare, if you are a first grader, a third grader, or a twelfth grader. We \nwant that schoolroom to be a schoolroom of which you are proud; we want \nyou to be the best you can be. We want every young child to rise to the \nlevel of their God-given talents in every corner of America.\n  That ought to persuade us that the process by which we consider \nlegislation in this Congress gives us full opportunity to take a look \nat that fiscal policy and say: If we are collecting more than we need, \nwe can give a little back, pay down the debt, and let's also, in \naddition to giving a little back and paying down the debt, invest in \nbetter schools for our kids. Let's take the best ideas everybody has in \nthis Chamber and have a good debate about that.\n  That is part of the passion with which most of us came to this body. \nWe came here to get things done, and we are so frustrated by a process \nthat seems to say: If it is our idea, we are going to vote on it. If it \nis your idea, somehow we are going to put it in a box someplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have 38 minutes, do I not, remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that much time and more.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield--how many minutes does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Just 2 is fine.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator asked for 2 minutes. I will give him 4.\n  Mr. President, let me say to the Senator, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, absolutely, if there is an opportunity to pass that, if it \ntakes twice, if it takes three times, if it takes six times, fine, I am \nfor it.\n  Minimum wage: I am one who used to work at less--less--than the \nminimum wage by far. If we pass it, yes. So we are not in disagreement \non that.\n  I think the Senator referenced, a little earlier, two times when I \nhave felt that we are calling up an amendment just as a political \namendment and doing it over and over and over again. That is different \nfrom what he is speaking of. I am not for that. I am not for taking the \ntime on an amendment which has no opportunity, no future, no \npossibility of passing.\n\n[[Page S9429]]\n\n  But in these cases, it is obvious. And the way he has described these \nhas produced such a vivid picture of need that I am very supportive of \ntrying again. There are reasons why one might try again and win. And \nthe Senator has just stated it with reference to the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  So I congratulate this Senator, who does so much for the Senate, who \nhas so much to offer, who has such great talents, and who does not hide \nthose talents in a napkin but produces fivefold or tenfold. I \ncongratulate him and salute him. I thank him for what he has said on \nthe Senate floor today.\n  So I have yielded him 4 minutes. And I have taken how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the Senator 4 minutes still. That still leaves me, \nI understand, 30 minutes or more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is very \ngenerous. Let me conclude by saying something I think is important. I \ncame to the floor because the Senator from West Virginia is someone for \nwhom I have great respect. He was talking about the process, the method \nby which the Senate is supposed to work. He has been here much longer \nthan I have. He knows the history of the Senate far better than I do. I \nhave great respect for that.\n  He did not come to the floor--I listened carefully to his discussion \nthis morning--and I did not come to the floor to be critical of others. \nIt is a tough job running this Senate. I certainly did not come to the \nfloor to say that the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee has not done his job. I happen to think Senator Stevens is an \noutstanding Senator, Senator Cochran, and so many others with whom I \nhave served. So I do not come here with the purpose of casting \naspersions.\n  But I just come to the floor because I fear that what is preventing \nus from getting to where I want the Senate to get to, and that is to \nhave a full debate, and good, strong open votes on the issues I care \npassionately about. We are thwarted from doing that. In fact, we have \nhad bills brought to the floor of the Senate and had cloture motions to \nshut off debate before the debate began, cloture motions to shut off \namendments before the first amendment was offered. That thwarts this \nprocess. Back home they would say that is throwing a wrench in the \ncrank case. That just shuts it all down. It is not the way it ought to \nwork.\n  I think it is a privilege every day to come to work here. I grew up \nin a town of 300 people, had a high school class of 9, and never in my \nlife thought I would meet another Senator, I suppose, let alone serve \nin the Senate. I think it is a privilege every day to come here.\n  But the reason I think it is a privilege is because I bring, as most \nof my colleagues do, an agenda of passion to make changes that I think \nwill improve this country. I might be wrong in some of it. Maybe so. \nBut I want my day. If I can persuade enough Members of this Senate to \nvote on the things I care about, then if I win, I win. If I don't, \nmaybe I learned something from the debate. I am willing to lose. But I \nam not willing to lose the opportunity to have a full debate and a vote \non the things that I and the constituents I represent in North Dakota \ncare deeply about. That is the point. I am not willing to lose that \nopportunity. The process in this Senate increasingly begins to shut \nthose opportunities down.\n  The Senator from West Virginia came the Senate to say, let's not do \nthat. Let's not do it for Republicans or Democrats. Let's not do it out \nof concern for this Senate, its proud history and its future. Let's not \ndo that. Let's get back to the way we are supposed to debate public \npolicy in this Chamber.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia and my colleague, the \nSenator from Nevada, and others, who have spoken today. I hope we can \nall work together and get the best of what each can bring to this \nChamber in the debate about public policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the unanimous consent agreement that is \nnow before the body, Senator Johnson is to be recognized for 10 \nminutes, then Senator Durbin for 30 minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nthat following that, Senator Cleland be recognized for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I must \nsay, I commend my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for his \nsuggestion that some of us come to the floor today to talk a little bit \nabout the process.\n  Some people would say it is a procedural issue. It is far more \nprofound than simply a procedural issue in the context of the way we \nhave handled legislation on the Senate floor this year. The process \nthat has been applied not only does, I believe, great damage to this \ninstitution, but, in the end, it has great consequence to the substance \nof our legislative priorities and certainly of the budget for our \nNation.\n  Two out of the 13 appropriations bills that are required to run the \nFederal Government have been passed. Eleven remain incomplete. October \n1 is the beginning of the Federal fiscal year, and yet we have made \nlittle progress on the Federal budget. We have a CR, continuing \nresolution, that will take us to October 6. But, clearly, we are in a \nstate of chaos right now relative to the completion of our work in the \nSenate.\n  This year has been the shortest legislative session in the Senate \nsince the ``do-nothing'' Congress that President Truman campaigned \nagainst. As my colleague from North Dakota alluded to, during the \nentire course of this year, we have been in session and have had votes \nin all of 3 weeks out of the year. How many of our constituents can \nimagine employment or service of any kind that would involve 3 full \nweeks out of the year? Of those 115 days we have been in session, \nroughly 30 percent of them have involved no votes whatever. No progress \nhas been made relative to the completion of the people's agenda.\n  Now we find, I think most profoundly objectionable of all, an \nappropriations process where appropriations bills which deal with the \nFederal budget but, more importantly, deal with where our priorities \nare as a people--whether we are going to invest more money in \neducation, in health care, in Medicare, in the environment, in our \nnational defense, towards debt reduction--these are all the issues that \nneed to be resolved in the context of the appropriations debate. Yet we \nfind now that these bills move in an unprecedented fashion from an \nappropriations committee directly to conference, with no consideration \non the Senate floor whatever.\n  It has never been done this way, this kind of legislative bypass of \nthe legislative process, in the Senate.\n  Fully half of the Senators in this body, 25 States, have no \nrepresentation on the Appropriations Committee. Certainly that is the \ncase for my home State of South Dakota. Those States have no input, no \nopportunity to speak for their constituents about the nature of these \nappropriations bills and the kind of priority they apply to our \nNation's needs. These bills then go to conference. What is worse, all \ntoo often then the conference committees in turn have not met, but only \nthe majority party members agree then to send the bill back to the \nfloor in a conference report, which is unamendable. So we have not even \nthe distilling of thought through the conference committee process.\n  This is a terrible process, one that brings a significantly demeaning \nquality to the thoughtfulness that ought to be going into these \nfundamental questions.\n  Eight years after President Clinton was elected to office, having \ninherited $300 billion a year in red ink, we find ourselves now running \nbudget surpluses. In fact, the White House and the congressional budget \nexperts project budget surpluses in excess of $4 trillion over the \ncoming 10 years. We ought to be cautious about those projections. They \nare only projections. Most of the money would materialize only in the \nouter years. Even so, that is a remarkable turnaround. It creates for \nus a once-in-a-lifetime, a once-in-multiple-generations opportunity to \nfocus on what kind of society America will be for years to come.\n\n[[Page S9430]]\n\n  If we take the surplus and then set aside the trust fund dollars--\nSocial Security and the other trust funds as well--it is projected that \nwe will have a budget surplus of around $1.2 trillion over the coming \n10 years. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the House and the Senate, \nover my objections and over the objections of Senator Daschle and most \nMembers on our side, have passed tax cuts that would cost $1.7 trillion \nover 10 years, when we have only $1.2 trillion to spend before we even \nget to issues about whether we are going to do anything to improve the \nquality of education, Medicare, health care, debt reduction, veterans \nprograms, agriculture, the environment, and whatever other needs our \nNation might have.\n  Wisely, the President has vetoed the two most expensive tax bills. We \ncan bring them up again in a bipartisan fashion and in a more \nthoughtful manner. We can address those issues as well as questions of \npaying down the debt, questions of education and health care, \nrebuilding our schools, technology that we need, and the strength of \nour national defense.\n  We cannot bring these issues up and consider them in a thoughtful, \ndeliberative fashion if these issues bypass the Senate floor. That is \nwhat the process now entails. This a perversion of our democracy. This \nis not what the founders of our Republic designed. It does grave \ninjustice not only to this institution but to the needs of every \ncitizen of this Nation.\n  I applaud the work of Senator Byrd, who is an extraordinary scholar, \nwho has a great understanding of the traditions of this body, and who \nunderstands our democracy as well as anyone who has served in this \nbody. I appreciate his suggestion that we come to the floor and talk \nabout how our democracy is being demeaned by this process, that, in \nfact, the kinds of thoughtful, deliberative priority-making decisions \nall of our people ought to be engaged in are being denied as these \nbills go directly from the Budget and Appropriations Committees, with \nno opportunity for amendment, no opportunity for discussion, into \nconference committees, which are then unamendable. We wind up with the \nchaos that we have today, with only 2 of the 13 appropriations bills \nhaving been passed, as we near October 1, the beginning of the Federal \nfiscal year, and we find ourselves in a state of legislative chaos as \nwe end this month of September.\n\n  The people of this country deserve better. We need to work in a \nbipartisan fashion to bring these bills up in an orderly way and to \nallow amendments and debate, as was designed for this institution. To \nsee that lost is something in which we can take no pride. It is a \nshameful circumstance in which we find ourselves in this body, that \nthis would ever have occurred in our democracy. It has never happened \nbefore to this scope.\n  It is my hope we learn some painful lessons from the experiences we \nare having this year. The issues before us are too profound. They are \ntoo significant relative to whether we will at last use some resources \nto pay down the debt, keep the cost of money down, and sustain a strong \neconomy, while at the same time reserving some financial resources to \nrebuild schools, to do what we need to do to live up to our commitments \nto veterans, to have a strong national security, to improve our \nenvironment, to strengthen Medicare, and to do something about \nprescription drugs. These are the issues we are being denied an \nopportunity to debate, to vote on, and to arrive at the kind of \npolitical compromises necessary for all of our needs and all of our \npriorities and all of our points of view to be truly represented in \nthis country. Hopefully, these are lessons that are painfully learned, \nlessons that will never have to be repeated in future years.\n  This is a sad day to look back at the lack of progress that has been \nmade in this 2nd session of the 106th Congress. This Senate has been \ndenied its ability to truly do its work. The people of America, not the \nSenators, are the great losers by the process that has been applied to \nthe appropriations process and the legislative process in general this \nyear.\n  I will do all I can to work in a bipartisan fashion to never allow \nthis kind of process to occur again. The people of our Nation deserve \nfar better. If we are going to play the leading role in the world, both \neconomically and in terms of security, we need an institution that \nworks better than that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Senator from Illinois \nand the Senator from Georgia. They both agreed to limit their time by 5 \nminutes. Senator Cleland will take 10 minutes and Senator Durbin 25 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent that the present order be amended to \nthat effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that my friend and \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, has permission to speak for 10 \nminutes under our agreement and that I have 25 minutes. Since Senator \nCleland is now on the floor, I ask unanimous consent he be allowed to \nspeak before me and that I follow him with my 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for yielding to me for the purpose of discussing the ambiguous \nsituation in which we find ourselves in terms of the budget process and \nthe appropriations process.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, for his continuing efforts to remind Members of this Chamber of \nour responsibilities to this institution but, more importantly, \nresponsibilities to the American people.\n  Today Senator Byrd is causing us to step back and reflect on what we \nare now doing with respect to the appropriations process. It brings \nback a comment I like from Winston Churchill: How do you know where you \nare going unless you know where you have been?\n  Senator Byrd reminds us where we have been in the appropriations \nprocess, our history, our tradition, and the rules of the Senate. He is \nvery fearful of where we are going in that process, and so am I.\n  As a Senator now for 3\\1/2\\ years, I am certainly not nearly as well \nversed as Senator Byrd in the history or the precedents of the Senate. \nI would like to add that I believe all other Senators, of whatever \nlevel of experience and of both parties, acknowledge his leadership in \nthis respect. Nonetheless, from what I have read and heard in this \ndebate, in the first budget and appropriations cycle of the 21st \ncentury, the Senate has moved in a new and deeply troubling direction.\n  I am certainly aware that on occasion the Senate has been compelled \nby necessity to resort to bypassing the regular process of committee \naction for consideration and amendment, conference action, and then \nfinal approval, final passage, of individual authorization and \nappropriations measures.\n  Indeed, I voted for the massive omnibus measure with which we \nconcluded the 1998 session. That single bill totaled a whopping $487 \nbillion and funded 8 out of the 13 regular appropriations bills. I \nthink Senator Byrd himself said on that occasion, ``God only knows \nwhat's in it.'' Most of us didn't.\n  However, even on that occasion, the Senate actually took up \nseparately and passed 10 of the 13 bills and considered 1 other bill--\nnamely, Interior appropriations--while only 2 appropriations measures, \nthe Labor-HHS-Education bill and the relatively small District of \nColumbia bill, were acted on in conference without any previous Senate \nfloor action.\n  By contrast, this year the number of appropriations measures which \nare apparently headed for conference action without affording the full \nSenate an opportunity to work its will has grown to three: Commerce-\nJustice-State, Treasury-Postal, and VA-HUD. Not only is this trend \ndisturbing, but apparently a determination was made fairly early on \nthat these measures would somehow not require regular floor \nconsideration.\n  I have heard many theories as to why this will be so, including fears \nof hard votes, difficult votes, or of obstructionist tactics. But I \nhave yet to learn of any real justification or defense of the notion \nthat the Senate has discretion as to whether or not it will consider \nappropriations bills--the means through which we are supposed to \ndischarge perhaps the ultimate congressional authority under the \nConstitution, the power of the purse.\n\n[[Page S9431]]\n\n  If we in the Senate are not authorized or able to have an impact on \nappropriations bills, we have what the American Revolution ostensibly \nwas all about: taxation without representation.\n  I have the great privilege of representing the 7.5 million people in \nthe State of Georgia, the 10th most populous State in America. Georgia \nhasn't had a representative on the Senate Appropriations Committee \nsince 1992. And while the 28 members of that committee, representing 27 \nStates, with Washington being fortunate to have 2 seats, do a good job \nof considering national needs and local interests, they cannot be \nexpected to know the priorities and interests of the people of Georgia.\n  As the Senate was envisioned by the founders and as it has operated \nthroughout our history, the absence of State representation on the \nAppropriations Committee was not an insurmountable burden. \nNonappropriators could expect to have the opportunity to represent \ntheir constituents' interests when the 13 appropriations bills came to \nthe Senate floor were open to debate and amendment. Indeed, in my first \n3 years in the Senate, I often had recourse to offering floor \namendments or entering into colloquies on behalf of Georgia--Georgia \npriorities and Georgia people. But with the apparent move to routinely \nbypassing the floor, what am I or, more importantly, my constituents to \ndo?\n  In looking at the fiscal year 2001 bills, which apparently will not \ncome to the Senate floor in amendable form, the potential adverse \nimpact on my State is clear. For example, the Commerce bill funds key \nGeorgia law enforcement efforts, including the Georgia Crime Lab and \ntechnology enhancement for local law enforcement agencies, such as the \nMacon Police Department. The Treasury bill contains the budget for the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynn County, GA. And the \nVeterans' Administration appropriations measure covers the national \nveterans cemetery for north Georgia that I got authorized last year. \nFor all of these and more, the Georgia Senators will now apparently \nhave no direct role.\n\n  This is not the way it should be, under the Constitution, or the way \nwe ought to act under the traditions of the Senate. More and more of \nthe most important decisions affecting our constituents and their \ncommunities are being moved off the floor of the Senate and into \nclosed-door deliberations involving a small number of negotiators where \nthe people of my State are left out and where my only choice as their \nrepresentative is a single take-it-or-leave-it vote on a massive and \nunfathomable package. This is taxation without representation.\n  Mr. President, I understand that in an election year--especially this \none--it is always a challenge to have the Senate get its business done \non time. But when ``business as usual'' starts becoming a process where \nthe Senate routinely doesn't get to work its will, something \nfundamental has been lost. Then, we had better worry not just about the \ninterests and constituents of today, but the precedents and legacies we \nare leaving for future Senates and future generations of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that under the \nagreement I have 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia, Max \nCleland, my usual seatmate. I moved over here since he was speaking. I \nthank him for his presentation. He is one of the hardest working \nMembers of the Senate. I echo his words. We both find ourselves, as do \nall Members of the Senate, in a real predicament. We have only passed \nthree of the appropriations. Two of the bills have been signed into \nlaw, and now we are going to send three of the appropriation bills, as \nI understand it, into a conference committee without any consideration \non the floor of the Senate.\n  This is not unprecedented. It has happened, but very rarely. What \ntroubles me is it is becoming a rather common practice. When the \nPresident gives a State of the Union Address at the beginning of the \nyear, he spells out to Congress his hopes for what we can achieve. Many \nof these hopes are never achieved. That is the plight of a President--\nrelying on a Congress which has its own will and agenda. But the one \nthing the President is certain will be achieved is that, at the end of \nthe congressional process, the spending bills necessary to keep the \nGovernment in business will be passed--13 bills.\n  If Congress did nothing else, it would have to pass the spending \nbills. Otherwise, agencies of Government would close down and important \nfunctions of Government would not be served. So the President, after \ngiving all of his ideas in the State of the Union, steps back and \nwatches Congress, which starts by the passage of a budget resolution \nand considers 13 different bills, funding all of the agencies of the \nFederal Government.\n\n  Sadly, over the last several years we have seen this whole process \ndisintegrate to the point where, at the end of the session--and we are \nnearly there now as we come to the floor today on September 28; our new \nfiscal year begins October 1. Sadly, each and every year we end the \nsession without doing our work. We end up with all of these spending \nbills which involve literally billions of dollars and many different \nfunctions of the Federal Government that have never been worked through \nthe system. There are authorizing committees and appropriating \ncommittees, and they have the right names on the door. But when it \ncomes to the bottom line, they don't, in fact, do their business and \nbring a bill out of the committee to the floor for consideration.\n  When we are studying civics and political science, one of the first \nbooks we run across is a pamphlet entitled ``How Laws Are Made.'' We \nteach our children and students across America, and around the world, \nfor that matter, that there is a process in the Congress. The process \ninvolves committee consideration, floor consideration on both sides of \nthe Rotunda, and if there are differences, a conference committee, \nwhich results in a compromise which is sent to the President for \nsignature. It is very simple and American.\n  Unfortunately, it is also very unusual around this Congress, and now \nwe are seeing more and more bills coming out of the committee, \nbypassing the Senate Chamber, and heading straight to a conference \ncommittee, which means that billions of dollars' worth of spending is \nnever subject to debate or amendment. That means that Senators who \ndon't serve on an appropriations subcommittee or the full Committee of \nAppropriations never get a chance to even speak on a bill, let alone \nchange it.\n  The beauty of this institution, the most important deliberative body \nin our Nation, is that we are supposed to represent the people and \nspeak to the issues involved in the bills and then come to some \nconclusion on their behalf. That is what representative government is \nabout. It is what democracy is about. Yet we have been thwarted time \nand time again.\n  This time around, we find that only 10 of the bills have seen floor \naction. The Commerce-Justice-State bill, the Treasury bill, general \ngovernment bill, and the VA-HUD bill are all moving directly from \ncommittee to conference. If this process continues, we will see this \nyear what we have seen in previous years: a bill that comes at the end \nof the session, called an omnibus bill, that tries to capture all of \nthe unfinished business and a lot of other items that are extraneous \nand put them in one package. And then, as my friend Senator Byrd from \nWest Virginia can attest, we are handed a bill literally thousands of \npages long and told to read it, vote, and go home. A lot of us wonder \nif we are meeting our constitutional responsibility in so doing.\n  I asked the staff if they kept one of those bills from previous years \nso I could show it during the course of this debate, but one wasn't \nreadily available. These bills, as Senator Byrd can tell you, are \nsometimes 2,000 pages long, and we are asked to look at them and \nevaluate them. That is hard to do under the best of circumstances and \nimpossible to achieve when we have very little time to do it. The best \nI could find was the Yellow Pages of the District of Columbia. It is \nnot a good rendition because it is only 1,400 pages long. There is \nabout another 600 pages we can expect to receive in the omnibus bill \nhanded to us at the end of the\n\n[[Page S9432]]\n\nsession. We will be told: ``Take it or leave it. Don't you want to go \nhome and campaign?''\n  I think that is an abrogation of our constitutional responsibility.\n  I believe that most of us--even those of us on the Appropriations \nCommittee--believe we are duty bound to come before this Senate to \naddress the issues contained in these appropriations bills, to debate \nthem, as we are elected to do, to reach an agreement, hopefully on a \nbipartisan basis, and pass the bill on to the House for its \nconsideration and to a conference committee.\n  There was a mayor of New York City named Fiorello La Guardia--a \nfamous mayor--who, when there was a newspaper strike in his town, went \non the radio and read the cartoons and the comics to the kids so they \nwouldn't miss them. But he said what I think is appropriate here: There \nis no Democratic or Republican way of cleaning the streets.\n  What he was saying, I believe, is that in many of the functions of \ngovernment, we really do not need partisanship. In fact, there \nshouldn't be partisanship.\n  In this situation, Senator Byrd spoke eloquently today about the \ntraditions of the Senate--the idea of federalism, and the respect for \nsmall States and large States alike.\n  The fact is that this Chamber, unlike the one across the Rotunda, in \nwhich I was proud to serve for 14 years, gives every State an equal \nvoice. But that is a fiction if in fact the legislation never comes to \nthe floor so that Senators from every State can use their voice and \nexpress their point of view.\n  That, sadly, is what has been happening time and time again. Their \nappropriations work may be the most important part of our \nresponsibility in Congress.\n  A few years go when Congress reached a terrible impasse, we actually \nclosed down several agencies of Government for an extended period of \ntime. There were some critics, radio commentators and the like, who \nsaid: Well, if they close down the Government, no one will ever notice.\n  They were wrong because, frankly, our phones were ringing off the \nhook. I can recall people calling my offices from Chicago and \nSpringfield, IL, saying: How are we supposed to get our visas and \npassports to go overseas? How can we get these Federal agencies to \nrespond? The Department of Agriculture was closed and the farmers \nneeded to contact people about important decisions they had to make. In \nfact, closing down the Government is noticed, and people should take \nnotice not only because important responsibilities of government are \nnot being met but because Congress has not met its responsibility to \nmake certain that we pass the appropriations bills that lead to the \ncontinuation of government responsibilities.\n  The people across America who elect us get up and go to work every \nmorning knowing that if they stayed home and didn't do their job they \nwouldn't get paid. If they didn't get paid, they couldn't feed their \nfamilies. We have to do our job. We have no less of a responsibility as \nSenators to stay here and work as long as it takes to accomplish these \nthings.\n  The interesting thing, as you reflect on this session of Congress, is \nhow little time we have spent in Washington on the Senate floor doing \nthe people's business. This will be the shortest session of Congress we \nhave had since 1956. Out of 108 days of session so far, we have had 34 \ndays without a vote. If we continue at the current pace, it will take \nus nearly 2 full years to complete the remaining appropriations bills. \nThat is a sad commentary.\n  Most of us who are elected to serve come to work and try to do our \nbest. But if you look at this past year, you will find that we are only \ngoing to be in session 2 days longer than a Congress which was dubbed \nthe ``Do-Nothing Congress'' back in the late 1940s. I think that is a \nsad commentary on our inability to face our responsibility.\n  Why do we find ourselves in this position? I think there are two \nmajor reasons. One is we are dealing with spending caps. These are \nlimitations on spending which have been enacted into law which are \nthere to make certain we don't fall back into red ink and into \ndeficits. These spending caps are strings on the Federal Government's \nspending in appropriations bills. Some of them are reasonable and some \nof them are easy to live with. Some of them are very difficult to live \nwith. Those of us on appropriations committees know that. As a member \nof the Budget Committee, I can attest to it as well.\n  The budget resolution, the architecture for all of our spending at \nthe Federal level, was enacted by Congress--not by the President. He \nhas no voice in that process. It was enacted by Congress. We try to \nlive within the spending caps. Then we start to try to put together \nappropriations bills and quickly learn that in some areas there is just \nnot enough money. Neither party wants to be blamed for breaking the \nspending caps early in the process.\n  We created unconscionable situations in previous years. One of the \nmost important appropriations bills--the one for Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education--was literally ravaged of its money. That \nmoney was taken and used in other appropriations bills. It was saved \nfor the very last thing to be done. Knowing of its popularity across \nthe country, many people on Capitol Hill felt that if we were going to \nbust the caps, we would do it for education, health care, and labor. It \nhappened.\n  This year, as I understand, VA-HUD is one of those bills. What is \nmore important than our obligation to our veterans? Men and women who \nserved this country with dignity and honor were promised health care \nand veterans' programs. They rely on us to come up with the \nappropriations for that purpose and then find there is nothing in the \nappropriations bill to meet those needs.\n  Housing and urban development, an important appropriations bill that \nprovides housing for literally millions of families across America, is \nsimilarly situated. We have ravaged the VA-HUD bill this year in an \neffort to try to make up for all of the other spending shortfalls in \nthe other bills.\n  Everything stacks up as we come near the end of the year. Unlike many \nprevious years, we haven't routed these bills through the Senate floor. \nSo we have never been able to debate what the level of spending on the \nSenate floor should be for the Veterans' Administration, for the \nTreasury Department, and for a lot of agencies such as the Department \nof Justice and the State Department. That puts us at a disadvantage and \ncreates the blockade that we find ourselves in today.\n  There are amendments as well in some of these bills that are \nextremely controversial because most of the authorizing committees do \nnot come up with their authorizing bills. Many Members of the Senate \nhave said: I have good legislation. I have a good idea. I will put it \non the spending bill. I know they have to pass the spending bill \nultimately, so we will do that.\n  That introduces controversy in some of these spending bills, and as a \nresult, we find ourselves bypassing the Senate floor in an effort to \navoid a controversial vote.\n\n  I am forever reminded of a quote from the late Congressman from \nOklahoma, Mike Synar, who was chiding his fellow Members of the House \nof Representatives because they did not want to cast controversial \nvotes. The late Congressman Mike Synar used to say, ``If you do not \nwant to fight fires, do not be a firefighter.'' If you do not want to \ncast controversial votes, don't run for Congress. That is what this job \nis all about. You cast your votes for the people you represent with \nyour conscience, and you go home and explain it. That is what \ndemocracies are all about.\n  Many of these appropriations bills have been kept away from the floor \nof the Senate so Members of the Senate who are up for reelection don't \nhave to cast controversial votes. That has a lot to do with the mess we \nare in today.\n  Sadly, we have found that as to a lot of these amendments--some \nrelated to gun safety, for example, and some related to the treatment \nof gunmakers and how they can bid on contracts with the Government--\nbecause they were introduced in the appropriations bill, the bill was \ncircumvented from the floor. They never got to the floor for fear \nMembers would have to vote on them, and didn't want to face the music \nwith the people who don't want gun control and with the National Rifle \nAssociation. They do not want to face reality. The reality is we have a \nresponsibility to consider and vote on this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S9433]]\n\n  Some have said we don't have time to do all of that. I have been here \nall week. I think we have been casting a grand total of about one vote \na day. I think we are up to a little more than that.\n  There have been days in the House and Senate where we have cast \ndozens of votes. We can do that. We can limit debate, cast the votes, \nand get on with our business.\n  This week we have been consumed with the H-1B visa bill, a bill which \nwould allow an increase in the number of temporary visas so people with \ntechnical skills can come into the United States. We spent a whole week \non it.\n  We are going to go home in a few hours having achieved virtually \nnothing this week, except for the passage of this short-term spending \nbill that is pending at the moment. We will delay for another week the \nbusiness of the Senate.\n  One has to wonder what will happen in the meantime. I think the \nPresident is right to insist that Congress stay and do its job. Some \npeople have said: Why not leave the leaders of Congress here in \nWashington and let the Members go home and campaign? Let the leaders \nhaggle back and forth as to what the spending bills should contain. I \noppose that. I oppose it because I believe we all have a responsibility \nto stay and meet our obligation to the people of this country and to \nconsider these spending bills. A few years ago, in major sports, there \nwas a decision made about the same time, in basketball. I can recall \nthat in high school when your team would get ahead, you would freeze \nthe ball; you would try to run the clock. Players would dribble around \nand not get the ball in the hands of the opposition and hope the clock \nran out. That used to happen at all levels of basketball. Finally, \npeople said, that is a waste of time. People came to see folks playing \nbasketball, not wasting time dribbling. So they put shot clocks in and \nsaid after every few seconds, if you don't take a shot, you lose the \nball.\n\n  They did the same thing in football. They said we will basically \nspeed this game up, too; we will make you play the game rather than \ndelay the game.\n  I think we ought to consider, I say to Senator Byrd, the possibility \nof a vote clock in the Senate that says maybe once every 12 hours while \nwe are in session the Senate is actually going to cast a vote. I know \nthat is radical thinking, somewhat revolutionary. But if we had a vote \nclock, we wouldn't be dribbling away all of these opportunities to pass \nimportant spending bills. We wouldn't be running away from the agenda \nthat most families think are important for them and the future of our \ncountry.\n  Look at all of the things we have failed to do this year. This is a \nCongress of missed opportunities and unfinished business. It is hard to \nbelieve we have been here for 115 days and have so little to show for \nit. When the people across America, and certainly those I represent in \nIllinois, talk to me about their priorities and things they really care \nabout, it has little or nothing to do with our agenda on the floor of \nthe Senate. They want to know what Congress is going to do about health \ncare. They have kids who don't have health insurance. They themselves \nmay not have health insurance. They wonder what we will do about a \nprescription drug benefit. We had a lot of speeches on it. We just \ndon't seem to have reached the point where we can pass a bill into law. \nSadly, that says this institution is not producing as people expect \nCongress to produce.\n  With a vote clock running on the Senate floor and Members having to \ncast a vote at least once every 12 hours while in session, maybe we \nwill address these things. Maybe people won't be so fearful of the \nprospect of actually casting a vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Patients' Bill of Rights is another example. People in my home State \nof Illinois and my hometown of Springfield come to me and tell me \nhorror stories about the insurance companies and the problems they are \nhaving with medical care for their families; serious situations where \ndoctors are prescribing certain medications, surgeries, certain \nhospitalizations, and there will be some person working for an \ninsurance company 100 miles away or more denying coverage, time and \ntime again, saying: You cannot expect to have that sort of treatment \neven if your doctor wants it.\n  Many of us believe there should be a Patients' Bill of Rights which \ndefines the rights of all Americans and their families when it comes to \nhealth insurance. I believe and I bet most people do, as well. Doctors \nand medical professionals should make these judgments, not people who \nare guided by some bottom line of profit and loss but people who are \nguided by the bottom line of helping people to maintain their health.\n  We can't pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. The insurance companies, \nwhich are making a lot of money today off of these families, just don't \nwant Congress to enact that law. So they have stopped us from passing \nmeaningful legislation.\n\n  Another thing we want to do is if the insurance company makes the \nwrong decision, and you are hurt by it, or some member of your family \ndies as a result of it, you have a right to sue them for their \nnegligence. Every person, every family, every business in America is \nsubject to a lawsuit, litigation, being held accountable in court for \ntheir negligence and wrongdoing--except health insurance companies. We \nhave decided health insurance companies, unlike any other business in \nAmerica, will not be held accountable for their wrongdoing.\n  With impunity, they make decisions denying coverage. I think that is \nwrong. I think they should be held to the same standard every other \nbusiness in America is held to; that is, if they do something to hurt a \nperson because of their negligence or intentional wrongdoing, they \nshould be held accountable. That is part of our law, the ones that we \nsupport on this side of the aisle.\n  One can imagine that the health insurance companies hate that idea \njust as the devil hates holy water. They don't want to see that sort of \nthing ever happen. So they have stopped us from passing the bill. It is \nanother thing we have failed to do in this Congress--a Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  On prescription drug benefits, to think that we would finally take \nMedicare, created in 1965, and modernize it so that the elderly and \ndisabled would have access to affordable prescription drugs is not \nradical thinking. I daresay in every corner of my State, whether a \nperson is liberal, conservative, or independent, they understand this \none. People, through no fault of their own, find they need medications \nthat they cannot afford. So they make hard choices. Sometimes they \ndon't take the pill and sometimes they bust them in half, and sometimes \nthey can afford them at a cost of the necessities of life. Shouldn't we \nchange that? Shouldn't we come to an agreement to create a universal, \nvoluntary, prescription drug plan under Medicare? But unless something \nrevolutionary occurs in the next few days, we are going to leave \nWashington without even addressing the prescription drug issue under \nMedicare.\n  Another question is a minimum wage increase. It has been over 2 years \nnow we have held people at $5.15 an hour. Somewhere between 10 and 12 \nmillion workers in America are stuck at $5.15 an hour. In my home State \nof Illinois, over 400,000 people got up this morning and went to work \nfor $5.15 an hour. Quickly calculate that in your mind, and ask \nyourself, could you survive on $11,000 or $12,000 a year? I know I \ncouldn't. I certainly couldn't do it if I were a single parent trying \nto raise a child. And the substantial number of these minimum wage \nworkers are in that predicament. They are women who were once on \nwelfare and now trying to get back to work. They are stuck at $5.15 an \nhour.\n  We used to increase that on a regular basis. We said, of course, the \ncost of living went up; the minimum wage ought to go up, too. Then it \nbecame partisan about 15 years ago, and ever since we have had the \nfight, year in and year out. We may leave this year without ever \naddressing an increase in minimum wage for 12 million people across \nAmerica in these important jobs--not just maintaining our restaurants \nand hotels but also maintaining our day-care centers and our nursing \nhomes. These important people who cannot afford the high-paid lobbyists \nthat roam the Halls of Congress are going to find that this Congress \nwas totally unresponsive to their needs.\n  Issues go on and on, things that this Congress could have addressed \nand\n\n[[Page S9434]]\n\ndidn't address. Sadly enough, we are not only failing to address the \nimportant issues, we are not doing our basic business. We are not \npassing the spending bills that we are supposed to pass. As Senator \nByrd said earlier, we are derelict in our responsibilities under the \nConstitution. We have failed to respond to the American people when \nthey have asked us to do our job and do our duty.\n  I hope that before we leave in this session of Congress, we will \nresolve to never find ourselves in this predicament again; that we are \nnever going to find ourselves having missed so many opportunities that \nthe people of this country have to wonder why we have not accepted our \nresponsibility in a more forthcoming way.\n  I don't know if next year I will be making the proposal on the Senate \nfloor. I have to talk to Senator Byrd. It is kind of a radical idea of \ninstalling a vote clock that will run and force a vote every 12 hours \naround here so we can get something done. But it worked for the \nNational Football League. It worked for the National Basketball \nAssociation.\n  And Senator Byrd, I know you can't find it in that Constitution in \nyour pocket, but maybe that is what it will take to finally get this \nSenate to get down to work on the business about which people really \ncare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 39 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me comment on a couple of things that \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois just said.\n  The Senator from Illinois served in the other body and he served on \nthe Appropriations Committee. He comes to this body bringing great \ntalent, one of the most talented Members that I have ever seen in this \nbody. He brings great talent to this chamber. He can speak on any \nsubject. He is similar to Mr. Dorgan, and can speak on any subject at \nthe drop of a hat. He is very articulate, he is smart, and I am proud \nto have him as a fellow Member.\n  Now, he mentioned a change that was made in basketball. I wish that \nthey would make another change in basketball. When I talk about \n``basketball'' that is a subject concerning which I know almost \nnothing. But I have watched a few basketball games. I can remember how \nthey played them when I was in high school, which was a long time ago. \nBut it really irritates me to see basketball players run down the court \nwith that ball and jump up and hang on the hoop and just drop the ball \nthrough the basket. If I were 7 feet tall, I could drop the ball \nthrough the basket, even at age 83. If I were that tall, and I did not \nhave to shoot from the floor to make that basket, I could do it, too. I \nwonder why they don't get back to the old way of requiring players to \nshoot from the floor. In the days when I was in high school, players \nhad to shoot from the floor. They weren't 7-feet tall. A 6 foot 2 \ncenter in my high school was a tall boy.\n  But, anyhow, so much for basketball.\n  The distinguished Senator has talked about how we have plenty of time \nto do our work. The first year I came to the House of Representatives, \nin 1953, we adjourned sine die on August 3; 2 years later, we adjourned \nsine die on August 2; the next year, we adjourned sine die on July 27. \nWe did our work. We did not have the breaks we have now. Easter? We \nmight have been out Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We didn't have the \nbreaks then, but we passed the appropriations bills.\n  We didn't do any short-circuiting, and the Appropriations Committees \nof both Houses acted on a much higher percentage of the total moneys \nthat were spent by the Federal Government. I think there was a time \nwhen the Appropriations Committees passed on 90 percent of the moneys \nthat the Federal Government spent. Today, we probably act on less than \na third of the total moneys spent. So don't tell me that we can't get \nthis work done. We used to do it. We can do it again.\n  Now while I am talking about the Senator from Illinois being a new \nMember--relatively new in this body--he comes well equipped to this \nbody. I have been calling attention to the fact that 59 percent--59 \nSenators--have come to the Senate since I walked away from the majority \nleader's job. I mentioned Lyndon Johnson as a majority leader; I \nmentioned Mike Mansfield as a majority leader; I mentioned Robert C. \nByrd as a majority leader. I should not overlook the stellar \nperformances of Howard Baker, a Republican majority leader; or Robert \nDole, a Republican majority leader. We hewed the line when it came to \nthe Senate rules and precedents. They honored those rules and \nprecedents. We didn't have any shortcutting, any short-circuiting of \nappropriations bills, like going direct to conference and avoiding \naction on this floor. I want to mention those two Republican leaders \nbecause they were also in my time.\n  Mr. President, 27 of the 50 States are especially fortunate this \nyear. They have Senators on the Senate Appropriations Committee. These \nlucky 27 states, containing a total estimated 147,644,636 individuals \nas of July 1999, account for over half of our population of \n272,171,813. However, 23 of these United States--and I have them listed \non a chart here. I have them listed as the 25 have-nots--23 of these \nStates are in a different situation. They have no direct representation \non the Senate Appropriations Committee. Due to the rather unique \nsituation in which we find ourselves this year, three appropriations \nbills--bills which fund roughly 100 agencies and departments of the \nFederal Government--may never be considered on the Senate floor. If \nthat is the case, some 125 million Americans who happen to live in \nthose 23 States will have no direct input regarding the decisions of \nthe Senate committee that directly controls the discretionary budget of \nthe United States. The countless decisions on funding and policies in \nthose three bills will not have been presented on the Senate floor in a \nform that allows the elected Senators from those 23 States to debate \nand amend those 3 appropriations bills; namely, the FY2001 Commerce/\nJustice/State, Treasury-Postal, and VA-HUD bills.\n  This is not the fault of the Appropriations Committee. I cannot and I \nwill not blame Senator Stevens, the very capable Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, whom I know wants to shepherd each bill \nthrough his committee to the floor, and through the conference \ncommittee process in the appropriate manner. His efforts have been \nhamstrung because of a budget process that sets an unrealistically low \nlevel of funding, a level of funding that could not possibly address in \nany adequate way the demands placed upon it by the administration or by \nthe Senate, and because the Senate has not taken up many important \npieces of authorization and policy legislation this year.\n  I have nothing but praise for Senator Ted Stevens. I have seen many \nchairmen of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate. I have been on \nthat Senate Appropriations Committee 42 years--longer, now, than any \nother Senator in history on that Appropriations Committee. I have seen \nmany chairmen. I have never seen one better than Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Additionally, cloture has been filed too quickly on many bills, in \norder to further limit amendment opportunities. Appropriations bills \nhave, as a result, become an even stronger magnet for controversial \namendments than usual. That always complicates the process. Further, \nthe administration has not waited until the Senate has finished its \nbusiness before issuing veiled or blatant veto threats in an attempt to \ninfluence the appropriations process. So, I am very sympathetic to the \nsituation in which my good friend, Senator Stevens, now finds himself.\n  Whatever the reasons, however, these 23 have-not states will be \ndeprived of their right to debate and amend these bills through their \nelected Senators if we wrap these remaining bills into House/Senate \nconference reports without first taking them up on the Senate floor. \nThey will get only a yea or nay vote on an entire appropriations \nconference report. There will be no chance to debate or amend the \ncontents of those bills. The 15 million people in Florida--up or down \nvotes, with no amendments. The 11 million people in Ohio--up or down \nvotes on conference reports, with no amendments. The 479,000 people in \nWyoming--up or down votes is all they will get, with no amendments. The \nsame goes for the\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\nresidents of Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, \nMinnesota, Nebraska, and Maine.\n  Those citizens should also be upset. So should the residents of \nConnecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, North Carolina, \nOregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Tennessee. Those folks will \nhave no input into hundreds of thousands of spending decisions. They \nwill summarily be told to take that conference report without any \namendments; take it; vote up or down, take it or leave it.\n  I heard a Member of this Senate yesterday--I believe it was \nyesterday--decry the President's threat to veto an appropriations bill \nif something called the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act was not \npassed. That Senator said yesterday that a President who would make \nsuch threats was acting like a king. I agree. That threat was \noutrageous. If that threat was made, it was outrageous. It should not \nhave been made. Further, I agree with that Senator's feeling about the \npiece of legislation which caused the White House threat. I voted \nagainst suspending the rule that would have made it possible to \nconsider it. But when it comes to this President, or any President, \nDemocrat or Republican acting like a king, let me say that we in this \nbody are the ultimate check on that assumption of the scepter and crown \nthat all Presidents would like to make.\n  When we in the Congress invite the President's men to sit at the \ntable--essentially that is what we do when we delay these \nappropriations bills until the very last and have to act upon them with \nour backs to the wall and facing an almost immediate sine die \nadjournment, we in effect invite the administration's people to sit at \nthe table and be part of the decisions involving the power over the \npurse; yes, that power which is constitutionally reserved for the House \nand the Senate. When we do that and then deny the full Senate the right \nto debate and amend those spending bills, we are aiding and abetting \nthat kingly demeanor.\n  When we hand over a seat at the table to the White House and lock out \nthe full Senate, not just these 23 States, but lock out the full Senate \non spending bills, we are, in truth, giving a President much more power \nthan the framers ever intended.\n  We are charged in this body with staying the hand of an overreaching \nExecutive. Instead, it sometimes seems as if we are polishing the \nchrome on the royal chariot and stacking it full of congressional \nprerogatives for a fast trip to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  This year, one appropriations bill providing funding for the \nDepartments of Commerce, Justice, and State has been in limbo--limbo. I \nbelieve that Dante referred to limbo as the first circle of hell. \nAnyhow, this bill has been in limbo for more than 2 months in order to \navoid controversial subjects coming up for debate and amendment. So \nthat bill has been a sort of Wen Ho Lee of the Appropriations \nCommittee. It has been in isolation--incommunicado, stowed away in \nlimbo, out of sight, out of mind. But there it is on the calendar. It \nhas been there for weeks. Controversial? Yes. Some amendments might be \noffered. But why not? That is the process. We should call it up and \nhave those amendments and have a vote on them. Let's vote on them.\n  I have cast 15,876 votes in 42 years in this Senate. That is an \nattendance record of 98.7 percent. That may sound like bragging, but \nDizzy Dean said it was all right to brag if you have done it. So I have \na 98.7 percent voting attendance. I have never dodged a controversial \nvote, and I am still here and running again. And if it is the Good \nLord's will and the will of the people of West Virginia, I will be \naround here when the new Congress begins.\n  I have cast controversial votes. What is wrong with that? That is why \nwe come here.\n  Two other appropriations bills--DC and VA-HUD--were not even marked \nup by the committee until the second full week of September. There was \nnot enough money to make the VA-HUD bill even minimally acceptable. But \nhaving been marked up and reported from the committee, was it called up \non the Senate floor for consideration? No, it was not. It was just \nwrapped in dark glasses and a low-slung hat, surrounded with security \nand rushed straight into conference as if it contained secrets for the \neyes of the Appropriations Committee only. The plan apparently is to \ninsert the entire VA-HUD bill into the conference agreement on another \nappropriations bill without bringing it before the Senate. I still am \nhopeful that a way can be found to bring up that bill, as well as the \nTreasury Postal and Commerce Justice bills to the Senate floor.\n\n  I know that some of my colleagues may argue that every Senator has a \nchance to make his or her requests known to the chairman and ranking \nmember of each appropriations subcommittee, and in that way get their \nissues addressed in the bill even if it does not see action on the \nSenate floor. I certainly know that is true. I receive thousands of \nrequests each year to each subcommittee, as well as the requests made \nwhile those bills are in conference. However, if a Member's request is \nnot addressed in a bill and that bill does not see debate on the floor, \nthat Member has no opportunity to take his or her amendment to the full \nSenate and get a vote on it. He has no way to test the decisions of the \ncommittee to see if a majority of the full Senate will support his \namendment.\n  Additionally, when an appropriations bill is not debated by the full \nSenate, Senators who are not on the committee do not have the \nopportunity to strip objectionable items out of the bill. They do not \nhave the ability to seek changes, perhaps very useful changes, to \nprovisions in the bill that might hurt their States. They do not have a \nvoice on the many policy decisions contained in appropriations bills.\n  The Appropriations Committee staff is a good one. The Members and the \nclerks are fair, and they try to do a good job. For the most part, they \nsucceed and succeed admirably, and I am very proud of them. But we are \nall human. Sometimes we do not always see the unintended consequences \nof this or that provision, or we simply make a drafting error that \ncould hurt one or more States or groups of people. The fresh eyes and \ndifferent perspectives of our fellow Senators who are not on the \nAppropriations Committee, however, have caught such errors in the past \nand will, I am sure, do so again. But when those Members only get to \nvote on a conference report that is unamendable, their judgment is \neliminated. That is not a sensible way to legislate. I think it is a \nsloppy way to legislate. I know that my distinguished chairman, Senator \nStevens, does not want to legislate in this manner. He is not afraid of \nany debate or any controversial amendments. Ted Stevens is not afraid \nof anything on God's green Earth that I know of. He has done a yeoman's \njob in trying to find sufficient funding within the budget system to \nmove his bills, and I commend him for it.\n  I sincerely hope that we can all come together to find a way to help \nmy chairman. The full Senate must do its duty on appropriations bills \nthis year. We owe that to the Nation. We owe it to this institution in \nwhich we all serve.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is preparing to act on a short-term \ncontinuing resolution, which will give the Senate an additional week to \ntake up and debate appropriations bills, if we so choose. We can get a \nlot done in 7 days if we all put our shoulders to the wheel to heave \nthis bulky omnibus, or these bulky minibuses, out of the mud. The \nSenate is surely not on a par with the Creator. We cannot pull Heaven \nand Earth, and all the creatures under the Sun out of the void before \nwe rest. But with His help and His blessings, we surely can complete \nwork on the remaining appropriations bills before we adjourn.\n\n  The Legislative Branch and Treasury/General Government appropriations \nconference report was defeated by the Senate on September 20. Some may \nhave seen this as a defeat. But, in fact, that was no defeat. It was a \nvictory for the institution of the Senate, for the Constitution and its \nframers, and for the Nation. I think the defeat of that conference \nreport in large measure can be laid at the door of this strategy, which \nemanates from somewhere here, of avoiding floor debate on \nappropriations bills. I am glad that many of my colleagues objected to \nbeing asked to vote on a nondebatable conference report containing a \nbill--now, get this--containing a bill, in this instance the\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\nappropriations bill for the Department of the Treasury and for general \nGovernment purposes, that they have not had a chance to understand, to \ndebate, to amend, or to influence. The Senate was designed to be a \ncheck on the House of Representatives. Moreover, the Senate was \ndesigned to even out the advantages that more populous States enjoy in \nthe House, and to give small or rural States an even playing field in \nall matters, including appropriations.\n  This vote on the legislative branch, Treasury, and general government \nminibus--minibus--appropriations bill is a setback, as far as time \ngoes, but, I still believe that we can rally, and complete our work in \na manner that will allow us to leave with our heads held high, rather \nthan with our tail between our legs. We can finish our work. The people \nexpect it. We ought to do it.\n  In fact, in keeping with the rather screwball approach that we have \nbeen taking on appropriations matters this year, much of the \nconferencing on these bills has been taking place, even before the \nbills have been debated on the floor.\n  Surely we can build on this base, and still allow the Senate to work \nits will on the more contentious elements of these bills. It is our job \nto resolve these problems. We get paid to do it. We get paid well to do \nit. It may be true that we could get higher pay somewhere else--as a \nbasketball player or as a TV anchor person or in some other job--but we \nget paid well for the job we do.\n  We are all familiar with these issues. We know the needs of our \nindividual States. We need to have that debate about these issues, and \nwe need to engage the brains of 100 members of this body to get the \nvery best results. I would far rather--far rather--see this process \ntake place, and send good bills to the President to sign or veto, than \nto see Senators simply abdicating our constitutional role in \nformulating the funding priorities for our Nation. The bad taste of \nrecent years' goulash of appropriations, tax, and legislative vehicles \nall sloshed together in a single omnibus pot has not yet left my mouth. \nThat is the easy way, but it is the wrong way. I didn't want a second \nor third helping, much less a fourth. It is loaded with empty calories, \nand full of carcinogens. Moreover, we are poisoning the institutional \nrole of the U.S. Senate, rendering it weaker and weaker in influence \nand in usefulness. We are slowly eroding the Senate's ability to inform \nand to represent the people, and sacrificing its wisdom--the wisdom of \nthe Senate--and its unique place in our Republic on the cold altar of \nambition and expediency. All it takes is our will to see what we are \ndoing and turn away from the course that we are on. I urge Senators to \ncome together and do our work for our country.\n  I thank all Senators who have spoken on this subject today.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Twelve minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, will the revered Senator, who I like to \nthink of as the President pro tempore, yield 5 minutes to this Senator?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes--I yield all my remaining time to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, I would like to speak to the matter that the \nSenator from West Virginia has addressed from the perspective of the \nFinance Committee. I think the Senator will agree that most of the \nbudget of the Federal Government goes through the Finance Committee in \nterms of tax provisions, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the \ninterest on the public debt, which is a very large sum, which we do not \ndebate much because we have to pay it.\n  The two committees--Finance and Appropriations--were formed at about \nthe same time in our history and have had the preeminent quality that \ncomes with the power of the purse, that primal understanding of the \nfounders that this is where the responsibilities of government lie--to \nlay and collect taxes; to do so through tariffs, to do so through \ndirect taxation.\n  We had an income tax briefly in the Civil War, but there was the \njudgment that we ought to amend the Constitution to provide for it \ndirectly.\n  Sir, I came to this body 24 years ago. I have learned that, as I \nshall retire in January--and, God willing, I will live until then--\nthere will only have been 120 Senators in our history who served more \nterms. So they claim a certain experience.\n  I obtained a seat on the Finance Committee with that wondrous Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. We were in the same class, Senator Chafee and \nSenator Danforth and I. I obtained a seat as a first-time Senator, \nthrough the instrumentality of the new majority leader. I avow that. I \nacknowledge it. I am proud of it. I will take that with me from the \nSenate as few others.\n  I underwent an apprenticeship at the feet, if you will, of Russell \nLong, the then-chairman, who, for all his capacity for merriment, was a \nvery strict observer of the procedures of this body and the \nprerogatives of the Finance Committee.\n  We brought bills to the floor. They were debated. They were debated \nat times until 4 in the morning. I can remember then-Majority Leader \nByrd waking me up on a couch out in the Cloakroom to say, ``Your \namendment is up, Pat,'' and my coming in, finding a benumbed body. The \nvote was aye, nay. It wasn't clear. It was the first time and the last \nin my life I asked for a division. And we stood up, and you could count \nbodies, but you could not hear voices.\n  Then we would go to conference with the House side. The conferees \nwould be appointed. Each side would have conferees, each party. They \neach would have a say. We would sit at a table--sometimes very long \ntimes, but in time--and we would bring back a conference report and \nsay: Here it is. And if anyone would like to know more about it, there \nare seven of us in this room who did the final negotiations with the \nHouse. It is all there. It is comprehensible. And it is following the \nprocedures of the body.\n  I stayed on the committee, sir. This went on under Senator Dole as \nchairman; Senator Bentsen as chairman. I would like to think it went on \nduring the brief 2 years that I was chairman.\n  In the 6 years since that time, I have seen that procedure collapse. \nIn our committee, we have a very fine chairman. No one holds Senator \nRoth in higher regard than I do. I think my friend recognized this when \nhe saw the two of us stand here for 3 weeks on the floor to pass the \nlegislation which he did not approve. Senator Byrd did not approve of \npermanent normal trade relations, but when it was all over, he had the \ngraciousness as ever to say he did approve of the way we went about it. \nEvery amendment was offered. Cloture was never invoked. And in the end, \nwe had a vote, and the Senate worked its will.\n  Now, in the last several days in the Finance Committee, we have been \nworking on major legislation, legislation for rebuilding American \ncommunities, which is based on an agreement reached between the \nPresident and the Speaker of the House that this is legislation we \nought to have, which is fine. The President should have every \nopportunity to reach some agreement with the leadership over here and \nsay: Let us have this legislation. You send it to me; I will sign it. \nBut you send it to me; I won't write it. I might send you a draft.\n  We were not even contemplating bringing the bill to the floor, \npassing it, going to conference. It is just assumed that can't happen. \nAnd indeed, in the end, we could not even get it out of committee. So \nthe chairman and I will introduce a bill and a rule XIV will have it \nheld here at the desk so it is around when those mysterious powers sit \ndown to decide what our national budget will be.\n  You spoke of something difficult to speak to but necessary in this \nbody, which is our relations with the Executive, which increasingly \nhave found themselves not just with a place at the table, as you have \nso gentlemanly put it, but a commanding, decisive role in the \nlegislative process.\n  Sir, I can report--and I don't have to face constituents any longer, \nso I might just as well--I can recall around 11 o'clock one evening on \nthe House side in the Speaker's conference room--that particular \nSpeaker had a glass case with the head of an enormous Tyrannosaurus rex \nin it, a great dinosaur--and tax matters were being taken up. There \nwere representatives of the White House, representatives of\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\nthe majority leadership in the House, the leadership in the Senate. I \ndidn't really recognize any committee members, just leadership. And I \narrived in the innocent judgment of something in which I wouldn't have \na large part, but I would be expected to sign the papers, the \nconference papers the conferees sign, a ritual we all take great \npleasure in because it means it is over.\n  Sir, I was asked to leave the room. I was asked to leave the room. \nThere as a Member of the Senate minority, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, that decision was not going to have anything to do with the \nFinance Committee or much less the Democrats. It would be a White House \nand a congressional leadership meeting.\n  In 24 years, nothing like that had ever happened. I don't believe, \nsir, it ever happened. I can't imagine how we came to this. I do know \nhow, from the point of view of our party--the calamitous elections of \n1994, when we lost our majorities in both bodies.\n  So I would say, I do not believe in the two centuries we have been \nhere--and we are the oldest constitutional government in history, but \nwe have seen our constitutional procedures degrade. We have seen \npractices not ever before having taken place, nor contemplated. They \nare not the way this Republic was intended. They are subversive of the \nprinciples of our Constitution, the separation of power.\n  The separation of powers is the first principle of American \nconstitutional government. We would not have a King or a King in \nParliament. We would have an elected President, an elected Congress and \nan independent judiciary. When the White House is in the room drafting \nthe bill that becomes the law, the separation of power has been \nviolated in a way we should not accept.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I apologize.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor to my distinguished friend, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to state that if there is no \nobjection, the vote on the continuing resolution would occur at 4:15. I \nask unanimous consent that that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And that rule XII be waived.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask permission for up to 5 \nminutes during that period of time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to yield to my friend 5 minutes of the time \nI have between now and 4:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, might the very distinguished and able \nSenator from New York have just 2 or 3 minutes to finish his statement?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to yield to the Senator from New York 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator from Alaska, my friend of all these \nyears. Just to conclude my thought, which is that the separation of \npowers is what distinguishes American government. We brought it into \nbeing. It did not exist in any previous democratic regimes, the various \nGrecian cities, the Roman era had a legislature period. There was no \nexecutive authority. What Madison once referred to as the fugitive \nexistence of the ancient republics was largely because they had no \nexecutive authority to carry out the decisions of the legislature. The \nlegislature was left to be the executive as well. It didn't work.\n  We have worked. There are two countries on Earth, sir, that both \nexisted in 1800 and have not had their form of government changed by \nviolence since 1800: the United States and the United Kingdom. There \nare seven, sir, that both existed in 1900 and have not had their form \nof government changed by violence since. Many of the British dominions \nwere not technically independent nations.\n  The separation of powers is the very essence of our system. We have \nseen it evanescing before us. I say evanescing because--the misty \nclouds over San Clemente, noise rising from the sea--because I was not \nin that room after I was asked to leave, nor was there any journalist, \nnor were there any of our fine stenographers. No one was there save a \ngroup of self-selected people. They weren't selected for that role. \nThey should not have been playing it. This has gone on too long, and it \nought to stop.\n  With that, sir, I thank my friend from Alaska and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I revere the Senator from New York. He came \nto the Senate in 1977. He went on the committee. What he has just said \nastonishes me--that he was asked to leave the room in this Republic--\n``a republic, Madam, if you can keep it.''\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Said Benjamin Franklin, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I consider myself very fortunate today. \nExcept for going to a conference here and there, and a few other things \nthat had me go off the floor, I have had the opportunity to listen to \nalmost everything that went on today, either from my seat in the Senate \nChamber or in the Cloakroom. How fortunate I am.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is to be commended for initiating this \ndebate on what American Government is all about. When the history books \nare written, people will review what took place during this debate, the \nhigh level of debate and the exchange between the Senator from New York \nand the Senator from West Virginia, both with years of wisdom, years of \nknowledge, and years of experience. People will look back at this \nconsideration in the textbooks.\n  I stepped out to go over to the Senator's Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee. The administration was there complaining about report \nlanguage as to what the intent of the Congress was. It is hard for me \nto fathom they could do that. I don't want to embarrass anybody from \nthe administration, but I spoke to two people from the administration. \nI said: What in the world are you trying to do? Are you trying to tell \nthis subcommittee, this legislative entity, what our intent is? That is \nour responsibility as legislators, not this administration's \nresponsibility. We have report language in bills so that people can \nlook and find out what our intent is.\n  Mr. BYRD. So that the courts can also.\n  Mr. REID. The courts, or anybody else. If the administration doesn't \nlike what we do, they can take it to court, and that report language \nwill give that court an idea as to what we meant. I say to Senator Byrd \nand Senator Moynihan, words cannot express how I feel.\n  As people have heard me say on the floor before, I am from \nSearchlight, NV. My father never graduated from eighth grade and my \nmother never graduated from high school. To be in the Senate of the \nUnited States and to work with Senator Moynihan and Senator Byrd is an \nhonor. It is beyond my ability to express enough my appreciation for \nthis discussion that has taken place today. I hope it will create some \nsense in this body--maybe not for this Congress but hopefully for the \nnext one--that we will be able to legislate as we are supposed to do \nit. I express my appreciation to both Senators.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurkowski be recognized for up to 20 minutes and that Senator Sessions \nbe recognized for up to 15 minutes following the two rollcalls that \nwill soon take place.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't hear that request.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am going to yield back the time I had so we can vote \nearlier. I agreed to yield time to two colleagues, to be used after the \nvotes take place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, having been a Senator who served in the \nminority, in the majority, and then in the minority, and again in the \nmajority, I understand the discussion that has taken place here today \nfull well. I have been a member of the Appropriations Committee for \nmany years--not nearly as long as the Senator from West Virginia but \nfor a long enough time to know that the appropriations process has to \nfit into the calendar as adjusted by the leadership.\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\n  We have done our best to do that this year. It does inconvenience \nmany Senators whenever the appropriations process is shortened. I \nbelieve in full and long deliberation on appropriations bills. Mainly, \nI believe in bringing to the floor bills that have such uniform support \non both sides of the aisle that there really isn't much to debate.\n  I think if the Members of the Senate will go back and look at the \nDefense Appropriations Committee bills since I became chairman, or when \nSenator Inouye became chairman, we have followed that principle. \nUnfortunately, issues develop that are not bipartisan on many bills and \nthey lead to long delays. In addition, the closer we get to an election \nperiod, the longer people want to talk or offer amendments that have \nbeen voted on again and again and again.\n  We have had a process here of trying to accommodate the time that has \nbeen consumed on major issues, such as the Patients' Bill of Rights and \nthe PNTR resolution dealing with China, which took a considerable time \nout of our legislative process. We find ourselves sometimes on Thursday \nwith cloture motions that have to be voted on the following Monday, and \nthen we make it Tuesday and we lose a weekend. We have adjusted to the \ndemands of many Senators.\n  I believe the Senator from West Virginia would agree that we have \ntried very hard in the Appropriations Committee to get our work done. \nMost of our bills were out of committee before we left for the recess \nin July. As a matter of fact, we had our two major bills, from the \npoint of view of Defense--military construction and the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill--approved in really record time.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I want to make sure that any comments I have made do not \nreflect on the Senator from Alaska. I can't imagine anyone being more \ninvolved in trying to move the legislation forward than the Senator \nfrom Alaska. So none of the blame that is to go around here goes to the \nSenator from Alaska, as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator. I wasn't inferring that I received \nany comments or concern on my activity or the committee's, per se. I \nbelieve the process of the Senate, however, is one that involves the \nleadership adjusting to the demands of the Senate and to the demands of \nthe times. A political year is an extremely difficult time for the \nleadership. Senator Byrd had leadership in several elections, and I had \nthe same role as the Senator from Nevada--the whip--during one critical \nelection period during which the leader decided to be a candidate and \nwas gone. So I was acting leader during those days. I know the strains \nthat exist.\n  I want to say this. I believe that good will in the Senate now is \nneeded to finish our job. The American people want us to do our job. \nOur job is to finish these 13 bills that finance the standing agencies \nof the Federal Government and to do so as quickly as possible. Because \nof the holiday that starts in a few minutes for some of our colleagues, \nwe will not meet tomorrow, and we cannot meet Saturday. So we will come \nback in Monday, and that will give us another 7 days to work on our \nbills.\n  The House has now passed the energy and water bill. We will file the \nTransportation and Interior bills--I understand those conferences are \njust about finished now--on Monday. We are working toward completion by \nthe end of this continuing resolution. But let's not fool ourselves. If \nwe got all these bills passed by next Friday, there would still have to \nbe a continuing resolution because the President has a constitutional \nperiod within which to review the bills. He has 10 days to review them, \nnot counting Sunday; so we are going to be in session yet for a \nconsiderable period of time--those of us involved in appropriations.\n  I urge the Senate to remember that circumstances can change. We could \nbe in the minority next year, God forbid, and the leadership on the \nother side could be trying to move bills. And if the minority taught us \nsome lessons about how to delay, I think we are fast learners. We have \nto remember that what comes around will go around. It is comity that \nkeeps this place moving and doing its job.\n  I think all of us have studied under and learned from the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. He has certainly been a \nmentor to people on both sides of the aisle. He has taught us \neverything there is to know about the rules and how to use them. He has \nnever abused them. I don't take the criticism that he has made other \nthan to be of a process that we now find ourselves involved in. Our job \nis to work our way out of this dilemma. I hope we can. I hope we can do \nit in good grace and satisfy the needs of our President as he finishes \nhis term. We have been working very hard at that since we came back \nfrom the August recess.\n  In my judgment, from the conversations I have had with Jack Lew, the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, there is a recognition \nof the tensions of the time and a willingness to try to accommodate the \nconflicting needs of the two major parties in an election year. That is \nwhat we are trying to do.\n  I hope we will vote to adopt this continuing resolution and that \nMembers will enjoy the holiday that is given to us by our Jewish \ncolleagues. We will come back Monday ready to work.\n  I fully intend to do everything I can to get every bill we have to \nthe President by a week from tomorrow. That may not be possible, but \nthat is our goal, and I expect to have the help of every Senator who \nwants to see us do our constitutional duty, and that is to pass these \nbills.\n  Does the Senator wish any further time?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the two Republican Senators there be allowed to speak in \nmorning business: Senator Feingold for 30 minutes and Senator Mikulski \nfor 35 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am compelled to object because I want to state to the \nSenator that I took our time and allotted it after----\n  Mr. REID. I said after the Republican speakers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't know what the leader intends to do after that \ntime. I have no indication that he wishes to object, but I don't know. \nIn a very short time our Jewish friends must be home before sundown. I \ndon't think there is going to be objection, but I am not at liberty to \nsay.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Feingold, of course, is Jewish and he would handle \nthat on his own. Anyway, fine. I think it is sundown tomorrow, anyway.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thought it was sundown tonight.\n  Mr. REID. No. Some people just want to leave to get ready for sundown \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't see any reason to object.\n  Mr. REID. If the leader has something else he wants to do, of course \nthat will take precedence. But before we leave tonight, they would like \nto have the opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am compelled to say this: Under the practice we have \nbeen in so far, the Senator's side of the aisle has consumed 6 hours \ntoday, and we have consumed about 40 minutes, at the most. There is a \nprocess of sort of equalizing this time. I would be pleased to take \ninto account anyone who has to leave town, but can we do that after \nthis time? I promise the Senator I will help work this out.\n  Mr. REID. We will talk after the first vote. I will renew the request \nafter the first vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I've come to the floor to join my \ncolleagues in discussing where our annual budgeting process stands.\n  We are just three days away from the start of the new fiscal year, \nand the Senate is far behind in its work. The resulting rush is leading \nsome to short-circuit our usual appropriations process. Like so many of \nmy colleagues, I am dismayed that Senators are being denied the \nopportunity to fully consider and debate these appropriations bills.\n  I want to commend Senator Byrd for his comments today. Senator Byrd \nis once again speaking for the United States Senate. His comments are \nneither Republican nor Democrat. With his usual elegance and candor, \nSenator Byrd is championing this institution, and we should all commend \nhim for that. The Senate that he defends so passionately is one that \nworks for both parties; works for all Senators; and most importantly, \nworks for the American people.\n\n[[Page S9439]]\n\n  Time and again during my eight years of service in this body, I have \nmade the walk from my office to this floor. And each time, I bring with \nme a certain excitement and anticipation for the great opportunity the \npeople of Washington state have given me to represent them as we debate \nissues from education to foreign policy to health care.\n  Unfortunately, there have been very few opportunities to come to this \nfloor and engage in meaningful debate. Too often, the majority has \nsought to either stifle or deny debate on the issues Americans care \nabout. On the rare occasions when we have had debates, they have not \nresulted in meaningful legislation that has a chance of being signed \ninto law.\n  For example, the Senate spent several weeks debating the Elementary \nand Secondary Education act. We debated the issues, and we cast tough \nvotes on the ESEA bill. But, for some reason, the bill was shelved by \nthe majority. Now it looks certain to die as the Congress tries to \nadjourn quickly in this election year.\n  As we watch the clock tick toward the end of the fiscal year this \nweekend, only two of the 13 appropriations bills have been signed into \nlaw. We now find ourselves in an unnecessary impasse. The breakdown in \nthis year's appropriations process did not happen overnight. It is not \nmerely the result of election eve politicking, or jockeying for \nposition between the Executive and Legislative branches, although there \nare plenty of both going on.\n  No, the breakdown of the fiscal year 2001 appropriations process can \nbe traced back to the opening days of this session of Congress in \nJanuary. Back then, the House and Senate leadership promptly fell into \ndisarray over the handling of the President's request for a \nsupplemental spending bill. You may recall that the President requested \n$5 billion in supplemental fiscal year 2000 funding. The House \nsubsequently passed a $12.8 billion supplemental funding bill--more \nthan twice what the President had requested. The Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, at the behest of the Senate Majority Leader, shelved plans \nto draw up a separate supplemental funding bill. Instead, the Senate \nattached a total of $8.6 billion in supplemental funding onto three \nregular appropriations bills--Military Construction, Foreign \nOperations, and Agriculture appropriations. The Majority Leader's plan \nwas to have all three bills enacted into law by the Fourth of July \nholiday. Needless to say, things did not quite go as planned.\n  Despite weeks of congressional wrangling, the three bills in the \nSenate could not be reconciled with the one bill in the House. \nFinally--in desperation--the House and Senate ended up jamming $11.2 \nbillion in supplemental funding into the conference on the FY 2001 \nMilitary Construction Appropriations Bill. Much of that funding had \nnever seen the light of day in either the House or Senate. The \nconference report was approved on June 30, and became the first of the \nFY 2001 appropriations bill signed into law. With the exception of the \nswift and relatively smooth passage of the Defense Appropriations Bill \na month later, the FY 2001 appropriations process has gone from bad to \nworse. We now find ourselves in the intolerable position of having 11 \nof the 13 appropriations bills still pending--with two days to go \nbefore the end of the fiscal year, and no clear game plan in sight. The \nHouse has passed all of the regular appropriations bills. And the \nSenate Appropriations Committee--on which I serve--has reported all 13 \nregular appropriations bills. But only 10 of these 13 bills have been \npassed by the Senate. Once again, desperation is setting in. The focus \nis shifting from the flow of open debate on the Senate floor to the \nclosed doors of the conference committees.\n  Just last week, the Senate leadership attempted to attach the \nTreasury and General Government Appropriations bill--which the Senate \nhas never considered--to the Legislative Branch conference report, and \npass them as a package deal. The Senate was wise to reject that \napproach. The Senate should have an opportunity to fully consider these \nthree significant appropriations bills. To abandon the reasoned debate \nthis chamber is known for would represent a full surrender by this body \nof our responsibilities to the American people.\n  Mr. President, there are many pressing issues from programs for \nveterans healthcare and the courts to the National Weather Service. We \nshould be able to debate these funding plans and then vote for or \nagainst them. Mr. President, it doesn't have to be this way. The Senate \nstill has time to take up the remaining appropriations bills, debate \nthem, amend them, and send them to the President. They may be \ncontentious. But that is precisely why they must be aired in the light \nof day before the entire Senate and not swept into law under the cover \nof an unrelated appropriations conference report.\n  If the Senate acts promptly, the conferees will have ample time to \ncomplete their work, and report back to the full House and Senate. As a \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am acutely aware of \nour responsibilities to the people of this nation when it comes to \nappropriating taxpayers' dollars. I take that responsibility very \nseriously. The people have a right to know what Congress is doing with \ntheir money. And members of Congress have a responsibility to \nappropriate money wisely.\n  We cannot do our jobs or meet our responsibilities, if we delegate \nour work to a handful of appropriators hammering out a conference \nagreement, or to a closed circle of congressional leaders and White \nHouse officials huddling over a conference table.\n  Mr. President, we are poised to pass a Continuing Resolution that \nwill keep the government operating through October 6. I believe that if \nwe could put aside political posturing, partisan bickering, and \nretaliatory tactics for just one week, just one week, we could complete \nwork on the appropriations bills, in an orderly and responsible \nfashion, and close out this Congress. We may not have accomplished all \nthat we would have wished to accomplish. But I am confident that \ncontinued bickering over the appropriations process in the waning days \nof the 106th Congress will not improve the climate for any other \nlegislation to move forward.\n  Mr. President, the American people deserve more than this mess from \ntheir elected leaders. I know the Senate can do better. In the days \nahead, I urge my colleagues to work with our leaders and with the \nleadership of the Appropriations Committee, to tackle the remaining \nappropriations bills and conference reports, to debate, to vote, and to \ncomplete the work that we have been charged to do.\n  Though time is running out, it is not too late to make these spending \ndecisions in the most responsible way, and that is what I am calling on \nmy colleagues to do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think the time has come for us to ask that this \nresolution be presented to the Senate for a vote. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have had a series of discussions with \nmy colleagues on the energy crisis in this country.\n  I think it is fair to make a broad statement relative to the crisis. \nThe crisis is real. We have seen it in our gasoline prices. We saw it \nlast week when oil hit an all-time high of $37 a barrel--the highest in \n10 years. And now we are busy blaming each other for the crisis.\n  I think it is fair to say that our friends across the aisle have \ntaken credit for the economy because it occurred during the last 7 \nyears. I also think it is fair that our colleagues take credit for the \nenergy crisis that has occurred because they have been here for the \nlast 7 years.\n  I have talked about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, what I consider \nthe insignificance of the drawdown, and the signal that it sends to \nOPEC that, indeed, we are vulnerable at 58-percent dependence on \nimported oil. That sends a message that we are willing to go into our \nsavings account.\n  What did we get out of that? We got about a 3- to 4-day supply of \nheating oil. That is all. We use about a million barrels of heating oil \na day during the winter. That has to be taken out of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve in crude form--30 million barrels--and transferred to \nthe refineries which are already operating at capacity because we \nhaven't had any new refineries built in this country in the last 15 to \n20 years.\n  This is not the answer.\n  I am going to talk a little bit about one of the answers that should \nbe considered by this body and has been considered before. In fact, in \n1995, the issue of opening up that small area of the Coastal Plain, \nknown as ANWR, came before this body. We supported it. The President \nvetoed it. If we had taken the action to override that veto of the \nPresident, or if the President had supported us, we would know what is \nin this small area of the Coastal Plain. When I say ``small area,'' I \nimplore my colleagues to reflect on the realities.\n  Here is Alaska--one-fifth the size of the United States. If you \noverlay Alaska on the map of the United States, it runs from Canada to \nMexico, and Florida to California. The Aleutian Islands go thousands of \nmiles further. There is a very small area near the Canadian border. \nWhen I say ``small,'' I mean small in relationship to Alaska with 365 \nmillion acres.\n  But here we have ANWR in a little different proportion. This is where \nI would implore Members to understand realities. This is 19 million \nacres. This is the size of the State of South Carolina.\n  A few of the experts around here have never been there and are never \ngoing to go there in spite of our efforts to get them to go up and take \na look.\n  Congress took responsible action. In this area, they created a refuge \nof 9 million acres in permanent status. They made another withdrawal--\nonly they put it in a wilderness in permanent status with 78.5 million \nacres, leaving what three called the 1002 area, which is 1\\1/2\\ million \nacres.\n  That is this Coastal Plain. That is what we are talking about.\n  This general area up here--Kaktovik--is a little Eskimo village in \nthe middle of ANWR.\n  They say this is the ``Serengeti.'' There is a village in it. There \nare radar sites in it. To suggest it has never been touched is \nmisleading.\n  Think for a moment. Much has been made of the crude oil prices \ndropping $2 a barrel when the President tapped the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve and released 30 million barrels of oil.\n  While I believe the price drop will only be temporary, I ask my \nfellow Senators what the price of crude oil would be today if the \nPresident had not vetoed opening up ANWR 6 years ago. It would have \nbeen at least $10 less because we would have had another million-\nbarrel-a-day supply on hand.\n\n  What would prices be if OPEC and the world knew that potentially 1 to \n2 million barrels a day of new oil was coming out of the ANWR Coastal \nPlain, and not only for 3 or 4 or 15 days, but for decades?\n\n[[Page S9441]]\n\n  Let me try to belie the myth of what is in ANWR in relationship to \nPrudhoe Bay. This area of Prudhoe Bay has been supplying this Nation \nwith nearly 25 percent of its crude oil for almost two decades--2\\1/2\\ \ndecades.\n  We built an 800-mile pipeline with the capacity of over 2 million \nbarrels. Today, that pipeline is flowing at 1 million barrels with the \ndecline of Prudhoe Bay.\n  You might not like oil fields but Prudhoe Bay is the finest oil field \nin the world, bar none. I defy anybody to go up there and compare it \nwith other oil fields. The environmental sensitivity is unique because \nwe have to live by rules and regulations.\n  The point I want to make is when Prudhoe Bay was developed and this \npipeline was built at a cost of roughly $6.5 billion to nearly $7 \nbillion, the estimate of what we would get out of the oil field was 9 \nbillion barrels.\n  Here we are 23 or 24 years later, and we have gotten over 12 billion \nbarrels. It is still pumping at better than 1 million barrels a day.\n  The estimates up here range from a low of 5.7 billion to a high of 16 \nbillion barrels--16 billion barrels. What does that equate to? It is \nkind of in the eye of the beholder. Some say it would be a 200-day \nsupply--a 200-day supply of America's oil needs. They are basing their \nestimates on old data of 3.2 billion barrels in ANWR, ignoring the most \nrecent estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey that there is a 5 \npercent chance of 16 billion barrels--that is at the high end with a \nmean estimate of 10.3 billion barrels. That is the average. For the \nsake of conversation, we might as well say a 10.3 billion barrel \naverage.\n  Under this argument, Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field in the United \nStates, has only a 600-day supply. That is assuming all oil stops \nflowing from all other places, and we have no other source of oil other \nthan Alaska. So those arguments don't hold water.\n  But the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club say it is only a 200-\nday supply. It is only this, or it is only that; and using that logic, \nthe SPR is only a 15-day supply, in theory.\n  Let's make sure we keep this discussion where it belongs.\n  To give you some idea, in this 1002 area, in comparison to an eastern \nseaboard State, let's take the State of Vermont, and say that there are \nabsolutely no other sources for oil in the entire Coastal Plain. If \nthis 1002 area was designated to fulfill Vermont's needs, that 200-day \nsupply is enough to heat homes and run equipment all over Vermont for \nthe next 197 years. So don't tell me that is insignificant. For New \nHampshire, for example, it would be 107 years.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey says that it would replace all of our \nimports from Saudi Arabia for 11 years.\n  If it contains the maximum estimate of recoverable oil, it would \nreplace all of our imports from Saudi Arabia for 30 years.\n  If the Arctic Coastal Plain could produce just 600,000 barrels a day, \nthe most conservative estimate--more likely it would produce 2 million \nbarrels a day--the area would be among the top 13 countries in the \nworld; just this area in terms of crude oil production.\n  At 2 million barrels a day, the Coastal Plain of ANWR itself would be \namong the top eight oil-producing nations in the world. I am sick and \ntired of hearing irresponsible statements from the environmental groups \nthat are lying to the American people.\n\n  We had a little discussion the other day on the floor. One of my \ncolleagues from Illinois said he ran into a CEO of a major oil company \nof Chicago--he didn't identify who he was--and asked him how important \nANWR was to the future of the petroleum industry. The man from the \ncompany said from his point of view it was nonsense, there are plenty \nof sources of oil in the United States that are not environmentally \ndangerous.\n  Where? Where? We can't drill off the Pacific coast. We can't drill \noff the Atlantic coast. We can't drill offshore. We can only drill down \nin the gulf, and now the Vice President wants to cancel leases down \nthere.\n  He further said he believes, and the man from Illinois agreed, we \ndon't have to turn to a wildlife refuge to start drilling oil in the \nArctic nor do we have to drill offshore.\n  If we are not going to drill offshore, where are we going to drill? \nThey won't let drilling occur in the Overthrust Belt. Mr. President, 64 \npercent has been ruled out--Wyoming, Colorado, Montana--to any \nexploration.\n  The idea that these people don't identify where we are going to \ndrill, but are just opposed to it, is absolutely irresponsible. As a \nconsequence of not knowing whether we have this oil or not, we are not \ndoing a responsible thing in addressing whether we can count on this as \nanother Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  I have a presentation that I hope will catch some of the attention of \nMembers because there is an old saying from some of the environmental \ngroups: For Heaven's sake, there is 95 percent of the coastal plain \nthat is already open for oil and gas development.\n  Here is a picture of the coastal plain. It is important that the \npublic understand this: 95 percent is not open. Here is Canada. Here is \nthe ANWR area, 19 million acres, the coastal plain. This area is not \nopen. It is open in this general area. Then we have the National \nPetroleum Reserve. This area is closed --this little bit of white area. \nFrom Barrow to Point Hope is closed. I repeat, 95 percent isn't open.\n  The Administration prides itself on saying we have been responsible \nin opening up areas of the National Petroleum Reserve, which is an old \nnaval petroleum reserve. A reserve is there for an emergency. We don't \nknow what is there. The areas that the oil company wanted to go in and \nbid Federal leases, the Department of Interior wouldn't make available. \nThey made a few, it is a promising start, but let's open up a petroleum \nreserve and find out whether we have the petroleum there. They won't do \nthat. They won't support us in opening up ANWR.\n  Only 14 percent of Alaska's coastal lands are open to oil and gas \nexploration. Those are facts. I defy the environmental community, the \nSierra Club, or the Wilderness Society to counter those statements. The \nbreakdown: Prudhoe region, 14 percent; ANWR coastal plain, 11 percent; \nANWR wilderness, 5 percent; naval petroleum, 52 percent; and Western \nNorth Slope, State, native private land, 18 percent. Ninety-five \npercent is not open.\n  I am looking at ``The Scoop on Oil,'' Community News Line, Scripps \nNews Service, written obviously by the environmental community. It says \n``And yet oil spills in Prudhoe Bay average 500 a year.''\n  They don't amount to 500 spills a year. They amount to 17,000 spills \na year--I see that has the attention of the Presiding Officer--because \nin Prudhoe Bay they don't mention they have to report all spills of any \nnonnaturally occurring substance, whether a spill of fresh water, a \nhalf cup of lubricating oil, or a more significant spill. The vast \nmajority of spills at Prudhoe Bay have been fresh and salt water use in \nconditioning on the ice roads and pads--not of chemicals or oil.\n  In 1993, the worst year in the past decade for spills at Prudhoe Bay, \nthere were 160 reported spills involving nearly 60,000 gallons of \nmaterial but only 2 spills involving oil. Those are the facts. And all \n10 gallons went into secondary containment structures and were easily \ncleaned.\n  Prudhoe Bay is the cleanest industrial zone in America. America \nshould understand this. What the environmental community has done is \nfound a cause, a cause for membership dollars. Our energy policy today \nin this country is directed not by our energy needs but by the \ndirection of the environmental community. They accept no responsibility \nfor the pickle we are in with this energy crisis. This administration \nhas not fostered any domestic exploration program of any magnitude in \nthis country, as I have indicated, whether it be the Overthrust Belt or \nelsewhere. They have limited excess activity to the Gulf of Mexico. \nThey have prohibited exploration in the high Arctic, as I have \nindicated.\n  They have moved off oil and said: No more nuclear; we won't address \nnuclear waste. My good friend from Nevada and I have had spirited \ndebate, but we are not expanding nuclear energy because we cannot \naddress what to do with the waste. Twenty percent of our power comes \nfrom nuclear. We have not built a new coal-fired plant since the mid-\n1990s. You cannot get a permit. We are talking of taking down hydro \ndams because of the environmentalists, but\n\n[[Page S9442]]\n\nthere is a tradeoff, as the occupant of the Chair from Oregon knows--\nputting the traffic off the barges on to the highways. There is a \ntradeoff.\n  If we take no hydro, no coal, no nuclear, no more imports of oil, \nwhere does it go? It goes to natural gas. What about natural gas, the \ncleanest fuel? Ten months ago, it was $2.16 per 1,000 cubic feet; \ndeliveries in November of $5.42--more than double. Where are we going \nfor energy? We are going to natural gas. That is the next train wreck \ncoming in this country. It will be severe. Fifty percent of the homes \nin this country heat by natural gas--56 million homes. Heating bills \nare going to be 40-percent higher in the Midwest this winter. We have a \ndifferent problem on the east coast where we don't have natural gas. \nThe train wreck is coming.\n  When I hear these ludicrous statements, this thing is garbage, it is \ntotally inaccurate. It says:\n\n       The oil industry's definition of ``environmentally \n     sensitive'' also differs quite radically from yours and mine. \n     How can thousands of caribou, polar grizzly bear, eagles, \n     birds and other species who survive in what has been dubbed \n     ``America's Serengeti''. . . .\n\n  If you haven't been up there, this coastal plain is pretty much the \nsame all over. It is beautiful, it is unique. But it has some activity \nwith the villages and the radar sites, and you wouldn't know where you \nwere along this coastal plain because it is all the same.\n  They talk about dozens of oil fields. They say the road and pipelines \nwould stop the movement of wildlife from one part of the habitat to \nanother, toxic waste would leak. Let me show something about the \nwildlife up here: This is Prudhoe Bay, and this is the wildlife. These \nare not stuffed dummies, these are live caribou. They are wandering \naround because nobody is shooting them. Nobody is running them down \nwith snow machines. This is Prudhoe Bay. We can do this in other areas \nof Alaska.\n  According to the Wilderness Society, rivers, streambeds, key habitat \nfor wildlife, will be stripped by millions of tons of gravel roads. Let \nme show a little bit about the technology today because it is \ndifferent. America should wake up and recognize this. This is a drill \npad in the Arctic today. There are no gravel roads. We have ice and \nsnow 9 months of the year. This is an ice road. That is the well.\n  Let me show the same place in the summertime, during the short \nsummer, which is 2\\1/2\\ months or thereabouts. This is after moving the \nrig. There is the Christmas tree; there is the tundra. Do you see any \nmarks? Do you see any gravel roads? Do you see pipelines? No, we have \nthe technology, we can do it right. We could if the environmental \ncommunity would meet its responsibilities. As we look for sources of \nenergy, particularly oil, do we want to get it from the rain forests of \nColombia where nobody gives a rat's concern about the environment? They \njust want the oil and to get it at any price, lay a pipeline anywhere.\n  Do you want to do it right here at home? I think it is time to come \nto grips with these folks and ask them to stand behind their \nassertions. They talk about millions of piles of gravel. We don't have \nto do that anymore. They are talking about the living quarters of \nthousands of workers and air pollution and death for the stunning \nanimals. They talk about the polar bear. The polar bear don't den on \nland, they den on the ice.\n  I could go right down the list and state what is wrong with this \nthing. It is irresponsible. They finish by saying it is a 90-day supply \nof oil. That is just not accurate. It is not factual. The reality is, \nif given the opportunity, we can turn this country around, keep these \njobs home.\n  I am going to tell you, one of the problems, of course, is with our \nrefining capacity because we are going to have to increase that. The \nassertion is that some of these refineries were closed prior to the \nClinton-Gore administration. That is fine. But what have we done to \nincrease the refining capacity? Refining capacity has increased by less \nthan 1 percent while demand has increased 14 percent in this country. \nWhat are the causes of price hikes? Let's go to EPA. We have nine \ngeographical regions in this country that require reformulated gas. I \nam not going to question the merits of that, but I can tell you the \nsame gas in Springfield, IL, can't be used in Chicago. It costs more. \nIs it necessary? I don't know, but it costs more because you have to \nbatch it.\n  We have talked about President Clinton's veto of ANWR 6 years ago, \nand what it would do. We are addressing the national security of this \ncountry as we look at depleting our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It \namazes me that nobody is upset about our increased dependence on oil \nfrom Iraq, 750,000 barrels a day. Saddam Hussein finishes every speech: \n``Death to Israel.'' If there was ever a threat to Israel's national \nsecurity, it is Saddam Hussein. He is developing a missile capability, \nbiological capability--what is it for? Well, it is not for good things.\n  As a consequence of that, we are seeing our Nation's increased \nreliance on crude oil and refined product, increased vulnerability to \nsupply interruptions, and we are pulling down our reserves, and the \nadministration says it is doing something about it. But I would like to \nknow what. It vetoed ANWR, the opening of ANWR. It says we will get a \nlittle bit out of SPR. It says we have a problem here, we have a \nproblem there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, here are the Iraqi oil exports into the \nUnited States. They have gone up. Let me show some more charts because \npictures are worth a thousand words. People say we have to concern \nourselves with the issue of the porcupine caribou herd. This is ANWR, \nCanada. This is the Demster Highway. These are oil wells drilled in \nCanada. These in the light color were drilled. They didn't find any \noil, but this is the route of the caribou. They have gone through this \narea. They cross the Demster Highway with no problem at all. The \ncaribou calve--where do they calve? Sometimes they calve in ANWR, \nsometimes they do not. We are not going to have any oil development in \nthe summertime in the calving area.\n  This is what it is like over in Iraq. This is what it was like during \nthe Persian Gulf war. There we are trying to clean up the mess caused \nby Saddam Hussein. That is the guy we are helping to support today, now \nwith biological capabilities.\n  There are a couple of more points I wish to make. Talk about \ncompatibility, here is something I think is fairly compatible. This \nshows a couple of guys out for a walk--3 bears. Why are they walking on \nthe pipeline? The pipeline is warm. This is in the Prudhoe Bay oil \nfield. Nobody is shooting those guys. They are happy. They walk over.\n  I can remember 15 years ago when they said: You build that pipeline \nand you are going to cut the State in half. The caribou, the moose will \nnever go over from the other side. It just did not happen. It will not \nhappen because these guys are compatible with the environment, as long \nas you don't harm them, chase them, run them down and so forth.\n  We have a lot of things going here, given the opportunity. If these \nMembers would go back, if you will, to your environmental critics and \nsay: What do you suggest? Can American technology overcome, if you \nwill, our environmental obligation? Can we open up this area safely? Do \nwe have the science and technology? There is nothing to suggest that we \ndo not have that capability.\n  This is where we are getting our oil from now, with no environmental \nconscience about how they are getting it out of the ground. That is \nirresponsible on their part.\n  I am going to leave you with one thought. Here are the people with \nwhom I am concerned. Those are the people who live in my State. This is \nin a small village. These are the kids walking down the street. It is \nsnowing, it is cold, it is tough. It is a tough environment.\n  One of my friends, Oliver Leavitt, spoke about life in Barrow. That \nis at the top of the world, right up here. You can't go any further \nnorth or you fall off the top. He said I could come to the DIA school \nto keep warm because the first thing I did every morning was go out on \nthe beach and pick up the driftwood. Of course, there are no trees. The \ndriftwood has to come down the river.\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\n  Jacob Adams said:\n\n       I love life in the Arctic but it's harsh, expensive, and \n     for many, short. My people want decent homes, electricity and \n     education. We do not want to be undisturbed. Undisturbed \n     means abandoned. It means sod huts and deprivation.\n\n  The native people of the Coastal Plain are asking for the same right \nof the Audubon Society of Louisiana, the same right this administration \nitself is supporting in the Russian Arctic Circle, and the same right \nthe Gwich'ins had in 1984 when they offered to lease their lands.\n  The oil companies should have bought it. There just wasn't any oil \nthere.\n  I recognize the public policy debate about this issue is complex and \nwill involve issues at the heart of the extreme environmental agenda \nwhich is driving our energy policy. It certainly is not relieving it.\n  At the same time, I think the issue can be framed simply as: Is it \nbetter to give the Inupiat people, the people of the Arctic, this \nright?\n  These people live up here. This is an Eskimo village. There is the \nvillage. Do you want to give them the right, while promoting a strong \ndomestic energy policy that safeguards our environment and our national \nsecurity, rather than rely on the likes of Saddam Hussein to supply the \nenergy?\n  The answer in my mind is clear, as well as in the minds of the \nAlaskans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9443-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, the Senate has just concluded its fourth \nvote in favor of the bill expanding H-1B visas that America grants each \nyear to people from other countries to work in certain specialty \noccupations. I supported the bill on each of these votes.\n  But I rise today to express how strongly I oppose the manner in which \nthe majority leader has sought to constrain this debate. I oppose the \nway in which the majority leader sought, on that bill, as with so many \nothers, to prevent Senators from offering amendments. And I oppose the \nmajority leader's effort to stifle debate by repeatedly filing cloture \non the bill.\n\n  Through his extreme use of cloture and of filling the amendment tree, \nI'm afraid the majority leader has reduced the Senate to a shadow of \nits proper self. And the result has been a Senate whose legislative \naccomplishments are as insubstantial as a shadow. This body cannot long \nexist as merely a shadow Senate.\n  Yesterday, as he brushed aside calls that the Senate vote on minimum \nwage or a patient's bill of rights, the majority leader complained that \nthe Senate had already voted on those matters. But the Senate has, as \nyet, failed to enact those matters, and the people who sent us here \nhave a right to hold Senators accountable.\n  And what's more, by blocking amendments, the majority leader has also \nblocked Senate consideration and votes on a number of issues that have \nbeen the subject of no votes in the Senate this year. Let me take a few \nmoments to address two of them, the reform of soft money in political \ncampaigns, and the indefensible practice of racial profiling.\n  Let me begin my discussion of these two items that the Senate was not \nallowed to take up--campaign finance and racial profiling--by \ndiscussing how those matters relate to what the Senate did take up--the \nH-1B visa bill.\n  The proponents of the H-1B bill characterize it as a necessity for \nour high tech future. It is both more and less than that.\n  But in a sense, the high-tech industry is certainly a large part of \nthe reason why the Senate considered H-1B legislation these past two \nweeks. I would assert, that there is a high degree of correlation \nbetween the items that come up on the floor of the United States Senate \nand the items advocated by the moneyed interests that make large \ncontributions to political campaigns.\n  American Business for Legal Immigration, a coalition which formed to \nfight for an increase in H-1B visas, offers a glimpse of the financial \nmight behind proponents of H-1Bs. As I've said, I am not opposed to \nraising the level of H-1B visas. But I do think it's appropriate, from \ntime to time, when the weight of campaign contributions appears to warp \nthe legislative process, to Call the Bankroll to highlight what wealthy \ninterests seeking to influence this debate have given to parties and \ncandidates.\n  ABLI is chock full of big political donors, Mr. President, and not \njust from one industry, but from several different industries that have \nan interest in bringing more high-tech workers into the U.S. I'll just \ngive my colleagues a quick sampling of ABLI's membership and what they \nhave given so far in this election cycle. All the donors I'm about to \nmention are companies that rank among the top employers of H-1B workers \nin the U.S., according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  These figures are through at least the first 15 months of the \nelection cycle, and in some cases include contributions given more \nrecently in the cycle:\n  Price Waterhouse Coopers, the accounting and consulting firm, has \ngiven more than $297,000 in soft money to the parties and more than \n$606,000 in PAC money candidates so far in this election cycle.\n  Telecommunications giant Motorola and its executives have given more \nthan $70,000 in soft money and more than $177,000 in PAC money during \nthe period.\n  And of course ABLI is comprised of giants in the software industry, \nwho have also joined in the political money game.\n  The software company Oracle and its executives have given more than \n$536,000 in soft money during the period, and its PAC has given $45,000 \nto federal candidates.\n  Executives of Cisco Systems have given more than $372,000 in soft \nmoney since the beginning of this election cycle.\n  And Microsoft gave very generously during the period, with more than \n$1.7 million in soft money and more than half a million in PAC money.\n  But I should also point out, Mr. President, that the lobbying on this \nissue is hardly one sided.\n  Many unions are lobbying against it, including the Communication \nWorkers of America, which gave $1.9 million in soft money during the \nperiod, including two donations of a quarter of a million dollars last \nyear. And CWA's PAC gave more than $960,000 to candidates during the \nperiod.\n  The lobbying group Federation for American Immigration Reform, or \n``FAIR,'' has lobbied furiously against this bill with a print, radio \nand television campaign, which has cost somewhere between $500,000 and \n$1 million, according to an estimate in Roll Call.\n  This is standard procedure these days for wealthy interests--you have \nto pay to play on the field of politics. You have got to pony up for \nquarter-million dollar soft money contributions and half-million dollar \nissue ad campaigns, and anyone who cannot afford the price of admission \nis going to be left out in the cold.\n  Thus, I believe that campaign finance is very much tied up in why the \nSenate considered the H-1B bill these past two weeks. I believe that \ncampaign finance is very much tied up in why the Senate considered the \nH-1B bill under the tortured circumstances that it did. This is just \nanother reason why I believe that this Senate must consider and vote on \namendments that deal with campaign finance reform.\n  The momentum is building on campaign finance reform. In recent days, \nmore and more candidates have offered to swear off soft money and have \ncalled for commitments from their opponents\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\nto do without soft money in their campaigns. More and more candidates \nare coming to the realization that taking soft money is a political \nliability. The days of soft money are numbered, and this shadow Senate \ncannot long hide from the political reality.\n  Beyond that subject, there are other important subjects that the \nmajority leader is blocking with his heavy-handed tactics. The Senate \nmay just have considered a bill dealing with immigrants, but the Senate \nhas thus far failed to consider a discussion of a particular injustice \nthat could well affect their lives, as well.\n  The INS's May report showed that most of those for whom they approved \nH-1B visas during the period for which data were available came here \nfrom countries of the developing world. As a large number of those \nreceiving H-1B visas are people of color, many could become subject to \nthe indefensible practice of racial profiling.\n  If this Senate can find the time to consider H-1B legislation, I \nbelieve that it should also find the time to consider an amendment that \naddresses the issue of racial profiling.\n  Let me begin my discussion of racial profiling by acknowledging the \nleadership of Congressman John Conyers and our friend in this body, \nSenator Frank Lautenberg, the principal authors of the legislation to \naddress this very real problem.\n  The problem is this: Millions of African Americans, Hispanic \nAmericans, immigrants, and other Americans of racial or ethnic minority \nbackgrounds who drive on our Nation's streets and highways are subject \nto being stopped for no apparent reason other than the color of their \nskin.\n  This practice, known as racial profiling, targets drivers for \nheightened scrutiny or harassment because of the color of their skin. \nSome call it ``DWB,'' ``Driving While Black,'' or ``Driving While \nBrown.'' Of course, not all or even most law enforcement officers \nengage in this terrible practice. The vast majority of our men and \nwomen in blue are honorable people who fulfill their duties without \nengaging in racial profiling, but the experience of many Americans of \ncolor has demonstrated that the practice is very real.\n  There are some law enforcement agencies or officers in our country \nwho have decided that if you are a person of color, you are more likely \nto be trafficking drugs or engaged in other illegal activities than a \nwhite person, despite statistical evidence to the contrary. In a May \n1999 report, the American Civil Liberties Union reported that along I-\n95 in Maryland, while only roughly 17 percent of the total drivers and \ntraffic violators were African American, an astonishing 73 percent of \nthe drivers searched were African American. The legislation that \nSenator Lautenberg and I have sponsored would allow us to get an even \nbetter picture.\n  In America, all should have the right to travel from place to place \nfree of this unjustified government harassment. None should have to \nendure this incredibly humiliating experience--and sometimes even a \nphysically threatening one--on the roadsides or in the backseat of \npolice cruisers.\n  This practice also damages the trust between law enforcement and the \ncommunity. Where can people of color turn for help when they believe \nthat the men and women in uniform cannot be trusted? As one Hispanic-\nAmerican testified earlier this year in Glencoe, IL, after his family \nexperienced racial profiling, ``Who is there left to protect us? The \npolice just violated us.''\n  Racial profiling chips away at the important trust that law \nenforcement agencies take great pains to develop with the community. \nWhen that trust is broken, it can lead to an escalation of tensions \nbetween the police and the community. It can lead to detrimental \neffects on our criminal justice system--like jury nullification and the \nfailure to convict criminals at all--because some in the communities no \nlonger believes the police officer on the witness stand. Racial \nprofiling is bad policing, and it has a ripple effect whose \nconsequences are only beginning to be felt.\n\n  In just the last year and a half, since we introduced the traffic \nstops statistics study bill, we have already seen increased awareness \nof this problem in the law enforcement community, and an increased \nwillingness to address it. A growing number of police departments are \nbeginning to collect traffic stops data voluntarily. Over 100 law \nenforcement agencies nationwide--including State police agencies like \nthe Michigan State Police--have now decided to collect data \nvoluntarily. Eleven State legislatures have passed data collection \nbills in the last year or so. This is tremendous progress from where we \nwere when the bill was introduced. I applaud those states and I applaud \nlaw enforcement agencies that are collecting data on their own.\n  But these State and local efforts underscore the need for a Federal \nrole in collecting and analyzing traffic stops data to give Congress \nand the public a national picture of the extent of the racial profiling \nproblem and lay the groundwork for national solutions to end this \nhorrendous practice. While we can applaud individual states and law \nenforcement agencies for taking action, combating racial discrimination \nis one area where a Federal role is essential. Our citizens have a \nright to expect us to act.\n  I am pleased to have joined my distinguished colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, in introducing S. 821, a companion bill to \nthe bill introduced in the House by Representatives John Conyers and \nRobert Menendez. The bill would require the Attorney General to conduct \nan initial analysis of existing data on racial profiling and then \ndesign a study to gather data from a nationwide sampling of \njurisdictions.\n  This is a straightforward bill that requires only that the Attorney \nGeneral conduct a study. It doesn't tell police officers how to do \ntheir jobs. And it doesn't mandate data collection by police \ndepartments. The Attorney General's sampling study would be based on \ndata collected from police departments that voluntarily agree to \nparticipate in the Justice Department study.\n  I cannot emphasize enough that this traffic stops study bill is a \ntruly modest proposal. Some would even say it's a conservative \nproposal. The American people have become so much more aware of the \nissue over the last year, and so many law enforcement agencies and \nState governments have expressed interest in addressing the issue, that \nmany people are now saying that a study bill does not go far enough. \nThey argue that we have enough data; we know racial profiling exists; \nwe do not need to study it more; let's just end it. I understand this \nsentiment. This is a modest, reasonable proposal that, I hope, will lay \nthe groundwork for developing ways to end racial profiling once and for \nall.\n  Only last month, the son of the great civil rights leader Martin \nLuther King Jr. led a march on the Lincoln Memorial to commemorate his \nfather's legacy. His father inspired a nation 37 years ago when he \nsaid, in words that echoed throughout the world and have been etched in \nhistory, that he had a dream that one day racial justice would flow \nlike a mighty river. Sadly, our Nation has not fulfilled that dream. As \nMartin Luther King III noted, racial profiling continues to harm \nAmericans and erodes the important trust that should exist between law \nenforcement and the people they serve and protect.\n  President Clinton has endorsed S. 821, and last June he directed \nfederal law enforcement agencies to begin collecting and reporting data \non the race, ethnicity and gender of the people they stop and search at \nour Nation's borders and airports. A coalition of civil rights and law \nenforcement organizations--including the ACLU, the NAACP, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, and the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives--also support this legislation. I am pleased \nthat 20 Senators have joined to cosponsor the bill, and I am hopeful \nthat if allowed to come to a vote, my amendment would enjoy broad \nsupport. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill by voice \nvote in the 105th Congress, and this March, the House Judiciary \nCommittee passed the bill again. It's time we passed it in the Senate, \ntoo.\n  Racial profiling and soft money campaign finance reform are issues \nthat deserve consideration in the Senate. Regrettably, the procedures \nthat the majority leader employed to consider the H-1B bill and too \nmany other bills have so far blocked their consideration. Before this \nSenate adjourns sine die, I\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\nhope that we will have an opportunity to address these, and many other \nissues that demand attention. If it fails to, this Senate's mark in \nhistory will be no more permanent than a shadow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, March 16, 2001, will mark the 250th \nanniversary of the birth of James Madison, who clearly earned the \ntitle: Father of our Constitution.\n  This great American devoted his life to the service of his country \nand his fellow man, and that service played an essential role in \ncreating and protecting the constitutional liberty that we enjoy today.\n  Accordingly, I intend to offer the bipartisan James Madison \nCommemoration Commission Act to celebrate the life and contributions of \nthis small man who was a giant of liberty.\n  James Madison was born on March 16, 1751 in Port Conway, VA. He was \nraised at Montpelier, his family's estate in Orange County, VA. He \nattended the College of New Jersey, now known as Princeton University, \nwhere he excelled academically and graduated in 1771. Shortly after his \ngraduation, Madison embarked on a legal career. In 1774, at the age of \n23, Madison entered political life. He was first elected to the Orange \nCounty Committee of Safety. Following that, he was elected as delegate \nto the Constitutional Convention of Virginia in 1776. He next served as \na member of the Continental Congress from 1780 to 1783. This provided \nhim marvelous insight into the nature of our early American government \nand ideals.\n  After America won its freedom at Yorktown, the country looked to \nstrengthen the government that had proven too helpless under the \nArticles of Confederation. A Constitutional Convention was called in \nPhiladelphia. It was here that Madison was to play the most important \nrole of his life, dwarfing, in my view, his subsequent excellent \nservice to his country.\n  From 1784 to 1786, Madison was a member of the Constitutional \nConvention. He served as a primary draftsman of the Constitution. \nThomas Jefferson, who was in France at the time, and who did not \nparticipate in the Constitutional Convention, did suggest a number of \nbooks that would aid the young draftsman in preparing for his historic \ntask. With these books and others, Madison engaged in an extensive \nstudy of the ancient governments of Greece and Rome and of the more \nmodern governments of Italy and England, among others. No one came to \nPhiladelphia so intentionally, practically, and historically prepared \nto create a new government.\n  Madison posed his task as follows:\n\n       If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If \n     angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government which is to be administered by men over men, the \n     great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and in the next place, \n     oblige it to control itself.\n\n  This he wrote in Federalist No. 51.\n  At the convention, delegates made impassioned arguments regarding the \nrelative powers of big States, small States, Northern States, Southern \nStates, and there were those who feared that a strong national \ngovernment might dominate all States. In month after month of untiring \nargument, careful persuasion, and creative compromise, Madison reached \nanswers upon which the delegates could agree. There would be a Federal \nGovernment of separated and enumerated powers. Large States would have \ntheir votes based on population in the House of Representatives. Small \nStates would have equal, two-vote, representation in this body, the \nSenate.\n  Further, the powers of the Federal Government would be limited to \nenumerated objects in order to protect all the States from Federal \noverreaching. Madison described the Federal Republic, states and \nfederal governments, that the Constitution envisioned as follows:\n\n       In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered \n     by the people is first divided between two distinct \n     governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided \n     among distinct and separate departments. Hence a double \n     security arises to the rights of the people. The different \n     governments will control each other, at the same time that \n     each will be controlled by itself.\n\n  He was writing that in Federalist No. 51.\n  In addition to playing a leading role in framing this new government, \nMadison also made detailed notes on the proceedings of the \nConstitutional Convention. Madison's notes on the Constitutional \nConvention have proven the most extensive and accurate account of how \nour Founding Fathers framed the greatest form of government in the \nhistory of mankind.\n  Once the Constitutional Convention reached an agreement, the States \nhad to ratify the Constitution and make it binding fundamental law. \nMadison contributed to that fight for ratification in three ways. It \nwas a critical, tough fight.\n  First, he joined with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in drafting the \nFederalist Papers which were circulated among New York newspapers under \nthe pseudonym Publius.\n  These papers contained perhaps the most vivid and profound pages of \npractical political philosophy ever produced. They answered with force \nand eloquence the arguments of the anti-federalists and helped sway \npublic opinion toward ratification.\n  Second, Madison fought in the Virginia ratification convention for \nthe adoption of the Constitution.\n  It was critical that Virginia ratify the Constitution. Joining with \nJohn Marshall, the future great Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, \nMadison argued against the fiery orator, Patrick Henry. Henry, who \nargued so forcefully for declaring independence from Great Britain, \ncharged that the new Constitution would vest too much power in the \nFederal Government. Madison countered that the powers of the Federal \nGovernment would be limited to enumerated objects and subject to the \ncontrol of people.\n  Third, Madison helped to develop the Bill of Rights which limited the \npower\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\nof the Federal Government further and ensured the power of the states \nand the liberty of the people. He was a critical drafter in the \ndevelopment of the Bill of Rights.\n  Madison's herculean efforts, along with the efforts of others, \nresulted in the ratification of the Constitution with a Bill of Rights. \nThis constitutional government enabled a fledgling democracy to grow \ninto the most powerful force for liberty the world has ever known. He \nwas the right man at the right time.\n  Notwithstanding Madison's intellectual prowess and the thoughtful, \nreflective approach he brought to problem-solving, humility was the \nhallmark of this man. In later years, when he was referred to as the \nFather of the Constitution, Madison modestly protested that the \ndocument was not ``the offspring of a single brain'' but ``the work of \nmany heads and many hands.'' It was true, but it was done under his \nnurturing care.\n  After Madison's service at the Constitutional Convention, he served \nin the U.S. House of Representatives for four terms. When Thomas \nJefferson was elected President in 1801, he selected Madison to serve \nas his Secretary of State.\n  At the conclusion of Jefferson's administration, the American people \ntwice elected James Madison President of the United States. As \nPresident, he watched over the very government he played such a crucial \nrole in creating. And his steady leadership in the War of 1812 against \nGreat Britain helped guide America to victory.\n  While these accomplishments are remarkable indeed, the really \nremarkable thing is the enduring nature of Madison's imprint on \nAmerican history. Amended only 17 times after its ratification with the \nBill of Rights, the Constitution that Madison drafted still provides \nthe same basic structure upon which our government operates today and \nthat we comply with every day in this body.\n  The Supreme Court still quotes the Federalist Papers that Madison \ndrafted. And Madison's concept of federalism is the subject of renewed \ndebate in the Supreme Court and Congress at this time.\n  The Constitution that Madison drafted, and his writings that have \nguided generations of Americans in interpreting that Constitution, are \nstill the envy of the world. Madison's wisdom and foresight have been \nproven by the indisputable success of the American constitutional \nexperiment. Indeed, while we are a young country, this nation has the \noldest continuous written Constitution in the world. It is a beacon and \nexample for others. Many try and are not able to make it work, but they \nhave modeled their constitutions so often after ours.\n  Why has it worked? Because Madison understood that the law must be \nsuited to the people it is intended to govern. In Federalist No. 51, \nMadison stated:\n\n       What is government itself but the greatest of all \n     reflections on human nature?\n\n  And a constitution that protects liberty is suited to a people who \nlove liberty to the extent that they are willing to fight and die for \nit.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with great pride that I join with other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, including Senators Byrd, Thurmond, \nMoynihan, Warner, and Robb, to offer at the appropriate time, this bill \nestablishing the James Madison Commemoration Commission. The Commission \nwill celebrate the 250th anniversary of James Madison's birth on March \n16, 2001.\n  The commission will consist of 19 members: The Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the \nSpeaker and Minority Leader of the House, the Chairmen and Ranking \nMembers of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, two Members of \nthe Senate selected by the Majority Leader, two Members of the Senate \nselected by the Minority Leader, two Members of the House of \nRepresentatives selected by the Speaker, two Members of the House of \nRepresentatives selected by the Minority Leader of the House, and two \nmembers of the Executive Branch selected by the President. A person not \nable to serve may designate a substitute. Members will be chosen based \non their position at the end of the 106th Congress and will continue to \nserve until the expiration of the Commission.\n  The bill will also create an Advisory Committee with 14 members, \nincluding: the Archivist of the United States, the Secretary of the \nSmithsonian Institute, the Executive Director of Montpelier, the \nPresident of James Madison University, the Director of the James \nMadison Center, the President of the James Madison Memorial Fellowship \nFoundation, 2 persons who are not Members of Congress selected by the \nmajority leader of the Senate, with expertise on the legal and \nhistorical significance of James Madison, 2 persons who are not Members \nof Congress, selected by the minority leader of the Senate, 2 persons \nwho are not Members of Congress, selected by the Speaker of the House, \nand 2 persons who are not Members of Congress, selected by the minority \nleader of the House.\n  With the aid of the Advisory Committee, the Commission will:\n  1. Publish a collection of Madison's most important writings and \ntributes to Madison;\n  2. Coordinate and plan a symposium to provide a better understanding \nof Madison's contributions to American political culture;\n  3. Recognize other events celebrating Madison's life and \ncontributions;\n  4. Accept essay papers from students on Madison's life and \ncontributions and award certificates as appropriate; and\n  5. Bestow honorary memberships on the Commission and the Advisory \nCommittee.\n  The bill authorizes $250,000 for the Commission. This will be used \nfor the expenses of publishing the book and hosting a symposium.\n  The Commission will expire after its work is done in 2001.\n  Mr. President, I believe this work is truly important to our country. \nI ask all my colleagues--and we have had a growing number of \nindividuals who have joined as co-sponsors of this bill--to join in \nthis effort to commemorate the Father of our Constitution and perhaps \nthe greatest practical political scientist who ever lived, James \nMadison.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to gain Senator Sessions as \na cosponsor of the James Madison Commemoration Commission Act. It is \nappropriate that we honor James Madison for his exemplary contributions \nto our country.\n  The Commission will build on the success of the James Madison \nFellowship Foundation, which Senator Hatch and I cochair. We are very \nproud of the work of the Madison Fellows. They are among the most \naccomplished, talented, and dedicated educators in the Nation. They are \ncommitted to educating children across the country about the value of \nlearning, the importance of the Constitution, and the significance of \npublic service.\n  I hope that this new Commission honoring James Madison will breathe \nnew life into the Constitution for people across the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9447-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9447-S9449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         STEM CELL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was not on the floor a few moments ago \nwhen the distinguished majority leader and the assistant leader for the \nDemocrats had a colloquy when the majority leader propounded a \nunanimous consent request concerning legislation on stem cells. I think \nit useful to make a brief comment or two and then to have, if I might, \na brief discussion with the majority leader about what will happen on \nthe future of the bill.\n  The stem cell legislation in question would eliminate the prohibition \nnow in effect which limits the use of Federal funds, principally from \nthe National Institutes of Health, from paying for extracting stem \ncells from embryos. Once the stem cells have been extracted from \nembryos, then Federal funds may be used on their research, and private \nfunds--if I might have the attention of the majority leader for a \nmoment while we discuss the stem cell issue, as to what is going to \nhappen next. Without describing the legislation--which I can in a \nminute--I ask the distinguished majority leader what he anticipates in \nthe future.\n  When this issue to eliminate the limitation on funding was stricken \nfrom the appropriations bill last year, it was done so after I \nconsulted with the majority leader because concluding it would have \nresulted in a filibuster and\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\ntied up that appropriations bill. The majority leader made a \ncommitment, which he has fulfilled today, to bring the bill to the \nfloor.\n  It had been my hope that we would have had the bill on the floor at \nan earlier time, but I fully understand the complexities of the \nschedule; and once we had reached September, the only way to deal with \nthe matter was on a limited time agreement to be obtained through \nunanimous consent.\n  So it is my hope that the intent and the thrust of what was \nproposed--I think intended--was that that the bill would be on the \ncalendar and considered when we reconvened, when it would not have to \nbe subjected to a unanimous consent request, but it might have to pass \na filibuster vote on a motion to proceed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Pennsylvania will yield, \nlet me acknowledge the fact that the Senator from Pennsylvania did \nagree at a critical moment last year to remove this issue from the \nLabor-HHS-Education appropriations bill so we could complete it. It was \nclearly one of the difficulties we were having in wrapping up the \nsession.\n  I committed at that time that we would make an effort to get it up \nthis year and that I would do that. We probably should have made this \neffort earlier. I owe him an apology for not doing that. Let me say, in \nrecent days we have tried to clear it. There is objection to it. I \nbelieved it was important that I go ahead and make that request \npublicly because we made that commitment to the Senator.\n  I know how strongly the Senator from Pennsylvania feels about this \nissue, and a lot of other people feel very strongly about it. I know we \nhad some testimony on it within the last couple of weeks in the Senate. \nThere are strong and passionate feelings about it on both sides in \nterms of what it can do for some health problems, and there are others \nwho obviously think this is an improper use. I am sure it will be a \ngood debate whenever it is debated and wherever it is debated. I will \nwork with the Senator next year to try to get it up earlier in the \nsession. Before I make a commitment at this time that I will file \ncloture, I have to make sure it will not fall through and I can keep \nthat commitment.\n  But I will work with him to see that he gets a shot at it. He always \nhas the opportunity to offer amendments on bills that come along. There \nis not just one way to get it done. I do believe I owe him a commitment \nto keep working with him. Even though I don't necessarily agree with \nhim on the substance, I think on the procedure I have an obligation to \nkeep a commitment to help him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his statement. I appreciate his last statement that he doesn't \nnecessarily agree with me, which leaves some room that he doesn't \nnecessarily disagree with me. I am not looking for a response at this \ntime. Senator Lott is well known to have an open mind on controversial \nissues and on matters not debated. I agree with him when he says it is \nsubject to passionate feelings on both sides.\n  We had debates and witnesses. We had seven hearings on this issue. We \nhad Senator Brownback, the principal opponent of the legislation, to \ntestify, and Congressman Jay Dickey, the principal opponent of the \nlegislation in the House, to testify.\n  The hearings have always been balanced, and we have had people who \nhave opposed the legislation at every one of the hearings.\n  It is a matter which is appropriate for the Senate to consider. I \nappreciate what the majority leader has said about giving consideration \nto an early listing next year, and not making a commitment on pressing \na cloture motion. I think a cloture motion could be filed by any 17 \nSenators. But we are not going to get involved in that at this time.\n  But I did want to say for the Record why I believe it is important \nthat the matter be considered. And it is because stem cells have such a \nremarkable opportunity to cure many of the most difficult maladies and \ndiseases which confront America and the world today. These stem cells \nhave the potential to be placed in the human body to replace other \ncells.\n  We had testimony, for example, from Michael J. Fox, who suffers from \nParkinson's. We had the experts testify that these stem cells could be \nenormously effective in curing Parkinson's. That is an obtainable goal \nperhaps in as early as 5 years.\n  The stem cells may also be useful on Alzheimer's disease, on strokes, \non spinal cord injuries, perhaps on cancer, and perhaps on heart \nailments.\n  There is virtually no limit to what these stem cells can do. They are \na veritable fountain of youth.\n  I have said publicly that I understand those on the other side of the \nissue. It involves taking an embryo which has been created for purposes \nof in vitro fertilization but not used. These embryos are discarded. \nThere are some 100,000 embryos in existence today which will not be \nused. So the issue is whether you simply discard these embryos which \nwill have no further effect, or whether you use these embryos to \nproduce stem cells which can cure many very serious maladies.\n  There are other alternatives such as adult stem cells. But the \nscientific evidence has been very compelling, in my judgment, that \nadult stem cells cannot do the job, but stem cells can from embryos.\n  There are also stem cells from fetal tissue. Those stem cells are \nlimited, and we really need the stem cells from these embryos to \nprovide the research opportunities to cure so many of these ailments.\n  This is not an issue which is going to lead to the creation of \nembryos for the purposes of extracting stem cells. When we have the \nfetal tissue discussion, many people are concerned that they will \nproduce more abortions to have fetal tissue available. In fact, that \nwas not the case--fetal tissue was used from abortions which would have \noccurred in any event.\n  It is not a controversial pro-life versus pro-choice issue as we have \nhad many Senators who are strongly pro-life support stem cell research \nin this legislation. Senator Strom Thurmond, who is very strongly pro-\nlife and an acknowledged very conservative Senator, testified before \nthe subcommittee in favor of this legislation to have Federal funding \nfor extraction of stem cells from embryos.\n\n  Senator Connie Mack of Florida has spoken about this bill, another \npro-life Senator speaking in favor of it. Very strong statements have \ncome from Senator Gordon Smith, who is pro-life and very concerned \nabout these underlying issues, as to why he feels the balance is in \nfavor of this sort of legislation.\n  Since the issue was mentioned and there is not another Senator on the \nfloor seeking recognition, I thought I would explain in abbreviated \nform where this legislation is pending, and why I have been pressing. \nIt comes naturally within the subcommittee of appropriations which I \nchair.\n  The prohibition against use of Federal funds to extract stem cells \nfrom embryos was placed in a bill which came out of this subcommittee. \nWhen the prohibition was imposed, there was no one who really knew the \nmiraculous potential of stem cells, it being a veritable fountain of \nyouth. This only came into existence with the research disclosed in \nNovember of 1998. Since that time, our subcommittee has had seven \nhearings to explore the issue very fully.\n  It is my hope that the matter will come before the Senate early next \nyear. I appreciate what the majority leader has had to say. We will let \nthe Senate work its will. Let us consider it. Let us debate it. Let us \nanalyze it and come to judgment on it, which is our role as \nlegislators, in a way which considers all of the claims and considers \nall of the positions but resolves the matter so that public policy will \nbe determined in accordance with our constitutional standards and our \nlegislative procedures.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  MR. GRAMS.

Mr. President, let me highlight our intent about how the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) should implement this \nlegislation with respect to physicians who seek H-1B visas. The INS \ncurrently requires that each applicant for an H-1B visa who wishes to \nwork as a physician must have passed the three parts of the United \nStates Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and, if required by the \nstate in which he or she will be practicing, be licensed. Due to the \nincreased number of physicians who may work in the U.S. under H-1B \nvisas with the passage of this legislation, it is even more important \nthat the INS confirm successful completion of all parts of the USMLE \neach time an individual physician applies for, or seeks renewal of, an \nH-1B visa.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our Nation's economy is experiencing a \ntime of unprecedented growth and prosperity. This strong economic \ngrowth can, in large measure, be traced to the vitality of the fast-\ngrowing high technology industry. Information technology, biotechnology \nand associated manufacturers have created more new jobs than any other \npart of the economy.\n  The rapid growth of the high-tech industry has made it the nation's \nthird largest employer, with 4.8 million workers in high-tech related \nfields, working in jobs that pay 70 percent above average income. The \nBureau of Labor Statistics projects that the number of core IT workers \nwill grow to a remarkable 2.6 million by 2006--an increase of 1.1 \nmillion from 1996.\n  With such rapid change, the economy is stretched thin to support \nthese new businesses and the growth opportunities they present. The \nconstraint cited most often on future growth of the high-technology \nindustry is the shortage of men and women with the skills and technical \nbackground needed for jobs in the industry. Several factors are \ncontributing to this shortage, including an inaccurate, negative image \nof IT occupations as overly demanding, the under-representation of \nwomen and minorities in the IT workforce, and outdated academic \ncurricula that often do not keep pace with industry needs.\n  All of us want to be responsive to the nation's need for high-tech \nworkers. We know that unless we take steps now to address this growing \nworkforce gap, America's technological and economic leadership will be \njeopardized. The H-1B visa cap should be increased, but in a way that \nbetter addresses the fundamental needs of the economy. Raising the cap \nwithout seriously addressing our long-term labor needs would be a \nserious mistake.\n  The legislation before us today includes provisions that respond to \nwhat American workers, students and employers have been telling \nCongress: that any credible legislative proposal must begin with a \nsignificant expansion of career training and educational opportunities \nfor our workers and students. Expanding the number of H-1B visas to \nmeet short-term needs is no substitute for long-term solutions to fully \ndevelop the potential of our domestic workforce. It makes sense to ask \nthat more of our workers be recruited and trained for these jobs.\n  I commend Senator Lieberman, Senator Conrad, and other colleagues for \ntheir valuable contributions to the proposed training provisions. The \ntraining provided will ensure that the H-1B program will provide our \nworkers with the skills needed to benefit from this growing economy and \nto help our companies continue to grow.\n\n\na reasonable increase in the h-1b visa cap is justified, but it must be \n temporary and sufficiently tailored to meet existing short-term needs\n\n  A temporary influx of foreign workers and students is needed in the \nshort-term to help meet the demands by U.S. firms for high skilled \nworkers. But we shouldn't count on foreign sources of labor as a long-\nterm solution. It is unfair to U.S. workers, and the supply of foreign \nworkers is limited.\n  It makes sense to insist that more of our domestic workers must be \nrecruited into and placed in these jobs. Countless reports cite age and \nrace discrimination as a major problem in the IT industry, along with \nthe hiring of foreign workers and lay-off of domestic workers.\n  A Dallas Morning News article describes how Ken Schiffman of Texas \nreceived only one or two responses to his resume over a long period of \ntime, until he deleted all direct and indirect references to his age. \nAfter that, he received 26 messages in one day. A human resource \nexecutive at a trade association confirms that this problem is a \nconstant issue. Employers often ask the age of an applicant and reject \nolder applicants without ever interviewing them.\n  John Miano, head of the American Programmer's Guild, argues that once \na worker is laid off, it is very difficult to find a new job, in \ncontrast to younger workers. Companies often unfairly view older \nworkers as ``dirty linen.'' These and countless other experiences \nsupport the need for a more responsible approach to H-1B legislation. \nAnd similar problems face women and minorities who are under-\nrepresented in the IT workforce.\n\n  Although many new jobs are created in the IT industry each year, we \nalso know that thousands of IT workers were laid off in 1999. For \nexample 5,180 workers lost their jobs at Electronic Data Systems, 2,150 \nat Compaq, and 3,000 at NEC-Packard Bell.\n  We also know that some IT companies classify their workers as \nindependent contractors or temporary workers, rather than as employees, \nto avoid paying them benefits. In fact, it has been said that ``if all \ncategories of contingent workers are included--temporary, part-time, \nself-employed, and contract workers--almost 40% of all employment in \nSilicon Valley are contingent workers.'' This mis-classification scheme \nalso contributes to numerous positions being seemingly ``unfilled,'' \nbecause official ``employees'' are not performing those functions. This \npractice perpetuates an artificially higher number of ``open'' \npositions than actually exist.\n  Although it makes sense to provide an increase in the H-1B cap \nthrough FY 2002, the unprecedented cap exemptions in the Hatch bill are \nunwarranted. Those exemptions would permit 40,000 workers above the \n195,000 cap to receive an H-1B visa. The resulting figure is well above \nthe number of visas that even the most ardent IT lobbyists claim are \nneeded. Exempting all those with advanced credentials will result in a \nsignificant increase in the number of persons within the cap who have \nless specialized skills, and who are in occupations ranging from \ntherapists to super models. This is not the direction in which the H-1B \nvisa program should be moving. The bill should not focus solely on the \nnumber of visas available for foreign skilled workers. It should also \nemphasize employers' needs for as many workers with the highest \nprofessional credentials as possible, who possess specialized skills \nthat cannot be easily and quickly reproduced domestically.\n  I am strongly in favor of supporting our institutions of higher \neducation and research groups. But the two types of exemptions in the \nbill overlap and are unnecessarily complex. The first exemption \naddresses a genuine need of universities who face difficulty competing \nwith the high tech industry for\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\nvisas. But universities and research organizations would be just as \neasily served by reserving for them 12,000 a year within the cap.\n  The second exemption is for students graduating in the U.S. with any \nadvanced degree, as long as they apply within a certain time frame. But \nit should not matter when they graduated or where they graduated. The \nexemptions will cause administrative problems that we should not impose \non INS.\n  Instead, we should ensure that workers with an advanced degree have \npriority for H-1B visas within the cap, and are subject to the same \nrequirements as all other applications. No evidence exists that proves \nor even implies that there is a shortage of American advanced degree \nholders in all subject areas. Yet the bill ignores this point and \nspecifically permits all foreign graduates to receive a visa.\n\n  The unprecedented exemptions contained in this bill will only add to \nthe already troublesome task faced by INS to process visas. We should \nnot make a bad situation for U.S. students and the INS even worse by \npassing this bill with the current exemptions.\n  The exemptions in the bill and the abundance of IT workers they would \ncreate are an irresponsible approach to increasing the cap, especially \ngiven the very real existing questions about the true extent of the IT \nskill shortage.\n  As we address the needs of the IT industry, in addition to raising \nthe H-1B visa cap, we must place laid off workers in new jobs, enforce \nour labor laws, and recruit and train more women, minorities, and \npeople with disabilities, so that the current IT workforce gets the \npay, benefits, working conditions and job opportunities to which they \nare entitled.\n\n\n EXPANDING JOB TRAINING FOR U.S. WORKERS IS CRITICAL AND PROVIDES THE \n             ONLY LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO THIS LABOR SHORTAGE\n\n  When we expanded the number of H-1B visas in 1998, we created a \nmodest training initiative funded by a modest visa fee in recognition \nof the need to train and update the skills of U.S. workers. Today, as \nwe seek to nearly double the number of high tech workers available to \nAmerican businesses, we must also ensure a significant expansion of \ncareer training and educational opportunities for American workers and \nstudents.\n  Now more than ever, the strong employer demand for high tech foreign \nworkers shows that there is an even greater need to train American \nworkers and prepare U.S. students for careers in information \ntechnology. Expanding the number of H-1B visas to meet short-term needs \nis no substitute for long-term solutions to fully develop the potential \nof our domestic workforce.\n  The magnitude of this need for training is increasing year after \nyear. According to the Information Technology Association of America, \nroughly two-thirds of unfilled jobs requiring workers with computer-\nrelated skills are for technical support staff, such as customer \nservice and help desks, database administrators, web designers, and \ntechnical writers. According to the survey's own description of these \noccupational fields, these positions simply require entry-level and \nmoderate-level skills. We clearly need to greatly accelerate training \nfor all skill levels, not just the most advanced level.\n  Recent studies have also demonstrated the strong correlation between \neducational attainment and increases in worker productivity. A year of \nstructured employer-directed training can also produce a substantial \nincrease in productivity.\n  Congress must help fund such efforts. We cannot turn our backs on \nAmerican workers and employers who need our help.\n  Many high-tech companies are investing significant resources in \neducation, and to a limited extent, in training programs. In reviewing \nthese examples, however, it is clear that the focus of their \ncontributions is on education, not worker training.\n  Thie effort does not come close to meeting the nation-wide need for \ninvestment in training. Only when businesses address the shortage of \nhighly skilled workers as a national problem with a national solution--\nrather than a company-by-company approach to worker training--will our \nworkforce be able to meet the growing demand for high skills, so that \nour economy will continue to prosper. The federal government has an \nobligation to bridge the high tech skill gap which today separates \nmillions of workers from the 21st century jobs they desire.\n\n\n           RAISING NECESSARY FUNDS FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\n  At a time when the IT industry is experiencing major growth and \nrecord profits, it is clear that even the smallest of businesses can \nafford to pay a higher fee in order to support needed investments in \ntechnology skills and education. The only effective way for Congress \nand industry to provide sufficient long-term solutions to the high-tech \nskills shortage is by increasing H-1B visa user fees. We should ensure \nthat 55% of all revenues go to worker training and increased \neducational opportunities for U.S. students.\n  We must train at least 45,000 workers a year if we are to responsibly \naddress the need for technological skills. Unfortunately, due to blue \nslip issues that would arise if the Senate were to propose an increase \nin H-1B fees, I will not be offering an amendment with such a \nprovision.\n  However, the Senate should send to the House a request for a modest \nincrease in the H-1B visa fees. An increase in H-1B funds collected is \nnecessary to expand training and education programs. A modest increase \nin the user fee will generate approximately $280 million each year \ncompared to current law, which raises less than one-third of this \namount. Revenues can be reasonably and fairly obtained by charging \n$1,000 per new visa, or visa extension, or request to change employers. \nAs in current law, employers from educational institutions and non-\nprofit and governmental research organizations should remain exempt \nfrom all fees.\n  This fee is fair. Immigrant families with very modest incomes were \nable to pay a $1,000 fee to allow family members to obtain green cards. \nCertainly, high tech companies can afford to pay at least that amount \nduring this prosperous economy.\n\n\n      PROVIDING STATE-OF-THE ART TRAINING FOR 46,000 U.S. WORKERS\n\n  With such a reasonable and fair fee structure, the training plan in \nthis amendment will receive roughly $154 million to substantially \nexpand the existing program to provide state-of-the-art high tech \ntraining for 46,000 workers a year, primarily in high tech, information \ntechnology, and biotechnology skills.\n  It requires the Department of Labor, in consultation with the \nDepartment of Commerce; to provide grants to local workforce investment \nboards in areas with substantial shortages of high tech workers. Grants \nwould be awarded on a competitive basis for innovative high tech \ntraining proposals developed by the workforce boards collaboratively \nwith area employers, unions, and higher education institutions.\n\n  The training proposal builds on the priorities specified in current \nH-1B law. It will serve those who are currently employed and are \nseeking to enhance their skills, as well as those who are currently \nunemployed.\n\n\n     educational opportunities for u.s. students must be increased\n\n  As we enter the 21st century, careers increasingly require advanced \ndegrees, especially in math, science, engineering, and computer \nsciences. Eight of the ten fastest growing jobs of the next decade will \nrequire college education or moderate to long-term training.\n  We must encourage students, including minority students, to pursue \ndegrees in math, science, computers, and engineering. Scholarship \nopportunities must be expanded for talented minority and low-income \nstudents whose families cannot afford today's high college tuition \ncosts. According to the National Action Council for Minorities in \nEngineering, minority retention rates tend to be higher at institutions \nwith high average financial aid awards, and the financial aid is a \nsignificant predictor in retaining minority students.\n  With increased opportunities for scholarships, students completing \ntwo-year degrees will be provided with incentives to continue their \neducation and obtain four-year degrees, and retention rates among four-\nyear degree students will be higher.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In sum, it would be irresponsible of Congress to address the shortage \nof high tech workers solely by expanding the number of visas for \nforeign workers. Immigration is only a short-term\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\nsolution to the long range, national skill shortage problem.\n  The U.S. is currently not providing domestic workers with enough \nopportunities to upgrade their skills so that they can fully \nparticipate in the new economy. They deserve these opportunities, and \nAmerican business needs their talents.\n  I commend Senators Hatch and Abraham for agreeing to include these \ntraining provisions in the bill before us today, and for committing to \nhelp bridge the high tech skills gap.\n\n\n congress must reject the view that the only pro-immigrant agenda this \n                       session is an h-1b agenda\n\n  Finally, Congress cannot continue to ignore other equally important \nimmigration issues which are as critical to immigrants in our workforce \nas H-1B visas are to the information technology industry. \nUnfortunately, unlike the H-1B issue, these other equally important \nissues have been ignored by too many members of Congress.\n  Last year, a broad coalition of immigrant and faith-based groups \nlaunched the ``Fix '96'' campaign to repeal the harsh and excessive \nprovisions in the 1996 immigration and welfare laws, to restore balance \nand fairness to current law, and to correct government errors which \nprevent certain immigrants from receiving the services Congress \nintended.\n  All of the issues raised in the ``Fix '96'' campaign are still \noutstanding. A number of bills, including the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act, have been introduced proposing solutions to these \nproblems. However, the Republican leadership continues to block action \non these important proposals. These issues include parity legislation \nfor Central Americans and Haitians, restoring protections to asylum \nseekers, restoring due process in detention and deportation policy, \nrestoring public benefits to legal immigrants, and restoring \nprotections to battered immigrant women and children.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act provides us with an opportunity \nto end a series of unjust provisions in our current immigration laws, \nand build on the most noble aspects of our American immigrant \ntradition.\n  It restores fairness to the immigrant community and fairness in the \nnation's immigration laws. It is good for families and it is good for \nAmerican business.\n  The immigrant community--particularly the Latino community--has \nwaited far too long for the fundamental justice that this legislation \nwill provide. These issues are not new to Congress. The immigrants who \nwill benefit from this legislation should have received permanent \nstatus from the INS long ago.\n  Few days remain in this Congress, but my Democratic colleagues and I \nare committed to doing all we can to see that both the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act and the H-1B high tech visa legislation become \nlaw this year. I urge my colleagues to give equal priority to these \nbasic immigration issues that affect so many immigrant families in our \nworkforce. The time to act is now, and there is still ample time to act \nbefore Congress adjourns.\n\n\n                    training and education programs\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we in the Senate cannot originate a \nrevenue measure to fund the new training and education program. But it \nwould be a serious mistake to enact a final bill that does not call on \nemployers to pay $1,000 per visa for the training and education \nnecessary to improve the skills of U.S. workers and students.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I, too, am committed to seeing to it that there is \nfunding for these programs and a $1,000 fee is appropriate and would \naccomplish this goal. As the Ranking Member knows, I believe that as \nfar as the shortage of highly skilled workers is concerned, we have \nboth a short term and long term problem, and I believe these programs \nare an integral part of addressing our long term problem. I very much \nappreciation your ongoing willingness to work on these important \nprograms for training and educating Americans so that they will be \nready to take these jobs, and the leadership you have shown on these \nmatters. I pledge to work with you, the other Members of this body, the \nbusiness community, and other affected outside interests to seek ways \nto help fund these programs consistent with the principle you \narticulated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In addition, I believe it is important to exclude from \nthat fee any employer that is a primary or secondary education \ninstitution, an institution of higher education, as defined in the \nHigher Education Act of 1965, a nonprofit entity which engages in \nestablished curriculum-related clinical training of students registered \nat any such institution, a nonprofit research organization, or a \ngovernmental research organization.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I agree with the Ranking Member, and I support his \nobjectives. I will work with Senator Kennedy to ensure that these \ninstitutions are excluded from the imposition of fees.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In conclusion, I would simply like to thank Senator \nAbraham for his ongoing willingness to work on these important programs \nfor training and educating Americans so that they will be ready to take \nthese jobs, and the leadership he has consistently shown on these \nissues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent the \nSenate now lay aside S. 2045 until 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9451-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9451-S9453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VISA WAIVER PERMANENT PROGRAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to H.R. \n3767, the visa waiver bill, and that the substitute amendment, on \nbehalf of Senators Abraham and Kennedy, which is at the desk, be agreed \nto, no further amendments or motions be in order, the bill be advanced \nto third reading, and passage occur immediately following the passage \nvote on S. 2045.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support the passage of H.R. \n3767, the Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act. This legislation, as \namended, is important not only because it facilitates travel and \ntourism in the United States, thereby creating many American jobs, but \nalso because it benefits American tourists who wish to travel abroad, \nsince visa requirements are generally waived on a reciprocal basis.\n  The Visa Waiver Pilot Program authorizes the Attorney General to \nwaive visa requirements for foreign nationals traveling from certain \ndesignated countries as temporary visitors for business or pleasure. \nAliens from the participating countries complete an admission form \nprior to arrival and are admitted to stay for up to 90 days.\n  The criteria for being designated as a Visa Waiver country are as \nfollows: First, the country must extend reciprocal visa-free travel for \nU.S. citizens. Second, they must have a nonimmigrant refusal rate for \nB-1/B-2 visitor visas at U.S. consulates that is low, averaging less \nthan 2 percent the previous two full fiscal years, with the refusal \nrate less than 2.5 percent in either year, or less than 3 percent the \nprevious full fiscal year. Third, the countries must have or be in the \nprocess of developing a machine-readable passport program. Finally, the \nAttorney General must conclude that entry into the Visa Waiver Pilot \nProgram will not compromise U.S. law enforcement interests.\n  Countries are designated by the Attorney General in consultation with \nthe Secretary of State. Nations currently designated as Visa Waiver \nparticipants are Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, \nBrunei, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, \nJapan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, \nNorway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, \nSwitzerland, United Kingdom, and Uruguay. Greece has been proposed for \nparticipation in the program.\n  The Visa Waiver Pilot Program was established by law in 1986 and \nbecame effective in 1988, with 8 countries participating for a period \nof three years. The program has been considered successful and as such \nhas been expanded to include 29 participating countries. Since 1986, \nVisa Waiver has been reauthorized on 6 different occasions for periods \nof one, two, or three years at a time.\n\n[[Page S9452]]\n\n  The time has come to make the Visa Waiver Pilot Program permanent \nand, in the process, to strengthen further current requirements. That \nis the purpose of this bill, which has been amended and worked out \njointly with our House counterparts, in particular House Immigration \nSubcommittee Chair Lamar Smith, who I thank for his work on this bill. \nThis legislation is very close to S. 2376, the Travel, Tourism, and \nJobs Preservation Act, which I introduced earlier this year with \nSenators Kennedy, Leahy, DeWine, Jeffords, Akaka, Graham, Grams, \nMurkowski, and Inouye, all of whom I thank for their support.\n  The legislation we are about to pass would accomplish a number of \nthings.\n  First, it would make the Visa Waiver Pilot Program permanent. This is \nimportant since no serious disagreement exists that the program should \ncontinue in place for the foreseeable future, and no significant \nproblems have been raised with the fundamentals of how it has been \noperating for the past 14 years. To the contrary, failure to continue \nthe program would cause enormous staffing problems at U.S. consulates, \nwhich would have to be suddenly increased substantially to resume \nissuance of visitor visas. It would also be extremely detrimental to \nAmerican travelers, who would most certainly find that, given \nreciprocity, they now would be compelled to obtain visas to travel to \nEurope and elsewhere. Finally, there are costs to continuing to \nreauthorize the program on a short-term rather than a permanent basis, \nas it periodically creates considerable uncertainty in the United \nStates and around the world about what documents travelers planning \ntheir foreign travel have to obtain.\n  Second, the current requirement that countries be in the process of \ndeveloping a program for issuing machine-readable passports will be \nreplaced with a stricter requirement that all countries in the program \nas of My 1, 2000 certify by October 1, 2001 that they will have an \noperational machine-readable passport program by 2003 and that new \ncountries have a machine-readable passport program in place before \nbecoming eligible for designation as a Visa Waiver country. The bill \nalso establishes a deadline of October 1, 2007 by which time all \ntravelers must have machine-readable passports to come to the United \nStates under Visa Waiver. The judgment of everyone involved in these \nissues is that the technology is now sufficient that it is time for \neveryone to move from the concept and planning stages to the prompt \nimplementation of these requirements.\n  Finally, the legislation, altered from the House-passed version, \nwould allow for an ``emergency termination'' by the Attorney General, \nin consultation with the Secretary of State, of a country's Visa Waiver \ndesignation in an extreme and unusual circumstances. These \ncircumstances are a ``war (including undeclared war, civil war, or \nother military activity on the territory of the program country; a \nsevere breakdown in law and order affecting a significant portion of \nthe program country's territory; a severe economic collapse in the \nprogram country; or any other extraordinary even in the program country \nthat threatens the law enforcement or security interests of the United \nStates (including the interest in enforcement of the immigration laws \nof the United States.)'' Considering the impact of such a termination \non U.S. foreign policy interests and the conduct of the State \nDepartment itself, it is my belief that the Secretary of State would \nexert considerable authority in determining whether such an ``emergency \ntermination'' was warranted.\n  Mr. President, I urge passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Abraham, \nSenator Leahy, and others in cosponsoring the Travel, Tourism and Jobs \nPresentation Act. This measure will reauthorize the Visa Waiver Program \nand make it permanent.\n  This visa waiver program allows individuals from designated low risk, \nhigh volume countries to enter the United States as temporary visitors \nfor business or pleasure without first obtaining a visa. Individuals \nvisiting the United States under the visa waiver program must complete \nan admission form prior to arrival. Their visit may last only ninety \ndays, with thirty days extensions allowed only in the case of \nemergency. Countries participating in the visa waiver program must meet \ncertain requirements, such as possessing a low non-immigrant refusal \nrate for B-1/B-2 visas and utilizing, or currently developing, a \nmachine readable passport program. Finally, the Attorney General must \ndetermine that each country's participation in the program will not \ncompromise United States law.\n  By eliminating the visa requirement, the visa waiver program \nfacilities international travel and increases the number of visitors \nfor business and tourism. These effects generate economic growth and \nstimulate international trade and commerce. According to the INS, over \n17 million visitors to the United States arrived under the visa waiver \nprogram in FY 1998. The program is strongly supported by the State \nDepartment because it reduces consular workloads, allowing the officers \nto shift staff and scarce resources to other pressing matters, as well \nas reducing costs.\n  Despite operating efficiently and providing enormous benefit to the \nUnited States economy and the State Department for the past eleven \nyears, the visa waiver program remains a pilot program. This bill \nreauthorizes this important program and makes it permanent.\n  This legislation also strengthens security precautions under this \nprogram by requiring participating countries to incorporate machine \nreadable passport programs by October 2003 and nationals from these \ncountries to possess readable passports by 2008. In addition, the \nAttorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, must \ncontinue to evaluate the effect of a new country's inclusion in the \nvisa waiver program on law enforcement and national security. \nContinuing countries in the program are evaluated every five years.\n  I am especially pleased that Portugal was recently added to the visa \nwaiver program. Travel between our two countries is significantly \neasier because cumbersome paperwork and delays have been eliminated--\nobstacles that needlessly prevented Portugese families from visiting \ntheir loved ones here in the United States. Portugal's inclusion in the \nProgram will benefit thousands of Portugese families in Massachusetts \nand around the nation.\n  Although I strongly support this important bill, I have very serious \nconcern about the amendment that Senator Helms has offered amending the \nConyers provision of the visa waiver bill. Representative Conyer's \nprovision simply states that visas that are wrongfully denied based on \nrace, sex, disability or other unlawful grounds cannot be included in \ncomputations determining a country's admission into the visa waiver \nprogram. The amendment Senator Helms offers pertaining only to the \nConyers provision. It seeks to preclude judicial review of any visa \ndenying visas, denial of admission to the United States, the \ncomputation of visa refusal rates, or the designation or non-\ndesignation of any country.\n  I have reluctantly agreed to it because it is surely symbolic and \nwill have no practical legal effect. Under current law, consular visa \ndeterminations, the denial of admission under the visa waiver program, \nor determinations regarding designation of a country into the visa \nwaiver program are not subject to court review.\n  Nonetheless, court stripping provisions, whether symbolic or not, are \nanathema to our judicial system. I thought that Republicans had learned \nthe importance of judicial review in the Elian Gonzalez case. Such \nprovisions allow life-shattering determinations to be made at the \nunreviewable discretion of an administrative functionary. The most \nfundamental decisions are being made on the basis of a cursory review \nof a few pages in a file, or a perfunctory interview, without the \npossibility of any appeal or judicial review. This is a recipe for \ndisastrous mistakes and abuse.\n  This excellent program has been a pilot program for too long. Its \nenormous benefits to the United States economy and the efficiency it \ncreates for the federal government are obvious. It is time we make this \nlight of this fact and make this important program permanent. I urge \nall of my colleague to support this important bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this bill addresses a critically important \nissue: the preservation of our visa waiver program. I am a cosponsor of \nthe Senate\n\n[[Page S9453]]\n\nversion of this bill, and I strongly recommend the passage of H.R. \n3767.\n  This legislation will achieve the important goal of making our visa \nwaiver program permanent. We have had a visa waiver pilot project for \nmore than a decade, and it has been a tremendous success in allowing \nresidents of some of our most important allies to travel to the United \nStates for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, and in allowing \nAmerican citizens to travel to those countries without visas. Countries \nmust meet a number of requirements to participate in the program, \nincluding having extraordinarily low rates of visa refusals. Of course, \nthe visa waiver does not affect the need for international travelers to \ncarry valid passports.\n  The pilot project expired on April 30, and I had sought passage of S. \n2367, which is incorporated into the bill we consider today, before \nthat expiration date. Indeed, I encouraged the discharge of this bill \nfrom the Judiciary Committee in April so that the Senate could act upon \nthis highly time-sensitive matter. Unfortunately, this bill was instead \nheld hostage to other issues. Fortunately, the Administration extended \nthe program administratively until the end of May, but despite my best \nefforts we failed to meet that deadline as well. As a result, the \nprogram was extended until the end of June, but once again the Senate \ndid not meet the deadline. The Administration then extended the program \nthrough July, sparing thousands of American tourists and international \nbusiness travelers tremendous inconvenience and cost during the busy \nsummer traveling season. Before the August recess, we once again failed \nto act on this legislation, forcing the Administration to extend it \nagain. It is now well past time to end this charade, pass this bill, \nand send it back to the House for its final approval.\n  Rather than simply pass another extension of the pilot program, it is \ntime to make this program permanent--it has stood the test of time for \nwell over a decade. In order to address any security concerns about \nmaking the program permanent, the requirements placed upon \nparticipating countries have been tightened. Indeed, countries wishing \nto participate in the visa waiver program must meet each of the \nfollowing four criteria: the participating country must allow U.S. \ncitizens to travel without a visa; the country must have a nonimmigrant \nrefusal rate for B-1/B-2 visitor visas at U.S. consulates that is low, \naveraging less than 2 percent the previous two full fiscal years, with \nthe refusal rate less than 2.5 percent in either year, or less than 3 \npercent the previous full fiscal year; the country must already possess \nor be in the process of developing a machine-readable passport program; \nand, the Attorney General must conclude that entry into the Visa Waiver \nPilot Program will not compromise U.S. law enforcement interests.\n  The visa waiver program provides substantial benefits to both the \nAmerican tourism industry and to Americans traveling abroad. I urge the \nSenate to make it permanent.\n  Although I am a strong supporter of the bill, I must speak out \nagainst the amendment that has been inserted into the bill by Senator \nHelms. This amendment states that under a certain paragraph of this \nbill, no court will have jurisdiction to review any visa refusal based \non race, sex, or disability. It is my understanding that this provision \nhas no practical effect, since affected foreign nationals would not be \nable to bring such a claim in an American court in the first place. \nBecause it is effectively a dead letter, and because of the importance \nof the visa waiver program and other amendments to this bill, I have \nchosen not to assert rights and deny unanimous consent. But this \nprovision is offensive to our legal traditions. I have consistently \nopposed attempts to strip courts of authority to resolve immigration \nmatters, and I am particularly opposed to such attempts where the \nstripping is directed specifically toward claims asserting \ndiscrimination. Judicial review is a critical part of American law, and \nwe should not be impinging upon it--symbolically or otherwise.\n  Finally, passage of this bill should not be misinterpreted as a \nsignal that this Congress has dealt fairly or adequately with \nimmigration issues. There is still so much to do in the little time we \nhave left, from passing the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act--to \ndealing with the aftereffects of the immigration legislation this \nCongress passed in 1996. In particular, I would call again for hearings \non S. 1940, the Refugee Protection Act. This is a bill I introduced \nwith Senator Brownback and a number of other Senators that would undo \nthe damage that has been done to our asylum process by the \nimplementation of expedited removal. I believe it, like so many \nimmigration issues that have been ignored for the last 21 months, \ndeserves the attention of this Congress.\n  The amendment (No. 4276) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 3767) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9453-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9453-S9455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 4733 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4733) making appropriations for energy and water development \n     for the fiscal year 2001, and for other purposes, having met, \n     after full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and \n     do recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed \n     by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nSeptember 27, 2000.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate now turn to \nconsideration of the conference report accompanying the fiscal year \n2001 Energy and Water Development Act. Earlier today, the House passed \nthe conference report by a vote of 301 to 118, and I hope the Senate \nwill also overwhelmingly support the conference report. I am very \npleased that we are able to get this very important conference report \nto the floor, given the difficulties affecting more appropriations \nbills this time of year. Senator Reid and I, along with Chairman \nStevens and Senator Byrd, have worked hard to prepare an outstanding \nbill that meets the needs of the country and addresses many of the \nSenators' top priorities.\n  The Senate and House full committee chairman were very supportive and \nhave provided the additional resources at conference that were \nnecessary to address many priority issues for Members. They have \nallowed the House to come up $630 million to the Senate number on the \ndefense allocation $13.484 billion, and the Senate non-defense \nallocation has increased by $1.1 billion.\n  I would now like to highlight some of the great things we have been \nable to do in this bill.\n  The conference report provides $4.5 for Army Corps of Engineers water \nprojects, an increase of $400 million over the Senate and $383 over the \nPresident's Request.\n  The increased resources have allowed us to get started on the very \nhighest priority new starts in 2001--something we were not able to do \nunder our original allocation.\n  The conference report provides $3.20 billion for DOE Science, an \nincrease of $330 million over the Senate and $420 million over last \nyear. We heard from many members over the last few months about \nproviding more money for science and I am pleased we were able to heed \ntheir concerns and make significant investments in our future.\n  On the defense side, the conference report provides $5 billion for \nnuclear weapons activities, an increase of $150 million over Senate and \n$600 million over last year.\n  On clean-up, we have been able to continue to provide the \nenvironmental clean-up money that is so important to many of our \nmembers across the country. The conference report provides $6.1 \nbillion, and increase of $390 million over last year.\n  We do have a few controversial provisions in this bill. The \nconference report\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\nincludes a provision that we have carried for several years that would \nprohibit the use of funds to revise the Missouri River Master Manual if \nsuch would result in increased springtime flood risk on the lower \nMissouri River. I know the administration has threatened a veto on this \nissue, and I take that seriously. But, we have been unable to forge an \nacceptable compromise and have insisted that the provision remain in \nthe conference report just as it passed the Senate floor. Although \nthere are other issues the administration has raised, we have made a \ngood faith effort to address their concerns were possible. I believe we \nhave a good bill that the President will sign.\n\n\n              laboratory directed research and development\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, would the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee indulge \nme in a colloquy for clarification purposes on use of Laboratory \nDirected Research and Development by Department of Energy national \nlaboratories?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to oblige my friend from Idaho, a valuable \nmember of the Energy and Water appropriations subcommittee.\n  Mr. CRAIG. When DOE's Environmental Management budget request for FY \n2001 was submitted to Congress earlier this year it continued a \nrestriction on the use of DOE environmental management funds for LDRD \npurposes carried over from FY 2000. The EM restriction of LDRD was \nsubsequently rescinded by OMB later in the year at strong urging by \nnumerous Senators including myself. Subsequently, the Senate Defense \nAuthorization and the Senate Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bills directed that DOE return LDRD to full scope, to \ninclude use of EM funds. The Senate Defense Authorization bill permits \nuse of LDRD up to 6%; and this conference report also permits use of \nLDRD funds at 6%. Is this the Chairman's understanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The gentleman from Idaho is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. As the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee knows \nfrom the Department's testimony including Secretary Richardson and Dr. \nCarolyn Huntoon, EM Assistant Secretary, the Administration, with \nsignificant encouragement from the Congress, is now on record in \nsupport of restoring EM programs as a funding source for LDRD in 2001.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. That has been a factor in the \nConference Committee's considerations.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Would it be fair then to assume that all 2001 laboratory \nplanning budgets prepared while the EM restriction was in place would \nbe impacted by removal of the LDRD restriction?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That would be an accurate assumption.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is it the Chairman's view that permission to derive LDRD \nfunds from EM sources should be granted to all National laboratories \nunder the new authority established in this bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, that is my view and the view of the Committee.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Does the Chairman see any circumstances to justify \ngranting this authority to some of the laboratories but not to others?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I see no conditions under which I or the Committee \nwould support any effort by the Administration to withhhold this \nauthority from any laboratory, including the EM lead laboratory in \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the gentleman from New Mexico.\n\n\n              yellowstone energy and transportation study\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici, in a colloquy regarding the Greater Yellowstone-\nTeton energy and transportation systems study and the International \nCenters for Environmental Safety, ICES.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am delighted to accommodate my friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. As the chairman of the energy and water appropriations \nsubcommittee knows, the pending conference report does not provide \nfunds for the Yellowstone energy and transportation study. It is my \nunderstanding the Department of Energy supports this study and the \nDepartment may provide funds to support the Idaho National Engineering \nand Environmental Laboratory's participation in this effort. If DOE \nmakes a decision to provide funds for this study, would the chairman \nsupport that decision?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would agree that funding for this important study \nwould be appropriate.\n  Mr. CRAPO. As the senior Senator from New Mexico knows, the ICES \nprogram was formed last year through a joint statement signed by \nSecretary Richardson and the Minister for Atomic Energy of the Russian \nFederation, Yevgeny Adamov. The centers were created to provide a \nmechanism for technical exchange and effective collaboration between \nthe DOE and Minatom on matters of environmental safety in both \ncountries. The U.S. Center is managed by the Idaho National Engineering \nand Environmental Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory. In \nRussia, the Ministry for Atomic Energy operates the Center in Moscow. \nBoth work collaboratively to ensure overall ICES success in reducing \nenvironmental threats and costs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Report language in the FY2001 Senate Energy and Water \nDevelopment bill supports DOE's efforts to use the experience and \nexpertise of scientists of the former Soviet Union to address waste \nmanagement and environmental remediation challenges within the DOE \ncomplex. Isn't it also true that the centers are intended to facilitate \ninternational collaboration to address environmental and nuclear safety \nissues important to the national security?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Idaho is correct in his understanding. \nI would add that committee saw fit to support the International Nuclear \nSafety Program at the President's requested level of funding. This \nincludes funding for the Russian and U.S. centers.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n              hopi-western navajo water development study\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the conference report to H.R. 4733 provides \n$1 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to initiate a comprehensive \nHopi-Western Navajo water development study. This funding was added to \nthe bill at my request, and I would like to take this opportunity to \ndetail the reason why I consider this to be a very important \nundertaking.\n  Efforts have been ongoing for several years to settle the various \nwater rights claims of the Navajo and Hopi Indian tribes and other \nwater users in the Little Colorado River watershed of Northern Arizona. \nNumerous proposals have been advanced in an effort to settle these \nwater-rights claims, including identifying alternative sources of \nwater, means of delivery and points of usage to help provide a reliable \nsource of good-quality water to satisfy the present and future demands \nof Indian communities on these reservations. Cost estimates for the \nvarious existing proposals run into the hundreds of millions of \ndollars, the majority of which would likely be borne by the Federal \nGovernment. This study is needed to identify the most cost-effective \nprojects that will serve to meet these objectives.\n  I have asked the Bureau to hire an outside contractor to complete \nthis study to ensure that a fresh and objective analysis of existing \nstudies and data is conducted. In addition, using a private contractor \nwill enable the Bureau to complete the study in a timely manner without \nrequiring the Bureau to divert personnel needed to accomplish other \nvital priorities. The study should be complete and submitted to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee as soon as possible but no later than \nApril 1, 2002.\n  I also want to assure the parties that this study is intended to be \nused to facilitate this settlement, and cannot be used for any other \npurpose in any administrative or judicial proceeding.\n\n\n                              NIF STUDIES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman and \nranking member to engage in a brief colloquy on the National Ignition \nFacility. The bill as it passed the Senate requested a study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences of a number of issues regarding the \nNational Ignition Facility. The current bill and conference report \nlanguage require reviews of several issues, including the need for the\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\nfacility, alternatives to NIF, consideration of starting with a smaller \nfacility, and planning for the Broader stockpile stewardship program. \nAll these elements are important, but the bill does not specify how \nthese reviews are to be conducted.\n  Previous supposedly independent DOE reviews of NIF have been strongly \ncriticized in the recent GAO report and in a recent article in the \njournal Nature, and have even been subject to lawsuits for violating \nthe Federal Advisory Committee Act. I believe it is critical for the \ncredibility of these reviews that they be conducted by an independent \nbody, such as the National Academy of Sciences, and that they be \norganized as independent studies under FACA rules. This is a troubled \nprogram, and we need the very best thought of independent experts to \nhelp us get it back on track or to scale it back as needed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague and want to \nemphasize how important it is to Congress that these be outside, \nindependent reviews. DOE has unfortunately lost credibility on this \nissue and needs to bring in outside experts to regain it. I have \nalready conveyed my expectations on this point to Madelyn Creedon and \nam happy to join my colleagues in clarifying this today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, our country has very important needs \nthat many hope NIF can solve. The credibility of outside experts will \nbe crucial as we consider the future of this program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I now ask unanimous consent the vote occur on the \nadoption of the conference report at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from New \nMexico, I am disappointed that we are not voting on this tonight. I \nthink it would be an opportunity to get a bill to the President's desk \nand speed up things around here. I think it is a shame we are waiting \nuntil 5:30 Monday night. It is going to consume too much time in the \nprocess.\n  I hope whoever has caused this, whoever that might be who is \nresponsible, recognizes that they are responsible for slowing up what \ngoes on around here. We have to move these appropriations bills. \nSenator Domenici and I and especially our staffs have worked night and \nday all this past week, and I literally mean night and day. We were \nlooking forward to completing this bill tonight.\n  Having said that, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9455-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate a relatively new organization designed to enhance U.S.-Cuba \nrelations. The Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy was created in \nearly 1998 to foster better political, economic and cultural \nrelationships between our country and Cuba. Its board is compromised of \ndistinguished Americans, including some of our former colleagues in the \nCongress.\n  Clearly the time has come to bring ``responsibleness'' to the debate \nregarding U.S.-Cuba relations.\n  The Alliance has briefed me and my staff regarding their first-hand \nexperience in Cuba. I encourage them to continue their fact finding and \ninformation gathering missions to Cuba.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an Activities \nReport of the Alliance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy Activities Report--Fact-Finding \n              Mission; Republic of Cuba, July 10-12, 2000\n\n       This report summarizes the activities of a fact-finding \n     mission to the Republic of Cuba conducted on July 10-12, \n     2000. The fact-finding mission was organized by the Alliance \n     for Responsible Cuba Policy (the ``Alliance''), a non-\n     partisan, non-profit organization incorporated in the \n     District of Columbia. The delegation included former \n     Congressman Beryl Anthony, partner, Winston & Strawn; Mr. \n     Albert A. Fox, Jr., President of the Alliance, Mr. Paul D. \n     Fox, Vice-President Atlantic Region, Tysons Food, Inc. and \n     Managing Director, Tyson de Mexico; Ms. Nanette Kelly, \n     President and Mr. John Spain, Managing Director, The Powell \n     Group of Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Mr. Edward Rabel, former \n     news correspondent with CBS and NBC, and currently Senior \n     Vice President of Weber McGinn; and Gregory J. Spak, partner, \n     White & Case LLP.\n       This fact-finding mission was the second such trip \n     organized by the Alliance. The first mission occurred on \n     September 26-29, 1999. An Activities Report related to that \n     mission is available from the Alliance's web site at \n     www.responsiblecubapolicy.com.\n       During the July 10-12, 2000 mission, the delegation met \n     with the following persons and entities in Cuba:\n       Ministry of Foreign Trade\n       Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment\n       Ministry of Agriculture\n       Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation\n       Mr. Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, President of the National \n     Assembly\n       Ministry of Justice\n\n     The following summarizes the discussion at each of these \n     meetings.\n\n\n                       Ministry of Foreign Trade\n\n       The delegation met with Maria de la Luz B'Hamel, Director \n     of the North American Division of the Foreign Trade Ministry, \n     and with Mr. Igor Montero Brito, Vice President of ALIMPORT. \n     Ms. B'Hamel's division is responsible for international trade \n     issues relating to the United States and Canada, and the \n     Foreign Trade Ministry in general has jurisdiction over all \n     foreign trade issues, including issues arising in the World \n     Trade Organization and other international and regional trade \n     agreements. Ms. B'Hamel noted that Cuba is a founding member \n     of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (``GATT'') and \n     the World Trade Organization (``WTO'').\n       The Foreign Trade Ministry has a practical role in foreign \n     trade through its authority to grant licenses to Cuban \n     enterprises engaging in international trade. Ms. B'Hamel \n     described two important trends that have emerged since the \n     dissolution of the Soviet Union and the resulting rupture of \n     Cuba's traditional trading relationships:\n       (1) Diversification of Cuba's foreign trade. Currently, \n     Cuba's two largest trading partners are Spain and Canada, and \n     no more than 10-12 percent of Cuba's trade is with any one \n     country. As part of this diversification process, Cuba has \n     been negotiating trade agreements with its regional trading \n     partners in order to promote Cuba as a strategic bridge to \n     the Caribbean region.\n       (2) Decentralization of foreign trade issues. Ms. B'Hamel \n     stated the Foreign Trade Ministry is deemphasizing its direct \n     involvement in international trade transactions, and is \n     assuming more of a trade regulation role. Companies engaged \n     in foreign trade today in Cuba include state enterprises, \n     private enterprises, and international joint ventures or \n     branch offices of foreign companies. More than 250 private \n     and state enterprises are actively engaged in foreign trade, \n     and there are approximately 600 Cuban branch offices of \n     foreign companies engaged in trade in Cuba.\n       Ms. B'Hamel explained that, since 1994, Cuba has \n     experienced steady improvement in foreign trade and GDP \n     growth. Her Ministry forecasts continued GDP growth, even \n     assuming no relaxation of U.S.-imposed trade restrictions. \n     She stated that the U.S. trade restrictions (which she called \n     the ``blockade'') have affected Cuba, but that other trends \n     in business and world trade were creating new opportunities \n     for the Cuban economy.\n       One particularly dynamic sector of the Cuban economy is \n     tourism, which is growing by 16-20 percent per year. These \n     statistics do not include U.S. tourists, which Ms. B'Hamel \n     estimates to have numbered approximately 180,000 last year. \n     She noted that this increase in tourism will have a ripple \n     effect on the Cuban economy and will increase the demand for \n     food goods, and other services.\n       Mr. Igor Montero explained that ALIMPORT is the principal \n     Cuban state enterprise dedicated to importing foodstuffs into \n     Cuba and distributing imports to the public. ALIMPORT is \n     dedicated almost exclusively to the primary foodstuffs which \n     are considered to be staples of the Cuban diet (e.g., rice, \n     beans, etc.). Cuba currently imports approximately $1 billion \n     in foodstuffs annually, $650 million of which is imported \n     through ALIMPORT. Principal food imports are wheat, soybeans, \n     and rice.\n       Cuba currently is importing approximately 400,000 metric \n     tons of rice per year, principally from China, Thailand, and \n     Vietnam. Delivery time for rice imported from these countries \n     is approximately 60 days, and the quality is considered only \n     fair. Mr. Montero acknowledged that transportation costs to\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\n     acquire this rice represent a significant expenditure.\n       Mr. Spain, whose Louisiana-based company, the Powell Group, \n     is involved in the rice milling business, pointed out that \n     his company used to supply rice to Cuba before the U.S. trade \n     restrictions. While clarifying he was not in Cuba to develop \n     business. Mr. Spain noted that his company could supply high-\n     quality rice to Cuba with a turnaround time (from order to \n     delivery) of approximately one week and insignificant freight \n     costs.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n            Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment\n\n       The delegation met with a number of representatives from \n     this Ministry (``CITMA''), including the Minister, Dr. Rosa \n     Elena Simeon Negrin. Dr. Simeon described the Ministry's \n     creation in 1994 as a result of the reorganization and \n     consolidation of other Cuban ministries. Dr. Simeon \n     distributed to the delegation the following publications \n     regarding the Ministry's activities (1) ``Law of the \n     Environment''; (2) ``Cuba Foreign Investment Act of 1995''; \n     and (3) ``National Environmental Strategy.'' These documents \n     are available from the Alliance upon request.\n       Much of the discussion focused on environmental issues. Dr. \n     Simeon noted the importance of environmental education to the \n     Ministry's mission. She described the results of a recent \n     survey revealing that although 73 percent of the Cuban \n     population recognize the threat to the environment, only 30 \n     percent believe they can improve environmental conditions \n     through their own actions. The Ministry is attempting to \n     increase awareness among the Cuban population of the role the \n     individual plays in improving the environment.\n       Dr. Simeon also portrayed alternative fuels as an important \n     focus of the Ministry's efforts. Approximately 5,000 \n     facilities in the mountain areas of the country operate with \n     solar energy, but the solar energy panels necessary to \n     continue the development of this energy source are \n     prohibitively expensive. Notwithstanding the cost, the \n     Ministry is committed to solar energy.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                        ministry of agriculture\n\n       The delegation met with Dr. Alfredo Gutierrez Yanis, Vice \n     Minister of Agriculture, and several other officials from the \n     Ministry. Dr. Gutierrez explained that Cuba's traditional \n     relationship with the Soviet Union had allowed for a stable \n     agriculture policy. Cuba exported sugar and citrus to the \n     Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries, and imported \n     machinery, fertilizer, and pesticides from those countries. \n     Ten years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cuban \n     agriculture is in the midst of a recovery program (known as \n     the ``processo de Recuperacion en Agricultura'' or the \n     ``Agriculture Recovery Process''). Recovery has been uneven, \n     however, with some sectors advancing beyond pre-crisis \n     performance levels (notably vegetable production) and others \n     continuing to experience difficulties (poultry, livestock, \n     and rice production).\n       Dr. Gutierrez offered poultry products as an example of a \n     sector that has not recovered. Prior to 1991, the Cuban per-\n     capita annual egg consumption was 230, nearly double the \n     current per-capita rate. Similarly, Cuban agriculture once \n     produced approximately 117,000 tons of chicken meat annually, \n     but now can only produce approximately 30,000 tons. Cuba has \n     been forced to import chicken meat, with Canada emerging as \n     the principal supplier. Dr. Gutierrez attributed the decrease \n     in chicken and egg production to lack of available feed. This \n     lack of feed results from both the disruption in the \n     traditional trading relationship with the Soviet Union, and \n     changes in the economic restrictions imposed by the United \n     States. During the 1980s, Cuba imported approximately 2 \n     million tons of feed, and reported much of this was purchased \n     from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. After the \n     enactment of the Toricelli Act, the value of this trade \n     dropped from $400 million per year to approximately $1 \n     million. Also, the provisions of U.S. law restricting access \n     to U.S. ports for those vessels which have engaged in \n     commercial activity in Cuba to obtain feed at a reasonable \n     price.\n       With respect to milk, Dr. Gutierrez reported that for all \n     practical purposes, the dairy herds ceased to produce when \n     grain was no longer available for feeding. Many cows died of \n     starvation and others were slaughtered while still at a \n     productive age. The Cuban Government has since developed a \n     breed of dairy cow that is \\5/8\\ Holstein and \\3/8\\ Zebu in \n     order to facilitate milk production without excessive \n     grain consumption, but current productivity per head has \n     declined with these genetic changes. The Government is \n     importing powdered milk, but not in sufficient quantities. \n     One of the delegation members touring a neighborhood away \n     from the tourist areas was told that the milk formula sold \n     in state stores is supposed to be consumed exclusively by \n     children from 3 to 7 years old.\n       Dr. Gutierrez also mentioned difficulties in the rice \n     sector, in that Cuba has been forced to import most of its \n     rice from distant sources, thereby increasing costs and \n     lowering quality of the rice. The Ministry would like to see \n     an increase in local rice production, and a corresponding \n     reduction in imports to approximately 200,000 tons per year. \n     Dr. Gutierrez feels that this would permit a per-capita rice \n     consumption of approximately 50 kilograms.\n       Dr. Gurtierrez cited pork and cirrus production as two \n     examples of a successful recovery. Cirrus production has \n     recovered and could increase if new markets were opened for \n     Cuban citrus goods. Israel is providing assistance to the \n     Cuban Government on citrus production, and an Italian firm is \n     helping with production of citrus derivation products.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Dr. Gutierrez described developments he believes will help \n     the Cuban agricultural sector continue its post-crisis \n     recovery. First, state farms play a less significant role in \n     the agricultural sector, with the percentage of farm land \n     cultivated by state farms reduced from 67 percent to \n     approximately 33 percent. Thus, according to Dr. Gutierrez, \n     approximately two-thirds of the land is being cultivated \n     today by small private companies and cooperatives. When asked \n     how the small companies and cooperatives sell their crops, he \n     replied that it would be typical for such companies and \n     cooperatives to contract with a Cuban state enterprise for a \n     specific supply quantity, and that the companies and \n     cooperatives would then be free to sell any additional \n     production privately.\n       Secondly, individual farmers now operate in a relatively \n     free market, and are permitted to farm areas of 75 hectares \n     (approximately 200 acres). Nearly 800,000 hectares \n     (approximately 2 million acres) are now in the hands of \n     individual farmers. The farmers do not own the land (land \n     ownership is reserved to the state), but they are allowed to \n     cultivate the land and are entitled to sell the production as \n     they wish. Many of these farmers have formed privately-\n     operated cooperatives.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n        ministry of foreign investment and economic cooperation\n\n       The delegation met with Mr. Ernesto Senti Endarias, First \n     Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Investment and \n     Economic Cooperation, and various members of his staff. \n     According to Vice Minister Senti, the Cuban economy is in its \n     fifth year of a gradual economic recovery, and foreign \n     investment has played an important role in this recovery. \n     Sales from enterprises resulting from direct foreign \n     investment account for approximately 3-4 percent of the Cuban \n     GDP, nearly twelve percent of all exports, and such \n     enterprises employ approximately one percent of the labor \n     force.\n       Direct foreign investment is affecting various sectors of \n     the Cuban economy, including (1) tourism, (2) heavy industry \n     (petroleum (especially deep-water drilling)), (3) mining, \n     (4) light industry, (5) telecommunications, (6) energy \n     (especially alternative sources), (7) sugar (especially \n     derivatives from sugar production), and (8) agriculture. \n     Only three sectors are not open to direct foreign \n     investment health, education, and national security. \n     Fifty-two percent of direct foreign investment is from \n     countries in Europe, particularly Spain and France.\n       Vice Minister Senti believes that direct foreign investment \n     in Cuba will continue to grow. He observed the companies \n     investing in Cuba typically are large companies, and these \n     companies exhibit a high level of professionalism in their \n     business ventures, which is beneficial for Cuba. In return, \n     Cuba offers foreign investors highly-trained workers, \n     political stability, and a government interested in helping \n     companies that are willing to help Cuba.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                  president ricardo alarcon de quesada\n\n       The delegation met with Mr. Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, \n     President of the National Assembly, former foreign minister \n     and former ambassador to the United Nations. The discussion \n     with President Alarcon was wide-ranging, and he was \n     forthcoming on all issues raised by the delegation. He showed \n     particular interest in the status of the various legislative \n     proposals in the U.S. Congress that might permit the sale of \n     U.S. food and medicine to Cuba. When asked whether Cuba would \n     commit to purchasing U.S. food and medicine after the \n     legislation passed, he stated Cuba would like to do so, but \n     ultimately it would depend on the text of the legislation and \n     on timing. He explained they were monitoring the various \n     versions of the legislation and that certain provisions \n     (especially the increased restriction on travel and the \n     limited duration of the export licenses) might make \n     purchasing U.S. food and medicine difficult.\n       The Alliance then briefed President Alarcon on the upcoming \n     visit by Senators Pat Roberts and Max Baucus. The Alliance \n     explained the importance of these senators to any passage of \n     legislation regarding the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. \n     President Alarcon expressed his pleasure in visiting with the \n     Alliance again.\n\n\n                          ministry of justice\n\n       The delegation met with Lic Robert Diaz Sotolongo and other \n     members of the Ministry. Mr. Diaz began the meeting by \n     stating his satisfaction with the manner in which the United \n     States and Cuba were able to resolve the recent controversy \n     regarding Elian Gonzalez. He noted that this is a visible and \n     helpful example of how the two governments and their \n     societies can interact successfully despite differences of \n     opinion.\n       Mr. Diaz then directed the discussion toward drug \n     interdiction, another area in which he believes Cuba and the \n     United\n\n[[Page S9457]]\n\n     States can increase cooperation. He noted that in the last \n     meeting with the Alliance, the Cuban Department of Justice \n     had asked for assistance in facilitating the placement of a \n     U.S. Coast Guard representative to the U.S. Interest Section \n     in Havana to help increase cooperation on drug interdiction. \n     He thanked the Alliance for its assistance, noting with \n     satisfaction that the U.S. Coast Guard representative had \n     arrived in Havana. Mr. Diaz went on to describe the \n     celebrated case of the ``Limerick,'' a Belize-flagged vessel \n     that began to sink in Cuban waters in 1996. The cooperation \n     of British, American, and Cuban officials led to the \n     discovery on the vessel of six tons of cocaine believed \n     destined for the United States. The Cuban officials turned \n     over the drugs and the persons involved to the U.S. \n     authorities and actively assisted in the successful \n     prosecution of the individuals traveling to the United States \n     to testify in the criminal trial.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                              observation\n\n       All the Cuban Government officials and the Cuban people \n     with whom we visited were friendly and answered our questions \n     in a forthright manner. They made it clear they have no ill \n     feeling toward the American people or the U.S. form of \n     government. They expressed bewilderment that the U.S. \n     maintains its economic sanctions against Cuba despite other \n     developments, including the normalization of U.S. trade \n     relations with China, Vietnam, and North Korea, the \n     increasing foreign investment in Cuba by the rest of the \n     world (especially Europe and Canada), and the overwhelming \n     U.S. public opinion in favor of removing the sanctions.\n       The Alliance is grateful for the opportunity to have \n     concluded a second successful fact-finding mission to Cuba, \n     and intends to continue this process. The Alliance is \n     convinced that the U.S. trade restrictions must end and that \n     we must deal with the Cuban Government as it is, not as we \n     wish it to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9457-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9457-S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE NEED TO PASS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to once again ask \nthe majority to immediately bring S. 2787, the Violence Against Women \nAct of 2000, VAWA II, to the floor for a vote.\n  Yesterday the President wrote to the Majority Leader urging passage \nof VAWA II this week. This is a top priority not only for the \nAdministration but for the Nation. The President wrote: ``The Senate \nshould not delay, and I urge you to pass a freestanding version of the \nBiden-Hatch VAWA reauthorization bill this week. The women and families \nwhose lives have been scarred by domestic violence deserve nothing less \nthan immediate action by the Congress.'' The President is right.\n  This Tuesday the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act by a vote of 415 to \n3. I commend the House for finally acting on this important \nlegislation. Many of us have been urging Senate action on legislation \nto reauthorize and improve the Violence Against Women Act for months. \nWe have been stymied by the Republican leadership.\n  I also would like to thank my friend Senator Joe Biden, for his \nleadership on this issue. He has been a champion for victims of \ndomestic violence for many years. He was pivotal in the enactment of \nthe Violence Against Women Act almost a decade ago. He has been \ntireless in his efforts this year. It is time for the Senate to take up \nS. 2787, review and accept the consensus substitute and move to final \npassage. It could be done this week--today. Senator Biden has offered \nto proceed on a clean bill within 10 minutes and he is right.\n  I regret to have to remind the Senate that the authorization for the \noriginal Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, expires at the end of this \nweek on Saturday, September 30, 2000. This is outrageous. This should \nbe consensus legislation, bipartisan legislation. With a straight up or \ndown vote I have no doubt that our bill will pass overwhelmingly. \nPlaying partisan or political games with this important legislation is \nthe wrong thing to do and this is the wrong time to be playing such \ngames.\n  ``Gotcha'' games have no place in this debate or with this important \nmatter. The Violence Against Women Act II is not leverage or fodder but \nimportant legislation with 71 Senate cosponsors.\n  There is and has been no objection on the Democratic side of the \naisle to passing VAWA II. Unfortunately, there have been efforts by the \nmajority party to attach this uncontroversial legislation to the \n``poison pill'' represented by the version of bankruptcy legislation \ncurrently being advanced by Republicans and to other matters.\n  I received today a letter from the Pat Ruess of the NOW Legal Defense \nand Education Fund that emphatically makes the point the VAWA is not \n``cover'' for other legislation that hurts women. She is right. The \nbankruptcy bill as the Republicans have designed it is opposed by the \nNational Partnership for Women and Families, the National Women's Law \nCenter, the American Association of University Women and dozens of \nwomen's organization across the country. I hope that the rumors of such \nan effort by the Republican leadership will prove unfounded and that no \nsuch cynical pairing will be attempted. It is destined to fail and only \ndelays and distracts the Senate from what we should be doing--passing \nVAWA II.\n  I believe the Senate can and should pass VAWA II as a clean, stand-\nalone bill, without further delay. That is what Senator Biden urged \nTuesday.\n  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, almost one-third of \nwomen murdered each year are killed by a husband or boyfriend. In 1998, \nwomen experience about 900,000 violent offenses at the hands of an \nintimate partner. The only good news about this staggering number is \nthat it is lower than that of previous years when the number of violent \noffenses was well past 1 million. I have no doubt this drop in the \nnumbers of victims of domestic violence is due to the success of the \nprograms of the Violence Against Women Act. We should be working to \nlower that number even further by reauthorizing and expanding the \nprograms of VAWA. The country has come too far in fighting this battle \nagainst domestic violence to risk losing it because the Senate does not \npass VAWA II or someone wanting to score clever, political points for \nshort term partisan gain.\n  There is no reason to make this a political battle. We must act now.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the President's letter \nand the September 28 letter from the NOW Legal Defense and Education \nFund and a September 17, 1999 letter from the National Partnership for \nWomen & Families, National Women's Law Center and other women's \nadvocacy organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to urge you to bring the \n     reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) to \n     the Senate floor this week.\n       An estimated 900,000 women suffer violence at the hands of \n     an intimate partner each year, demonstrating the urgent need \n     for this legislation. Since VAWA was enacted, the Department \n     of Justice and Health and Human Services have awarded \n     approximately $1.6 billion in Federal grants to support the \n     work of prosecutors, law enforcement officials, the courts, \n     victim advocates, health care and social service \n     professionals, and intervention and prevention programs in \n     order to combat violence against women. We must reauthorize \n     these critical programs immediately.\n       As you know, yesterday, the House overwhelmingly passed \n     VAWA reauthorization by a vote of 415-3. In the Senate, VAWA \n     has similar bipartisan support with over 70 cosponsors. If \n     Congress does not act this week, however, VAWA's \n     authorization will expire on September 30, 2000. The Senate \n     should not delay, and I urge you to pass a freestanding \n     version of the Biden-Hatch VAWA reauthorization bill this \n     week. The women and families whose lives have been scarred by \n     domestic violence deserve nothing less than immediate action \n     by the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Now Legal Defense\n\n\n                                           and Education Fund,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: The Violence Against Women Act runs out in \n     two days. The Senate must act immediately! Do not let VAWA \n     die--pass S. 2787, the reauthorization of the Violence \n     Against Women Act. The bipartisan VAWA renewal bill, \n     sponsored by Senators Biden and Hatch, has 71 co-sponsors and \n     virtually no opposition. The House passed a similar bill on \n     Tuesday, 415-3. You must demand that this bill comes to the \n     Senate floor today, freestanding and without harmful riders.\n       It is unacceptable for the Senate to attach VAWA to or \n     partner it with any bill that the President has threatened to \n     veto. One such bill is the Bankruptcy Reform Act, a bill that \n     threatens women's economic security by:\n\n[[Page S9458]]\n\n       Making it more difficult to file bankruptcy and regain \n     economic stability afterwards.\n       Pitting women and children who are trying to collect child \n     support against powerful commercial companies trying to \n     collect credit card and other debts.\n       Punishing honest low income bankruptcy filers while \n     providing cover for individuals convicted of violating FACE \n     (clinic violence protections).\n       We cannot support a bill that uses VAWA to provide cover \n     for legislation that also hurts women. S. 2787 can be passed \n     under Unanimous Consent today. Please just do it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Patricia Blau Reuss,\n     Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Women's Law Center, National Partnership for \n           Women & Families,\n                                               September 17, 1999.\n     Re: S. 625, The ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999''\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned women's and children's \n     organizations write to urge you to oppose S. 625, the \n     ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999.''\n       Hundreds of thousands of women and their children are \n     affected by the bankruptcy system each year as debtors and \n     creditors. Indeed, women are the fastest growing group in \n     bankruptcy. In 1999, over half a million women are expected \n     to file for bankruptcy by themselves--more than men filing by \n     themselves or married couples. About 200,000 of these women \n     filers will be trying to collect child support or alimony. \n     Another 200,000 women owed child support or alimony by men \n     who file for bankruptcy will become bankruptcy creditors.\n       S. 625 puts both groups of economically vulnerable women \n     and children at greater risk. By increasing the rights of \n     many creditors, including credit card companies, finance \n     companies, auto lenders and others, the bill would set up a \n     competition for scarce resources between parents and children \n     owed child support and commercial creditors both during and \n     after bankruptcy. And single parents facing financial \n     crises--often caused by divorce, nonpayment of support, loss \n     of a job, uninsured medical expenses, or domestic violence--\n     would find it harder to regain their economic stability \n     through the bankruptcy process. The bill would make it harder \n     for these parents to meet the filing requirements; harder, if \n     they got there, to save their homes, cars, and essential \n     household items; and harder to meet their children's needs \n     after bankruptcy because many more debts would survive.\n       Contrary to the claims of some, the domestic support \n     provisions included in the bill would not solve these \n     problems. The provisions only relate to the collection of \n     support during bankruptcy from a bankruptcy filer; they do \n     nothing to alleviate the additional hardships the bill would \n     create for the hundreds of thousands of women forced into \n     bankruptcy themselves. And even for women who are owed \n     support by men who file for bankruptcy, the provisions fail \n     to ensure that support payments will come first, ahead of the \n     increased claims of the commercial creditors. Some \n     improvement were made in the domestic support provisions in \n     the Judiciary Committee. However, even the revised provisions \n     fail to solve the problems created by the rest of the bill, \n     which gives many other creditors greater claims--both during \n     and after bankruptcy--than they have under current law. The \n     bill does not ensure that, in this intensified competition \n     for the debtor's limited resources, parents and children owed \n     support will prevail over the sophisticated collection \n     departments of these powerful interests.\n       This Bankruptcy Reform Act will reduce the ability of \n     parents to pay their most important debt--their debt to their \n     children. It is for these reasons that we strongly oppose S. \n     625 and urge you to oppose it as well.\n           Very truly yours,\n       National Women's Law Center.\n       National Partnership for Women & Families.\n       ACES, Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, \n     Inc.\n       American Association of University Women.\n       American Medical Women's Association.\n       Business and Professional Women/USA.\n       Center for Law and Social Policy.\n       Center for the Advancement of Public Policy.\n       Center for the Child Care Workforce.\n       Church Women United.\n       Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW).\n       Equal Rights Advocates.\n       Feminist Majority.\n       Hadassah.\n       International Women's Insolvency & Restructuring \n     Confederation (``IWIRC'').\n       National Association of Commissions for Women (NACW).\n       National Black Women's Health Project.\n       National Center for Youth Law.\n       National Council of Jewish Women.\n       National Council of Negro Women.\n       National Organization for Women.\n       National Women's Conference.\n       Northwest Women's Law Center.\n       NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       Wider Opportunities for Women.\n       The Women Activist Fund.\n       Women Employed.\n       Women Work!\n       Women's Institute for Freedom of Press.\n       Women's Law Center of Maryland, Inc.\n       YWCA of the U.S.A.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9458-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONTINUING CLIMATE OF FEAR IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as co-chairman of the Helsinki \nCommission, I take this opportunity to update my colleagues on the \nsituation in Belarus, as I have done on previous occasions.\n  The Belarusian parliamentary elections are scheduled for October 15, \nand unfortunately, they do not meet the basic commitments outlined by \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \nconcerning free and democratic elections. Moreover, many observers have \nconcluded that the Belarusian government has not made real progress in \nfulfilling four criteria for international observation of the \nelections: respect for human rights and an end to the climate of fear; \nopposition access to the state media; a democratic electoral code; and \nthe granting of real power to the parliament that will be chosen in \nthese elections.\n  Instead, the Helsinki Commission has observed that the Lukashenka \nregime launched a campaign of intensified harassment in recent days \ndirected against members of the opposition. We have received reports \nthat just last week, Anatoly Lebedka, leader of the United Civic Party, \nwhom many of my colleagues met when he visited the Senate last year, \nwas roughed up by police after attending an observance marking the \nfirst anniversary of the disappearance of a leading member of the \ndemocratic opposition Viktor Gonchar and his associate, Anatoly \nKrasovsky. And just a few days ago, we were informed that Belarusian \nPopular Front leader Vintsuk Viachorka's request for air time on \nBelarusian television to explain why the opposition is boycotting the \nparliamentary elections was met with a hateful, disparaging diatribe on \nthe main newscast ``Panorama.''\n  This is only the tip of the iceberg--in addition, the Helsinki \nCommission is receiving reports of detentions, fines and instances of \nbeatings of opposition activists who are promoting a boycott of the \nelections by distributing leaflets or other literature or holding \nmeetings with voters. In recent weeks, we have also been informed of \nthe refusal to register many opposition candidates on dubious grounds; \nthe seizure of over 100,000 copies of the independent trade union \nnewspaper ``Rabochy''; forceful disruptions of public meetings with \nrepresentatives of the opposition; an apparent burglary of the \nheadquarters of the Social Democratic Party; a ban of the First \nFestival of Independent Press in Vitebsk, and recent ``reminder \nletters'' by the State Committee on Press for independent newspapers to \nre-register.\n  Mr. President, Belarusian opposition parties supporting the boycott \nhave received permission to stage ``Freedom March III'' this Sunday, \nOctober 1. At a number of past demonstrations, police have detained, \nharassed and beaten participants. Those in Congress who are following \ndevelopments in Belarus are hopeful that this demonstration will take \nplace peacefully, that authorities do not limit the rights of \nBelarusian citizens to freedom of association and assembly, and that \nthe Government of Belarus will refrain from acts of repression against \nthe opposition and others who openly advocate for a boycott of these \nelections.\n  Mr. President, the Helsinki Commission continue to monitor closely \nthe events surrounding these elections and we will keep the full Senate \napprized of developments in the ongoing struggle for democracy in \nBelarus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9458-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9458-S9459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SCHOOL SHOOTINGS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is not even one month into the school \nyear and yet school is canceled for the week at Carter C. Woodson \nMiddle School in New Orleans, Louisiana. On Tuesday afternoon, a 13-\nyear-old boy, who had been expelled from school for fighting, allegedly \nslipped another 13-year-old a .38-caliber revolver. The expelled teen \nwas seen passing the handgun through the school fence to the other 13-\nyear-old, who allegedly used the gun to shoot a 15-year-old schoolmate. \nAccording to witnesses, the 15-year-old then managed to get the gun \nfrom his attacker and return gunfire.\n\n[[Page S9459]]\n\n  As a result of this school day skirmish, two teenagers have been \nhospitalized in critical condition and another teen-ager has been \nbooked on charges of illegally carrying a gun and being a principal to \nattempted first-degree murder. In addition, the 600 student middle \nschool is in a ``cooling off period,'' meaning classes are canceled for \nthe rest of the week.\n  It is deeply disturbing that teen-agers have such easy access to \nhandguns. The laws in this country make it illegal for a juvenile to \npossess a handgun or a person to sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer a \nhandgun to a juvenile. Yet, with so many loopholes in our firearm \ndistribution laws, it is easy for prohibited users, such as young \npeople, to find illegal access to thousands of guns.\n  Congress can close those loopholes and act to prevent tragedies like \nthe one in New Orleans. With only one week left until the Senate's \ntarget adjournment, the time is now. We must pass sensible gun laws and \nreduce the threat of gun violence in our schools and communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9459-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

To campaign for us and in\n     1952\n       She got us elected to the U.S. Senate.\n     1977\n       We decided--after talking it over, to retire.\n       We did not owe anything to anybody--except the people of \n     Montana--nor did anyone owe anything to us.\n     1977\n       President Carter asked me if we would be interested in \n     becoming the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. Maureen thought we \n     should accept and we did and when President Reagan called and \n     asked us to stay, we did for almost 12 years.\n     1988\n       Around Xmas Maureen almost literally forced me to go to the \n     Naval Hospital at Yokosuka, which sent me to the Army \n     Hospital at Honolulu, which sent me directly to Walter Reed \n     Army Hospital where I had heart bypass and prostate \n     operations.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   CONSERVATION AND REINVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, a letter from the National Governors' \nAssociation on September 27th to the majority leader of the Senate \nexpresses the National Governors' Association's views that any final \nversion of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA) legislation \ninclude stable funding and a strong commitment to the states by \nreinvesting Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) mineral revenues into assets \nof lasting value and sharing a meaningful portion of these revenues \nwith states and territories. In addition, the letter points out that \nthe essential strengths of CARA are that it assures a dependable stream \nof funding which enables states to implement long-term capital \ninvestments and to develop cost-effective fiscal strategies.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              National Governors' Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The nation's Governors support \n     legislation that both wisely reinvests Outer Continental \n     Shelf (OCS) mineral revenues into assets of lasting value and \n     shares a meaningful portion of these revenues with states and \n     territories. We have previously endorsed H.R. 701, the \n     Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA), but recognize that \n     alternatives are being considered. We urge that any final \n     legislation allocating OCS revenues include stable funding \n     and a strong commitment to the states.\n       As new proposals are floated, we hope that you will \n     remember the essential strengths of CARA. CARA assures a \n     dependable stream of funding. This enables states to \n     implement long-term capital investments and to develop cost-\n     effective fiscal strategies. Being subjected to the annual \n     appropriations process will not provide the stability \n     necessary for states to take advantage of low-interest bonds, \n     enter into voluntary conservation agreements with private \n     landowners, and invest in long-term programs to recover \n     declining species. A one-year appropriation to state programs \n     simply will not address concerns.\n       CARA also focuses on conserving and preserving both federal \n     and state assets. Parks, estuaries, wildlife, and historical \n     properties are not limited to federal lands. A meaningful \n     share of the Outer Continental Shelf revenues should be \n     shared with the states and territories so that investments in \n     the conservation of America can occur in a comprehensive \n     manner. This hallmark of CARA is the investment of resources \n     and the empowerment of states to set their own priorities, \n     particularly as they respond to federal mandates and fulfill \n     state environmental goals. These fundamental elements must be \n     incorporated into any final legislation.\n       As you know, Representative Norman D. Dicks (D-Wash.) \n     recently proposed a ``Lands Legacy Trust'' fund amendment to \n     the fiscal 2001 Interior appropriations conference report. \n     Many Governors perceive the Dicks amendment as a departure \n     from the principles of CARA. The Dicks amendment does not \n     guarantee an increase in net funding or guarantee full \n     funding for conservation programs.\n       The reported CARA compromise reached by congressional \n     leaders on September 26th is an approach that more closely \n     resembles the principles of CARA. This proposal has the \n     support of the National Governors' Association (NGA) and \n     should be strongly considered as a viable option as \n     negotiations proceed.\n       On behalf of NGA, we urge that any final legislation \n     allocating OCS revenues address the concerns we have raised. \n     We appreciate your efforts to conserve the nation's most \n     valuable resources by creating a lasting and comprehensive \n     legacy for the American people and future generations.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Thomas J. Wilsack,\n                            Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n     Governor Frank Keating,\n     Vice Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9460-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

DAVID'S CHURCH AND ST. PETER'S CHURCH\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n300th anniversary of St. David's Church in Berwyn, Pennsylvania and St. \nPeter's Church in the Great Valley, near Paoli, Pennsylvania. The two \nparishes were established in 1700 as mission churches of the historic \nChrist Church, Philadelphia to serve those that settled Chester County.\n  Philadelphia is where so many of our Founders came together to \ndeliberate, sign the Declaration of Independence and fight in battles \nduring the Revolutionary War. Both churches, now nationally registered \nlandmarks, were involved in the war. St. David's parish sent forth \nGeneral Anthony Wayne to fight with General Washington, and St. Peter's \nserved as a field hospital for soldiers that were wounded.\n  For 300 years--longer than we have been a nation--these two churches \nhave been vital elements of the communities in which they reside and \nserve. Governor Tom Ridge recently selected St. Peter's Church, a \nregistered historical landmark, as the site for the signing of \nPennsylvania's ``Growing Greener'' bill.\n  On October 21, 2000 these two churches will hold a combined \nanniversary celebration at St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley. The \ncelebration will feature historic symposia, period food and\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\ncostume, and the burial of a time capsule. This event will enable \npeople to gain insight into the lives of our historic forebears. I \ncommend area leaders for initiating such a celebration and look forward \nto the upcoming festivities.\n  I am therefore pleased to celebrate the 300th anniversary of St. \nDavid's Church and St. Peter's Church. To honor this event, I put \nforward the following proclamation:\n\n       Whereas, 300 years ago, St. David's Church and St. Peter's \n     Church in the Great Valley were founded as missions of the \n     historic Christ Church, Philadelphia;\n       Whereas, the congregations of St. David's Church and St. \n     Peter's Church in the Great Valley played a vital role in the \n     early growth of historic Chester County, Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas, St. David's Church was the home parish and \n     eventual burial site for General Anthony Wayne, a hero of the \n     American Revolution;\n       Whereas, St. David's Church and its graveyard are \n     registered as a National Historic Landmark;\n       Whereas, St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley is a \n     registered National Historic Landmark which served recently \n     as the site selected by the Governor of Pennsylvania for the \n     signing of the ``Growing Greener'' land conservation bill;\n       Whereas, St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church in the \n     Great Valley have sent their parishioners out into the larger \n     community as public servants throughout their history;\n       Whereas, St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church in the \n     Great Valley continue to serve their communities, their State \n     and the Nation as strong civic partners in numerous programs \n     to provide food, shelter, clothing, education, health care, \n     and other forms of nurture to those in need;\n       Now therefore be it resolved by the United States Senate \n     That St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church in the Great \n     Valley be officially recognized and commended on the occasion \n     of their 300th anniversary of worship, September 2, \n     2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9461-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF WILLIAM HERNANDEZ\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize William \nHernandez for his efforts as president of the Hispanic State Parade of \nNew Jersey. His work has done a great deal for Hispanic-Americans, and \nit is an honor to acknowledge him today.\n  As president of the Hispanic State Parade of New Jersey, Mr. \nHernandez has been able to honor the accomplishments of many prominent \nHispanic-Americans. For the last three years he has also served as the \npresident of DesFile Hispanoacericano of New Jersey. During that time, \nhe has worked to arrange the first international cultural and health \nfair, and create unity and cultural pride among Hispanic-Americans.\n  Mr. Hernandez is an extremely talented and energetic individual. His \nwork on behalf of Hispanic-Americans has been truly beneficial, and I \nam confident he will continue to work tirelessly for all Americans of \nHispanic decent as well as all of society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9461-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING MOUNT SAINT CHARLES ACADEMY\n\n Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this past weekend, Mount Saint \nCharles Academy of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, was honored at a ceremony \nrecognizing it as a Blue Ribbon School. I would like to commend them on \nthis outstanding achievement.\n  ``Mount,'' as it is called in Rhode Island has long been recognized \nnationally for its elite hockey program. In fact, the Mounties hockey \nteam is so good that they have won the last 23 Rhode Island State \nChampionships--a record--and during that stretch they skated their way \nto ten straight High School National Championships.\n  But in Rhode Island, Mount Saint Charles is best known for its \nexcellent academic reputation. It is great to see ``Mount'' recognized \nnationally for its academic excellence, not just its hockey.\n  The Blue Ribbon School program rewards schools that excel in all \nareas of academic leadership, teaching and teacher development, and \nschool curriculum. Schools are chosen through a competitive application \nprocess that rates each school on two areas. The first category, \n``Conditions of Effective Schooling,'' includes teaching environment, \ncurriculum and instruction, parent and community support, and student \nenvironment. The second category, ``Indicators of Success,'' includes \nstudent test performance, high attendance and graduation rates, as well \nas postgraduate pursuits.\n  I am proud to see a Rhode Island school recognized nationally for \nsetting the bar high, and I applaud the teachers, principles, and \nstudents who have worked so hard to make Mount Saint Charles a Blue \nRibbon School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9461-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE TURNER HILL BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is with great personal joy and \npride that I come before you today to commemorate an anniversary that \nis of particular importance to my family and me. One hundred years ago, \non October 13, 1900, in a borrowed school building at the intersection \nof McDaniel and Rockland Roads, sixteen original members of the Turner \nHill Baptist Church convened for the first time.\n  The group enjoyed being together and quickly became a strong extended \nfamily. In fact, within months of their first meeting at the Old County \nLine School, the members decided to cement their closeness by \nconstructing a permanent church building of their own. On land donated \nby E.L. Turner and as a result of its members' ingenuity and hard work, \nthe beginning of 1901 marked the opening of Turner Hill Baptist Church, \na wooden structure heated by one wood stove and lit by kerosene lamps.\n  Although the congregation moved to a new brick structure in 1954, the \noriginal wooden building and the work that went into its creation \ncontinue to embody the values of all those associated with the church. \nDespite the absence of Turner Hill's original sixteen members at \ntoday's centennial celebration, many of their descendants are delighted \nto take part. By the same token, some of the original nine families, \nincluding my own, who were present as the church opened in 1901 \ncontinue to attend regular services: Turner Hill has both fifth and \nsixth generation members. I am also proud to be related to both the \nchurch's current youngest and oldest members. While my father, Mr. \nJoseph Hugh Cleland, and Aunt, Mrs. Georgia Mae Cleland Johnston, are \nTurner Hill's most senior members, my cousin, Miss Jessica Wages is the \nnewest addition to the 151 member congregation.\n  Over the years, the church itself and the faces in the pews have \nchanged, but one thing has remained a constant--community. My friends \nand family at Turner Hill have pulled together in times of crisis and \njoined each other in celebration throughout the years. Behind the \nleadership of Reverend Farrell Wilkins and with God and family at the \ncenter of their lives, the members of my church today commemorate an \nhistoric anniversary. May their next hundred years be as prosperous as \ntheir first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9461-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9461-S9462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF FATHER ALBERT R. CUTIE\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nFather Albert R. Cutie, to whom the 25th Hispanic-American Parade of \nNew Jersey Annual Banquet is being dedicated. This tremendous honor is \nbeing bestowed upon an individual who is a true example of the \npossibilities that are available to all in our great nation.\n  Father Albert's parents were forced, like many others, to flee from \nCuba to Spain due to the atheist-communist dictatorship that took over \ntheir homeland. Fortunately, his family was reunited a few years later \nin San Juan, Puerto Rico, and was able to emigrate to the United States \nwhen he was seven years old. Here he has been able to pursue a life \nthat would not have been possible in communist Cuba.\n  Father Albert has always been a talented and industrious soul. From a \nyoung age, he showed vibrant entrepreneurial skills by turning his love \nfor music into his own business. During his High School years his \nexperience in parish youth groups and spiritual retreats began to \nfoster his great love for the Church and its mission. Hearing his \ncalling, Father Albert entered the Seminary in 1987 and was ordained on \nMay 13, 1995.\n  Since his ordination, countless individuals have benefitted from \nFather Albert's love and guidance. Not only does he continue to reach \nout to individuals, families, the sick, and those in need, but he works \ndiligently to give\n\n[[Page S9462]]\n\nthe youth of our society a better future.\n  We are truly fortunate to have an individual such as Father Albert as \na member of our society. I am confident that our future is much \nbrighter thanks to the efforts of Father Albert and other young \nAmericans like him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9462-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNITION OF OUR LADY OF PROVIDENCE JUNIOR/SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL IN \n  CLARKSVILLE, INDIANA, WINNER OF THE PRESTIGIOUS BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS \n                                 AWARD\n\n Mr. BAYH.

Mr. President, as the Senate nears adjournment I \nwant to pay a special tribute to a special member of the Armed Services \nCommittee's Minority staff. After a long and successful career in both \nthe Executive and Legislative Branch, but mostly here in the United \nStates Senate, Jan Gordon will be leaving our staff on November 30. \nSpeaking not only for myself, but on behalf of the entire Committee and \nour staff, I can tell you that Jan will be sorely missed.\n  A native North Carolinian, in 1972 Jan Gordon was recruited by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation to come to Washington, D.C. to work as \nan executive secretary in their Intelligence Division. While her heart \nalways remained in North Carolina, her feet became firmly planted in \nWashington.\n  After four years at the FBI, Jan began her Senate career, working \nfirst on the staff of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee, and then nine \nand a half years for the Secretary of the Senate in the Office of \nNational Security Information, which later became what is now the \nOffice of Senate Security. Countless numbers of my colleagues and staff \nwho attended classified briefings or conferences up in S-407 of the \nCapitol during that period have first hand knowledge of Jan Gordon's \nsuperior administrative abilities and organizational skills.\n  In 1987, Chairman Sam Nunn of the Armed Service Committee appointed \nJan Gordon as a staff assistant, and she was charged with the very \ndemanding task supporting the staff and work of the Strategic \nSubcommittee. Not surprisingly, Jan rose to the occasion. She met all \nof the needs of the Subcommittee, while at the same time she had sole \nresponsibility for the processing and printing of typically 20-25 \nhearing transcripts per year, many of which were classified. Because \nher work was so excellent, Jan Gordon was the person Committee's Chief \nClerk turned to when new staff assistants needed to be taught ``how to \ndo things the right way.''\n  When I became Ranking Minority Member of the Committee in 1997 \nfollowing Senator San Nunn's retirement from the Senate, one of the \nquickest and easiest decisions I made was to ask Jan to continue \nworking for me and the rest of the Committee's Minority Members and \nstaff. I was delighted that she accepted my offer, because Jan is a \nvaluable and key member of the Minority Staff of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Jan Gordon's service on the staff of the Armed Services Committee has \nbeen remarkable. She has an uncompromising work ethic and a strong \ndedication to duty. Of the over 5,000 days she will have worked for the \nArmed Services Committee when she retires, she has only had seven sick \ndays. Being late to work, cutting any corner for the sake of moving a \nproject forward, or not being totally cooperative and responsive are \nforeign and unacceptable concepts to Jan. Her steadfast attention to \ndetail is legendary around the Committee, as is her commitment to \nmeeting the highest standards in everything she does.\n  Jan Gordon has always given completely of herself each and every day \nof the nearly fourteen years she has served on the staff of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. When she departs the Committee staff, all of \nus will remember her for her professionalism, her enthusiasm, and the \nconsistently high standard she set for herself. We are grateful for her \nservice to the Senate and the Nation, and we wish her many years of \nhealth and happiness in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9462-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GEORGIA EARLY LEARNING INITIATIVE\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, with a focus on the horizon and a \nknowledge of where we've been, I come before you today to laud a group \nthat has dedicated its time and resources to Georgia's youth in \nattempts to secure a brighter future for us all. Throughout its \nexistence, The Georgia Early Learning Initiative, a collaboration of \nbusiness and labor leaders, health and human service providers, \neducators, and legislators, has sought to increase access to, and \nfunding for, early education throughout our state.\n  As a reflection of today's fast-paced society, households \nincreasingly boast two working parents who can neither afford to miss \nwork nor pay the often exorbitant cost of childcare in our country. In \nfact, while only forty percent of children are cared for by a parent \nall day, sixty-seven percent of Georgia mothers with children under age \nsix are in the workforce. Increasingly, many parents want to stay home, \nyet have no choice but to work. However, it takes a dedicated and \nselfless group of people to bring about results; there is no greater \nchampion of Georgia's children and investment in the future than The \nGeorgia Early Learning Initiative.\n  A child's pre-school years are more important than we have previously \nacknowledged. With 554,430 Georgia children currently enrolled in \npreschool, and the knowledge that ninety percent of human brain \nfunctions develop during the first three years of life, early learning \nand improved childcare are perhaps more important than ever before. It \nis our responsibility as a nation and leaders to support activists who \nare willing to fight for worthy causes, especially when those causes \nwill benefit generations to come. We owe it to our children to provide \nequal access to early learning options which will place them on a \nsecure footing and will allow them to excel in life. It is the mission \nof the dedicated men and women who comprise the Georgia Early Learning \nInitiative to increase childcare choices for parents and to extend the \nopportunity to succeed to all of America's children, no matter what \ntheir family's station in life. In the future, we will only be as \nstrong as our children. As Pearl Buck said, ``If our American way of \nlife fails the child, it fails us all.''\n  As I think back to where we have been and once again focus on the \nglorious horizon, I cannot help but feel optimistic about our future \nknowing that men and women like those working with the Georgia Early \nLearning Initiative continue to fight for a better tomorrow for all of \nour children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9462-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9462-S9463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE JUDGE JULIO FUENTES\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

This distinguished member of my State is \nbeing honored with the dedication of the 25th Hispanic-American Parade \nof New Jersey Annual Banquet in his name, and it\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\ngives me great pleasure to recognize his accomplishments.\n  Judge Fuentes is a man of great intellect and a distinguished record \nof public service. He is constantly seeking to improve himself, as can \nbe attested to by his pursuit of master's degrees in Latin American \naffairs and liberal arts during his time as a sitting judge. Those who \nhave had the opportunity to work with Judge Fuentes universally praise \nhis integrity as well as the depth and breadth of his knowledge of the \nlaw.\n  Through a great internal drive and determination, Judge Fuentes has \nrisen from Newark Municipal Court Judge to his current post of judge \nfor the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Fuentes also has the \ndistinction of being the first Hispanic-American to sit on this \nprestigious court, an honor he has truly earned.\n  Judge Fuentes is a good, honest, decent man. He is an exemplar of the \ncoveted American ideal of public service. It was truly an honor to be \nable to recommend his nomination to President Clinton. We are truly \nfortunate to have someone of his immense capabilities and desire for \npublic service sitting as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9463-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9463-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1295.

Mr. President, in the last decade, DNA testing has become \nthe most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when \nbiological evidence of the crime is recovered. While DNA testing is \nstandard in pre-trial investigations today, the issue of post-\nconviction DNA testing has emerged in recent years as the technology \nfor testing has improved. Because biological evidence, such as semen or \nhair from a rape, is often preserved by authorities years after trial, \nit is possible to submit preserved biological evidence for DNA testing. \nIn cases that were tried before DNA technology existed, and in which \nbiological evidence was preserved after conviction, post-conviction \ntesting is feasible.\n  While the exact number is subject to dispute, post-conviction DNA \ntesting has exonerated prisoners who were convicted of crimes committed \nbefore DNA technology existed. In some of these cases, the post-\nconviction DNA testing that exonerated a wrongly convicted person led \nto the apprehension of the actual criminal. In response to these cases, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee has examined various state post-\nconviction DNA statutes, held a hearing on post-conviction DNA testing, \nand sought the expertise of federal and state prosecutors and criminal \ndefense lawyers.\n  To ensure that post-conviction DNA testing is available in \nappropriate cases, I, along with Senators Lott, Nickles, Mack, McCain, \nThurmond, Grassley, Kyl, Abraham, DeWine, Sessions, R. Smith, G. Smith, \nCollins, Fitzgerald, Helms, Santorum, Hagel,\n\n[[Page S9467]]\n\nShelby, Warner, Inhofe, Snowe, Allard, Brownback, Grams, Bennett, \nCochran, T. Hutchinson, and Frist are introducing the Criminal Justice \nIntegrity and Law Enforcement Assistance Act today. This Act authorizes \npost-conviction DNA testing in federal cases and encourages the States, \nthrough a grant program, to authorize post-conviction DNA testing in a \nconsistent manner in state cases. In addition, the Act provides $60 \nmillion in grants to help States reduce the backlog of DNA evidence to \nbe analyzed and to conduct post-conviction DNA testing.\n  The Criminal Justice Integrity Act was based in large part on the \nsuccessful post-conviction DNA testing statute in Illinois. The \nIllinois statute has worked particularly well, as Illinois has the most \npost-conviction DNA exonerations in the Nation. Like the Illinois \nstatute, the Criminal Justice Integrity Act authorizes post-conviction \nDNA testing only in cases in which testing has the potential to prove \nthe prisoner's innocence. This standard will allow testing in \npotentially meritorious cases without wasting scarce prosecutorial and \njudicial resources on frivolous cases. It is significant that the \nIllinois statute has worked well without overburdening the State's law \nenforcement or judicial systems.\n  Mr. President, given that post-conviction DNA testing is a complex \nlegal issue, I would like to discuss the legal standard to obtain \ntesting in the Illinois statute and in the Criminal Justice Integrity \nAct. While the Illinois statute is somewhat vague, several Illinois \nCourt of Appeals decisions have interpreted the standard for obtaining \npost-conviction testing under the statute. See People v. Gholston, 697 \nN.E.2d 375 (1998); People v. Dunn, 713 N.E.2d 568 (1999); People v. \nSavory, 722 N.E.2d 220 (1999). As these decisions make clear, post-\nconviction testing is allowed under the Illinois statute only if the \ntesting has ``the potential to establish the defendant's innocence.''\n  For example, in People v. Gholston, the defendant and five companions \nwere convicted of raping a woman and assaulting and robbing her two \nmale companions in 1981. In 1995, the defendant filed a motion to \ncompel DNA testing of the victim's rape kit to prove that he did not \nparticipate in the gang rape. The trial court dismissed the motion for \ntesting, and the appellate court affirmed.\n  In affirming the denial of testing, the court ruled that a ``negative \nDNA match would not exculpate defendant Gholston due to the multiple \ndefendants involved, the lack of evidence regarding ejaculation by the \ndefendant Gholston and defendant's own admission of guilt under a \ntheory of accountability.'' Id. at 379.\n  In People v. Dunn, the defendant was convicted in 1979 of a rape in \nwhich there was only one attacker. The defendant petitioned for post-\nconviction relief, and the trial court dismissed the petition. On \nappeal, the court remanded the motion to determine whether post-\nconviction testing was appropriate under the Illinois statute.\n  In remanding the motion, the court distinguished the facts in Dunn \nfrom Gholston, noting that post-conviction testing was denied in \nGholston because ``the test results could not have been conclusive of \ndefendant's guilt or innocence.'' Id. at 571. Under the facts in Dunn, \nthe court held that the decision in Gholston would not prevent post-\nconviction testing ``where DNA testing would be determinative'' of \nguilt or innocence. Id. The court remanded the motion to the trial \ncourt to determine ``whether any conclusive result is obtainable from \nDNA testing.'' Id.\n  The most extensive discussion of the standard for obtaining post-\nconviction testing under the Illinois statute occurred in People v. \nSavory. In Savory, the defendant was convicted of stabbing two people \nto death in 1977. In 1998, the defendant sought DNA testing of \nbloodstained pants that were recovered from his home. The trial court \ndenied the motion for DNA testing, and the appeals court affirmed.\n  The court held that DNA testing on the bloodstained pants could not \nexonerate the defendant because a negative DNA match could merely \nindicate that the defendant did not wear those pants during the \nmurders. At trial, Savory's father testified that the pants were his \nand that he, not the defendant, was responsible for the bloodstains. In \naddition, there was other, overwhelming evidence of the defendant's \nguilt.\n  The court in Savory noted that in Gholston, post-conviction testing \nwas denied because ``DNA testing could not conclusively establish \ndefendant's guilt or innocence.'' In discussing the Illinois statute, \nthe court stated:\n\n       Based on the plain language of [the Illinois statute] and \n     on the interpretation of [the statute] in Gholston and Dunn, \n     we believe that the legislature intended to provide a \n     process of total vindication . . . [I]n using the term \n     ``actual innocence,'' the legislature intended to limit \n     the scope of the [Illinois statute], allowing for \n     scientific testing only where it has the potential to \n     exonerate a defendant. Id. at 224.\n\n  Under the facts in Savory, the court denied post-conviction testing \nbecause ``although DNA testing carries the possibility of weakening the \nState's original case against the defendant, it does not have the \npotential to prove him innocent.'' Id. at 225.\n  In short, post-conviction testing is allowed under the Illinois \nstatute only where testing ``could be conclusive of the defendant's \nguilt or innocence''; only where ``DNA testing would be \ndeterminative''; only if ``any conclusive result is obtainable from DNA \ntesting''; and only where post-conviction testing ``has the potential \nto exonerate a defendant.''\n  The Criminal Justice Integrity Act has a similar legal standard to \nobtain testing. The Act authorizes testing if the prisoner makes a \n``prima facie showing'' that identity was at issue at trial and DNA \ntesting would, assuming exculpatory results, establish actual \ninnocence. A ``prima facie showing'' is a lenient requirement that is \ndefined as ``simply a sufficient showing of possible merit to warrant a \nfuller exploration by the district court.'' See Bennett v. U.S., 119 \nF.3d 468 (7th Cir. 1997). Thus, under the Criminal Justice Integrity \nAct, post-conviction testing is ordered if the prisoner makes a \n``sufficient showing of possible merit'' that identity was at issue at \ntrial and DNA testing would, assuming exculpatory results, establish \nactual innocence. In other words, the Act requires a showing that post-\nconviction testing has the potential to prove innocence. This is \nconsistent with--and no more difficult than--the legal standard in the \nIllinois statute. If post-conviction DNA testing can establish a \nprisoner's innocence, such a prisoner can obtain testing under the \nCriminal Justice Integrity Act.\n  If post-conviction DNA testing is performed and produces exculpatory \nevidence, the Criminal Justice Integrity Act allows the prisoner to \nmove for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, \nnotwithstanding the time limits on such motions applicable to other \nforms of newly discovered evidence. In so doing, the Act relies on \nestablished judicial procedures. In addition, the Criminal Justice \nIntegrity Act prohibits authorities from destroying biological evidence \nwhich was preserved in cases in which identity was at issue for the \nduration of the Act, and it authorizes the court to appoint counsel for \nan indigent prisoner who seeks post-conviction testing.\n  Mr. President, the Criminal Justice Integrity and Law Enforcement \nAssistance Act is the only federal post-conviction DNA legislation that \nis supported by the law enforcement community. The Criminal Justice \nIntegrity Act was unanimously endorsed by the bipartisan board of the \nNational District Attorneys Association. In addition, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the \nNational Sheriffs' Association have endorsed the bill. I am proud to \nhave the support of the law enforcement community for this important \nlegislation.\n  In closing, I would like to note that advanced DNA testing improves \nthe just and fair implementation of the death penalty. While the \nCriminal Justice Integrity Act applies both to non-capital and capital \ncases, I think the Act is especially important in death penalty cases. \nWhile reasonable people can differ about capital punishment, it is \nindisputable that advanced DNA testing lends support and credibility to \nthe accuracy and integrity of capital cases. For example, earlier this \nyear, Texas Governor George W. Bush, granted a temporary reprieve to a \ndeath row inmate, Ricky McGinn, to allow post-conviction DNA testing on \nevidence recovered from the victim. In 1995, McGinn was convicted of \nraping and murdering his 12-year-old stepdaughter. McGinn's lawyers had \nargued\n\n[[Page S9468]]\n\nthat additional DNA testing could prove that McGinn did not rape the \nvictim, and therefore, was not eligible for the death penalty.\n  The DNA testing was recently completed, and the test results \nconfirmed that McGinn raped the victim, in addition to murdering her. \nIn short, as the McGinn case demonstrates, we are in a better position \nthan ever before to ensure that only the guilty are executed. All \nAmericans--supporters and opponents of the death penalty alike--should \nrecognize that DNA testing provides a powerful safeguard in capital \ncases. We should be thankful for this amazing technological \ndevelopment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the endorsements of this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Grand Lodge,\n\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                    Albuquerque, NM, July 5, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing on behalf of the more than \n     290,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise \n     you of our strong support of legislation you intend to \n     introduce entitled the ``Criminal Justice integrity and Law \n     Enforcement Assistance Act.''\n       Political opponents of the death penalty have renewed their \n     assault wrongly citing ``mistakes'' in the justice system \n     which leads to the execution of innocent persons. One of \n     their ploys in their effort to suspend the practice \n     indefinitely calls for post-conviction DNA testing, a \n     relative new technology. We find it very sad that political \n     considerations are intruding in such a way that real justice \n     is thwarted, not furthered.\n       The FOP vehemently opposes the thinly veiled political \n     attempts to end capital punishment, like S. 2073, offered by \n     Ranking Member Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT). This legislation \n     would require expensive, post conviction testing in thousands \n     of unnecessary cases such as those in which no exculpatory \n     evidence is likely to be found. The bill places vital law \n     enforcement funds like the Community Oriented Policing \n     Services (COPS), the Edward J. Byrne and DNA Identification \n     grant programs in jeopardy by requiring all states to adopt \n     this standard. His bill would prohibit the death penalty for \n     Federal crimes committed in certain states and provide \n     Federal grants to nonprofit organizations subsidizing the \n     American Civil Liberties Union's (ACLU) representation of \n     defendants in capital cases. In essence, Senator Leahy's bill \n     is an effort to kill the death penalty.\n       The legislation which you shared with us would authorize \n     post-conviction DNA testing for a thirty (30) month period \n     and only in a narrow class of cases where the identity of the \n     perpetrator was at issue during trial and, assuming \n     exculpatory results, would establish the innocence of the \n     defendant. The FOP strongly approves of the time limitation \n     because the issue of post-conviction testing involves only \n     past cases where the technology was not available. DNA \n     testing is now standard in pretrial investigations.\n       Your proposed legislation would also provide $60 million to \n     the states in an effort to reduce the nationwide backlog of \n     unanalyzed DNA samples from convicted offenders and crime \n     scenes. In order to qualify for these grants, states must \n     allow post-conviction testing in a manner consistent with the \n     procedures established by this bill.\n       The FOP has confidence in our nation's justice system and \n     yet recognizes that no system is ever perfect. For this \n     reason, we support a time-limited window for post-conviction \n     DNA testing in those few cases where innocence might be \n     proved.\n       I want to thank you for sharing this draft with us and we \n     look forward to working with you and your staff to get this \n     legislation enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Gilbert G. Callegos,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 National District\n\n\n                                        Attorneys Association,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, August 16, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: The National District Attorneys \n     Association, with over 7,000 members, represents the local \n     prosecutors of this nation. Our members try, by far, the \n     majority of criminal cases in this country and our expertise \n     in prosecuting violent criminals is second to none--as is our \n     dedication to protecting the innocent. In keeping with this \n     charge, the Board of Directors of the National District \n     Attorneys Association has voted, unanimously, to support the \n     ``Criminal Justice Integrity and Law Enforcement Assistance \n     Act,'' for which you serve as the primary sponsor.\n       New technologies, such as DNA testing, can assist in \n     establishing guilt or innocence in cases when used \n     appropriately. In the application of any new technology, post \n     conviction testing must be reserved for those defendants who \n     can actually benefit from the application of the advance of \n     science and not merely raise spurious claims.\n       Testing DNA, or any other scientific evidence, is costly \n     and requires trained technicians to collect the evidence, \n     conduct analyses of the samples and provide the requisite \n     records and testimony to the court. Advancing unfounded \n     demands for post conviction tests would not only delay on \n     going investigations and trials but also deny those truly \n     deserving of a reassessment of the evidence in their case a \n     timely review.\n       Adhering to these principles we believe that post \n     conviction testing must be reserved for:\n       defendants who have consistently maintained their \n     innocence--if the defendant has voluntarily confessed to the \n     offense or has pled guilty then they should not have the \n     requisite standing to challenge their guilt; and\n       have contested the issue of identification at tiral--DNA \n     testing goes to the issue of identification, nothing else; \n     and\n       who can make a prima facie showing that a favorable test \n     would demonstrate their innocence.\n       The latter point is most crucial. In many cases an \n     individual can be guilty of a crime, in which DNA evidence \n     may be available, yet not have been the individual who left \n     the evidence. For instance an individual can be convicted of \n     rape by holding down a victim even though he never actually \n     has intercourse or they may never have ejaculated; in a \n     like fashion the driver of a ``get away'' car can be \n     convicted of murder even though she never enters the \n     convenience store.\n       The federal government does have a vital role to play in \n     this effort to hasten appropriate post conviction relief in \n     fostering the use of DNA testing but cannot, and must not, \n     usurp state prerogatives in preserving the sanctity of their \n     respective systems of criminal justice. If post conviction \n     testing DNA evidence indicates potentially favorable results, \n     the issue should be addressed, under state criminal \n     procedures, as a timely claim of newly discovered evidence \n     and be accorded review under normal state standards.\n       The legitimate role of the federal government in this \n     effort is to encourage and assist the states in developing \n     the means to conduct post conviction testing of scientific \n     evidence. Given the serious, and continuing, backlog of DNA \n     cases in particular, federal help can, and must be directed \n     towards exponential increases in the capabilities of the \n     state laboratory systems.\n       Withholding critical funding or mandating how states must \n     use federal programs is counterproductive to the effort to \n     obtain viable post conviction relief. Federal assistance must \n     be devoted to permitting each state to apply resources to \n     support and reinforce their respective systems. Moreover \n     federal assistance must be incorporated, by the individual \n     states, into efforts to upgrade laboratory capabilities \n     across the board.\n       To be meaningful, DNA testing, and post conviction relief \n     measures, must be truly dispositive of a defendant's guilt or \n     innocence and not merely a pretext to stymie justice--for \n     himself or others. The ``Criminal Justice Integrity and Law \n     Enforcement Assistance Act'' provides for this balance of \n     resources and we most strongly urge that it be passed by the \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert M.A. Johnson,\n       County Attorney, Ano- ka County, Minnesota, President, \n     National District Attorneys Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                          of Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am writing to \n     express our strong support for the Criminal Justice Integrity \n     and Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 2000. As you know, the \n     IACP is world's oldest and largest association of law \n     enforcement executives with more than 18,000 members in 100 \n     countries.\n       The use of DNA evidence represents the logical next step in \n     technological advancement of criminal investigations and is \n     in keeping with law enforcement's obligation to use the most \n     advanced and accurate methods of investigating crime and \n     proving criminal activity in a court of law. The IACP \n     strongly supports the collection and use of DNA evidence and \n     has consistently called for legislation that would promote \n     greater use of DNA technology and include funding to analyze \n     both convicted offender and crime scene DNA samples. The \n     provisions of the Criminal Justice Integrity and Law \n     Enforcement Assistance Act advance these goals.\n       Currently, more than 700,000 DNA samples taken from \n     convicted felons and recovered from crime scenes remain \n     unanalyzed due to the limited resources of state and local \n     law enforcement agencies. This backlog severely threatens the \n     timeliness of quality forensic examinations that are critical \n     to solving crimes. By authorizing $60 million to assist \n     states in reducing the current backlog of DNA samples the \n     Criminal Justice Integrity and Law Enforcement Assistance Act \n     will greatly increase the ability of state and local law \n     enforcement agencies to make efficient and effective use of \n     DNA evidence.\n       In addition, by limiting post conviction DNA tests to only \n     those cases where the results have the potential to \n     conclusively establish an individual's innocence of the\n\n[[Page S9469]]\n\n     crime for which they were convicted, this act properly \n     ensures that justice is served without burdening the court \n     system and forensic laboratories with thousands of cases.\n       Thank you for your continued support of the nation's law \n     enforcement agencies. We look forward to working with you on \n     this issue of vital importance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Michael D. Robinson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am very pleased that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah has recognized the need to address the important issue of \npost-conviction DNA testing at the federal level and am proud to join \nhis efforts. Senator Hatch's Criminal Justice Integrity and Law \nEnforcement Assistant Act is an excellent bill that has the strong \nsupport from law enforcement officials. It will provide much-needed \nfunds for law enforcement authorities to analyze convicted offender DNA \nsamples and DNA evidence gathered from crime scenes.\n  However, it has become abundantly clear over recent years that \nfunding is not the only problem in the post-conviction DNA testing \ndebate. In determining guilt and innocence, our criminal justice system \noccasionally makes mistakes. It is our responsibility to take every \nreasonable measure to prevent miscarriages of justice. Perhaps the \ngravest injustice that could occur is wrongful imprisonment of an \ninnocent person. Ensuring that all defendants have access to competent \ncounsel would go a long way to minimize the risk of unjust \nincarceration.\n  Some will say that there is no problem, or that it is so rare as to \nbe negligible, or that we do not yet know the true extent of the \nproblem and should not introduce legislation until we do. I strongly \ndisagree. Although officers of America's courts and law enforcement \nwork extremely hard to ensure that the true perpetrators of heinous \ncrimes are caught and convicted, there have been errors that have sent \ninnocent men to death row--innocent people like you and me who did not \ndeserve to be there. While some states, like my home State of Oregon, \nwork hard to ensure that defendants are represented by competent \ncounsel, other states clearly do not. Without a federal standard, there \nis a real risk that innocent people tried in states without adequate \nstandards for defense counsel could be unjustly incarcerated, or in \nrate cases, even sentenced to death. Setting federal standards for \ncompetent counsel for all defendants is a very reasonable step to make \nsure that our system of criminal justice operates fairly regardless of \nwhere you live.\n  Senator Leahy and I have introduced the Innocence Protection Act, \nwhich would address the vital issue of competency of counsel, among \nother things. Although the Criminal Justice Integrity Act, as \nintroduced, does not address the issue of competency of counsel, \nSenator Hatch has promised to work with me and others to consider this \nissue when any post-conviction DNA testing legislation is considered in \nthe Senate. I commend Senator Hatch for his interest in this matter, \nand for his willingness to work with me to produce a bill that will \ntruly make a good system even better.\n  Mr. Hatch. I promise the distinguished Senator from Oregon that I \nwill take up this issue in the months ahead. The issue of competency of \ncounsel for indigents in state capital cases is a difficult issue for \nseveral reasons. First, it is not clear that this is a nationwide \nproblem. For example, in Utah and Oregon, there does not appear to be a \nproblem concerning the representation of indigents in capital cases. \nSecond, the anecdotal examples cited in the media of poor capital \nrepresentation occurred many years ago. For example, the death penalty \ntrial of Gary Graham, which has been repeatedly mentioned in the press, \noccurred in 1981. Third, the States that seem to have a problem in this \narea recently made improvements. In 1995, Texas Governor George W. Bush \nsigned legislation that provided indigent capital defendants the right \nto have two attorneys represent them at trial. Just this year, Alabama \npassed a law that compensates lawyers who represent indigents in \ncapital trials at $100 per hour.\n  In short, I would like to know more about the extent of this problem \nbefore I introduce legislation. Thankfully, the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics is releasing a comprehensive study of state indigent legal \ndefense services in December. I am hopeful that this study will provide \nthe information necessary to evaluate the extent of this problem. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Smith in the months ahead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 3131. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure that the Secretary of Health and Human Services provides \nappropriate guidance to physicians and other health care providers that \nare attempting to properly submit claims under the Medicare Program and \nto ensure that the Secretary targets truly fraudulent activity for \nenforcement of medicare billing regulations, rather than inadvertent \nbilling errors; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   medicare billing and education act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, right now, all across America, Medicare \nbeneficiaries are seeking medical care from a flawed health care \nsystem. Reduced benefit packages, ever escalating costs, and limited \naccess in rural areas are just a few of the problems our system faces \non a daily basis. For this reason, Congress must continue to move \ntowards the modernization of Medicare. But as we address the needs of \nbeneficiaries, we must not turn our back upon the very providers that \nseniors rely upon for their care.\n  These providers are the physicians, the therapists, the nurses, and \nthe allied health professionals who deliver quality care to our needy \nMedicare population. They are the backbone of our complex health care \nnetwork. When our nation's seniors need care, it is the provider who \nheals, not the health insurer--and certainly not the federal \ngovernment.\n  But more, and more often, seniors are being told by providers that \nthey don't accept Medicare. This is becoming even more common in rural \nareas, where the number of physicians and access to quality care is \nalready severely limited. Quite simply, beneficiaries are being told \nthat their insurance is simply not wanted. Why? Well it's not as simple \nas low reimbursement rates. In fact it's much more complex.\n  The infrastructure that manages the Medicare program, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration and its network of contractors, have built up \na system designed to block care and micro-manage independent practices. \nProviders simply can't afford to keep up with the seemingly endless \nnumber of complex, redundant, and unnecessary regulations. And if \nproviders do participate? Well, a simple administrative error in \nsubmitting a claim could subject them to heavy-handed audits and the \nfinancial devastation of their practice. Should we force providers to \nchoose between protecting their practice and caring for seniors?\n  I believe the answer is no. For this reason, I am introducing the \n``Medicare Billing and Education Act of 2000.'' Co-sponsored by Senator \nAbraham, this legislation will restore fairness to the Medicare system. \nIt will allow providers to practice medicine without fearing the \nthreats, intimidation, and aggressive tactics of a faceless \nbureaucratic machine.\n\n  Most importantly, this bill will reform the flawed appeals process \nwithin HCFA. Currently, a provider charged with receiving an \noverpayment is forced to choose between three options: admit the \noverpayment, submit additional information to mitigate the charge, or \nappeal the decision. However, a provider who chooses to submit \nadditional evidence must subject their entire practice to review and \nwaive their appeal rights. That's right--to submit additional evidence \nyou must waive your right to an appeal!\n  And what is the result of this maddening system that runs contrary to \nour nation's history of fair and just administrative decisions? Often, \nproviders are intimidated into accepting the arbitrary decision of an \nauditor employed by a HCFA contractor. Sometimes, they are even forced \nto pull out of the Medicare program. In the end, our senior population \nsuffers.\n  Under my bill, providers will be allowed to retain their appeal \nrights should they choose to first submit additional evidence to \nmitigate the charge. Many providers receive an overpayment as the \nresult of a simple administrative mistake. For cases not involving \nfraud, a provider will be able\n\n[[Page S9470]]\n\nto return that overpayment within twelve months without fear of \nprosecution. This is a common sense approach, and will not lead to any \nadditional costs to the Medicare system.\n  To bring additional fairness to the system, my bill will prohibit the \nretroactive application of regulations, and allow providers to \nchallenge the constitutionality of HCFA regulations. Further, it will \nprohibit the crippling recovery of overpayments during an appeal, and \nbar the unfair method of withholding valid future payments to recover \npast overpayments. These common sense measures maintain the financial \nviability of medical practices during the resolution of payment \ncontroversies, and restore fundamental fairness to the dispute \nresolution procedures existing within HCFA.\n  Like many of our nation's problems, the key to improvement is found \nin education. For this reason, I have included language that stipulates \nthat at least ten percent of the Medicare Integrity Program funds, and \ntwo percent of carrier funds, must be devoted to provider education \nprograms.\n  providers cannot be expected to comply with the endless number of \nMedicare regulations if they are not shown how to submit clean claims. \nWe must ensure that providers are given the information needed to \neliminate future billing errors, and improve the responsiveness of \nHCFA.\n  It is with the goal of protecting our Medicare population, and the \nproviders who tend care, that leads me to introduce the ``Medicare \nBilling and Education act of 2000.'' This bill will ensure that \nproviders are treated with the respect that they deserve, and that \nMedicare beneficiaries aren't told that their health insurance isn't \nwanted. We owe it to our nation's seniors. I urge immediate action on \nthis worthy bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the boundary of the George Washington \nBirthplace National Monument, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.se\n\n\nGEORGE WASHINGTON BIRTHPLACE NATIONAL MONUMENT BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT ACT \n                                OF 2000\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the man who would later become America's \nfirst president, George Washington, was born at Popes Creek Plantation \non the banks of the Potomac River in 1732. Although most Americans are \nfamiliar with his later residence at Mt. Vernon, fewer people know that \nGeorge Washington's childhood was spent on this sprawling 550 acre \nplantation in Westmoreland County, Virginia.\n  The Washington family first settled at Popes Creek in 1656 when John \nWashington, great-grandfather of George Washington, acquired the \nproperty. Although he later moved to Mt. Vernon, most historians agree \nGeorge Washington returned on a regular basis to his birthplace. \nLocated on the property is the Washington family cemetery that is the \nfinal resting place for\n\n[[Page S9473]]\n\nGeorge Washington's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. To this \nday, Washington family descendants continue to live in the area.\n  In 1930, Congress recognized the historic importance of this site to \nthe nation and created the George Washington Birthplace National \nMonument. The park is truly a national treasure which tells of George \nWashington's formative years. In addition to providing an excellent \nexample of colonial life, the park contains acres of woodlands, \nwetlands, and agricultural fields. I am told numerous bald-eagles now \ncall the park home.\n  In this age of rapid development, it is remarkable that despite the \npassage of two hundred and sixty-eight years, the Popes Creek area is \nremarkably unchanged since the time of George Washington's birth. The \n131,099 annual visitors to the park can still experience a rural, \npastoral countryside that George Washington would recognize. Much of \nthe credit for this bucolic atmosphere is due to the efforts of the \nowners of the private property surrounding the park. They have done \ntheir best to avoid developing the property adjacent to the park. But, \nas these landowners gradually decide they wish to sell their property, \nI believe the Park Service should acquire the surrounding property to \npreserve this historic setting for future generations. The alternative \nis to risk development that could forever scar this beautiful national \nlandmark.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to expand the boundary of the \nGeorge Washington Birthplace National Monument by allowing the U.S. \nPark Service to acquire portions of the surrounding property from \nwilling sellers. As a nation, it is our duty to preserve America's \nheritage for future generations. I urge my colleagues to support the \npreservation of George Washington's birthplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 3133. A bill to provide compensation to producers for \nunderestimation of wheat protein content; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             wheat protein mismeasurement compensation act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the bill which \nwill provide long-overdue compensation to agricultural producers in my \nstate and across the country. The ``Wheat Protein Mismeasurement \nCompensation Act'' provides a legislative remedy for producers who \nsuffered a loss due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's erroneous \nunderestimation of their wheat protein content for wheat sold between \nMay 2, 1993 and January 24, 1994.\n  In May 1993, the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Federal \nGrain Inspection Service, required the use of new technology for \ndetermining the protein content of wheat. However, the calibrations \nprovided by the Secretary for the new protein measurement instruments \nwere erroneous and resulted in protein determinations that were lower \nthan those produced by the technology in use before use of the new \ntechnology was required.\n  As a result of this miscalibration and the USDA's failure to provide \nadequate notice and opportunity for comment, hundreds of wheat \nproducers in my state were forced to adjust their protein measurement \nand pricing system in order to protect themselves on resale. The result \nwas a significant loss of revenue from the sale of high-protein wheat.\n  Mr. President, I have worked on this issue for several years--first \nas a case for my injured Montana producers. In a perfect this world, \nthis problem would have been resolved by the USDA at an administrative \nlevel immediately after the miscalibration was identified and \nreadjusted. Instead, it has lagged on and on and on. Unfortunately this \nmatter for technical sovereign immunity reasons cannot be resolved in \nthe courts. That is why we in Congress are their last chance at getting \nthis resolved once and for all.\n  It is clearly, however, that these wheat producers by no fault of \ntheir own were injured by the USDA's implementation of a flawed system. \nBut for that error, they would have received a fair price for their \nwheat. At a time when the agricultural community continues to suffer \nfrom record low prices and disastrous weather conditions, this \ncontinued injustice is simply unacceptable. We must do all in our power \nto correct this problem and justly compensate our producers for their \nlosses.\n  I urge my colleagues to assist us in the expeditious passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today to join my colleague from \nMontana in introducing the Wheat Protein Mismeasurement Compensation \nAct. In 1993 the Federal Grain Inspection Service changed the \ntechnology used to determine the protein content of wheat. As a result \na number of producers were harmed.\n  The issue has had our attention for a number of years, and has \ncumulated in a recent exercise over the past few months to find a \nresolution. The simple fact is that the USDA has failed to work with \nthe farmers harmed so we can determine the actual financial impact to \nall producers. However, I am very confident we can address the losses \nshouldered by Montana's producers with the $465 million cap in this \nlegislation.\n  My number one priority is to ensure that those producers who were \nharmed by the Federal Government's miscalculation are fully reimbursed \nfor their losses. As we work this bill through the legislative process \nI believe we may need to readdress the section on the amount of \ncompensation for the attorneys, but only time will tell. I believe this \nbill is a good step forward, and I welcome a process that will make \nUSDA sit down face to face with these producers and compensate those \nthat were harmed by the mismeasurements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 3134. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan income tax credit for certain charitable conservation contributions \nof land by small farmers and ranchers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                    RURAL HERITAGE CONSERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, our nation's agricultural heritage is a \nrich tradition, which encompasses much of what we are about as a \npeople; hard work, common sense, and a deep respect for the land.\n  In Montana, and in too many communities across America, our \nagricultural heritage is at risk. Productive farms and ranches that \nhave been in the same family for generations are being forced to turn \ntheir back on the land they love in order to make ends meet.\n  I applaud our current conservation easement system and the many fine \nnon-profit organizations that have worked with landowners across \nAmerica to protect millions of acres of land. The successes have been \ngreat, but so too have the lessons.\n  What we have learned is that the current system does not work \nparticularly well for working farmers and ranchers. That's why I've \nintroduced the Rural Heritage Conservation Act, a creative approach \nthat provides farmers and ranchers with a real incentive to preserve \ntheir, and our, agricultural heritage.\n  Over the past twenty-five years, over 3 million acres of agricultural \nland have been lost to development in Montana alone. Many of these \nacres were lost when family farms, hit hard by tough times, chose to \ngive up their generations of old farming operations and sell to \ndevelopers in order to pay their outstanding debts.\n  The measure proposed in this legislation will expand the current \nconservation easement tax incentive program with an eye toward making \nthe system work better for the bulk of real, working farmers and \nranchers who would like to preserve their land for future generations \nbut for whom the current system does not provide any meaningful \nincentive.\n  Let me give you a real-life example that was presented by my good \nfriend Jerry Townsend of Highwood Montana before the Senate Finance \nCommittee's subcommittee on Tax and IRS oversight.\n  Mr. Townsend testified that when he gave a conservation easement to \nthe Montana Land Reliance, the value of his deduction was $524,000. \nHowever, under current law, over the last five years he has only been \nable to save $1,858 in federal taxes. Not much of an incentive, \nparticularly when you factor\n\n[[Page S9474]]\n\nin the $2,500 he paid for the appraisal required to complete the \nconservation easement process.\n  The Rural Heritage Conservation Act will do three things.\n  First, it will create a targeted, limited tax credit for farm and \nranch filers who donate a conservation easement to a qualified land \ntrust. Mr. Townsend's example is all too familiar a story to farmers \nand ranchers throughout America. The relatively small deduction they \ncan obtain under current law does not in any way equate to either the \npotential income they have forfeited or the value the public has gained \nfrom the donation. As a result, fewer and fewer farmers and ranchers \nare donating conservation easements and protecting their land for \nfuture generations.\n  To protect against abuse, the bill calls for a cap on the total tax \ncredit available under the program and requires that a majority of the \nincome for the qualifying filer be from farm and ranch operations.\n  Second, this legislation will level the playing field for all types \nof agricultural filers. Current law allows C-Corps to deduct up to 10 \npercent of their income compared to the 30% allowed for other business \ntypes including Limited Liability Companies, Sole Proprietorships and \nLimited Liability Partnerships.\n  According to figures presented by the Montana Land Reliance, there \nare some 40,000 acres of land in Montana alone owned by C-Corporations, \nin most cases family held, that have identified the 10 percent limit as \na barrier to their contributing an easement.\n  Third, the bill would eliminate the current provision that limits \nadditional estate tax relief to landowners only within a 25 mile radius \nof a metropolitan area.\n  As we have discussed at some length in this very chamber, estate tax \nis a significant issue for many Americans, including those who live in \nfarm and ranch households. The current radius restriction works to the \nfinancial disadvantage of people who live in states with sparse \npopulations.\n  Elimination of the radius will be a significant improvement to \ncurrent law and will enable many rural families to pass along to future \ngenerations family farms and ranches that are so much a part of the \nvery heart of America.\n  Protecting our agricultural heritage and the land that makes it \npossible is good public policy. I believe that the Agricultural \nHeritage Preservation Act is a creative, common sense approach to \nimproving the current conservation easement program and making it work \nbetter to meet this important goal. I'm not claiming that this approach \nis the ``perfect'' approach, or the only way to accomplish our goals. \nBut it's clear that the current system does not work effectively for \nsmall farmers and ranchers and we must do more. I hope that the \nintroduction of this bill will initiate an informed, intelligent \ndiscussion of this important matter. We must find the best way to solve \nthis problem that threatens the conservation of our agricultural lands \nand rural way of life.\n  I hope that as we consider other land conservation initiatives and \nother measures to make significant changes to the estate tax system, \nthat the changes I'm proposing in the Rural Heritage Conservation Act \nwill be a key part of the discussion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 3138. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the amount and availability of the child tax credit and make \nthe credit refundable; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       helping american families\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will talk for a couple of minutes about \none of the issues about which I am most passionate, and that is taxes, \nor the overtaxation of the American people in a time of surpluses, and \nthe refusal of this Congress, this President, to even make an attempt \nto have meaningful tax cuts or meaningful tax relief before the end of \nthis Congress.\n  In 1997, the Congress passed and the President signed into law my \n$500-per-child tax credit legislation. As a result, today about 40 \nmillion children in this country receive this tax credit every year, \nand it returns a total of about $20 billion a year in tax savings to \nfamilies. That is money that families can use for savings for their \nchildren's education, for day care, for tutors, for braces, a new \nwasher, dryer--anything--a family vacation. But it is what the family \ndecides to spend their hard-earned money on, rather than waiting for a \nhandout from Washington.\n  In fact, for the first time since the 1980s, this tax credit and \nother Republican-initiated tax cuts have reduced the tax burden for \nlow- and middle-income families. I have heard many of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle bragging about how some people in the \nUnited States are paying less taxes today--and that is true--but it is \nmainly true because of the $500-per-child tax credit, nothing else that \nthis administration or this Congress has done.\n  Despite this tax credit, the total tax burden is still way too high \nfor working Americans. Today, let's look at an average two-income \nfamily. The median two-income family pays $26,759 in Federal, State, \nand local taxes. Let's compare this with back in 1992. Those taxes were \n$21,320 a year--a 26-percent increase in the tax burden for average \nfamilies in just the last 8 years of the Clinton administration. That \nis according to the Nonpartisan Tax Foundation. To date, $26,759; 8 \nyears ago, $21,320.\n  That shows the increase in taxes to the median-income family--not the \nrich of this country. They are paying more in taxes, as well. But it is \nthe average working family that is paying the brunt of the tax \nincreases imposed by this administration. Again, that is according to \nthe Nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Total taxes nationwide claim 39 percent \nof hard-earned income, and that is more than the typical family in this \ncountry pays for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation combined.\n  In the past few years, over 20 million Americans earning between \n$30,000 and $50,000 have been pushed from the 15-percent tax bracket \ninto the 28-percent tax bracket due to our unfair tax system. They are \npaying almost twice as much for those incomes, pushed from the 15-\npercent to the 28-percent tax bracket. As low-income and minimum wage \nworkers work harder and pay more, their payroll taxes also increase, \ntaking a huge bite out of their hard-earned dollars--dollars that I \nbelieve are desperately needed to keep those families above the poverty \nline.\n  Taxes collected by the Federal Government have reached 20.6 percent \nof all national income. That is the highest level since World War II. \nThe government takes one-fifth of every dollar produced in this country \nevery year. In the next 10 years, working Americans will pay taxes that \nwill contribute to an over $2.2 trillion non-Social Security surplus. \nThis non-Social Security surplus will be $2.2 trillion and that is even \nafter assuming government spending is increasing along with the level \nand rate of inflation. This non-Social Security surplus comes from \nincreased personal taxes and the realization of our capital gains \ntaxes.\n\n  I believe this money should be returned to working Americans in the \nform of some tax relief, debt reduction, and also Social Security \nreform. Yes, overtaxed American families still need tax relief today. I \nbelieve using some of the non-Social Security surplus to expand the \n$500-per-child tax credit is one of the right things to do because \nWashington, again, is taking more taxes from American families at a \ntime when it doesn't need the money as bad as families do.\n  I have repeatedly argued in this Chamber that the family has been and \nwill continue to be the bedrock of our society. Strong families make \nstrong communities, strong communities make for a strong America, and \nour tax policies should strengthen families and should be there to \nreestablish the value of families.\n  Between 1960 and 1985, Federal taxes on American families increased \nsignificantly. For families with 4 children, the Federal income tax \nrate increased 223 percent; for families with two children the rate \nincreased 43 percent. The inflation-adjusted median income for families \nwith children also decreased between 1973 and 1994. So its income was \ngoing down and taxes were still going up.\n  While the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, which included my $500-per-child \ntax\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\ncredit, has helped to change this situation, there is still room for \nimprovement, a lot of room for a lot of improvement. For example, \ncombined with the dependent exemption, the tax benefits for families \nraising children still falls well below both the inflation-adjusted \nvalue of the original dependent exemption, and also the actual cost of \nraising children according to Minnesota's Children Defense Fund.\n  In addition, this child tax credit and the income threshold for \nfamilies qualifying for credit are not indexed for inflation. As a \nresult, the value of this child tax credit would also shrink in the \nfuture and fewer families would qualify for the credit.\n  That is why I am introducing tonight legislation aimed at expanding \nthe tax credit. My legislation would increase the tax credit from $500 \nper child to $1,000, and it would be adjusted for inflation every year. \nIt would also index the income threshold for families qualifying for \nthis tax credit.\n  While I strongly support this increase as well as the marriage \npenalty repeal and getting rid of the death tax, the only way we will \nachieve meaningful tax relief is to reform our entire tax system \ncompletely. Even my legislation today, I look at as just an interim \nstep toward this very essential goal of having a tax system that is \nsimple, fair, and easy to understand.\n  With these proposed improvements we would allow overtaxed working \nfamilies with children to keep a little bit more of their own money--\ngive them the opportunity to spend it on their own priorities, not \nlooking for a handout from Washington, not saying they need another \nprogram from Washington, not that they want another big government \napproach--but allowing them to keep some of their dollars so they can \nmake the determination on how they want to spend their money, a little \nbit more of their own money, to spend on their own priorities. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to Senator Grams, I think this is \nanother insightful bit of tax relief policy you are promoting. I look \nforward to studying it. People think sometimes this is not possible. I \ndon't think we stop to celebrate enough the wonderful thing that \nhappened when, under your leadership and that of a lot of others who \nworked on it, we were able to provide a $500-per-child tax credit to \nworking families in America. A mother with two children will now have, \ntoday, $1,000 more a year--nearly $80 a month with which they can buy \nshoes or fix the muffler on the car, take the kids on a trip or to a \nmovie or out for a meal. It is the kind of thing that was really great. \nPeople said it could not be done and it was done.\n  I think these other proposals the Senator makes are realistic and \nalso can be done.\n  We need to continue to work at this. The question is whether the \nAmerican people are going to be able to keep this money or are we going \nto allow more and more to come to Washington as it grows more and more \npowerful and the power and wealth and independence of American citizens \ngrows weaker and weaker.\n  Mr. GRAMS. The Senator from Alabama is right. If we look at it, at a \ntime of overtaxation, when American workers are getting up every \nmorning, working hard, and sending this money to Washington, and then \nit is overtaxed--we are not talking about cutting taxes at all. We are \ntalking right now about returning some of the surplus to make sure \nthose people who worked hard and produced this windfall get it back.\n  We tell our children: If you find a wallet on the street with $1,000 \ndollars in it, the first thing you should do is try to return it to the \nowner. Make sure you give the money back. Washington has found a wallet \nwith $2.2 trillion in it, and they won't give it back. They are trying \nto find a way to spend it. I think our hard-working families deserve \nsome tax credit along with debt reduction and securing Social Security, \nrather than leaving it for the big spenders in Washington to decide how \nthey want to divvy up and dole out their money.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think my colleague also makes an excellent point \nabout this percentage of the total gross domestic product. People say \nwe cannot afford a tax cut, but we have reached record levels of a \ntotal gross domestic product that is being taken by the Government. \nThese suggestions the Senator makes are worthwhile. We need to be \nworking on that and the marriage penalty and the estate tax and a lot \nof other things around here which we can afford. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 3140. A bill to transfer administrative jurisdiction over land of \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority within the Daniel Boone National Forest \nto the Secretary of Agriculture and compensate the Authority for the \ntransfer; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           kentucky national forest land transfer act of 2000\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kentucky \nNational Forest Land Transfer Act of 2000. The purpose of this \nlegislation is to provide an equitable solution to a problem that \nexists in Kentucky--specifically, to allow the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority (TVA) to donate mineral rights, which it owns, to the Forest \nService in exchange for compensation through the sale of other mineral \nrights in the Federal land inventory.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to give my colleagues \nsome background on this issue and why this is necessary. During the \n1960's, TVA purchased coal mineral rights on land that was later \ndesignated as the Daniel Boone National Forest. Today, TVA owns 40,000 \nacres of mineral rights under the forest.\n  This past July, TVA announced that it no longer had a need for these \nextensive mineral rights, and announced that after a 15-day comment \nperiod, it intended to auction the rights to a coal operator to mine \nthe land. In TVA's view, this was a way to get much needed funds to pay \ndown the $26 billion debt which they have amassed over the years. Since \nTVA originally had purchased the land with ratepayer funds, they were \nunwilling simply to donate the land, and consequently defended their \nproposal to auction off their rights to a coal operator by arguing that \nthey currently have the ability to mine the land since they owned the \nmineral rights before the forest was created.\n  As you can imagine, Mr. President, this proposal hit a nerve with \nKentuckians, who were quick to express their outrage at the proposition \nthat TVA could allow mining in the Daniel Boone National Forest. The \nCourier-Journal, in an editorial published on August 7, 2000, wrote \nthat TVA's proposal was a ``rush to judgment'' that failed to take the \npublic interest into consideration. The editorial went on to say that \n``the best outcome, obviously, would be for the U.S. Forest Service to \ncontrol the mineral rights under the acreage that it manages. And if \nthere are legal problems to overcome in arranging that, the auction \nshould be held up until Congress can remove them.'' Mr. President, that \nis essentially what my legislation will achieve. I would like to submit \nthe editorial for the Record.\n  Well, Mr. President, both Congress and TVA responded to the public \noutcry. First, Senator Bunning offered an amendment to the Energy and \nWater Appropriations bill requiring TVA to conduct an Environmental \nImpact Study (EIS) before it could move forward on its proposal to \nauction off mineral rights. In response to that, a week later, TVA \nwithdrew its auction plan, citing its concern that the proposal had \nsent the wrong signals. Despite these developments, the interested \nparties continued to press their case for transferring the mineral \nrights to the Forest Service, and again, I say, Mr. President, that is \nexactly what my bill will do.\n  My bill is a compromise solution that will protect the forest and \nprotect TVA's ratepayers, by compensating TVA. This legislation is \nnarrowly crafted to require TVA to donate the mineral rights under the \nDaniel Boone to the Forest Service in exchange for the right to sell \nother mineral rights owned by the Interior Department. Under this \nagreement, TVA will receive fair market value from the sale, which it \ncan then use to reduce its burgeoning debt.\n  My bill has the support of TVA and the Forest Service, and is \nnecessary in\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\norder to implement the compromise which we have worked to achieve. This \nsolution is based on the Mt. St. Helens National Volcanic Monument \nCompletion Act (P.L. 105-279), which allowed for the acquisition of \nprivate mineral rights within the Monument through a swap. That \nlegislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It is my hope that \nmy colleagues will recognize the merits of my legislation and pass it \nwith similar support.\n  Mr. President, we are in the waning days of the 106th Congress and \ntime is running out to implement this carefully crafted solution, which \nis in the best interest of Kentucky's citizens and TVA's ratepayers. \nThis is a win-win proposition and I urge the Senate to expeditiously \nconsider and pass this important legislation. Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and an editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3140\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

But for what it's worth, we'll comment anyway: It \n     stinks.\n       Talk about a rush to judgment. Comment was shut off just 15 \n     days after TVA revealed its plan to sell.\n       Given that it's at least a quasi-public entity, TVA \n     certainly ought to keep the broad public interest in mind \n     when it makes major business decisions. TVA should be able to \n     say what public good will result from selling these mineral \n     rights to the highest bidder, as if they were some tax \n     evader's living room furniture being auctioned on the \n     courthouse steps.\n       TVA environmental engineer Steve Hillenbrand defends the \n     sellout (and we do mean to invoke the word ``sellout'' in \n     both its meanings, the ordinary and the pejorative) by saying \n     the agency needs money. But on that basis just about any \n     outrage could be rationalized. Obviously there needs to be \n     some better justification.\n       Hillenbrand also said TVA wants out because these mineral \n     deposits are not in the Tennessee Valley.\n       Odd. The distance between Eastern Kentucky's coalfields and \n     the utility's service area never discouraged TVA's interest, \n     or its coal buyers, before. Indeed, for decades the Kentucky \n     River coalfield was stripped and augered, its watersheds \n     compromised, its resources depleted, its people victimized, \n     for coal to feed the power plants of TVA.\n       The story of coal barons and their work in Appalachia, on \n     behalf of TVA, would make a great book, if Upton Sinclair or \n     Ida Tarbell were still around to write it.\n       How can TVA simply turn its back on that history and \n     depart, with the proceeds of its auction?\n       One newspaper story about the auction said TVA wants at \n     least $3.5 million, and will sell only to those who agree not \n     to strip mine. But the legalities are unclear, and protection \n     for all the national forest land against stripping is not a \n     sure thing. Nor would such a restriction address the \n     potential impact of deep mining or oil-and-gas exploration, \n     which could be devastating.\n       The best outcome, obviously, would be for the U.S. Forest \n     Service to control the mineral rights under the acreage that \n     it manages. And if there are legal problems to overcome in \n     arranging that, the auction should be held up until Congress \n     can remove them.\n       Selling mineral rights to the highest bidder is not a \n     responsible policy. The National Citizens' Coal Law Project \n     is right to oppose it, right to call for a full Environmental \n     Impact Statement on the plan instead of some half-baked \n     assessment, and right to urge that, if all else fails, only \n     those with exemplary mining and reclamation records be \n     allowed to bid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9477-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9477-S9478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 26\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 26, a bill entitled the \n``Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1999''.\n\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to \namend the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate disincentives to fair trade \nconditions.\n\n\n                                 S. 190\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inouye, the name of the Senator from Maine (Ms. \nCollins) was added as a cosponsor of S. 190, a bill to amend title 10, \nUnited States Code, to permit former members of the Armed Forces who \nhave a service-connected disability rated as total to travel on \nmilitary aircraft in the same manner and to the same extent as retired \nmembers of the Armed Forces are entitled to travel on such aircraft.\n\n\n                                 S. 693\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 693, a bill to assist in \nthe enhancement of the security of Taiwan, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 695\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cleland, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 695, a bill to direct the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery for \nveterans in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area.\n\n\n                                S. 1128\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nMiller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1128, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the Federal estate and gift \ntaxes and the tax on generation-skipping transfers, to provide for a \ncarryover basis at death, and to establish a partial capital gains \nexclusion for inherited assets.\n\n\n                                S. 1277\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Maine \n(Ms. Collins) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1277, a bill to amend \ntitle XIX of the Social Security Act to establish a new prospective \npayment system for Federally-qualified health centers and rural health \nclinics.\n\n\n                                S. 1536\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the names of the Senator from Louisiana \n(Mr. Breaux), the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. L.

Con. Res. 140\n\n       Whereas Taiwan is the seventh largest trading partner of \n     the United States and plays an important role in the economy \n     of the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas Taiwan routinely holds free and fair elections in a \n     multiparty system, as evidenced most recently by Taiwan's \n     second democratic presidential election of March 18, 2000, in \n     which Mr. Chen Shui-bian was elected as president of the \n     23,000,000 people of Taiwan;\n       Whereas Members of Congress, unlike executive branch \n     officials, have long had the freedom to meet with leaders of \n     governments with which the United States does not have formal \n     relations--meetings which provide a vital opportunity to \n     discuss issues of mutual concern that directly affect United \n     States national interests;\n       Whereas several Members of Congress expressed interest in \n     meeting with President Chen Shui-bian during his 16-hour \n     layover in Los Angeles, California, en route to Latin America \n     and Africa on August 13, 2000;\n       Whereas the meeting with President Chen did not take place \n     because of pressure from Washington and Beijing;\n       Whereas Congress thereby lost the opportunity to \n     communicate directly with President Chen about developments \n     in the Asia-Pacific region and key elements of the \n     relationship between the United States and Taiwan when he \n     visited Los Angeles;\n       Whereas there could not be a more important time to find \n     opportunities to talk to Taiwan's new leaders given the \n     enormous economic, security, and political interests we share \n     with both Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, as well \n     as the results of the recent election in Taiwan which \n     provided for the first party leadership change in Taiwan's \n     history;\n       Whereas Congress must continue to play an independent \n     oversight role on United States policy toward Taiwan, and try \n     to find ways to reduce the threat of war between Taiwan and \n     the People's Republic of China, and in particular, to \n     counteract China's buildup of missiles pointed at Taiwan;\n       Whereas the United States continues to cling to its policy \n     of more than 20 years, which prohibits high-ranking Taiwan \n     leaders from making official visits to the United States, \n     forcing Members of Congress to choose whether to rely solely \n     upon indirect assessments provided by the administration or \n     to travel to Taiwan to obtain this information firsthand, and \n     denying Taiwan's democratically elected officials the respect \n     they deserve;\n       Whereas by bestowing upon President Chen the respect his \n     office deserves, the United States would have demonstrated to \n     the people of both Taiwan and the People's Republic of China \n     United States support for democracy; and\n       Whereas the Immigration and Nationality Technical \n     Corrections Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-416) provides that \n     the President of Taiwan shall be welcome in the United States \n     at any time to discuss a host of important issues: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the interest of Congress and the executive \n     branch of the United States to communicate directly with \n     elected and appointed top officials of Taiwan, including its \n     democratically elected president; and\n       (2) the United States should end restrictions on high-level \n     visits by officials of Taiwan to the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9479-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9479-S9480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 362--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING ROBERTO CLEMENTE AS A \n        GREAT HUMANITARIAN AND AN ATHLETE OF UNFANTHOMABLE SKILL\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Specter) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 362\n\n       Whereas Roberto Clemente's athletic legacy has been honored \n     by the City of Pittsburgh with a 14 foot bronze statue and \n     the naming of a bridge over the Allegheny River located just \n     outside the centerfield gate of the new baseball stadium in \n     Pittsburgh;\n       Whereas Roberto Clemente led the Pittsburgh Pirates to \n     World Championship titles in 1960 and 1971, winning the \n     Series Most Valuable Player Award in 1971 when he batted .414 \n     with two home runs against Baltimore;\n       Whereas during his 18 year career with the Pittsburgh \n     Pirates, Roberto Clemente won four National League batting \n     crowns, the 1966 National League Most Valuable Player award, \n     and ended his career with a .317 lifetime average, 240 \n     homers, and 1,305 runs batted in;\n       Whereas on September 30, 1972, Roberto Clemente became the \n     11th Major League Baseball player to record 3,000 hits with a \n     4th inning double off of New York Mets left hander Jon \n     Matlack;\n       Whereas Roberto Clemente was one of the first Latin \n     American baseball players in the Major Leagues, and as such \n     he faced language barriers and racial segregation throughout \n     his career;\n       Whereas Roberto Clemente worked tirelessly to improve \n     professional baseball's understanding of the unique \n     challenges faced by young Latin American baseball players \n     thrust into a new culture and language;\n       Whereas in August of 1973, Roberto Clemente became just the \n     second player to have the mandatory five-year waiting period \n     waived as he was inducted posthumously into the National \n     Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas in 1984, Roberto Clemente became the second \n     baseball player to be honored for his athletic and \n     philanthropic achievements with an appearance on a United \n     States postage stamp;\n       Whereas Roberto Clemente devoted himself to improving the \n     lives of inner city youth in Puerto Rico and throughout the \n     United States, putting into action his belief that sport \n     could be a stepping stone to a better life for \n     underprivileged youth;\n       Whereas Roberto Clemente tragically died in an airplane \n     crash on December 31, 1972 as he accompanied relief supplies \n     to Nicaragua to aid the victims of the devastating 1972 \n     Managua earthquake;\n       Whereas Roberto Clement's humanitarian legacy continues to \n     this day, embodied by the Roberto Clemente Sports City in \n     Puerto Rico, which creates an environment for the development \n     of the human spirit though sport, and promotes community, \n     education, and awareness of human rights: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Roberto Clemente was a great humanitarian and an \n     athlete of unfathomable skill;\n       (2) Roberto Clemente should be honored for his \n     contributions to the betterment of society; and,\n       (3) all Americans should honor Roberto Clemente's legacy \n     every day through humanitarian and philanthropic efforts \n     toward their fellow man.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as the last baseball games are about to \nbe played in Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, a stadium referred to \nas the ``House that Clemente Build,'' I am reminded of Roberto \nClemente, one of the greatest athletes and humanitarians of all time. \nEvery baseball fan can recite Roberto's achievements during his \nprofessional career as a Pittsburgh Pirate--from hitting a remarkable \n.317 over 18 seasons and collecting 3,000 hits, to his 12 Gold Glove \nawards and 12 National League All Star Game appearances. However, it \nwas his philanthropic gestures which truly represent Roberto Clemente's \ninvaluable legacy.\n  As many people know, Roberto Clemente died tragically on December 31, \n1972, after he and four others boarded a small DC-7 to deliver food, \nclothing and medicine to Nicaragua, to aid victims of a devastating \nearthquake. The four-engine plane, with a\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\nquestionable past and an overload of cargo, crashed into the Atlantic \nOcean, killing all aboard. What is not well known is that, upon hearing \nrumors that Nicaraguan government officials were delaying the delivery \nof relief supplies, Roberto Clemente left his New Year's celebration \nwith family and friends to travel to Nicaragua in order to personally \noversee the delivery of the Puerto Rican relief supplies to the \nindividuals devastated by the Managua earthquake. On that fateful New \nYear's Eve night in 1972, the world lost not just a great athlete, \narguably the greatest in the history of the Pittsburgh Pirates, but a \nhumanitarian, a cultural icon, and a hero.\n  Mr. President, over the years, Roberto Clemente's dedication to his \nfellow man became legendary. As one of the first Latin America baseball \nplayers in the Major Leagues, Roberto Clemente faced language barriers \nand racial segregation throughout his career. He worked tirelessly to \nimprove professional baseball's understanding of the unique challenges \nfaced by young Latin American ballplayers thrust into a new culture and \nlanguage as they start their baseball careers.\n  However, his concern for is fellow man did not stop at the foul \nlines. throughout his career, Roberto Clemente expressed his concern \nfor the troubled lives faced by urban youth both in the United States \nand Puerto Rico. In a 1966 interview with Myron Cope for ``Sports \nIllustrated,'' Roberto Clemente discussed his desire to help youth by \nstoking their interest in sports. Roberto Clemente believed that sports \ncould bring families together in an athletic setting while providing a \nstage for youngsters to excel. In what would be the final months of his \nlife, Roberto Clemente conducted a series of baseball clinics for \nPuerto Rican youth in addition to fundraising efforts for a large \nsports facility dedicated to the youth of the world.\n  Mr. President, Robert Clemente's humanitarian legacy continues to \nthis day with the Roberto Clemente Sports City in Puerto Rico. \nEstablished March 18, 1973, when the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's \ngovernment granted 304 acres of land for development, the Roberto \nClemente Sports City commemorates Roberto Clemente's commitment of a \nbetter life for children through sports, education and community \nservice by creating an environment for the development of the human \nspirit through sports, involving community, education and human rights. \nThis sports facility provides high quality recreational and sports \nfacilities for children, youth and the general public such as: \nbaseball, volleyball, basketball, tennis, swimming, track and field, \nbatting cages, a golf range, tae kwon-do, camping and social and \ncultural activities. The Roberto Clemente Sports City provides Puerto \nRico with learning and training facilities, to include tutoring, \nmentoring and professional development programs in sports and life.\n  As eloquently stated by Bowie Kuhn in his 1973 eulogy to Clemente, \n``he made the world `superstar' seem inadequate. He had about him the \ntouch of royalty.'' With all of this in mind, Mr. President, I ask my \ncolleagues to support the resolution I am offering with Senator Specter \nwhich urges our fellow Americans to honor Roberto Clemente's legacy \nevery day through humanitarian and philanthropic efforts towards their \nfellow man.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed \nin the Record, immediately following my statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/28/senate-section/article/S9480-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 363--COMMENDING THE LATE ERNEST BURGESS, M.D., FOR \n    HIS SERVICE TO THE NATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND \n  EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE SENATE TO HIS FAMILY ON HIS DEATH\n\n  Mr. KERREY submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

IMMIGRANTS TO NEW AMERICANS MODEL PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Immigrants to New Americans Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1997, there were an estimated 25,800,000 foreign-\n     born individuals residing in the United States. That number \n     is the largest number of such foreign-born individuals ever \n     in United States history and represents a 6,000,000, or 30 \n     percent, increase over the 1990 census figure of 19,800,000 \n     of such foreign-born individuals. The Bureau of the Census \n     estimates that the recently arrived immigrant population \n     (including the refugee population) currently residing in the \n     Nation will account for 75 percent of the population growth \n     in the United States over the next 50 years.\n       (2) For millions of immigrants settling into the Nation's \n     hamlets, towns, and cities, the dream of ``life, liberty, and \n     the pursuit of happiness'' has become a reality. The wave of \n     immigrants, from various nationalities, who have chosen the \n     United States as their home, has positively influenced the \n     Nation's image and relationship with other nations. The \n     diverse cultural heritage of the Nation's immigrants has \n     helped define the Nation's culture, customs, economy, and \n     communities. By better understanding the people who have \n     immigrated to the Nation, individuals in the United States \n     better understand what it means to be an American.\n       (3) There is a critical shortage of teachers with the \n     skills needed to educate immigrant students and their \n     families in nonconcentrated, nontraditional, immigrant \n     communities as well as communities with large immigrant \n     populations. The large influx of immigrant families over the \n     last decade presents a national dilemma: The number of such \n     families with school-age children, requiring assistance to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities in the United States, is increasing \n     without a corresponding increase in the number of teachers \n     with skills to accommodate their needs.\n       (4) Immigrants arriving in communities across the Nation \n     generally settle into high-poverty areas, where funding for \n     programs to provide immigrant students and their families \n     with the services the students and families need to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities in the United States is inadequate.\n       (5) The influx of immigrant families settling into many \n     United States communities is often the result of concerted \n     efforts by local employers who value immigrant labor. Those \n     employers realize that helping immigrants to become \n     productive, prosperous members of a community is beneficial \n     for the local businesses involved, the immigrants, and the \n     community. Further, local businesses benefit from the \n     presence of the immigrant families because the families \n     present businesses with a committed and effective workforce \n     and help to open up new market opportunities. However, many \n     of the communities into which the immigrants have settled \n     need assistance in order to give immigrant students and their \n     families the services the students and families need to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities, in the United States.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish a \n     grant program, within the Department of Education, that \n     provides funding to partnerships of local educational \n     agencies and community-based organizations for the \n     development of model programs to provide to immigrant \n     students and their families the services the students and \n     families need to successfully participate in elementary \n     schools, secondary schools, and communities, in the United \n     States.\n       (d) Definitions.--\n       (1) Immigrant.--In this section, the term ``immigrant'' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 101 of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act.\n       (2) Other terms.--The terms used in this section have the \n     meanings given the terms in section 14101 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n       (e) Program Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Education is authorized \n     to award not more than 10 grants in a fiscal year to eligible \n     partnerships for the design and implementation of model \n     programs to--\n       (A) assist immigrant students to achieve in elementary \n     schools and secondary schools in the United States by \n     offering such educational services as English as a second \n     language classes, literacy programs, programs for \n     introduction to the education system, and civics education; \n     and\n       (B) assist parents of immigrant students by offering such \n     services as parent education and literacy development \n     services and by coordinating activities with other entities \n     to provide comprehensive community social services such as \n     health care, job training, child care, and transportation \n     services.\n       (2) Duration.--Each grant awarded under this section shall \n     be awarded for a period of not more than 5 years. A \n     partnership may use funds made available through the grant \n     for not more than 1 year for planning and program design.\n       (f) Applications for Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--Each eligible partnership desiring a grant \n     under this section shall submit an application to the \n     Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (2) Eligible partnerships.--To be eligible to receive a \n     grant under this section, a partnership--\n       (A) shall include--\n       (i) at least 1 local educational agency; and\n       (ii) at least 1 community-based organization; and\n       (B) may include another entity such as an institution of \n     higher education, a local or State government agency, a \n     private sector entity, or another entity with expertise in \n     working with immigrants.\n       (3) Required documentation.--Each application submitted by \n     a partnership under this section for a proposed program shall \n     include documentation that--\n       (A) the partnership has the qualified personnel required to \n     develop, administer, and implement the proposed program; and\n       (B) the leadership of each participating school has been \n     involved in the development and planning of the program in \n     the school.\n       (4) Other application contents.--Each application submitted \n     by a partnership under this section for a proposed program \n     shall include--\n       (A) a list of the organizations entering into the \n     partnership;\n       (B) a description of the need for the proposed program, \n     including data on the number of immigrant students, and the \n     number of such students with limited English proficiency, in \n     the schools or school districts to be served through the \n     program and the characteristics of the students described in \n     this subparagraph, including--\n       (i) the native languages of the students to be served;\n       (ii) the proficiency of the students in English and the \n     native languages;\n       (iii) achievement data for the students in--\n\n       (I) reading or language arts (in English and in the native \n     languages, if applicable); and\n       (II) mathematics; and\n\n       (iv) the previous schooling experiences of the students;\n       (C) a description of the goals of the program;\n       (D) a description of how the funds made available through \n     the grant will be used to supplement the basic services \n     provided to the immigrant students to be served;\n       (E) a description of activities that will be pursued by the \n     partnership through the program, including a description of--\n       (i) how parents, students, and other members of the \n     community, including members of private organizations and \n     nonprofit organizations, will be involved in the design and \n     implementation of the program;\n       (ii) how the activities will further the academic \n     achievement of immigrant students served through the program;\n       (iii) methods of teacher training and parent education that \n     will be used or developed through the program, including the \n     dissemination of information to immigrant parents, that is \n     easily understandable in the language of the parents, about \n     educational programs and the rights of the parents to \n     participate in educational decisions involving their \n     children; and\n       (iv) methods of coordinating comprehensive community social \n     services to assist immigrant families;\n       (F) a description of how the partnership will evaluate the \n     progress of the partnership in achieving the goals of the \n     program;\n       (G) a description of how the local educational agency will \n     disseminate information on model programs, materials, and \n     other information developed under this section that the local \n     educational agency determines to be appropriate for use by \n     other local educational agencies in establishing similar \n     programs to facilitate the educational achievement of \n     immigrant students;\n       (H) an assurance that the partnership will annually provide \n     to the Secretary such information as may be required to \n     determine the effectiveness of the program; and\n       (I) any other information that the Secretary may require.\n       (g) Selection of Grantees.--\n       (1) Criteria.--The Secretary, through a peer review \n     process, shall select partnerships to receive grants under \n     this section on the basis of the quality of the programs \n     proposed\n\n[[Page S9510]]\n\n     in the applications submitted under subsection (f), taking \n     into consideration such factors as--\n       (A) the extent to which the program proposed in such an \n     application effectively addresses differences in language, \n     culture, and customs;\n       (B) the quality of the activities proposed by a \n     partnership;\n       (C) the extent of parental, student, and community \n     involvement;\n       (D) the extent to which the partnership will ensure the \n     coordination of comprehensive community social services with \n     the program;\n       (E) the quality of the plan for measuring and assessing \n     success;

By better understanding the people who have \n     immigrated to the Nation, individuals in the United States \n     better understand what it means to be an American.\n       (3) There is a critical shortage of teachers with the \n     skills needed to educate immigrant students and their \n     families in nonconcentrated, nontraditional, immigrant \n     communities as well as communities with large immigrant \n     populations. The large influx of immigrant families over the \n     last decade presents a national dilemma: The number of such \n     families with school-age children, requiring assistance to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities in the United States, is increasing \n     without a corresponding increase in the number of teachers \n     with skills to accommodate their needs.\n       (4) Immigrants arriving in communities across the Nation \n     generally settle into high-poverty areas, where funding for \n     programs to provide immigrant students and their families \n     with the services the students and families need to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities in the United States is inadequate.\n       (5) The influx of immigrant families settling into many \n     United States communities is often the result of concerted \n     efforts by local employers who value immigrant labor. Those \n     employers realize that helping immigrants to become \n     productive, prosperous members of a community is beneficial \n     for the local businesses involved, the immigrants, and the \n     community. Further, local businesses benefit from the \n     presence of the immigrant families because the families \n     present businesses with a committed and effective workforce \n     and help to open up new market opportunities. However, many \n     of the communities into which the immigrants have settled \n     need assistance in order to give immigrant students and their \n     families the services the students and families need to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities, in the United States.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish a \n     grant program, within the Department of Education, that \n     provides funding to partnerships of local educational \n     agencies and community-based organizations for the \n     development of model programs to provide to immigrant \n     students and their families the services the students and \n     families need to successfully participate in elementary \n     schools, secondary schools, and communities, in the United \n     States.\n       (d) Definitions.--\n       (1) Immigrant.--In this section, the term ``immigrant'' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 101 of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act.\n       (2) Other terms.--The terms used in this section have the \n     meanings given the terms in section 14101 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n       (e) Program Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Education is authorized \n     to award not more than 10 grants in a fiscal year to eligible \n     partnerships for the design and implementation of model \n     programs to--\n       (A) assist immigrant students to achieve in elementary \n     schools and secondary schools in the United States by \n     offering such educational services as English as a second \n     language classes, literacy programs, programs for \n     introduction to the education system, and civics education; \n     and\n       (B) assist parents of immigrant students by offering such \n     services as parent education and literacy development \n     services and by coordinating activities with other entities \n     to provide comprehensive community social services such as \n     health care, job training, child care, and transportation \n     services.\n       (2) Duration.--Each grant awarded under this section shall \n     be awarded for a period of not more than 5 years. A \n     partnership may use funds made available through the grant \n     for not more than 1 year for planning and program design.\n       (f) Applications for Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--Each eligible partnership desiring a grant \n     under this section shall submit an application to the \n     Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (2) Eligible partnerships.--To be eligible to receive a \n     grant under this section, a partnership--\n       (A) shall include--\n       (i) at least 1 local educational agency;

and\n       (I) any other information that the Secretary may require.\n       (g) Selection of Grantees.--\n       (1) Criteria.--The Secretary, through a peer review \n     process, shall select partnerships to receive grants under \n     this section on the basis of the quality of the programs \n     proposed in the applications submitted under subsection (f), \n     taking into consideration such factors as--\n       (A) the extent to which the program proposed in such an \n     application effectively addresses differences in language, \n     culture, and customs;\n       (B) the quality of the activities proposed by a \n     partnership;\n       (C) the extent of parental, student, and community \n     involvement;\n       (D) the extent to which the partnership will ensure the \n     coordination of comprehensive community social services with \n     the program;\n       (E) the quality of the plan for measuring and assessing \n     success;

Applicants for family- and employment-\n     based visas are waiting as long as 3 to 4 years to obtain a \n     visa or an adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.\n       (4) In California, the delays in processing adjustment of \n     status applications have averaged 52 months. In Texas, the \n     delays have averaged 69 months. Residents of New York have \n     had to wait up to 28 months; in Florida, 26 months; in \n     Illinois, 37 months; in Oregon, 31 months; and in Arizona, 49 \n     months. Most other States have experienced unacceptably long \n     processing and adjudication delays.\n       (5) Applicants pay fees to have their applications \n     adjudicated in a timely manner. These fees have increased \n     dramatically in recent years without a commensurate increase \n     in the capability of that Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service to process and adjudicate these cases in an efficient \n     manner.\n       (6) Processing these applications in a timely fashion is \n     critical. Each 12-month delay in adjudicating an adjustment \n     of status application requires the alien to file applications \n     to extend employment authorization to work and advance parole \n     documents to travel.\n       (7) The enormous delays in processing applications for \n     families and businesses have had a negative impact on the \n     reunification of spouses and minor children and the ability \n     of law-abiding and contributing members of our communities to \n     participate fully in the civic life of the United States.\n       (8) United States employers have also experienced \n     debilitating delays in hiring employees who contribute to the \n     economic growth of the United States. These delays have \n     forced employers to send highly skilled and valued employees \n     out of the United States because their immigrant petitions \n     were not approved in a timely fashion. Such disruptions \n     seriously threaten the competitive edge of the United States \n     in the global marketplace.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service with \n     the mechanisms it\n\n[[Page S9513]]\n\n     needs to eliminate the current backlog in the processing of \n     immigration benefit applications within 1 year after \n     enactment of this Act and to maintain the elimination of the \n     backlog in future years; and\n       (2) provide for regular congressional oversight of the \n     performance of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in \n     eliminating the backlog and processing delays in immigration \n     benefits adjudications.\n       (c) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     processing of an immigration benefit application should be \n     completed not later than 180 days after the initial filing of \n     the application, except that a petition for a nonimmigrant \n     visa under section 214(c) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act should be processed not later than 30 days after the \n     filing of the petition.\n\n     SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Backlog.--The term ``backlog'' means, with respect to \n     an immigration benefit application, the period of time in \n     excess of 180 days that such application has been pending \n     before the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n       (2) Immigration benefit application.--The term \n     ``immigration benefit application'' means any application or \n     petition to confer, certify, change, adjust, or extend any \n     status granted under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n     SEC. 204.

Such disruptions \n     seriously threaten the competitive edge of the United States \n     in the global marketplace.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service with \n     the mechanisms it needs to eliminate the current backlog in \n     the processing of immigration benefit applications within 1 \n     year after enactment of this Act and to maintain the \n     elimination of the backlog in future years; and\n       (2) provide for regular congressional oversight of the \n     performance of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in \n     eliminating the backlog and processing delays in immigration \n     benefits adjudications.\n       (c) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     processing of an immigration benefit application should be \n     completed not later than 180 days after the initial filing of \n     the application, except that a petition for a nonimmigrant \n     visa under section 214(c) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act should be processed not later than 30 days after the \n     filing of the petition.\n\n     SEC. 203.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Immigration Services and \n     Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 202. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Applications for naturalization have increased \n     dramatically in recent years, outpacing the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service's ability to process them.\n\n[[Page S9516]]\n\n       (2) The dramatic increase in applications for \n     naturalization and the inability of the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service to deal with them adequately has \n     resulted in an unacceptably large backlog in naturalization \n     adjudications.\n       (3) The processing times in the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service's other immigration benefits have been \n     unacceptably long. Applicants for family- and employment-\n     based visas are waiting as long as 3 to 4 years to obtain a \n     visa or an adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.\n       (4) In California, the delays in processing adjustment of \n     status applications have averaged 52 months. In Texas, the \n     delays have averaged 69 months. Residents of New York have \n     had to wait up to 28 months; in Florida, 26 months; in \n     Illinois, 37 months; in Oregon, 31 months; and in Arizona, 49 \n     months. Most other States have experienced unacceptably long \n     processing and adjudication delays.\n       (5) Applicants pay fees to have their applications \n     adjudicated in a timely manner. These fees have increased \n     dramatically in recent years without a commensurate increase \n     in the capability of that Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service to process and adjudicate these cases in an efficient \n     manner.\n       (6) Processing these applications in a timely fashion is \n     critical. Each 12-month delay in adjudicating an adjustment \n     of status application requires the alien to file applications \n     to extend employment authorization to work and advance parole \n     documents to travel.\n       (7) The enormous delays in processing applications for \n     families and businesses have had a negative impact on the \n     reunification of spouses and minor children and the ability \n     of law-abiding and contributing members of our communities to \n     participate fully in the civic life of the United States.\n       (8) United States employers have also experienced \n     debilitating delays in hiring employees who contribute to the \n     economic growth of the United States. These delays have \n     forced employers to send highly skilled and valued employees \n     out of the United States because their immigrant petitions \n     were not approved in a timely fashion. Such disruptions \n     seriously threaten the competitive edge of the United States \n     in the global marketplace.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service with \n     the mechanisms it needs to eliminate the current backlog in \n     the processing of immigration benefit applications within 1 \n     year after enactment of this Act and to maintain the \n     elimination of the backlog in future years; and\n       (2) provide for regular congressional oversight of the \n     performance of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in \n     eliminating the backlog and processing delays in immigration \n     benefits adjudications.\n       (c) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     processing of an immigration benefit application should be \n     completed not later than 180 days after the initial filing of \n     the application, except that a petition for a nonimmigrant \n     visa under section 214(c) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act should be processed not later than 30 days after the \n     filing of the petition.\n\n     SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Backlog.--The term ``backlog'' means, with respect to \n     an immigration benefit application, the period of time in \n     excess of 180 days that such application has been pending \n     before the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n       (2) Immigration benefit application.--The term \n     ``immigration benefit application'' means any application or \n     petition to confer, certify, change, adjust, or extend any \n     status granted under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n     SEC. 204.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1534, the Coastal \nZone Management Act of 2000. Originally passed in 1972, the Coastal \nZone Management Act, CZMA, was intended to address increased population \nand development in coastal communities. The programs established under \nthis law were designed to balance responsible development with the \npreservation of the coastal environment. With over half of the U.S. \npopulation living in coastal areas, such balance is more important than \never.\n  This bill reauthorizes the law through fiscal year 2004 and improves \nthe framework of the CZMA--voluntary federal-state matching grant \nprograms. S. 1534 also enhances the ability of coastal zone managers to \nmeet the ever increasing demands of tourism, commercial growth, \npollution and environmental protection. In fact, one of the most \nserious problems facing our coastal environment is the damage caused by \npolluted runoff, or nonpoint source pollution. Polluted runoff has \ncontributed to human health problems, permanent environmental damage, \nand beach closures.\n  The legislation before us today will improve the ability of managers \nto address polluted runoff in a manner specifically tailored to each \nstate's individual needs. The bill clarifies and confirms that matching \nfederal grants may be used to address nonpoint source pollution under \nthe CZMA. In addition, S. 1534 reauthorizes the coastal zone \nenhancement grant program and provides dedicated funding for the \ncontinued implementation of state coastal nonpoint source pollution \nplans. Previous provisions had limited the program to projects such as \nwetlands protection and restoration, protection from coastal hazards, \nand reduction of marine debris along the coast.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1534. It is a strong, pro-\nenvironment bill, which will provide a series of improvements to the \nCoastal Zone Management Act. Most importantly, the bill allows local \nand state environmental problems to be addressed on a community-by-\ncommunity basis. This bipartisan bill enjoys the strong support of the \nCoastal States Organization, which represents the governors of more \nthan 30 states, and a coalition of environmental organizations.\n  I would like to thank Senator Snowe, the sponsor of the legislation, \nand Senators Kerry and Hollings for their bipartisan support of and \nhard work on\n\n[[Page S9547]]\n\nthis bill. I would also like to express my gratitude and that of the \nCommerce Committee to the staff who worked on this bill, including \nSloan Rappoport, Stephanie Bailenson, Brooke Sikora, Rick Kenin and \nMargaret Spring. In particular I would like to thank Emily Lindow, a \nSea Grant fellow, whose background and experience in coastal management \nissues helped produce a strong and reasonable CZMA bill. In addition, \nthe Committee appreciates the efforts of Jena Carter, a former Sea \nGrant fellow, and Catherine Wannamaker, two former Committee staff who \nhelped develop the legislation.\n  Again I urge the Senate to pass S. 1534, the Coastal Zone Management \nAct of 2000.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support in passing S. \n1534, a bill to reauthorize the Coastal Zone Management Act for fiscal \nyears 2000 through 2004, which the Commerce Committee reported out \nfavorably this session. First, I would like to commend Senators Snowe \nand Kerry for their leadership on this very important reauthorization.\n  In 1969, the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources \n(the Stratton Commission) recommended that: ``. . . a Coastal Zone \nManagement Act be enacted which will provide policy objectives for the \ncoastal zone and authorize federal grants-in-aid to facilitate the \nestablishment of State Coastal Zone Authorities empowered to manage the \ncoastal waters and adjacent land.''\n  In response to this recommendation, Congress, in 1972, enacted \ncoastal zone management legislation to balance coastal development and \npreservation needs. To encourage state participation, the CZMA \nestablished a voluntary, two-stage, state assistance program. The first \nstage, awarded ``section 305'' grants to coastal states for development \nof coastal management programs meeting certain federal requirements. \nState programs which were judged by the Secretary of Commerce to meet \nthose requirements received Federal approval and became eligible for \nthe second stage of grants. This second stage, under section 306, \nprovides ongoing assistance for states to implement their federally-\napproved coastal programs. All grants require equal matching funds from \nthe state. Since passage of the CZMA, all 34 eligible states and \nterritories have participated in the program to some degree. Currently, \n34 of the 35 eligible coastal states and territories have Federally \napproved plans. The approved plans include more than 100,000 miles of \ncoastline, which represents nearly all of the national total covered by \nthe Act. The Ohio, Georgia, and Texas, and Minnesota state CZMA \nprograms all received federal approval within the past three years. Of \nthe eligible states, only Illinois is not participating.\n  Let me note that the nature and structure of CZM programs vary widely \nfrom state to state. This diversity was intended by Congress. Some \nstates, like North Carolina, passed comprehensive legislation as a \nframework for coastal management. Other states, like Oregon, used \nexisting land use legislation as the foundation for their federally-\napproved programs. Finally, states like Florida and Massachusetts \nnetworked existing, single-purpose laws into a comprehensive umbrella \nfor coastal management. The national program, therefore, is founded in \nthe authorities and powers of the coastal states and local governments. \nThrough the CZMA, these collective authorities are orchestrated to \nserve the ``national interest in effective management, beneficial use, \nprotection, and development of the coastal zone.'' This 28 year program \nis a success story of how the local, state and federal government can \nwork together for the benefit of all who enjoy and rely on our coastal \nresources.\n\n  I am pleased to report that S. 1534 reauthorizes and strengthens a \nprogram that works well. It provides total authorizations of over $136 \nmillion, and adds a new Coastal Community Grant Program under section \n309A for states that want to focus on coastal community-based \ninitiatives. This provision is aimed at addressing the need for Federal \nand state support of community-based planning, strategies, and \nsolutions for local sprawl and development issues in the coastal zone. \nIn addition, it strengthens and provides increased authorizations for \nthe National Estuarine Research Reserve System, natural labs operated \nby the states that support management-oriented research needed by \ncoastal resource managers, as well as educational and interpretive \nprograms to improve public awareness and understanding of the coastal \nenvironment.\n  While the CZMA has proven greatly successful, the world has changed \nsince 1972. Today, over half of the U.S. population lives within 50 \nmiles of our shores--and more than 3,000 people move to the coast every \nday. In addition, more than 30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product is \ngenerated in the coastal zone. In my state of South Carolina, our \nbeaches now attract millions of visitors every year, all year long, \nplacing greater demands on our coastal resources than every before. And \nmore and more people are choosing to move to the coast--making the \ncoastal counties the fastest growing ones in the state. With population \ngrowth comes the demand for highways, shopping centers, schools, and \nsewers that permanently alter the landscape. If people are to continue \nto live and work on the coast, we must allow our states to do a better \njob of planning how we impact the very regions in which we all want to \nlive.\n  Strengthening the CZMA is one important step in addressing these \nproblems. These changes also call for another look at our overall ocean \nand coastal policy, which is why Congress this year enacted the Oceans \nAct of 2000, with the strong bipartisan support, including that of \nSenators Snowe, Kerry, Stevens and Breaux. Through reauthorization and \nstrengthening of the CZMA and creation of a new Ocean Policy Commission \ncalled for in the Oceans Act, we are on track in the year 2000 to \ncontinue and improve upon the good work started by the Stratton \nCommission in 1969.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1534, the Coastal \nZone Management Act of 2000. This bill reauthorizes and makes a number \nof important improvements to the Coastal Zone Management Act. Under the \nauthorities in this Act, coastal states can choose to participate in \nthe voluntary federal Coastal Zone Management Program. States design \nindividual coastal zone management programs, taking their specific \nneeds and problems into account, and then receive federal matching \nfunds to help carry out their program plans. State coastal zone \nprograms manage issues ranging from public access to beaches, \nprotecting habitat, to coordinating permits for coastal development.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Act was originally enacted by Congress in \n1972, in response to concerns over the increasing demands being placed \non our nation's coastal regions and resources. These pressures have \nincreased greatly since the Act was originally authorized. Although the \ncoastal zone only comprises 10 percent of the contiguous U.S. land \narea, it is home to more than 53 percent of the U.S. population, and \nmore than 3,600 people are relocating there annually. It is also an \nextremely important region economically, supporting commercial and \nrecreational fishing, a booming coastal tourism industry, major \ncommercial shipping, and a variety of other coastal industries.\n  The coastal zone is comprised of a number of delicate and extremely \nimportant ecosystems. Its health is of vital importance not only to the \nmultitude of plants and animals that inhabit this area, but also the \npeople and communities that are dependent on it for their livelihood. \nFor example, coastal estuaries provide habitat for more than 75 percent \nof the U.S. commercial and 85 percent of the U.S. recreational \nfisheries. In turn, the commercial fishing industry, with value-added \nservices included, contributes $40 billion to the U.S. economy each \nyear. Recreational fishing added another $25 billion to the economy. \nUnfortunately, these major economic contributions are being threatened \nby environmental problems such as non-point source pollution.\n  Non-point source pollution is degrading the condition of our coastal \nrivers, wetlands, and marine environments. Although the states are \ncurrently taking action to address this problem under existing \nauthority, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 encourages them to \ntake additional steps to\n\n[[Page S9548]]\n\ncombat the problem through the Coastal Community Program. This \ninitiative provides states with the funding and flexibility needed to \ndeal with their specific non-point source pollution problems. The \nstates will have the ability to implement local solutions to local \nproblems.\n  The Coastal Community Program in this bill also aides states in \ndeveloping and implementing creative initiatives to deal with problems \nother than non-point solution. It increases federal and state support \nof local community-based programs that address coastal environmental \nissues, such as the impact of development and sprawl on coastal uses \nand resources. This type of bottom-up management approach is critical. \nIt allows communities to design their own solutions to their unique \ncoastal environmental problems. The program also allows communities to \nbe proactive in protecting their coastal resources, preventing them \nfrom reaching a point where drastic action may become necessary.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 significantly increases \nauthorization levels for the Coastal Zone Management Program, allowing \nstates to better address their coastal management plan goals. The bill \nauthorizes $135.5 million for fiscal year 2001 and increases the \nauthorization levels by $5.5 million each year through fiscal year \n2004.\n  To provide further flexibility, the bill allows state matching funds \nto accrue in aggregate, as opposed to requiring the states to match \neach section individually. In my own state of Maine, our Coastal Zone \nManagement Program raises an average of seven dollars in state matching \nfunds for every single federal dollar appropriated. Unfortunately, not \nall states have been as successful. The new aggregate match provision \nwill give coastal states more leeway to address important state and \ncommunity projects.\n  Additionally, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 increases \nauthorization for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System \n(NERRS) to $12 million in fiscal year 2001 with an additional $1 \nmillion increase each year through fiscal year 2004. The NERRS is a \nnetwork of reserves across the country that are operated as a \ncooperative federal-state partnership. Currently, there are 25 reserves \nin 22 states. They provide an important opportunity for long-term \nresearch and education in estuarine ecosystems. Additional funds will \nhelp strengthen this nationwide program which has not received \nincreased funding commensurate with the addition of new reserves.\n  I would like to address a very serious problem facing the Coastal \nZone Management Program that we have tried to rectify in this bill. The \nAdministrative Grant section, section 306, serves as the base funding \nmechanism for the states' coastal zone management programs. The amount \nof funding each state receives is determined by a formula that takes \ninto account both the length of coastline and the population of each \nstate. However, since 1992, the Appropriations Committee has imposed a \ntwo million dollar cap per state on Administrative Grants. This was an \nattempt to ensure equitable allocation to all the participating states. \nHowever, over the past eight years, appropriations for Administrative \nGrants have increased by $19 million, yet the $2 million cap has \nremained. The result has been an inequitable distribution of these new \nfunds. In fiscal year 2000, 13 states had reached this arbitrary $2 \nmillion cap. These 13 states account for 83 percent of our Nation's \ncoastline and 76 percent of our coastal population.\n  It is not equitable to have the 13 states with the largest coastlines \nand populations stuck at a two million dollar cap, despite major \noverall funding increases. While smaller states have enjoyed additional \nprogrammatic success due to an influx of funding, some of the larger \nstates have stagnated. In an attempt to reassure members of the \nAppropriations Committee that a fair distribution of funds can occur \nwithout this hard cap in place, I have worked with Senator Hollings to \ndevelop language that has been included in this bill that directs the \nSecretary of Commerce to ensure equitable increases or decreases \nbetween funding years for each state. It further requires that states \nshould not experience a decrease in base program funds in any year when \nthe overall appropriations increase. I would like to thank Senator \nHollings for his assistance in resolving this matter and his commitment \nover the years to ensuring that the states be treated fairly.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Act enjoys wide support among all of the \ncoastal states due to its history of success. This support has been \nclearly demonstrated by the many members of the Commerce Committee who \nhave worked with me to strengthen this program. I would like to thank \nSenator Kerry, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee for his hard work and support of this bill. I would also \nlike to express my appreciation to Senator McCain, a co-sponsor of the \nbill and the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, \nthe ranking member of the Committee, for their bipartisan support of \nthis measure. I urge the Senate to pass S. 1534, as amended.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4278\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 830, S. 893.\n\n[[Page S9553]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 893) to amend title 46, United States Code, to \n     provide equitable treatment with respect to State and local \n     income taxes for certain individuals who perform duties on \n     vessels.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 893, \nthe Vessel Worker Tax Fairness Act. The bill will provide men and women \nworking our nation's inland waterways the same treatment with respect \nto State and local income taxes as other men and women employed in \ninterstate transportation of commerce receive. This measure was passed \nunanimously out of the Senate Commerce Committee on June 15 of this \nyear.\n  S. 893 declares individuals engaged on a vessel to perform assigned \nduties in more than one State to be exempt from income taxation laws of \nStates or political subdivisions of which that individual is not a \nresident.\n  While the Interstate Commerce Act exempts truck drivers, airline \npilots, and railroad employees from being taxed by state and local \njurisdictions in which they do not reside, it does not recognize \nmerchant mariners who operate vessels in more than one state. It is \ntime we correct this oversight and afford merchant mariners the same \ntax treatment similar transport operators are provided due to the \ninterstate nature of their business.\n  By passing this measure today, we will be providing much needed \nrelief to merchant mariners. Under existing law, water transportation \nworkers, including marine pilots, tow and tugboat workers and others \nwho work aboard vessels are often subjected to filing and tax \nrequirements by states other than their state of residence leading to \npossible double taxation. I do not believe that double taxation is what \nCongress intended for any transportation worker when it crafted the \nInterstate Commerce Act. By passing S. 893 today, we can make that \nintent reality.\n  I thank Senator Gorton for his efforts in bringing this bill forward. \nI hope my colleagues will join us in supporting passage of this \nlegislation so we can move it on to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am glad that the U.S. Senate is finally \npassing the Transportation Worker Tax Fairness Act. This bi-partisan \nlegislation, which I introduced with Senator Murray, will ensure that \ntransportation workers who toil away on our nation's waterways receive \nthe same tax treatment afforded their peers who work on the nation's \nhighways, railroads, or navigate the skies.\n  Truck drivers, railroad personnel, and airline personnel are \ncurrently covered by the Interstate Commerce Act, which exempts their \nincome from double taxation. Water carriers, who work on tugboats or \nships, were not included in the original legislation. This treatment is \npatently unfair. The Transportation Worker Tax Fairness Act will \nrectify this situation by extending the same tax treatment to personnel \nwho work on the navigable waters of more than one state.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will have no impact on the federal \ntreasury. This measure simply allows those who work our navigable \nwaterways protection from double taxation.\n  This matter came to my attention through a series of constituent \nletters from Columbia River tug boat operators who are currently facing \ntaxation from Oregon as well as Washington state. I am committed to \nsecuring this relief for my constituents, as well as hard working tug \nboat operators across the nation, before the end of the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \nthe third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 893) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 893\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 731, S. 113.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 113) to increase the criminal penalties for \n     assaulting or threatening Federal judges, their family \n     members, and other public servants, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to see the Federal Judiciary \nProtection Act finally being acted on by the Senate today. In the last \nCongress, I was pleased to cosponsor nearly identical legislation \nintroduced by Senator Gordon Smith, which unanimously passed the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate but was not acted upon by the House \nof Representatives. I commend the Senator from Oregon for his continued \nleadership in protecting our Federal judiciary.\n  Our bipartisan legislation would provide greater protection to \nFederal judges, law enforcement officers and their families. \nSpecifically, our legislation would: increase the maximum prison term \nfor forcible assaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation or \ninterference with a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 3 \nyears imprisonment to 8 years; increase the maximum prison term for use \nof a deadly weapon or infliction of bodily injury against a Federal \njudge or law enforcement officer from 10 years imprisonment to 20 \nyears; and increase the maximum prison term for threatening murder or \nkidnaping of a member of the immediate family of a Federal judge or law \nenforcement officer from 5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the \nsupport of the Department of Justice, the United States Judicial \nConference, the United States Sentencing Commission and the United \nStates Marshal Service.\n  It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs \nthis legislation to protect the hard working men and women who serve in \nour Federal judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. But, \nunfortunately, we are seeing more violence and threats of violence \nagainst officials of our Federal government.\n  For example, a courtroom in Urbana, Illinois was firebombed last \nyear, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This\n\n[[Page S9555]]\n\nfollows the horrible tragedy of the bombing of the federal office \nbuilding in Oklahoma City in 1995. In my home state during the summer \nof 1997, a Vermont border patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously \nwounded by Carl Drega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire \nlaw enforcement officers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that \nday, Drega shot and killed two state troopers and a local judge in New \nHampshire. Apparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the \njudge who had ruled against him in a land dispute.\n  I had a chance to visit John Pfeiffer in the hospital and met his \nwife and young daughter. Thankfully, Agent Pfeiffer has returned to \nwork along the Vermont border. As a federal law enforcement officer, \nAgent Pfeiffer and his family will receive greater protection under our \nbill.\n  There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking \nthe law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge or \nlaw enforcement officer. Still, the U.S. Marshal Service is concerned \nwith more and more threats of harm to our judges and law enforcement \nofficers.\n  The extreme rhetoric that some have used in the past to attack the \njudiciary only feeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the \nRepublican leaders in the House of Representatives has been quoted as \nsaying: ``The judges need to be intimidated,'' and if they do not \nbehave, ``we're going to go after them in a big way.'' I know that this \nofficial did not intend to encourage violence against any Federal \nofficial, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade Federal \njudges in the eyes of the public.\n  Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate \nand violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve \nwithin it with the respect that is essential to preserving its public \nstanding.\n  We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people \naround the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence \nof our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability \nto act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long \nprotected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary \ncheck on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible \nto the gusts of the political winds of the moment.\n  We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the \nFederal Judiciary and law enforcement in this country who do a \ntremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the \nhard-working public servants that make up the federal government, who \nare too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that \nit takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal \nJudiciary and other law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that \nthese are people with children and parents and cousins and friends. \nThey deserve our respect and our protection.\n  I urge the House of Representatives to pass the Federal Judiciary \nProtection Act and look forward to its swift enactment into law.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 113) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to \nconsider and pass S. 1438, the National Law Enforcement Museum Act of \n1999. This legislation will authorize the construction of a National \nLaw Enforcement Museum to be built here in our Nation's Capital.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks peace \nofficers face in enforcing our laws. Throughout our nation's history, \nnearly 15,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers have \nlost their lives in the line of duty. Based on FBI statistics, nearly \n63,000 officers are assaulted each year in this country, resulting in \nmore than 21,000 injuries. On average, one police officer is killed \nsomewhere in America every 54 hours. Approximately 740,000 law \nenforcement professionals are continuing to put their lives on the line \nfor the safety and protection of others.\n  We owe all of those officers a huge debt of gratitude, and it is only \nfitting that we properly commemorate this outstanding record of service \nand sacrifice.\n  My legislation seeks to achieve this important goal by authorizing \nthe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit \norganization, to establish a comprehensive law enforcement museum and \nresearch repository on federal land in the District of Columbia. The \nFund is the same group that so ably carried out the congressional \nmandate of 1984 to establish the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial, which was dedicated in 1991 just a few blocks from the \nCapitol. Clearly, their record of achievement speaks volumes about \ntheir ability to meet this important challenge.\n  Since 1993, the Fund has efficiently operated a small-scale version \nof the National Law Enforcement Museum at a site located about two \nblocks from the Memorial. The time has come to broaden the scope of \nthis museum and move it in closer proximity to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial.\n  This museum would serve as a repository of information for \nresearchers, practitioners, and the general public. The museum will \nbecome the premiere source of information on issues related to law \nenforcement history and safety, and obviously a popular tourist \nattraction in Washington, DC, as well.\n  The ideal location for this museum is directly across from the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on a parcel of federal-owned \nproperty that now functions as a parking lot.\n  I introduced this legislation on July 27, 1999, and after committee \nhearings and extensive testimony, the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources reported the bill in July of this year. Although the \nbill was pending on the Senate calendar awaiting final action by the \nSenate, I was pleased to work with my colleagues, Senator Thompson, \nChairman of the Government Affairs Committee, and Senator Durbin, the \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, Restructuring and the District of Columbia, on a compromise \namendment.\n  After over two months of negotiations, the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial Fund and the District of Columbia Courts reached an \nagreement to clarify that the building of this museum will in no way \nconflict with court expansion and renovation plans. As a result of this \nagreement, Senators Thompson and Durbin have offered an amendment with \nmy support to reflect this agreement with the courts.\n  Under my legislation, no federal dollars are being proposed to build \nthis museum. Rather, the Fund would raise all of the money necessary to \nconstruct the museum through private donations. The legislation places \nthe responsibility of operating the museum in the hands of the Fund.\n  Finally, let me add that this legislation is supported by 15 national \nlaw enforcement organizations: the Concerns of Police Survivors; the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association; the Fraternal Order of \nPolice; the Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary; the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police; the International Brotherhood of \nPolice Officers; the International Union of Police Associations/AFL-\nCIO; the National Association of Police Organizations; the National \nBlack Police Association; the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives; the National Sheriffs Association; the National \nTroopers Coalition; the Police Executive Research Forum; the Police \nFoundation; the United Federation of Police; and the National Law \nEnforcement Council. Together, these organizations represent virtually \nevery law\n\n[[Page S9557]]\n\nenforcement officer, family member and police survivor in the United \nStates.\n  As we remember the sacrifices made by our brave officers, I strongly \nurge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation. I also call \non our colleagues in the House to pass this important bill before the \nCongress adjourns for the year.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4279\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.
