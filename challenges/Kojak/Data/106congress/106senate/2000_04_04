Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 101, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Con. Res. 101) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal years 2001 through 2005 and revising the budgetary \n     levels for fiscal year 2000.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npresence and use of small electronic calculators be permitted on the \nfloor of the Senate during consideration of the fiscal year 2001 \nconcurrent budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have brief opening remarks, after which time I will \nbe pleased to yield to either the minority whip or the ranking member.\n  First, a couple of observations. We are now on the budget resolution. \nIt is now pending before the Senate. Before I summarize the resolution \nas reported by the Budget Committee last week, let me cover a couple of \nhousekeeping or managerial items. For those Senators and staff here, \nand those who might be listening, I remind everyone that the procedure \nfor considering a budget resolution in the Senate is unique compared to \nother legislation and other legislative items that we debate and amend \non the floor.\n  First, a budget resolution is privileged. That means proceeding to \nits consideration as we have done this morning could not have been \ndelayed by a Senator by filibuster or otherwise.\n  Second, the underlying law, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act--not the resolution--effectively establishes the rules for \nconsidering this resolution. The first of the rules is that there is a \ntime limit for considering a budget resolution. That time limit is 50 \nhours. Less time can always be taken. While it has never been used, a \nnondebatable motion to reduce debate time is always in order. The 50 \nhours does not count the time in the quorums immediately preceding a \nvote, nor does it count the actual voting time. Fifty hours is evenly \ndivided between the sponsor and the opponents of the resolution.\n  An amendment or amendments in the first degree to the resolution are \nlimited to 2 hours evenly divided between the mover of the amendment \nand its opponents. Additional time can be yielded off the overall \nresolution by\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\nthe manager or the ranking member, or their designee, if such time is \nstill available under the 50-hour rule. Amendments to amendments are \nlimited to 1 hour, again, evenly divided between the mover and the \nopponent. As before, if overall time exists on the resolution, Members \ncan add time to the debate on the second-degree amendment.\n  The next discussion is where it gets a little bit difficult. Senators \nwho may want to amend this resolution should note there are very \nparticular rules that apply. First, the committee-reported budget \nresolution forms the basis of germaneness.\n  There are four types of germane amendments: One, an amendment to \nstrike language or numbers, which is germane per se; second, an \namendment to change dates or numbers; third, an amendment adding sense \nof the Senate for matters within the jurisdiction of the Budget \nCommittee; and fourth, an amendment that limits some power in the \nresolution. If not germane, it will take three-fifths of the Senators' \naffirmative votes to waive the point of order. If not, the amendment \nwill fall.\n  I emphasize these procedures so Senators and their staffs will not be \nsurprised if a germaneness point of order is raised on their amendment.\n  Later in this debate we will follow the rules the act laid out for us \nconsidering a budget resolution, and we will try to finish it in an \norderly manner before the week is complete. I will briefly summarize \nthe reported resolution before us today.\n  First, let me say this annual exercise further strengthens my resolve \nto bring to the floor changes to this process, to change it into a \nbiennial budget and biennial appropriations process. But we are charged \nwith reporting an annual budget, and until the law is changed, or if it \nis changed, the committee-reported resolution abides by the current \nlaw.\n  I acknowledge that whatever fiscal policy we outline in any budget \nresolution the Senate considers this year, that resolution will be \nconstructed in the heat of a very political year and it will, in truth, \nbe ministered over by a new President and new Congress next year. So \nthis resolution can only be a broad blueprint for fiscal policy. It \nallows us to complete our work expeditiously, if at all possible, this \nyear. It recognizes the need for reform in many areas and that those \nreforms will undoubtedly have to wait until the next Congress and the \nnext President.\n  While we now have the luxury of budgeting in a world of possible \nsurpluses, that does not mean reform in Government is not necessary. \nReforms to the process are needed, and this committee's resolution \nbegins down that path so we can replace some cynicism that was built up \nabout the Federal budgeting process with some minor but new enforcement \ntools. Some may not like them, but we are trying very hard to answer a \ncall from many Senators that the budget resolution be enforced and that \nwe understand precisely what we are doing and look to the resolution \nitself for how much we can spend and where we are going.\n  Reforms are needed to ensure the long-term solvency of the Social \nSecurity system, not simply placing more empty IOUs on future \ngenerations. We cannot reform the Social Security system without a \nPresident who is willing, and thus far we have not had such in the \nWhite House under the administration of President Clinton.\n  Reforms are needed in the Medicare program, not simply promising more \npolitically popular benefits to a system in which, in 2010, the outgo \nwill exceed income. In this budget resolution, we have provided $40 \nbillion in two installments of $20 billion and $20 billion to do reform \nand add some prescription benefits, if that is what Congress decides to \ndo.\n  Major reforms are needed to our Tax Code. We all know that. While the \nresolution before us proposes to make room for tax reductions, I \nacknowledge that until the unfairness of this system and its \ncomplexities are addressed, real tax reform waits.\n  Finally, reforms to government programs are broadly needed; there is \nno doubt about that. As GAO and the Congressional Budget Office have \npointed out to us earlier this year, we really do not need 342 Federal \neconomic-development-related programs. We really do not need 12 \ndifferent agencies administering 35 different laws on food safety. It \nwould seem one agency would be sufficient.\n  I am not sure we need over a dozen postsecondary education programs \nand 224 elementary and secondary education programs administered by the \nDepartment of Education with their overlapping, duplicating, \ninefficient delivery of Federal funds to States. Perhaps this year we \nwill consider on the floor of the Senate some dramatic reforms that \nmight alter the education system I have just described.\n\n  So when critics say this resolution does not provide enough for the \ndiscretionary accounts, both defense and nondefense, I have to respond: \nNot if you assume that everything the Government does today is done \nefficiently and effectively. But I am realistic, and reform of these \nprograms will not come in the 70 days left in this Congress.\n  So the resolution before us is not everything an outgoing \nadministration wants because, quite frankly, they are not going to be \naround to administer what I consider their bloated budget request. But \nit is a responsible step for the short amount of time left in Congress.\n  Let me conclude with some key points on this resolution.\n  No. 1, it protects Social Security. Not one penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus is touched.\n  No. 2, it balances the budget every year, not counting the Social \nSecurity surplus. In other words, even though we have not been able to \nadopt a lockbox, we have followed the premise and philosophy and \nsubstance of a lockbox; that is, none of the Social Security money \nsurplus is being spent.\n  It retires debt held by the public, nearly $174 billion this year \nalone, and over $1.1 trillion over the next 5 years.\n  It sets aside $8 billion in non-Social Security surpluses for debt \nrelief this year alone. In other words, that $8 billion could be spent \nwithout us touching the Social Security trust fund. We could still live \nup to that promise. But we have taken $8 billion of the surplus outside \nof Social Security and put that on the debt also.\n  It rejects the President's proposed cuts in Medicare. It strengthens \nMedicare and sets up a $40 billion reserve for a new prescription drug \nbenefit immediately, with reform coming later.\n  Expenditures for the Department of Education would increase $4.5 \nbillion this year, special ed would increase nearly $2.2 billion, and \nHead Start funding would be up nearly $255 million.\n  Funding for our national security would increase nearly 4.8 percent \nnext year, up to $305.8 billion, nearly a $17 billion increase.\n  Funding for WIC, section 8 housing, National Park Service, highways \nand airports, all would increase next year, as would Head Start.\n  We provide immediate emergency assistance to depressed agricultural \nsections in the form of nearly $5.5 billion in income support needed \nthis year, not next year.\n  And, yes, we provide $150 billion in tax relief for American \nfamilies, for fairness and equity in the form of the marriage penalty, \nfor small businesses and startups, for education and medical \nassistance. Remember, the President did not provide any tax relief for \nthe next 5 years.\n  I believe this is a fair beginning. I am very hopeful we can have a \nlively debate about this on the floor of the Senate. For every $1 in \ntax relief, since there are those who continue to say the tax relief we \nseek is too big, too much, too risky--this resolution devotes $13 to \ndebt reduction. For every $1 in tax relief, this resolution devotes $13 \nfor debt reduction; 13-to-1 is the ratio in the first year. It is down \nto about 8-to-1 for the entire 5 years.\n  I believe it is a fair resolution. It is not a risky resolution, as \nsome will claim. I contend that increasing spending for domestic \nprograms nearly 14 percent next year, as the President would do, is \nmuch more risky to the future of Social Security and debt reduction \nthan a modest tax reduction.\n\n  Let me explain. If you increased domestic discretionary spending by \n14 percent a year, it would only take 3 years until you would have to \nuse the Social Security surplus to pay for domestic spending. What does \nthat mean? It means either the President sent us a one-time political \nyear 14-percent increased budget or he is serious that we\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\nneed that amount every year to meet the so-called needs of domestic \nprograms. In either case, it is not the right thing to do.\n  If it was sent up here as a one-time political budget with everything \nin it but the kitchen sink, then it should be denied. If it was sent up \nhere to set a pattern for 3 or 4 years, then it truly would be an \ninjustice to senior citizens and the Social Security trust fund.\n  But even if the tax reductions we plan for do not become law, we make \nsure every penny of that which would have gone to tax reductions is \nreturned in the form of debt reduction, not new spending. So for those \nwho say there will be no tax reduction or tax relief this year, and for \nthe President who says even though Republicans will try, he will not \nlet it happen, then obviously we will put another $150 billion, or some \nsubstantial portion of it, on the debt, which only adds to the numbers \nI have already discussed with you with reference to tax reduction in \nthis budget resolution.\n  It is a resolution that will allow us to get our work done. I say to \nthe Republicans, my side of the aisle, this budget resolution cleared \nthe committee on a party line vote with every Republican voting for it \nand every Democrat voting against it. I do not know how it will turn \nout 3, 4, or 5 days from now, but I do hope Republicans will consider \nthat what they want to change in it may, indeed, change whether or not \nwe can adopt a budget resolution at all on the floor.\n  I hope Republicans will consult and talk with the chairman and \nmanager of the bill as we consider this resolution so that our end \nproduct will be that we will pass a budget resolution and go to \nconference with the House and let our appropriations committees start \ntheir work.\n  I do want to say at the beginning and, obviously, I will at the end, \nthat it has been a pleasure working with Senator Lautenberg. This is \nhis last time managing the budget resolution because he will be leaving \nthe Senate.\n  We started off not knowing each other very well, maybe being a little \nguarded about how we would think about what each one said, whether we \nwould be cynical about it, whether we would believe it. I compliment \nhim. His job has become very important to him, and he has become very \nimportant to this job. It will be a pleasure working with him for the \nnext 4 or 5 days. I very much thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nwhat he has done. I thank everyone for listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici. I appreciate \nhis comments.\n  As noted, this is my last year as the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. As everyone around here knows, the ranking member harbors \nusually one thought, and that is to move to the chairmanship to give \ntheir colleague on the other side of the aisle a chance to work as a \nranking member, to understand fully what it is like.\n  Before I begin a discussion of the budget resolution--and I again \nthank Senator Domenici for his kind comments; the relationship has been \na good one--it has been a privilege and an honor to represent the \nSenate Democrats on the Budget Committee, and I am going to miss it. In \nmy early days in the Senate, I never played with the thought of being a \nleader in budget matters, never expecting to be the senior Democrat. In \nfact, I did not even in the beginning days intend to be on the Budget \nCommittee. But I had a good friend whom I knew before I came to the \nSenate, Senator Joe Biden from Delaware. He pulled me aside early in my \ncareer and made me an offer that sounded too good to be true. \n``Frank,'' he said, ``you're such a good friend and such a good Senator \nthat I'm going to resign my seat on the Budget Committee, and I'm going \nto give it to you.''\n  Only later did I come to realize what Senator Biden was really up to. \nHe knew what the Budget Committee function was. He knew how difficult \nsome of the discussions would become, and he knew conclusions arrived \nat are rarely satisfactory. I forgive him. It has taken me a decade to \ndo that, and I am not going to hold a grudge any longer.\n  Seriously, while I fell into the position of ranking member--that is, \nthe senior Democrat on the Budget Committee--I found it not only \ninteresting but a rewarding position. One of the principal reasons is \nthat I have had the privilege to serve with a very distinguished \nSenator, our chairman, Pete Domenici. Senator Domenici and I worked \ntogether from different beliefs, with very different views about \nGovernment and its proper role. While we have often disagreed, I have \ntremendous respect and even affection for him. We learned something \nabout the personal sides of each other's lives, which reduces barriers \nthat often arise from competitive views. When one understands what \nmakes the other person tick and hears his concerns and lets him \nunderstand your concerns, it makes for a different kind of alliance \nthan the traditional debate.\n  Over the years, we developed an appreciation and respect for one \nanother. Senator Domenici's mastery of the budget comes not only from \nyears of experience but lots of hard work as well. It comes from a \ngenuine commitment he has to serving his country to the best of his \nability. I have learned a lot from Senator Domenici, and I publicly \nthank him for his friendship over the years.\n  By their nature, debates on the budget tend to be more partisan than \nother debates. After all, setting a broad plan for allocating resources \nnecessarily depends on judgments based on established principles we \nbring with us from our views and priorities influenced by our \nrespective parties and affiliations.\n  It is no surprise that our parties have different perspectives on \nthis. In fact, in some ways, this diversity of views is one of our \nNation's great strengths; we can talk about these things and air our \nviews and give the public a chance to hear what it is we are saying and \nin what we believe.\n\n  Still, I cannot help but regret that budget debates over the past \ndecade have often become so entirely partisan. I saw it with the \nDemocrats as well as Republicans. No one party is at fault. It does not \nserve the Nation as we would all want to do. I hope perhaps, if the era \nof surpluses can be sustained longer, we can finally inject more \nbipartisanship into the process.\n  I may represent Democrats, but I have respect for my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. I do not always appear to be understanding \nof their views, but they, too, adhere to the principles that brought \nthem here. While it is not pleasant for me to accept it, I am often \nreminded: They were sent here as a majority by the people across this \ncountry and we have to respect or acknowledge that fact. But though I \nserve in the minority, I sincerely believe the approach the budget \nbrings to the table is the right one for America. I know from personal \nexperience that Government has a role to play, in my view, in the lives \nof our people and is to exercise that role responsibly.\n  I make that judgment based on personal experience. I have said it \nbefore on the floor of the Senate, and I will take a minute in this \ntwilight of my career to restate it.\n  My father died when he was 43. My mother was 36. I had already \nenlisted in the Army. I watched my father's health disintegrate in \nfront of my eyes--13 months of pain, agony, and degradation. He died, \nagain, after I had enlisted in the Army. He died not only leaving the \ngrief and the heartache which accompanies the death of a young man--my \nsister, my mother and I comprised the entire family; my sister was 12, \nand I was 18--not only did we experience the pain of the loss, but we \nwere deeply in debt to doctors and hospitals. My mother tried her best \nto meet those obligations. I was sending home, when I had the \nopportunity, $50 a month out of my pay. That was not very much.\n  Oh, if we had only had health insurance at that time, if we had only \nsome way for the Government to join us in our quest to stay alive as a \nfamily and do what my father always wanted us to do--be productive \ncitizens.\n  My next experience which helped develop my thinking about \nGovernment's role was when I was able to take advantage of the GI bill \nafter my service in World War II in Europe during the height of the war \nand go to a university that otherwise would have been unavailable to \nme. We could never have afforded the tuition no matter how\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\nhard we worked because we also had to support and unite the three of \nus.\n  That GI bill made an enormous difference, not only in my life, but \npermit me a moment of immodesty to say that I helped create a business \nthat created an industry, the computing industry, which is a bigger \npart of the computer atmosphere, the computer functioning, the computer \nindustry, than the hardware side: Computing, providing services. We \nwere pioneers. And I am a member of something called the Hall of Fame \nof Information Processing in Dallas, TX.\n  Education enabled me to do that. I became very active in philanthropy \nand was national chairman of one of the largest charities in the world. \nAt the same time, I ran a company that employed lots and lots of \npeople--over 16,000--when I came to this Senate.\n  So much of what I have done has been dependent on the education I was \nable to receive as a contribution by my fellow Americans and my \ncountry.\n  Then, the privilege of serving here for 18 years has made an \nimpression on me that will last for life.\n  That is how I have acquired my view of what Government's role might \nbe. And we dare not turn our back on it.\n  With that, I will turn to the business directly at hand.\n  Mr. President, in my role as ranking member, I begin by laying out \nthe broad budget principles with which most Democrats agree. Perhaps \nmost fundamentally, Democrats believe the budget should address the \nneeds of ordinary Americans as it prepares our Nation for the future. \nIt should strengthen Social Security and Medicare; provide prescription \ndrug coverage for our seniors desperate for some relief as they try to \nprotect their health from the financial burden of high prescription \ncosts; invest in education, health care, defense, and other compelling \nneeds.\n  We should provide targeted tax cuts for those struggling to advance \nthe well-being of the next generation. At the same time, it should \nmaintain fiscal discipline, reduce our debt, as most people in our \ncountry would want to do on a personal basis. The happiest day for lots \nof families is when the mortgage is paid off or when the bills are \nfinally paid for something that was necessary to acquire or, as we know \nthese days, to help people provide an education or assist in providing \nan education for their children. At the same time, we want to protect \nour Nation's economic prosperity.\n  In my view, this budget resolution fails to meet these goals. It \nwould use virtually the entire non-Social Security surplus for tax \nbreaks that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. It would require \ndeep and unrealistic cuts in domestic priorities, such as education and \nhealth care.\n  It proposes far less debt reduction than the budgets developed by \nPresident Clinton and the Senate Democrats. It fails to ensure that the \nCongress will consider legislation to establish a prescription drug \nbenefit. Finally, by covering only 5 years of operations, unlike the 10 \nyears we worked with last year, the resolution hides its long-term \ncosts and weakens fiscal discipline.\n  I want to address each of these points.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, says that over the next 5 \nyears, the non-Social Security surplus is going to be $171 billion. We \ndo not have any disagreement about that. That is what they say. This \nassumes that Congress freezes discretionary spending at the current \nreal levels, which means, very simply, that in order to protect the \nfunding of these programs, we have to allow for some inflation \nincreases, some inflationary adjustments, as modest as they might be.\n\n  In fact, if Congress increases domestic spending at the same rate as \nrecent years, which has been higher than inflation, the actual surplus \nwould even be smaller than that $171 billion.\n  Still, to give the majority the benefit of the doubt, we will ignore \nhistory for the moment and optimistically assume the non-Social \nSecurity surplus will be as projected, $171 billion.\n  The budget resolution, passed by the Republican majority, calls for \ntax breaks of $150 billion. I say that is at a minimum because there is \na reserve there for additional increases.\n  But this reduction in future surpluses would also require that the \nGovernment would pay more interest on the outstanding debt, in this \ncase $18 billion more. Thus, the real cost of the tax breaks isn't $150 \nbillion; it is $168 billion when we add the $18 billion for additional \ninterest. That consumes virtually the entire non-Social Security \nsurplus of $171 billion. This isn't mysterious; it is plain arithmetic.\n  People watching this debate might ask themselves: If the tax breaks \nuse virtually the entire non-Social Security surplus, how can the \nresolution also provide funding for any of the new initiatives it \nclaims to support, such as increases in military spending, prescription \ndrug coverage, agricultural risk management reform, payments to \ncounties, nuclear waste disposal activities, and various other claims \nof increases in discretionary programs?\n  The real answer is, it cannot. There is no way to fit all of this new \nspending in roughly the $3 billion that remains of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus. The numbers just do not add up.\n  Unfortunately, the majority seeks to sidestep the problem by assuming \nhuge unspecified cuts in domestic programs. The resolution calls for a \n6.5-percent cut in nondefense discretionary programs over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Because we are trying to address this to the public at large, I am \ngoing to take a moment to explain what this means.\n  A 6.5-percent cut in nondefense discretionary means, outside of \ndefense, those programs that many of us think are essential that have \nbeen in place will get a 6.5-percent cut. A 6.5-percent cut over 5 \nyears is pretty substantial because by the time you got to the fifth \nyear, the cut enlarges to 8.2 percent. In fact, since the resolution \nclaims to protect some specific programs, the cuts in other areas would \nbe well over 10 percent.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has analyzed how cuts such as \nthis could affect ordinary Americans. Here are just a few examples.\n  Mr. President, 20,000 teachers planned to be hired would not be \nhired. Those teachers were planned to be hired to reduce class sizes.\n  Five thousand communities would lose assistance to help construct and \nmodernize their schools. There are not many people in this country who \ndo not realize we have this enormous number of school buildings that \nare just inadequate for the purpose that they exist; that is, to \nprovide an atmosphere where our children can learn. If plaster is \nfalling from the ceilings, or there is no heating in the winter or \nventilation in the summer, we know that is not an atmosphere conducive \nto learning.\n  So there are 5,000 communities that would get help, but they won't \nunder the Republican plan; 62,000 fewer children would be served by the \nHead Start Program--one of the most successful programs this country \nhas; 19,000 fewer researchers, educators, students receive support from \nthe National Science Foundation. And if there is one place where \nAmerica excels, it is in research and in science.\n  I took a trip to the South Pole in January. People ask, ``Why did you \ngo there?'' It's a far and tough trip. I went there because I am \nworried about the climate, about the forecasts which talk about ever \nmore severe tornadoes and things such as cyclones and other natural \ndisasters. I wanted to know what is happening with the weather and \nclimate studies that we do down there.\n  I will tell you, one need not be a scientist to know that we have \nproblems. Now we are talking about an icefloe that is cracking away \nfrom the main part of the continent twice the size of Delaware. We had \none the size of Rhode Island float off some years ago. One day we are \ngoing to see an iceberg, an icefloe that is the size of Texas. What are \nwe going to do about that? Are we going to say maybe we can push it \nback and glue it together? Everybody knows that is not going to happen. \nIt says the ice is melting at an ever faster rate, and 70 percent of \nthe fresh water in the world exists at the South Pole. If that starts \nmixing with the saline of the oceans, we will have serious problems. \nThey may not be problems that affect anybody working in this room \ntoday, but I worry about my grandchildren and about their children and \nabout the future of mankind.\n  There will be 19,000 fewer researchers. Funding for all new federally \nled cleanups of toxic waste sites would be eliminated. I notice that \nthe Republican\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\ncandidate for President, George W. Bush, announced his interest in a \nbrownfields program, which is something we have been trying to do here \nfor a long time. I am glad to see that acknowledgement take place, to \nturn these fallow sites into productive, functioning areas where \nbusiness can flourish and people can visit. We can give some life to \nsome communities--many of them urban communities that are in various \nstages of decay and would like to be able to move up and away from \nthat.\n  We would have 430 fewer border patrol people available to safeguard \nour borders. Everybody knows what that problem is.\n  The list goes on and on. As most people around here recognize, cuts \nof this magnitude are totally unrealistic, and they are not going to \nhappen. We are going to play games--ping-pong--with the budget of the \nUnited States. In the final analysis, neither Republicans nor Democrats \nwill tolerate these cuts.\n  This is not the first time the Senate has assumed deep, unspecified \ncuts in a budget resolution. Last year's resolution included similarly \nunrealistic things. Not surprisingly, by the end of the year, the \nRepublican majority--not the President--had approved the appropriations \nbills, spending about $35 billion more than it planned for the year \ninitially. That is the same time and the same status that we have right \nnow. No doubt, something similar is going to happen this year. We are \nnot going to see Government close down. We learned that lesson. It was \nvivid and searing, and it is going to stay forever in our memories.\n  So we are not going to take those cuts that would make departments of \nGovernment inoperative or inadequate. Who is going to let go all these \nFBI agents and the border guards? One of the greatest concerns our \ncitizens have is to be secure in their homes, on the streets, and in \ntheir communities. Are we going to reduce law enforcement? We are not. \nWe may say so, or we may not even say so. We simply hide it in the \nvolume of pages and numbers that are presented to the public.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Republican budget relies on these unrealistic cuts \nfor its various increases in mandatory spending, such as aid to \nfarmers, prescription drugs, and other programs long ago, for the most \npart, considered essential. The cost of those increases--$62 billion \nfor those mandatory programs--would be locked in up front. The savings, \nhowever, would not be. When Congress later fails to make the assumed \ncuts in appropriations bills, funds for these new entitlements, it will \ncome from only one place--Social Security.\n  One might think that assumptions of deep, unrealistic cuts in \ndiscretionary spending would allow the Republicans to claim \nsignificantly more debt reduction than the budgets proposed by \nDemocrats. However, if one assumes that the Republican spending cuts \nactually materialize, which is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, \nthe Republican budget still would reduce much less than President \nClinton and Senate Democrats. The Republican plan will use non-Social \nSecurity surpluses to reduce only $19 billion, which is contrary to \nwhat is being said, over the next 5 years. By contrast, the President's \nbudget would reduce the $90 billion of debt, over the same period, \nnearly five times as much. This difference in debt reduction helps show \nhow extreme the GOP tax breaks are.\n  Throughout the markup on the resolution, Republicans claimed that \ntheir budget contained over $1 trillion of debt reduction. However, \nthis figure is based almost entirely on Social Security surpluses, and \nthese surpluses are off budget, and both parties have committed to \nprotecting them. Yet when it comes to the portion of the budget that \nremains subject to congressional discretion, Republicans have refused \nto devote significant resources for debt reduction. In doing so, they \nhave rejected repeated calls by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nto make debt reduction our first priority.\n  My next concern about the budget resolution is that it fails to \nensure Congress will act on legislation establishing a prescription \ndrug benefit. This is in marked contrast with its treatment of tax \nbreaks which the resolution's reconciliation instructions require of \nthe Finance Committee. This differential treatment is troubling, \nespecially given resistance from the Republican leadership to a \nmeaningful universal benefit. I hope that as the debate proceeds we can \ntake steps to ensure Congress really does approve a prescription drug \nbenefit this year.\n  My final concern about the budget resolution is that it covers only 5 \nyears--I mentioned that earlier--not the 10 included in last year's \nresolution. Those projections came out with--even though we know that \nforecasts are not necessarily precise, they are a gauge. Last year, we \nincluded them because it seemed to present a favorable position to the \nRepublican few. This year, we dropped back to 5 years because they know \nvery well that the second quintile is going to be one that spells \ndisaster. This has the effect of hiding the long-term costs of its tax \nbreaks, and it also weakens the budget resolution as a means of \nenforcing long-term fiscal discipline since points of order would not \nbe available against tax breaks that explode in cost after 5 years.\n  During markup, it was suggested that the budget resolution should \ncover only 5 years because CBO produces only 5-year estimates. That \nisn't true. In fact, since last year, CBO has been producing 10-year \nprojections. So why are these projections being ignored? Because they, \nagain, don't like the outcome of the second 5 years. Thus, no longer is \nthere a good excuse to restrict the budget resolution to only 5 years.\n  Considering that we are facing huge new liabilities when the baby \nboomers retire, we need to think longer term. We need to take all long-\nterm costs into account when establishing and enforcing fiscal policy.\n  Thus, I reluctantly conclude that the Republican budget fails to \nprepare for our future or address the needs of ordinary Americans \ntoday. It allocates virtually the entire non-Social Security surplus \nfor tax breaks. It would require drastic, unrealistic cuts in these \nparticular programs--such as education and health care. It fails to \nmake debt reduction a priority. It fails to ensure prompt action to \nprovide prescription drugs to seniors. And it fails to maintain fiscal \ndiscipline for the long term.\n  For all of these reasons, I join with the Democrats on the Budget \nCommittee in opposing this resolution.\n  When we discussed tax breaks and discussed what the standard bearer \nfor the Republican party has advocated--tax breaks that come in at over \n$500 billion the first 5 years--there was a strange silence that took \nplace over the majority of the Republicans sitting on the Republican \nside of the Budget Committee.\n  There were a couple of murmurs about: Well, we haven't given up. We \nare not going to pass that now.\n  They did that by a vote. One of our distinguished Democrats proposed \nit in a vote, and the support just wasn't there.\n  Again for these reasons, joining with the Democrats, I hope we can \nmake appropriate adjustments and amend that process for a more \nrealistic budget.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nin an effort to improve the resolution before it gets voted on in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I understand my colleagues are pressed for time and would like to \nspeak. I hope they will be recognized at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Illinois \nwants to speak. I will not interrupt as far as speaking. But I want to \nsay to Senators on our side that we would like very much for anyone who \nhas remarks on the budget to come down before we recess. Then we will \nstart. We will not take any amendments until after we come back from \nthat recess so that Democrats have a chance to talk in their caucus and \nwe have a chance to talk in our policy luncheon.\n  If you want to speak about the resolution with general statements, we \nwill be here until 12:30. Both sides are going to apply the same rules, \naccording to Senator Lautenberg. There will be no amendments until \nafter the 12:30 luncheon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Does the Senator from New Jersey yield time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do.\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I seek to be recognized for 10 minutes and \nask that my colleague from Oregon have 5 minutes, if that would be \nappropriate. We are going to a meeting. I think the Senator from \nCalifornia also is seeking recognition.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield time in accordance with the Senator's \nrequest.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Jersey if I \ncould have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It would be a pleasure to allow my colleague from \nCalifornia to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's understanding is that the Senator \nfrom Illinois is to be recognized for 10 minutes, the Senator from \nOregon is to be recognized for 5 minutes, and the Senator from \nCalifornia is to be recognized for 10 minutes on Senator Lautenberg's \ntime.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, very much.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey, who is on \nthe Budget Committee. This will be the last budget resolution he will \nmanage on the floor. He is retiring from the Senate. We will miss him. \nHe has been a leader on so many issues. I have worked with him on \nissues over the years such as gun control. He has certainly been a \nleader for his State and the Nation, and he has taken on a tough job in \nworking on the Budget Committee.\n  We all acknowledge that the chairman of the committee, Senator \nDomenici, is a man we respect very much. We may disagree on political \nissues. We find him as a colleague to be a real professional and a man \ntruly dedicated to reducing the budget deficit and keeping the fiscal \nhouse in order. We may see the world a little differently, but we have \na high respect for Senator Domenici.\n  I will miss Senator Lautenberg. He is a great friend and has been a \ngreat colleague over the years. I am happy he is here for this \nimportant and vital battle.\n  The budget resolution that we debate may be one of the toughest to \nsell to the American people because it is a dry subject. We are talking \nabout percentages--billions of dollars in appropriations, and money in \nthe outyears. Pretty soon, you are lost in the sauce trying to figure \nout what in the world these people are talking about.\n  Does this have any relevance or importance to the lives of ordinary \npeople across America? Should families even pay attention to it? If \nthey are watching on C-SPAN, they are probably clicking away now. As \nBilly Crystal said the other day, he liked the movie ``The Sixth \nSense.'' He said: I see dead people too. I see them on C-SPAN.\n\n  I think people who watch C-SPAN will understand that we are very much \nalive. They understand the issues we are debating today are very \nimportant to them.\n  Take a look at this little graphic prepared on the Democratic side. \nWe have a great ship of state, the ``U.S. Economy.''\n  Take a look at the U.S. economy over the past 8 or 9 years. You will \nsee that an amazing thing has occurred.\n  We have seen the greatest economic growth in the history of America, \nwith terrific employment, new housing, new businesses, and inflation \nunder control. We have seen our debt coming down at a time when many \npeople have given up, thinking that the national debt was just going to \nincrease.\n  These are all positive things--a stock market which was at 3,000 with \nthe Dow Jones average when President Clinton took office. It is now \nover 10,000. It may be over 11,000, I haven't checked. All of these \nthings are good news about the American economy.\n  This great ship of state sails on with the U.S. economy stronger than \nit has ever been in recorded history. This is not political hyperbole. \nThis is a fact, and America's families know it. They know we are moving \nin the right direction in this country. Above all, they want Congress \nto get out of the way. Don't stop this economy from moving forward.\n  Let me tell you that this budget resolution we are debating on the \nfloor of the Senate today is going to get in the way of that economy. \nIt is going to be an obstacle to our economic progress.\n  Look at this looming iceberg. Does this remind you of a movie? Here \nyou see the tip of the iceberg--a $168 billion Republican tax cut. But \nlook below the surface. This Republican tax scheme is much larger.\n  Why would politicians be for tax cuts? Every American family would \napplaud a tax cut. We would all like to have one. It helps you get by. \nBut if you ask what that tax cut will cost, a lot of people in America \nback off and say: Wait a minute. It doesn't make a lot of sense for us \nto be giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America and \njeopardizing the growth in our economy. You see, what the Republicans \ndo in their budget resolution is couple it with a tax cut plan over the \nnext 5 years that literally gobbles up every single dollar of surplus \nthat we have so there is no money available for us to spend on other \nthings that America knows we need.\n  Does America know we need better schools and better education? You \nbet we do. Every parent, every grandparent, and every family knows \nthat. The Republican plan shortchanges that. They take the money away \nfrom the cut. They say: No, we would rather give it as a tax cut to \nwealthy people than put it in education.\n  Let's ask another question. Would American families want to see a \nprescription drug benefit under the Medicare program for our parents \nand grandparents? You bet we would. We understand that a lot of senior \ncitizens are choosing between food and medicine. They can't afford to \nbuy the drugs to keep themselves healthy and strong, out of the \nhospital, and out of the nursing home.\n  We believe on the Democratic side--and the President agrees--that we \nshould take a part of our surplus and put it into a prescription drug \nbenefit so that the elderly and disabled across America have that peace \nof mind. Yet if you look at the Republican budget proposal, the money \nis not there for this prescription drug benefit. Instead, it is there \nfor this tax scheme that can derail the economy.\n  Not only that, you have to ask yourself whether or not we are \ndedicating the resources we need for the growth of our country for \ninvestment in infrastructure and people. That really counts.\n  This Republican tax scheme, which is the cornerstone of this budget \nresolution we are debating, is bad policy for this country. Don't take \nmy word for it. Don't take the word of any Democrat for it. Take the \nword of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. He tells \nus the No. 1 priority for the good of America and its economy is \nreducing our national debt--not a tax cut for the wealthiest people.\n  This tax cut from the Senate Republicans is a mere shadow of the tax \ncut proposed by Governor George W. Bush in his Presidential campaign. \nIt is a tax cut that, frankly, goes to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. It is worse than the one proposed by the Senate Republicans in \nthis budget resolution. This is the George W. Bush tax cut to the top 1 \npercent of wage earners in America. The George W. Bush tax cut will \nprovide a $50,000 a year tax cut. If one happens to be in the lower 60 \npercent of wage earners, the tax cut is $249 a year--20 bucks a month.\n  I gave the Senate Republicans on the Budget Committee two \nopportunities to vote for George W. Bush's tax cut in committee. They \nsay they want him for President. He says it is the most important thing \nin his campaign. One would think the Senate Republicans would rush to \nbe in his corner when it comes to standing for this tax cut. Do you \nknow what. On two different occasions they tried to avoid, and did \navoid, even having a recorded vote on their standard bearer's tax cut. \nThey don't want to be on record in favor of that tax cut. They know it \neats up all of our surplus that goes into the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  At this moment in time, the Senate Budget Republicans have denied \nGeorge W. Bush twice. I will give him another chance on the Senate \nfloor in the next few days. Will the Senate Budget Republicans deny \nGeorge W. Bush thrice? We will find out. I hope they come to their \nsenses and understand they should go on record in opposition to it.\n  America wants to spend money on things important for our future, such\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\nas education, health care, training the next generation of workers, \nmaking certain this economy keeps moving along. A lot of people have \nprospered under this economy, but a lot of working families are just \nstarting to believe things are getting better for them. They do not \nwant to derail the economic progress we have seen under the Clinton-\nGore administration. They want America to continue to move forward. \nThey want America to continue to grow. I believe that is the right \ntrack to follow.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Oregon. I hope to get another \nchance to address the budget resolution which should be defeated by the \nSenate so we can continue the economic progress we have seen in \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will pick up briefly on the point made by \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois about moving forward with an \nagenda that meets the needs of the American people.\n  When we started this budget markup, the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm, said the Senate ought to stand pat on the budget until after the \nelection. In spite of the pressing health and education concerns of the \nAmerican people, the concerns we will try to address on this floor this \nweek, Senator Gramm said we ought to stand pat; we should not take any \nsignificant steps with regard to action on many of these important \nissues in the health and education area.\n  I come to the floor this morning to say I am not prepared, and I \nthink my colleagues are not prepared, to say to the millions of older \npeople in this country and their families that we are going to stand \npat given the huge problem they are facing with their prescription drug \ncosts. I have come to the floor of the Senate more than 20 times in the \nlast few months to talk about the older people who are supposed to take \nthree pills a day and are taking only two; they are breaking up their \nanticholesterol capsules because they cannot afford the medicine. I am \nof the view this Nation can no longer afford to deny prescription drug \ncoverage to the Nation's older people.\n  In my home State, we have older people being hospitalized in order to \nget prescription drug coverage because Part A of Medicare will pick up \nthose bills and Part B, the outpatient part of the program, will not \ncover them. There has to be a sense of urgency about this important \nissue of prescription drug coverage for older people. I feel the same \nway, frankly, about education.\n  That is what we tried to do in the budget resolution. The chairman of \nthe committee made a comment earlier with which I agree completely, \nquestioning whether there could be comprehensive reform of the Medicare \nprogram this session. That is right. We ought to have comprehensive \nreform.\n  In the Budget Committee, at least as a beginning for significant \nreform, we said it is urgent to act this year. There is language that \nstipulates if the Finance Committee doesn't move on this issue by the \nfall, it is possible for any Member of the Senate to come to this floor \nand have the issue dealt with directly. We locked in the money to do \nthe job right, $40 billion, which, by the way, is tied to reform of the \nprogram. We have language that talks about using marketplace principles \nand competitive purchasing techniques. It is a chance to finally get \njustice for older people and their families.\n  Medicare started off as half a loaf. It didn't cover prescription \ndrugs in 1965. The big buyers--the health plans and HMO plans, the \nmanaged care plans--negotiate discounts. Democrats are having folks \ncome to our townhall meetings, those people who are without \nprescription drug coverage--and only about a third of the older people \ndo have good prescription drug coverage now. Those people in effect are \nsubsidizing the big buyers. They are subsidizing the people in those \nhealth plans and the managed care organizations.\n  I think it is time to bring the revolution in private sector health \ncare to the Medicare program. If we can get the anticoagulant drugs \ncovered, which we want to do on this side of the aisle, we might spend \n$1,000 a year to help an older person with medicine but we will save \n$100,000 by being able to prevent the stroke an older person might \notherwise incur.\n  We will try to convey a sense of urgency about this issue. I hope we \nwill be able to get additional colleagues from the other side of the \naisle to join. I particularly commend Senator Snowe and Senator Smith \nbecause they share our sense of urgency. They share our view we cannot \njust stand pat on this issue, as Senator Gramm talked about in the \nBudget Committee. This country has now made it clear they want the \nCongress to act on this issue, and they want Congress to act now. They \ndon't want it put off until after the election. We are going to try to \nconvey that during this week's budget debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from California has been granted \n10 minutes by unanimous consent. I ask she be extended 15 minutes \nrather than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Budget \nCommittee. I am honored to serve on that committee. Our chairman, Pete \nDomenici, is an expert on understanding the budget. Our ranking member, \nSenator Lautenberg, whom we will miss greatly when he retires, is \nlikewise an expert.\n  What is intriguing about this year's budget is that it shows the \ndifference between the two parties. Sometimes we come to the floor and \nit is hard to know the differences between the parties because the \nrhetoric may sound the same. The budget is dealing with hard dollars, \nand we are placing those hard dollars in different categories. No one \ncan run away from the fact that they do less for debt reduction, they \ndo less for prescription drugs, they do less for education, and they do \nmore to help the wealthiest in our society. The numbers are there; you \ncannot hide the numbers.\n  I say with due respect to my chairman, Pete Domenici, he doesn't want \nto do that. He wants to make the fight on the differences. And so do I.\n  The reason I have always chosen to be on the Budget Committee both in \nthe House, where I served for 10 proud years, and the Senate, where I \nam now serving for 7, is that the budget we do once a year--and, by the \nway, I think it is important to do it once a year; I don't support the \nnotion of going to budget every 2 years--is the budget that is the \nroadmap to our Nation. It is not a dry document. It may appear boring \nbecause we are putting numbers next to functions, but when we get \nbehind the numbers, what does it mean? Look at defense; we know what it \nmeans. Look at domestic discretionary; we know what it means. We know \nwhat it means for education. We know what it means for the environment.\n  By the way, I want to make a point about the environment. I am \nthoroughly distressed that for the first time in the history of the \nSenate in a budget resolution, this budget resolution calls for oil \ndrilling in a national wildlife refuge. Never before in a budget \nresolution have we done that. And not only are we calling for drilling \nin this preserve, we are putting the receipts for this drilling in this \nbudget, over $1 billion of receipts.\n\n  I am proud to say we are going to have a bipartisan amendment to \ndelete that reference to drilling in Alaska, the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. It is called ANWR. Those who do not care about the \nenvironment are using the gas prices as an excuse to open this area up \nwhile they are turning away from energy efficiency, turning away from \nthe fact that, as we speak, we are exporting Alaskan oil that belongs \nto the American people. We are exporting it to Asia instead of keeping \nit here--68,000 barrels a day. And they are turning their heads to the \nfact we are allowing huge mergers to take place in the oil industry, \nwhich is, in fact, manipulating the supply.\n  What do they want to do? Open up the wildlife refuge in Alaska. I ask \nyou a commonsense question. You have a wildlife refuge. How is that \nconsistent with drilling oil? We have seen the oilspills. We know the \ndevastation that can be wreaked. The bottom line is, I am very \ndistressed that this budget is clearly a document that is \nantienvironment, and the American people support the environment.\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n  I want to ask a commonsense question. If you are living in a time of \nthe greatest economic recovery in the history of the United States of \nAmerica, and you know what policies led to that--fiscal responsibility, \ntargeted tax cuts to those who need it and not to those who do not need \nit, investments in education, investments in the environment, \nprotecting Medicare and Social Security--why would you not continue \nthose policies?\n  I am going to show you some charts that indicate we have had the \ngreatest economic recovery in generations and generations and \ngenerations. Why would you turn away? Why would George W. Bush have \npolicies that turn away from this success? Why would the Republicans in \nthe Senate have policies that turn away from this success and would \ntake us back to dangerous times? To me, it makes no sense at all. It is \ncommon sense that if something is working in a business and you are \ndoing great because of the policies you put into place, you don't turn \naway from those policies. You continue those policies. This budget \nleads us away from those policies.\n  Let me talk about this return to fiscal strength. In 1992, we had a \nrecord deficit of $290 billion and we have a surplus of $179 billion in \n2000. In the last 2 years, we paid down the debt for the first time \ninstead of racking up huge debt. This has sparked the longest economic \nexpansion in the history of the country, 108 consecutive months, and \ncounting, of economic growth; 20.8 million new jobs; the lowest \nunemployment rate in 30 years--4.1 percent versus 7.5 percent that \nprevailed in 1992--and record American home ownership of 67 percent.\n  Those are the facts. Those are not made-up numbers. Why would we turn \naway from those policies? That is what the Republican budget does; it \nmakes a U-turn on those policies, following the leadership of George \nBush.\n  Let me show you these charts. Here you see the budget deficit was \n$290 billion. We now have a surplus of $179 billion. What was the \nprojection in 1992, before the Clinton-Gore team came in? It was $455 \nbillion worth of deficits. That was the projection; instead, there is a \n$179 billion surplus.\n  We have paid down $140 billion of the debt in the last 2 years. Here \nis where we see that. Instead of $761 billion of projected debt \nincreases for 1998-1999, we actually are paying down the debt.\n  This chart is titled ``Fiscal Discipline Sparks Robust Private Sector \nInvestment.'' In other words, when you do not have to pay so much \ninterest on the debt, there is money around for the private sector to \ninvest. Look what happened just in equipment and software investment. \nThe investment is up 12.1 percent. The unemployment rate, I told you \nbefore, declined from 7.5 percent to 4.1 percent. Some people consider \nthis full employment.\n  Another way to look at the jobs, 20.8 million new jobs--this is a \nbeautiful number here, charted straight up since 1992. Record home \nownership, up from 64 percent to 67 percent. The American dream is \nbeing realized; 67 percent of Americans own their own home.\n  We have rising incomes for all groups. In every single group, we have \nseen rising incomes. These are the quintiles: 10 percent in the first, \nor lowest-income people; increase, 11 percent in the second quintile; \n10 percent in the third; 10 in the fourth; and 12 in the higher \nincomes. All the talk about, oh, we are taxing the people in the upper \nincomes; they are getting killed--they have had the largest increase in \ntheir income, 12 percent.\n  The Federal income tax burden has declined. It has declined for the \naverage family of four. ``Federal Tax Level Falls For Most,'' this is \nan article from the Washington Post. We are paying less income taxes \nthan we did before.\n  This record economic expansion presents a historic opportunity, and I \nthink the Democratic budget, the alternative we have to vote on, seizes \nthis opportunity. It meets the fiscal challenges ahead because we \ncannot take this for granted. We know that. We need to strengthen \nSocial Security. As somebody said: When the Sun is shining, you fix the \nroof. You don't wait for the rain to fall.\n  That is what our Democratic budget does. It strengthens Social \nSecurity and Medicare. It sets up a lockbox, not only for Social \nSecurity but for Medicare. Let the record show, when Senator Conrad \noffered a lockbox for Medicare, the Republicans voted in lockstep \nagainst it. They are not protecting Medicare.\n  We place a top priority on adding a prescription drug benefit. We pay \ndown the national debt. We use honest budget numbers. And we expand \nopportunity by investing in education and other priorities to help \npeople realize the American dream. In my opinion, the Republicans \nsquander this opportunity with an irresponsible tax cut. As Senator \nDurbin has said, it is targeted to the wealthiest; it is going to risk \nSocial Security and Medicare; it is going to make it impossible to do a \nprescription drug benefit; and it is going to make it impossible to \ninvest in education and the environment and the kinds of things the \nAmerican people want.\n  Why do I say this? Because the Senate Republicans take the nondefense \ndiscretionary money--in other words, the money we can spend on \neducation, the environment, Medicare, and the rest--and they actually \ncut it below a freeze. This is not me talking; this is the \nCongressional Budget Office. They say a freeze is $296.1 billion; the \nSenate Republicans come in at $289 billion.\n  That is unrealistic, and it is not what the American people want. \nThey do not want a risky tax cut. They want a targeted tax cut to the \nmiddle class, leaving enough money to invest in their priorities. This \nis the hub and the nub of the problem.\n  The Republican budget cuts domestic priorities--$89 billion to $117 \nbillion of domestic cuts between 2001 and 2005.\n  What does this mean? Let's talk turkey about what this means.\n  Education: It will prevent the hiring of 20,000 new teachers to lower \nclass sizes.\n  Head Start: 62,000 fewer children served.\n  Basic research: 19,000 fewer researchers receiving support.\n  Environment: Funding eliminated for all 15 new federally led \ncleanups.\n  Law enforcement cuts: No funds for hiring additional police officers.\n  The Republicans have admitted it. They said: We will take these tax \ncuts one salami slice at a time. That is what Senator Lott has said; he \nhas admitted it. And he shows the different salami-sliced tax cuts:\n  $182 billion for the marriage penalty tax. We know we need to fix \nthat problem. It does not take $182 billion to do it. We can do it for \nless;\n  $122 billion in small business tax breaks. We can do it for less;\n  $21 billion tax breaks contained in the education savings account \nthat go to the wealthiest among us.\n  It goes on and on. They are doing it one salami slice at a time, and \nit adds up to one big salami which is going to put us back in the red. \nIt is going to use the entire non-Social Security surplus and maybe \neven dip into the surplus.\n  Senator Durbin showed my colleagues the Bush tax cut. I want to ask \none question: Is it fair to give a $50,000 a year tax cut to people \nearning over $300,000 a year? It is unbelievable. People work for the \nminimum wage. They make $11,000 a year. The wealthiest will get $50,000 \na year.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This Bush tax cut is not fair. This is not fair. It \njeopardizes our economic recovery. Do my colleagues know what people \nwho are in the bottom 60 percent with incomes below $39,000 get? They \nget back $249 a year. If one earns over $300,000, they get back over \n$50,000 a year. It makes no sense. Why not give the tax breaks to the \npeople who need it, not the people who do not need it. Their tax burden \nis not overly high. They are doing very well, thank you very much.\n  Some of the wealthiest people in America live in California in the \nhigh-tech sector. Do my colleagues know what they tell me. They say: \nSenator Boxer, don't do this. I don't need the money. I am making \nmillions of dollars. I don't need a risky tax break that is going to \njeopardize this economic recovery.\n  It makes no sense.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be delighted.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator read the newspaper articles a week ago \nSunday\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\nthat started in the Post and ran all over the country about the Federal \nincome tax burden on the American people being the lowest in the last \n40 years in some categories and in other categories in 50 years?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, and I have referred to them in these remarks. It was \na tremendous series that essentially showed the average families paying \nless of a burden in Federal income taxes. It makes no sense at all to \ngive back $50,000 to the people earning over $300,000 and set at risk \nthis amazing economic recovery. The American people want debt \nreduction, and that is what our Democratic alternative offers.\n  I say to my friend, doesn't he think that is the wise thing to do--\ndebt reduction and sensible investments in education, the environment, \nand other priorities, and targeted tax cuts to the middle class?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, a reduction in the \nnational debt, which is over $5 trillion, by paying less in the way of \ninterest on the debt every year would be a tax reduction for everybody; \nis that not true?\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is absolutely no question. I know my friend knows \nthis, but I want to quote to him Chairman Alan Greenspan, a Republican, \nwho said:\n\n       Saving the surpluses is . . . in my judgment, the most \n     important fiscal measure we can take at this time to foster \n     continued improvements in productivity.\n\n  He says basically pay down the debt, and the Republicans are blinded \non that point. They have a Presidential candidate who has made a bad \ndecision. He will not back off from it. The people are going to \nunderstand that it is going to put our economic recovery at risk. We \nhave to save Social Security. We have to save Medicare. We need a \nprescription drug benefit for our senior citizens, and we need to be \nwise and continue this economic recovery.\n  In conclusion, I hope the Democratic budget proposal will win the \nday. Having said that, I am a realist, and I know we are going to see a \nparty-line vote for this Republican budget. I will say unequivocally, \nthe Democratic plan reduces the debt; it makes investments in Medicare, \nthe environment, and education. I hope we will not turn our backs on \nthis economic recovery. The American people want it to continue.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my chairman for allowing me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, somehow, I guess because the President \nis pretty good at coming up with words, we hear that what we are \nattempting to do is risky. That is a nice word, ``risky.'' I submit \nthat if the American people knew how much the President was increasing \ndomestic spending for next year's budget, they would say: Mr. \nPresident, that's too risky.\n  A 14-percent increase in the domestic programs of this country is \nwhat the President has in his budget this year. I want to talk about \nwhat that really means.\n  Either that is a one-time event and the President does not think we \nhave to do it again in the next year, the year after, or the year \nafter--just one time; it happens that one time in an election year--\nright now--if you think it is just an election year number, you ought \nto discard it and decide what you really need. That is what we tried to \ndo. We think it is a political budget.\n  Let me flip the coin and say why I am entitled to believe it is a 1-\nyear budget phenomenon in a political year. I think I have to say \nperhaps it is not. Perhaps it is what Democrats think we ought to \nspend--a 14-percent increase.\n  I have a chart that shows what will happen to the surplus and the \nSocial Security surplus if we increase domestic discretionary spending \n14 percent a year for 3 years. We will start to use up the entire \nsurplus, and we will begin to use the Social Security surplus. That is \nhow important it is that we keep spending under control.\n  With a 14-percent increase in discretionary domestic spending--that \nis the 13 bills we do each year, less the defense bill--this chart \nshows the on-budget surplus spent and the money raided from Social \nSecurity in the gray and yellow.\n  Just look at the chart. The total surplus is shown by the red line. \nLook at what begins to happen to the surplus as we increase this budget \n14 percent a year just on the discretionary domestic accounts. By the \nyear 2003, it gets very close to our starting to use the Social \nSecurity surplus, and by 2004 we are. Clearly, by 2005, we will have \nused the Social Security surplus. We will have begun to use all of the \nsurplus because of the 14-percent increase.\n  Frankly, I think that sort of tells the tale. Obviously, I do not \nbelieve that is going to happen. The 14-percent increase is \nunparalleled, other than in 1 year under President Jimmy Carter. I do \nnot think, even at the President's behest, we are going to do anything \nlike that.\n  But I have two other points I would like to make. One, my good \nfriend, Senator Lautenberg, and the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, keep referring to how much we are going to reduce Federal \nexpenditures. They keep using the word ``real.'' Everybody who is in \nearshot of this floor debate should understand that the word ``real'' \nhas a technical meaning Republicans have decided we will not use.\n  If you want to look at what is spent by our Federal Government every \nyear in the appropriations accounts and you want to say it is entitled \nto ``real growth,'' that means every single solitary account of the \nFederal Government grows each year by the rate of inflation.\n  I do not think the average American assumes that if you do not let it \ngrow at the rate of inflation every year, you are cutting things. Many \npeople live with a frozen budget; they do not have any more the next \nyear than they do this year.\n  We start with the assumption that everything is frozen, and then we \ndecide what to add back. We have done that for a few years because it \nis a huge increase in Federal expenditures when you assume every \naccount in Government will go up by the rate of inflation every year. \nWe call that a nonincrease. We call that a neutral budget. We call that \na budget that does not spend any new money. Everybody knows it spends \nnew money over the previous years to the extent that you add inflation \nto every single account, bar none. Frankly, everyone knows you do not \nhave to increase every account in this Federal Government by the \ninflation rate of every year.\n\n  So what do we do? We start with: Let's freeze it and see how much we \nhave left over. To my amazement, and contrary to the numbers that have \nbeen talked about here on the floor by the other side, if you do that \nand say to Americans, we are going to start at zero and we are going to \nadd back, we have a surplus of $400 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Of that, we are going to spend $230 billion. In other words, our \nbudget, in the next year and the succeeding years, adds $230 billion to \na base of about $570 billion. We have a $400 billion surplus. We are \ngoing to spend $230 billion. We are going to say: If Congress can, and \nthe President will, we will have tax relief of $150 billion. We will \nhave debt reduction of an additional $20 billion. Essentially, that is \na pretty fair allocation of our resources. If, in fact, we do not get \nthe tax reductions, every bit of it will go on the surplus.\n  There is no difference between the Democrat budget they will propose \nand ours on debt reduction. We are both about $1 trillion over the next \n5 years. But our budget, the one for which we ask the Members to vote, \nhas $174 billion in debt reduction--$174 billion in the first year, $1 \ntrillion over the 5 years.\n  Let's get back to the tax relief. Mr. President, $150 billion over 5 \nyears; $13 billion in the first year. The ratio in the first year of \ntax relief to deficit reduction is $13 of debt reduction to $1 in tax \nrelief.\n  How much is enough?\n  Should the ratio be $50 to $1? Should it be $40 to $1? It is $13 to \n$1 in the first year. Over the 5 years, it is $8 in deficit reduction \nfor $1 of tax relief. I think that is pretty good.\n  I repeat, if we start with a freeze and add back, rather than \nstarting with the budget that adds back inflation to everything and \ncalls anything we reduce from that a cut, we will be spending $230 \nbillion over those 5 years, increasing our national defense spending \nand our domestic discretionary spending.\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\n  If we just averaged them per year and took 5 into $230 billion, what \nwould that be? Five into $200 billion would be $40 billion a year. \nAbout $46 billion to $50 billion each year in new spending is available \nunder this budget resolution. If we start with the premise that \neverything is at zero, and we add it back, we are going to add $230 \nbillion over 5 years, which is somewhere between $45 billion and $50 \nbillion a year.\n  How much is enough?\n  I believe what we have just described is plenty. We can improve and \nenhance the accounts in our Government, such as education, military, \nNational Institutes of Health, things we all know should go up \nsubstantially, but we do not have to increase every single program in \nGovernment.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, if we only had the gusto and \nenthusiasm to reform the discretionary accounts, we have a litany of \nthings the Government Accounting Office says are duplication of effort. \nThere are 342 different programs spread in five Departments for \neconomic development. These things can be put together in a way that we \nwill spend less, save the taxpayers dollars, and, yes, provide them \nwith some tax relief in areas such as the marriage penalty, affordable \neducation, patients' rights, and a small business package. If you add \nthose up, nobody thinks those are the wrong things to do. Everybody \nthinks they are on the right track. We make room for the Finance \nCommittee here and the Ways and Means Committee in the House to do it.\n  I will comment just for a moment on Medicare. In this budget \nresolution, we have $40 billion for Medicare reform and prescription \ndrugs. The President wants to make a political issue out of Medicare. I \nthink with this budget resolution he is finished. The President cut \nMedicare by knocking down the providers. Then the net amount he \nprovided for Medicare prescription benefits and reform was $15 billion.\n  Nonetheless, we will hear them say we are not doing enough. I am sure \nthey will find a way to say we are not doing enough. This budget \nresolution has $40 billion. It was provided by an amendment by Senator \nSnowe of Maine and Senator Wyden, who cosponsored it, and Senator Smith \nof Oregon was a principal proponent, and it was accepted by the \ncommittee. There were no negative votes.\n  Incidentally, just as an aside, while to me it doesn't make that much \ndifference, the Democrat members of the Budget Committee offered a \ntotal substitute, and their Medicare additions were less than what is \nin the Republican budget resolution, so I don't know that they have any \nroom to complain. They had $35 billion in theirs; we had $40 billion. \nSo I think we are within the parameters of getting something done that \nis bipartisan. I hope it is led by reform and efficiency. We should not \nadd big benefits to a program that is going to run out of money until \nwe get some reform.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I compliment the Senator on the time and \neffort he has devoted on probably the most difficult subject and \nworking out some of these problems.\n  I have an amendment I wish to offer. I understand it is not going to \nbe appropriate until later on. I want to tell you what it is. It is a \nsense of the Senate on fully funding impact aid. I notice that S. Con. \nRes. 101 does address this. It says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that levels in this \n     resolution assume that impact aid programs strive to reach \n     the goal that all local education agencies eligible for \n     impact aid receive a minimum of 40 percent.\n\n  Now my concern would be this. In the State of Oklahoma, overall, we \nare at about 36 percent now. However, we have some well below that and \nsome above that. In this sense of the Senate, would it be assumed that \nthose below 40 percent would be raised to 40 percent but not that those \nwho are above it would be reduced to 40 percent, or some level lower \nthan they are currently?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, later today, I will introduce an amendment \nto the budget resolution concerning impact aid. It is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution and is very straight forward, it simply recognizes \nthe importance of impact aid and states that it should be fully funded. \nNow, I realize that there are too few dollars chasing many worthy \nprograms, but impact aid is a promise, that we, the federal government, \nhave made to the states. I believe we should live up to our obligation \nand fully fund this program.\n  For those colleagues who are unfamiliar with impact aid, allow me to \nbriefly describe the program. It is one of the oldest federal education \nprograms, dating from the 1950's, and is meant to compensate local \nschool districts for the ``substantial and continuing financial \nburden'' resulting from federal activities. These activities include \nfederal ownership of certain lands as well as the enrollment in local \nschool districts of children of parents who work and/or live on federal \nland. The rationale for compensation is that federal government \nactivities deprive the local school district of the ability to collect \nproperty or sales taxes from these individuals (for example, members of \nthe Armed Forces living on military bases, or Native American families \nliving on reservations) even though the school district is obligated to \nprovide free public education to their children. Thus, impact aid is \ndesigned to compensate the school district for the loss of tax revenue.\n  If the program is fully funded, the formula used to determine a local \nschool district payment is fairly straight forward. Each child is \nassigned a weight based on the type of ``federal activity'' the family \nis involved in. For example:\n\nIndian Children on reservations...................................  1.25\nMilitary children on post.........................................  1.0\nMilitary children off post........................................  0.1\nCivilian children on reservation..................................  1.0\nCivilian children off reservation.................................  0.05\nLow rent housing..................................................  0.1\n \n\nNext, the weighted student count is multiplied by a cost factor which \nreflects the greater of one-half of the state average per-pupil \nexpenditure or one-half of the national average per-pupil expenditure. \nThe local school district provides this information to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education who in turn writes a check to compensate the \ndistrict for the loss of revenue.\n  In my state of Oklahoma, if the Impact Aid Program was fully funded, \nwe would have received $63 million in fiscal year 2000 as opposed to \n$23 million we received. That is a difference of 63 percent. This chart \nshows what each state would have received in fiscal year 2000 if the \nprogram had been fully funded versus what they receive through the \nformula. As you can see all states do better with full funding and 35 \nstates would have their payment increase by 50 percent or better.\n  I would be remiss, if I did not acknowledge that the appropriators \nhave worked very hard to increase funding for impact aid. In fact, in \neach year since fiscal year 1995, there has been an increase in impact \naid.\n  However, I believe we need to realize how not fully funding this \nprogram hurts local school districts. When this program is not fully \nfunded, the federal shortfall has to be made up with local dollars \nwhich means that projects that would have been undertaken have to be \npostponed. My staff has done a little research into what type of \nspending is postponed. What they found is very telling of the type of \npressure the federal government is putting on our schools because we \nfail to fulfill our obligation to them. For instance, the consequences \nof not fully funding impact aid means schools cannot afford to:\n  Buy handicapped accessible buses; buy classroom computers; buy \ncomputer upgrades; buy textbook replacements/updates; hire teachers to \nlower pupil teacher ratio; hire necessary staff for Special Education \nprograms; hire necessary staff for Gifted and Talented programs; \nprovide professional development for staff; provide adequate building \nsecurity; provide for remedial instructional needs; or do basic \nbuilding maintenance.\n  Full funding of impact aid means that local dollars that are now \nbeing used to offset lack of federal dollars can be used to take care \nof the above mentioned needs. For the school district it is like \ngetting two dollars for every one dollar because it frees up their \ndollars to purchase buses, do building maintenance or hire additional \nstaff to lower pupil/teacher ratios.\n  Mr. President, full funding of impact aid is not a luxury, it is a \nnecessity. Our schools are in a funding crisis that\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\nthe federal government has created because we have failed to fulfill \nour commitment to them. We must compensate them for lost revenue \nbecause of federal activity in their area that prevents them from \ncollecting sufficient property and sales taxes. This is not a handout; \nit is an obligation by the federal government to make school districts \nwhole. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join me in \nasking the appropriators to fully fund impact aid for fiscal year 2001.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might put the importance of Senator \nInhofe's amendment into perspective relative to the President's budget. \nHe proposed to cut impact aid $136 million. We rejected that in our \nbudget resolution, and the Senator, I assume, is on the floor \nsupporting what we did and wanting a clarification.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. If the Senator will yield further, I do support what \nthe chairman is doing. I would like to do more. Impact aid is a \npromise; it is an obligation. We have taken things away from the tax \nbase that preclude States from financially supporting their schools, \nand it happens that between our military installations and our Indian \npopulation and some of the unique ways we handle it in the State of \nOklahoma, we are impacted greatly by this program.\n  So I appreciate the fact that the Senator has made an effort to stop \nthe President in his budget from reducing impact aid, but I would like \nto do a little more if I could.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to insert in the Record--because \nwe speak of the President's budget and Medicare and, frankly, the \nPresident talks about how much he wants to spend for prescription \ndrugs. But hidden in the budget are cuts in the program that he assumes \nwill go toward prescription drugs and reform.\n  I just want everyone to know I don't believe a bipartisan committee \nin the Senate, or the House, would approve of the President's cuts in \nthis health care program. Hospital cuts in the cycle of this budget for \n5 years are $6.8 billion; $2.1 billion is reduced in terms of what is \ngoing to be allowable from cancer treatment clinics and other \noutpatient clinics providing certain kinds of drug treatments that are \nalready covered by Medicare, and a $3.7 billion reduction from the \nMedicare Choice health plans, including plans in low-cost States, such \nas Oregon, New Mexico, and Minnesota.\n  Frankly, I don't think we are going to do that. So when we put our \nbudget together, we rejected that and added $40 billion in two \ninstallments, which was the Snowe-Wyden amendment, and I add Senator \nSmith from Oregon as the prime sponsors. I will submit those reductions \nfor the Record. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     THE CLINTON-GORE MEDICARE PLAN\n                 [CBO Estimates, in billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               2001    2001-05   2001-10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHospital Cuts...............................    -0.4      -6.8     -21.8\nCancer Drugs and Other Drug Cuts............    -0.2      -1.0      -2.1\nMecicare+Choice Health Plans................     0.0      -3.7     -14.5\nFFS Selective Contracting, Etc..............     0.0      -1.6      -6.0\nOther Provider Cuts.........................    -0.3      -2.9      -8.3\n                                             ---------------------------\n    Total Provider Cuts.....................    -0.9     -16.0     -52.7\nBeneficiary Cost-Sharing....................     0.0      -0.1      -2.2\nMedicare Buy-In Proposals...................     0.0      -0.1       0.2\nCompetitive Defined Benefit.................     0.0      -2.1     -13.7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I once again say if any Senators would \nlike to be heard prior to our 12:30 luncheon, I am here to yield time \nto them. We won't have amendments until after our respective policy and \ncaucus lunches. Since nobody is here, I will make a couple of \nobservations about the American economy.\n  There are some things about the American economy we continue to call \nphenomenal. We continue to look at the American production machine, \nwhich is a sum total of all the efforts of American workers, American \nbusiness, American investment. Our gross domestic product, the sum \ntotal we have available, is growing and growing. It has reached a very \nhigh level of about $9 trillion.\n  The world looks at us and wonders how in the world are we doing this. \nWe don't have very much inflation. We have the highest level of \nemployment we have had in decades. We have annual growth that is still \nshocking the economists who were quite sure we could not sustain the \nkind of growth we have. We have Europe looking at us and saying maybe \nwe had better get over there and invest, start buying into their \ncompanies. We have a country we all were frightened of named Japan. \nMany people used to come to the floor and say, ``Why don't we follow \nJapan and have a planned economy?'' I am very glad nobody chose to do \nthat in America. And look at what happened to the respective \ncompetitiveness and growth and prosperity of the two nations. I wish \nthem the best, obviously, but we are doing rather well.\n  I suggest there are three or four things that make this work. I think \nwe should look at them very carefully because what is going on in the \nother capitalist countries and democracies in the world is very \ndifferent. We have been committed to the proposition that America \nprospers on low taxes. Now I understand that most of us think the \npercent of the gross domestic product that goes to taxes is too high. \nThere is no question that the percent of our gross domestic product \nthat goes to Federal taxes is the highest it has been since the Second \nWorld War. But, in essence, when you compare America's taxing of itself \nand its activities and its people and its workers, we are a low-tax \nnation.\n  I believe if we do not continue to keep it a low-tax nation but, \nrather, succumb to a high-tax status such as those competitors we have \nin the world, we are going to end up being exactly like them. A high-\ntax country, such as Germany, lives with 10, 11 percent unemployment \nbecause they have imposed on all their employers to pay for the welfare \nbenefits of their nation. Yet, on top of them, they have to keep very \nlarge taxes. They wonder why it doesn't work. We sit over here saying, \nthank God we are not taxing like them. We haven't yet decided to impose \non our businesses, beyond what they ought to be sustaining on their \nshoulders so they can invest and grow.\n  Secondly, while we declare regulations, I think the time will come--\nperhaps with a new President--when we will look carefully at the \noverregulation in certain areas of the economy, including whether \nenvironmental laws are reasonable or unreasonable in many areas, to \ncompare with those competing with us. We don't have regulations that \nstymie small business and stymie growth.\n  It is almost impossible for small business to grow in Europe as it \ndoes in America because right off the bat their rules and regulations \nmake it practically impossible. We are very fortunate. We have less \nregulation. We need to have less of a burden of regulation if we want \nto continue to prosper and grow.\n  Last theory: Innovation and high productivity are now natural parts \nof the American economy. We are not sure how all that happened. I \nbelieve we are underestimating productivity growth because I don't \nthink we quite know how to do it in a service-oriented economy built on \ncomputers and modern technology. But I believe that because of \ninnovation, improving technology, and lowering of prices for technology \nthat productivity is growing at a very high rate. It is higher than we \nare estimating it.\n  When you add low taxes and less regulations than our competitors \nhave, urging that we do better in both, that we stick to these lower \ntaxes by putting in a tax reduction in this bill, tax relief that will \nkeep us on that path, and waiting for somebody to occupy the Presidency \nthat will reform our regulatory system and continue not to stymie \nemployers with reference to their workforce, mobility, and so forth, we \nare going to have great sustained growth for a long time.\n  I don't choose to lay the credit on who did it, but it is clear that \na lot of people are responsible. Congress has done a whale of a job in \nthe last 7 or 8 years in reducing entitlement spending and reducing \noverall expenditures of Government. It is something of which we can be \nvery proud.\n  In addition, we entered into a bipartisan agreement that balanced the \nbudget, that had a very significant effect on lowering the cost of \nGovernment over that period of time. We should stick to that and not go \nwith something such as the President is asking for, to increase \ndomestic discretionary spending by 14 percent, a risky proposition, I \nwould call it, in light of\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\nthe prosperity and how we are going to get it.\n  What else is new? I have to say the most significant new dynamic is \nthe commitment on the part of the Congress and the President not to \nspend the Social Security trust fund.\n  I am very proud I was among the first to challenge the President by \nsaying his idea of saving 62 percent of it was inadequate; let's save \n100. I am very proud that I came up with the ``lockbox'' idea of \nlocking away the Social Security trust funds.\n  This is the new dynamic I believe over the long run will keep America \nprosperous because it will continue to pay down the national debt way \nbeyond what anybody ever thought we could. As a matter of fact, if we \nstay on that path, sometime into the second decade of this century we \nwill totally get rid of the national debt. Most of that is because of \nthe lockbox. Most of that is because of the new dynamic that says don't \nspend Social Security trust funds.\n  We are very proud of that. We are glad it is hugely bipartisan now. \nWe take great credit in getting that started and challenging the \nPresident, who, for the first time this year, submitted a budget that \ndoes not use any of the Social Security money for general government \nand, I say to my friend, Senator Grassley, the first budget of the \nPresident that recognizes the principle that we will not touch Social \nSecurity surpluses and locks it up. We still need a vote on a lockbox \nbecause that requires 60 votes to breach that line to not use any of \nthe money from Social Security for Government.\n\n  When you add all of this up, I believe it is easy to say to Americans \nthat we want to spend more. We want to give you more. The Government \nshould be spending more than the Republicans have in this budget \nresolution. But I believe we are on the right track.\n  I think when we put every penny of Social Security money into the \ntrust fund, and then add about $7 billion or $8 billion out of the non-\nSocial Security surplus, we are being cautious. We are saying we are \nnot going to spend that non-Social Security surplus. We are going to \nalso put it into the debt.\n  In closing, the next President has a big job--I hope it comes from \nour party--because I believe he will find a Government loaded with \nduplication, loaded with programs that are 30 years old and are not the \nprograms of today, and he will have to find a way to put many of those \ninto a place they should have been for a while; that is, totally \nremoved from the budget of the United States. We will have some real \npriorities that we have been discussing in our budget resolution \ntalking about where the American people would like to spend more money. \nIt is not on the myriad thousands of Federal programs, many of which \nshould not be around.\n  With that, if anybody would like to speak, I will yield to them.\n  Again, at 12:30 we are going to our caucuses. We will be ready for \namendments at 2:15.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from Iowa needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address the issue of the \nagriculture function in this budget.\n  I thank Senator Domenici, chairman of the committee, for the \nforesight that is represented in this budget, in two respects.\n  No. 1, for the foresight of including money in the budget for the \nproposed Federal Crop Insurance Program that already passed the Senate. \nLast year it passed the House. Hopefully, very shortly it will be sent \nto the President for his signature so that by the year 2001 the farmers \nof America will be able to manage their risks to a greater extent and \nbe less dependent upon the political whims of Washington, which \nsometimes is the case, and whether or not there is a natural disaster. \nWill Congress pass the disaster aid? That is passed to help family \nfarmers, not only when you have a drought but also when we have floods, \nhurricanes, and earthquakes. When there is a natural disaster, money is \nappropriated to help people in need at that particular time.\n  Last year, Senator Conrad of North Dakota and I were able to have \nmoney included in the bill anticipating the availability of funds in \ncase Congress passed crop insurance reform. The House got the job done \nlast year. The Senate did not get it done until this year. We are \nbuilding upon that $6 billion which was put in last year's budget with \nmoney through the year 2005 for the continuation of that program.\n  I thank Senator Domenici and members of the budget committee for the \nforesight of encouraging risk management by the American family farmer \nrather than relying upon the political whims of Congress. Sometimes the \nfamily farmers find themselves in that position when there is not \nadequate crop insurance protection. This is where the individual family \nfarmer makes a decision to participate.\n  By having a better Crop Insurance Program, we hope we will not only \nencourage participation by a number of farmers but also encourage their \nparticipation at a higher level of protection than ever before.\n  We think this budget and the program that passed the Senate give \nencouragement to farmers. We are trying to give one more additional \ntool to the farmers. That should have passed in 1996, the last time the \nfarm bill was passed. It was a tool that was supposed to be given to \nfarmers at that time but it was not.\n\n  So at this late stage with this budget, finally we are fulfilling one \nmore promise of the Congress in the 1996 farm bill to give farmers \ncontinuity through a longer farm program, rather than the usual 3- to \n4-year farm program, and tools to manage their own decisions rather \nthan waiting upon bureaucrats in Washington, DC, to make those \ndecisions as to what the farmer can plant and how much of each \ncommodity can be planted in order to qualify for the farm program.\n  Beyond that, this budget also includes $5.5 billion of additional \npayments for the year 2002 and beyond so we can help keep the promise \nto the farmers that Congress made in the 1996 farm bill that there \nwould be a sound safety net for the farmers throughout the life of the \n1996 farm bill.\n  In 1996, we projected it would cost $43 billion for the crop-years \nthroughout the 7-year farm bill. We anticipated then a certain amount \nfor the year 2002 as we did in 1999 and 1998. Because of the lowest \ncrop prices in 25 years, what we projected in 1996 to be that safety \nnet for farmers was not adequate. So in 1998 there was additional money \ninjected late in the budget year and also at the end of the crop-year. \nIn the year 1999, there was an additional amount of money at the end of \nthe budget year and at the end of the crop-year.\n  Congress was expressing its commitment to the family farmer to keep a \nsafety net and income support for farmers when there were things in the \nprice scheme for grains beyond the control of the individual farmer. \nThat dates strictly back to the Southeast Asia crisis when exports took \na downturn and to the unpredictability of four very good crop-years, \nbringing the lowest level of income for farmers for 1998 and 1999 for \ngrains, and in some cases livestock that was the lowest in 25 years. \nCongress then put in additional money in 1998 and 1999.\n  This budget is somewhat different. This particular budget--again I \nsay this to compliment the Senator from New Mexico for his foresight--\nincludes $5.5 billion because we expect the same low prices for the \n2002 crop-year as we expected in 1998 and 1999. It might turn out \notherwise. From everything we know now, that tends to be the situation. \nThe compliment is not only for the $5.5 billion in this budget; it is \nfor the foresight that is represented by having it figured in ahead of \ntime--not at the end of the crop-year, not at the end of the budget \nyear but at the beginning of the budget year and about the time that \nfarmers are getting their loans lined up for this crop-year and about \nthe time they are planting this crop-year so the farmers go into this \ncrop-year with more certainty than they had in 1998 and 1999. The \nCongress would keep its commitment to make sure there was a smooth \ntransition and that there was a sound safety net for farmers as \npromised in the 1996 farm bill.\n  Everyone knows the simple commonsense answer to prosperity in \nagriculture is the ability to export. The only way there is going to be \nprofitability in farming is through the ability to export. When you are \na farmer in the Midwest and you produce more\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nthan one-third for domestic production, you know that the only way \nthere will be money made, the only way there will be higher prices is \nif there is a worldwide demand and you are able to export.\n  We talk about a safety net and about appropriating $5.5 billion that \nwas not anticipated when the 1996 farm bill was passed. I say that in \nthe vein of helping farmers keep things together. It is not \nprofitability in farming. When it comes to income of farmers, common \nsense dictates two sources of that income: One, public money coming \nthrough the farm program but not guaranteeing profitability or, two, \nfrom the private sector, which basically means the ability to export \nand to have those export markets and having our Government do what it \ncan to promote our exports so we find foreign markets. That is where \nthe profitability lies. That is where the American farmers want to \nreceive their income--from the private sector and not from the public \ntreasury.\n  However, we cannot always anticipate four good crop-years in a row to \nbring about an abundance of production and a downturn in prices. We \ncannot anticipate the Southeast Asia crisis or other things that tend \nto bring about a downturn. The Southeast Asia financial crisis brought \na downturn in exports. That is why we have the 1996 farm bill. That is \nwhy we have the safety net we promised. That is why in this budget we \nare supplementing that by $5.5 billion.\n  For the taxpayers who are listening and wondering why they would be \nhelping the family farmer, that there ought to not be more control by \nthe individual family farm manager--that is the farmer himself, in his \nproductivity and his ability to export--I think I have answered that \nquestion to some extent. Whether you have a drought or whether you have \na massive amount of rain that will produce in overabundance, the farmer \nis not in control. When governments in Southeast Asia made bad \njudgments as to their banking industry and we had the Southeast Asia \nfinancial crisis and the economies in a downturn over there and we did \nnot export to them, those were all things beyond the control of the \nindividual family farmer--hence, a safety net for the family farmer and \nconsequently some costs to the taxpayers.\n  What does a person in the city or the general taxpayer get out of \nthis contract we have with the family farmers of America, this social \ncontract? They surely get an abundance of food so when they go to the \nsupermarket they don't have to worry about whether there is enough \nfood. That is not true a lot of places outside the United States, \nplaces with malnutrition, where there are droughts and where they live \nfrom hand to mouth for a daily supply of food.\n  It used to be that in the Soviet system of agriculture, and of their \ncommand and control economy, consumers in Russia did not find their \nsupermarket shelves stocked as well as they were in the United States \nof America.\n  For the consumers who think they are paying too much for their food, \nI suggest that as a percentage of their disposable income they are \nspending less on food than any consumer in any country in the \nworld. Consequently, we do have this social contract between the people \nof this country and the family farmers of America to maintain a safety \nnet so there is a stability that maintains the institution of the \nfamily farm. The institution of the family farm is that entity that \nguarantees to the consumer of America this supply of food that is in \ngood quantity and in good quality, at the lowest percentage of \ndisposable income to pay for it of any consumer in the world.\n\n  I hope we make it clear in this budget that Senator Domenici has put \ntogether that we are keeping our commitment to the family farmer, \nmaking sure there is an adequate supply of money for the safety net we \npromised in the 1996 farm bill.\n  We are giving the consumer, the other half of this social contract, a \nguarantee of an adequate supply of food, good quality food at a low \nprice, and we are also giving farmers some tools to manage their own \nbusinesses to a better extent through money for the Crop Insurance \nProgram so, in turn, they are not subject to the whims of each \nCongress, whether or not we are going to appropriate the money that \nought to be appropriated to meet our commitment to be an insurer of \nlast resort--in other words, appropriating the right amount of money \nwherever natural disasters might happen, whether it be earthquakes in \nCalifornia or droughts in the middle west.\n  I hope we are not going to hear on the floor of the Senate during \nthis budget debate that we do not have a safety net for farmers. What \ndo our colleagues think this $5.5 billion is for or the $9 billion-some \nwe appropriated in 1999, or the $6.5 billion additional supplement we \nappropriated in the crop-year 1998, in addition to the $43 billion that \nwas in the 1996 farm bill, total for the next 7 years? If that is not a \nsafety net, what is a safety net?\n  If somebody comes up here and says the present farm bill is not a \nvery good farm bill, all they have to do is go back to the old farm \nbills that were in existence from the 1930s until 1996. We saw Congress \nsupplementing the old farm bills because the safety net that we \nsuspected would be needed for the ensuing years of that farm bill was \nnot adequate. I do not want somebody to say there is a big tear in the \nsafety net for farmers under the 1996 farm bill because there have been \nbig tears in farm bills for previous years when Congress added funds.\n  The fact is, Congress uses the best judgment based on what \nclimatologists and economists can give us to make our decisions about \nwhat we ought to provide in a farm bill for whatever the duration of \nthat farm bill. This one is 7 years; previous ones have been 5, 4, and \n3. But, as best as we can guess ahead when we pass that farm bill, we \ncannot anticipate all the exigencies that might come about in those \nensuing years. So we find Congress responding to that safety net that \nmight have a hole in it from time to time, to knit that hole in the \nsafety net so we keep our commitment to the family farmers that we are \nnot going to keep them hanging out there by themselves, whether because \nof natural disaster or political decisions made in some foreign country \nor even domestic political decisions made in this country or even \ninternational trade decisions that are made that are beyond the control \nof this Congress. Some of the exigencies are only in the hands of God. \nCan we anticipate all of those? No, we cannot, whether it is under a \nDemocrat or Republican President, whether it is under a Democrat \nCongress or a Republican Congress. We have people making judgments, \nwhen we pass a farm bill, of what are going to be the situations with \nweather and world economics over the next few years. We make the wisest \ndecisions that can be made based on the information that is available. \nStill, sometimes we come up short.\n\n  I do not want to hear anything about not having a safety net for \nfarmers, or our not keeping our commitment to American farmers for that \nsafety net with the anticipation that this world economy is going to \nturn around and this oversupply that has come from 4 good crop-years--\nnot only in the United States but worldwide, to bring about an \noversupply--is not going to be with us all the time and we are going \nto, again, pick up our exports; we are going to, again, have somewhat \nnormal production. The farmer is going to get that profit from the \nmarketplace that is anticipated.\n  All we are doing in this farm bill, as we did in 1998 and 1999, is \nkeeping our commitment that when the profitability in the marketplace \nis not there the Congress of the United States is going to keep its \ncommitment--the social contract we have between the people of this \ncountry and the family farmer--that there is going to be a supply of \nfood of a good quality, good quantity, and at a price the consumer can \nafford.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for his commitment to the \nfarmers of America I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley, not only for \nhis kind remarks but for his observations, which are totally accurate. \nI think that was a very good summary of where we are, where we have \nbeen, and what we are trying to do in this budget resolution for the \nfarmers in this country.\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\n  I think the Senator knows. He was here, giving this few moments of \nreflection, anticipating somebody will always want more, and we will be \nconfronted with that, even on this budget resolution. I thank the \nSenator for his statement. I will be using it later on, within the next \n2 or 3 days.\n  Senator Specter wants to speak. I will yield to him as much time as \nhe would like from our side, if I might first make two observations.\n  First, I wish to summarize the tax situation to which I alluded, in \nterms of taxes on America imposed by government. The total tax burden \ntoday--that is, State and local and Federal--has never been higher. \nSecond, the Federal tax burden has never been higher, except at the end \nof World War II. Those who talk about rates and who pays and talk about \nthe article that was in the Washington Post a few days ago, ignore some \nthings about middle-income Americans I will address later. But actually \nthe total amount of money the Federal Government takes, as a portion of \nthe productivity of America, has never been higher since the Second \nWorld War as a percent of the gross domestic product.\n  Third, the U.S. is in a period of budget surpluses, which are \nprojected to grow, for certain over the next decade and maybe for \ndecades beyond that. So, in a sense, we are beginning to define the \nsurplus. We Republicans say that except for that which is Social \nSecurity, some portion of the surplus should go back to the taxpayer \nbecause it represents overpayment. When you have an overpayment, you do \nnot immediately run to spend the money; you want to do something to \nrecognize it is more than you need. In this case, we want to give some \nback. The President has a difficult time even recognizing that in his \nbudget. He cannot find a way, in a bona fide manner, to support a tax \ncut for the American people. He talks about cuts but he raises taxes \nmore than he cuts. He cannot seem to come to the conclusion that a \nlittle piece of that surplus should go back to the American people.\n  I yield the floor. I yield to Senator Specter as much time as he \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2066-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2066-S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OVERSIGHT POWER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a \npending inquiry by the Judiciary subcommittee on oversight on the \nDepartment of Justice related to two subpoenas which were issued by the \nfull Judiciary Committee to two individuals, one a former assistant \nU.S. attorney for the Central District of California and the second, a \ncurrent employee at the Department of Justice, here in Washington, DC.\n  The reasons for the request of the issuance of these subpoenas have \nbeen set out in the public record in a variety of places, but I thought \nit useful to summarize the background of the applicable law at this \ntime because there is some public concern about exactly what is going \non, why it is going on, and what are the precedents.\n  Yesterday in the respected Legal Times, there was a balanced account \nof the request for the subpoenas and the issuance of the subpoenas, but \nthe account, as is necessary in a relatively short publication, did not \nspell out in detail all of the background, which I propose to do at \nthis moment. Some of what I say on the floor of the Senate will be \nsupplemented by a memoranda which I will ask to be made a part of the \nRecord.\n  The essential facts are these: The oversight subcommittee is looking \ninto the plea bargain entered in the case of a man named Dr. Peter Lee \nin 1998. Dr. Lee had confessed to two very serious instances of \nespionage. In 1985, Dr. Lee provided to the scientists of the People's \nRepublic of China information about nuclear energy. In 1997, Dr. Lee \nagain provided to scientists of the People's Republic of China \ninformation about detecting submarines.\n  When the matter moved through the process between the assistant U.S. \nattorney in California to the Department of Justice, involving the Navy \nand the Department of Energy, there was a serious failure of \ncommunication.\n  I interviewed the assistant U.S. attorney at length in Los Angeles on \nFebruary 15, and that individual told me--and it is a part of the \nrecord--that he was denied permission to seek a serious charge against \nDr. Lee but was authorized only to file a criminal complaint under \nsection 1001 of 18 U.S.C., a false statement, but could not file \nserious charges of espionage.\n  Records of the FBI and the Department of Defense, which our \nsubcommittee has uncovered after laborious, painstaking efforts, \ndisclose that the Department of Justice was prepared to authorize a \nprosecution under 794, which is a serious espionage statute which \ncarries a penalty of up to life in prison or the death penalty. I am \nnot suggesting the death penalty was appropriate or life in prison was \nappropriate, but that is what was provided. Those serious penalties are \nsometimes used as leverage to get cooperation or further information, \nsomething I saw in some detail when I was district attorney of \nPhiladelphia.\n  The assistant U.S. attorney says he knew nothing about that. The plea \nbargain was entered into before there was a damage assessment. After \nthe damage assessment was completed, Department of Energy officials \nclassified the disclosures in the secret category. The Navy Department \nwrote an ambiguous letter at one stage on November 14, 1997, a letter \nwhich was hard to understand because the damage assessment had not been \nmade and, in fact, the Department of the Navy and the Department of \nDefense, did not make a damage assessment until requested to do so by \nthe Judiciary oversight subcommittee.\n  When that damage assessment was finally made, they came to the \nconclusion that it was, in fact, classified information. They disagreed \nwith the Department of Energy's secret classification but did classify \nit at the confidential level.\n  Through all of this sequence of events, the key official in the \nDepartment of Justice in Washington, DC, has declined to be \ninterviewed. This individual is the key person who dealt with the \nassistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles and who dealt with the \nDepartment of the Navy.\n  This is, obviously, a matter of enormous importance. When one \ncombines what was done with Dr. Peter Lee with what was done with Dr. \nWen Ho Lee, who is now under indictment, where the Attorney General of \nthe United States admitted she did not follow up on an FBI request for \na warrant under the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act but delegated \nit to a subordinate who had no experience in the field. Attorney \nGeneral Reno failed to follow up on it, and in fact the FBI let the \nmatter lie dormant for 16 to 17 months, and when you add to that other \nplea bargains in the Department of Justice on campaign contributions \ninvolving John Huang, Charlie Trie, and Johnny Chung, and the \ntechnology transfer to the People's Republic of China over the \nobjections of the Department of Justice which was conducting a criminal \ninvestigation, there is a great deal which needs to be done.\n\n  Isolating and focusing for a moment just on the Dr. Peter Lee case, \nthat is what we are looking at and that is why we have asked for the \nsubpoenas.\n  The arguments in the Judiciary Committee have raised the point that \nthis is an unprecedented event, but that in fact is not true. The \nCongressional Research Service summarized this issue as follows, and I \nwill be submitting a memorandum which has a fuller citation of \nauthority:\n\n       In the majority of instances reviewed, the testimony of \n     subordinate DOJ employees, such as line attorneys and FBI \n     field agents, was taken formally or informally, and included \n     detailed testimony about specific instances of the \n     Department's failure to prosecute alleged meritorious cases.\n\n  This goes beyond closed cases but goes to cases which are pending and \nwhich are currently being investigated. We have seen a repeated effort \nby the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Reno, to use a \npending investigation as a roadblock to providing congressional \noversight, but in fact the cases are to the contrary.\n  The authority for these issues goes back as far as Teapot Dome and \nextends as recently to last year with the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs of the Senate. In Teapot Dome, the select committee heard \ntestimony from scores of present and former attorneys and agents of the \nDepartment of Justice. Some of the cases upon which testimony was \noffered were still open at the time.\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\n  The investigation of white-collar crime in the oil industry, an \ninvestigation of the failure of the Department of Justice to \neffectively investigate and prosecute alleged crimes, took place in \n1979 when joint hearings were held by the Subcommittee on Energy and \nPower of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. At \nthat time, a Department of Justice staff attorney testified in open \nsession as to the reason for not going forward with a particular \ncriminal prosecution.\n  That is about what we are looking for here, why the prosecution did \nnot go forward, but why they settled for an insufficient plea bargain \nwhich gave Dr. Lee no jail time but only community service, probation, \nand a fine. In that context, the Department of Justice asked for only a \nshort period of incarceration. It is hard to understand why that would \nbe done when there are documents from the FBI and the Department of \nDefense which say prosecution would be authorized for a penalty which \ncarried life imprisonment or the death penalty.\n  In the Rocky Flats investigation in 1992, the Subcommittee on \nInvestigations and Oversight of the House Committee on Science, Space, \nand Technology took testimony from the U.S. attorney from the District \nof Colorado, an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Colorado, a \nDepartment of Justice line attorney, and an FBI field agent. According \nto Congressman Howard Wolpe, the Justice Department was initially \nuncooperative but finally agreed to the subcommittee's requests only \nafter the subcommittee threatened to hold DOJ in contempt.\n  In 1992, carrying through 1994, the House Subcommittee on Oversight \nand Investigations conducted an extensive investigation into the impact \nof Department of Justice activities on the effectiveness of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's criminal enforcement \nprogram. Overall, the subcommittee conducted detailed interviews with \nmore than 40 current and former Justice Department officials concerning \nthe management and operation of the Environmental Division.\n\n  For months, Justice Department attorneys stalled on subcommittee \nrequests to interview DOJ line attorneys and sought to deny the \nsubcommittee access to numerous primary decisionmaking documents as \nwell as documents prepared in response to the subcommittee's \ninvestigation.\n  On June 9 of last year, David Ryan, a line attorney for the \nDepartment of Justice OIPR, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, \ntestified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in response \nto a committee subpoena.\n  On September 22 of last year, three FBI field agents----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield to me? I am so sorry to interrupt \nhim, but I am confused because I thought we were supposed to be \ndiscussing the budget. We have Senators who want to talk about the \nbudget.\n  Does the Senator have a clue as to how long he is going to continue \non this?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have an allocation of time from the \nmanager, Senator Domenici, for as much time as I shall consume.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think under the rules we have to be speaking about the \nbudget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Can I----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I remind the Senator from California, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. A parliamentary inquiry is not in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not in order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK.\n  Mr. SPECTER. To respond to the inquiry of the Senator from \nCalifornia, I intend to speak for about 5 or 6 or 7 more minutes. As I \nunderstand the rules, if you have the floor, and if you have been \nallotted time, you can speak on any subject a Senator desires.\n  As I was about to say, Mr. President, on September 22, 1999, three \nFBI agents testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nabout the details of their investigation of Charlie Trie. Those \nindividuals appeared under subpoena. There have been efforts to have \nthe subcommittee stand down on some unspecified assurances from the \nDepartment of Justice that a way will be found to provide the \nsubcommittee with the information it needs.\n  That is not practical under these circumstances, where the specific \nsubpoenaed Department of Justice employee was the key link between the \nassistant U.S. attorney from California and the Department of Defense. \nBut I think it not irrelevant to comment about the failure of the \nDepartment of Justice to reply continually to requests for oversight \nfrom the Judiciary Committee.\n  On July 15, 1998, I asked for the Attorney General's opinion as to \nwhether there was ``specific and credible'' evidence of a legal \nviolation when Mr. Karl Jackson testified that John Huang said within \nearshot of President William Clinton, ``elections cost money, lots and \nlots of money, and I am sure that every person in this room will want \nto support the reelection of President Clinton.''\n  That was stated in the White House. The Attorney General responded \nthat she would be ``happy to review it with the task force and get back \nto you,'' referring to me. She never did so.\n  I will skip over the March 12, 1999, request, which I will have \nprinted in the Record in a moment, and refer now to the May 15, 1999, \nJudiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Department of Justice, \nwhere the Attorney General agreed to respond in writing as to whether \nthere were any ongoing investigations as to Mr. Fowler and Mr. \nSullivan. She did not do so.\n\n  At the same time, in response to my questions, the Attorney General \nagreed to respond in writing as to her thoughts on the plea bargain of \nPeter Lee, specifically, the propriety of the sentence given the \nseriousness of the offense. Notwithstanding this commitment, the \nAttorney General did not respond, which has led to our very detailed \ninquiry in this matter.\n  On June 8, 1999, in a closed hearing, in response to my questions, \nAttorney General Reno promised to write, No. 1, a report within a month \non where the Department of Justice stood on prosecuting Wen Ho Lee, \nwhich was never done; a report on the Peter Lee plea bargain, which was \nnever done; and details of the Johnny Chung plea, which was never done.\n  For purposes of brevity, I will skip over requests which the Attorney \nGeneral committed to and did not respond to on December 2, 1997, July \n10, 1998, July 23, 1998, and go to July 22, 1999, when I wrote to the \nAttorney General requesting all documents relating to the 1996 Federal \nelection campaigns and had only a staff response which provided very \nlittle information.\n  On September 29 of last year, I again wrote to the Attorney General, \npursuant to the investigation by the Judiciary subcommittee, to request \nthe 10 pieces of intelligence information mentioned in the DOJ \nInspector General Special Report on the Handling of the FBI \nIntelligence Information Related to the Justice Department's Campaign \nFinance Investigation. Again, no response.\n  When the Judiciary Committee was considering the subpoenas for the \ntwo individuals on March 23--just a couple of weeks ago--I was \nsurprised, in the middle of the proceeding, to see the ranking Democrat \non the Judiciary Committee start to read from a letter from the \nassistant attorney general of the Department of Justice.\n  The letter showed a copy to Senator Hatch, who had not received a \ncopy of the letter. The letter made a number of references to this \nSenator. I was more than a little surprised to find a letter would be \nwritten and used in that kind of an argument without the basic courtesy \nof supplying a copy of the letter to me. So, on March 24, I wrote to \nthe Attorney General asking her if she thought it was appropriate for \nAssistant Attorney General Robinson not to send me a copy of the \nletter, even though I was a topic of the letter and it involved a \nmatter before the Judiciary Committee where I was the principal moving \nparty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of a memorandum from my \nassistant, David Brog, dated today, concerning many requests of the \nAttorney General be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: Senator Specter.\n     From: David Brog.\n     Date: April 4, 2000.\n     Re: Requests made to AG Reno.\n\n                                Hearings\n\n     July 15, 1998--Judiciary Committee Hearing--Oversight of the \n         Department of Justice\n       You asked for the Attorney General's opinion as to whether \n     it was ``specific and credible'' evidence of a legal \n     violation when Mr. Karl Jackson testified that Mr. Huang said \n     with earshot of President Clinton, ``elections cost money, \n     lots and lots of money, and I am sure that every person in \n     this room will want to support the reelection of President \n     Clinton.'' The Attorney General responded that she would be \n     ``happy to review it with the task force and get back to \n     you.'' She did not do so.\n     March 12, 1999--Judiciary Committee Hearing--Department of \n         Justice FY2000 Budget Oversight\n       You requested that the Attorney General make available to \n     the Committee any writings, memoranda or documents which \n     ``deal with Mr. LaBella with respect to his recommendations \n     on independent counsel . . . or whether that issue came up in \n     any of the Department of Justice documents which led to the \n     appointment of Mr. Vega. Attorney General Reno responded that \n     she would be ``happy to furnish you anything that I can \n     appropriately furnish you on any matter relating to that.'' \n     The Attorney General did not follow up by furnishing \n     information or even to say that there was nothing she could \n     ``appropriately'' furnish.\n       When you stated that Mr. LaBella was quoted as saying that \n     he did not even get a phone call from the Justice Department \n     that Mr. Vega was going to be nominated, the Attorney General \n     responded that it was her understanding that he did, but that \n     she would check and let you know. Notwithstanding this \n     commitment to respond, she did not do so.\n     May 5, 1999--Judiciary Committee Hearing--Oversight of the \n         Department of Justice\n       The Attorney General agreed to respond in writing as to \n     whether there were any ongoing investigations as to Mr. \n     Fowler and Mr. Sullivan. She did not do so.\n       The Attorney General agreed to respond in writing as to her \n     thoughts on the plea bargain of Peter Lee, specifically the \n     propriety of the sentence given the seriousness of the \n     offense. Notwithstanding this commitment, the Attorney \n     General did not respond.\n     June 8, 1999--Judiciary Committee Hearing--Closed Hearing\n       In response to your questions, the Attorney General \n     promised to provide you with the following three things:\n       1. A report within a month on where DoJ stood on \n     prosecuting WHL.\n       2. A report on the Peter Lee plea bargain.\n       3. Details of the Chung plea bargain.\n       Notwithstanding this commitment, the Attorney General did \n     not provide any of these items.\n\n                                Letters\n\n     December 2, 1997\n       You wrote to the Attorney General requesting that a copy of \n     the Freeh memorandum be made available to the Judiciary and \n     Governmental Affairs Committees. You received a response from \n     Attorney General Reno and Director Freeh on December 8 \n     stating that they must decline your request.\n     July 10, 1998\n       You wrote to the Attorney General reiterating your request \n     from December 2, 1997, that a copy of the memorandum from FBI \n     Director Freeh recommending appointment of Independent \n     Counsel on campaign financing reform matters be made \n     available. No response.\n     July 23, 1998\n       You wrote to the Attorney General requesting a copy of the \n     LaBella report recommending Independent Counsel. No response.\n     July 22, 1999\n       You wrote to the Attorney General (Senator Hatch signed on) \n     requesting all documents in the Department's possession \n     relating to (1) the Department's investigation of illegal \n     activities in connection with the 1996 federal election \n     campaigns, and (2) the Department's investigation of the \n     transfer to China of information relating to the U.S. nuclear \n     program. DOJ staff responded by providing very little \n     information.\n     September 9, 1999\n       Together with Senators Hatch and Torricelli, you wrote to \n     the Attorney General regarding the redactions in the \n     transcript of the June 8 closed session hearing. The Attorney \n     General did not respond to you, but instead met separately \n     with Senators Hatch and Leahy on the issue.\n     September 29, 1999\n       You wrote to the Attorney General to request the ten pieces \n     of intelligence information mentioned in the United States \n     Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General Special \n     Report on the Handling of FBI Intelligence Information \n     Related to the Justice Department's Campaign Finance \n     Investigation (July, 1999). You further requested any \n     analysis available to the Department of Justice related to \n     the validity of the information and its sustainability for \n     use in a prosecution or relevance to a plea agreement. No \n     response.\n     September 29, 1999\n       You wrote a follow-up letter to the Attorney General \n     regarding the documents you requested on July 22, 1999. \n     Again, no response.\n     March 15, 2000\n       Your counsel, David Brog, was invited to DOJ offices to \n     review the partially unredacted LaBella memo which had \n     already been reviewed by other members of Congress. When he \n     arrived, he was informed that he could not review, the memo, \n     since the new head of the Campaign Finance Task Force had to \n     review it in order to see if further redactions were \n     necessary in light of some ongoing cases.\n     March 24, 2000\n       You wrote to the Attorney General regarding a letter from \n     Assistant Attorney General James Robinson which was sent to \n     Senator Leahy in time for the Judiciary Committee executive \n     business meeting on March 23. You asked her for her view of \n     whether it was proper for Mr. Robinson not to send you a copy \n     of the letter even though you were a topic of the letter. No \n     response.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of the Memorandum on the Senate's Oversight Power Regarding \nSubordinate DOJ Employees and Open DOJ Cases be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Memorandum on the Senate's Oversight Power Regarding Subordinate DOJ \n                        Employees and Open Cases\n\n       1. Congress has broad authority to hear testimony from \n     subordinate DOJ employees and to obtain information regarding \n     open DOJ cases.\n       Congress has broad authority to conduct oversight of the \n     Executive Branch, including the Department of Justice and the \n     FBI. This authority includes the ability to obtain testimony \n     and documents relating to open DOJ cases, and to take \n     testimony from subordinate DOJ employees such as line \n     attorneys and investigators who have direct knowledge of \n     relevant cases. Congressional oversight authority is \n     succinctly set forth in a recent Congressional Research \n     Service analysis:\n\n       ``[A] review of congressional investigations that have \n     implicated DOJ or DOJ investigations over the past 70 years \n     from the Palmer Raids and Teapot Dome to Watergate and \n     through Iran-Contra and Rocky Flats, demonstrates that DOJ \n     has been consistently obliged to submit to congressional \n     oversight, regardless of whether litigation is pending, so \n     that Congress is not delayed unduly in investigating \n     misfeasance, malfeasance, or maladministration in DOJ or \n     elsewhere. A number of these inquiries spawned seminal \n     Supreme Court rulings that today provide the legal foundation \n     for the broad congressional power of inquiry. All were \n     contentious and involved Executive claims that committee \n     demands for agency documents and testimony were precluded on \n     the basis of constitutional or common law privilege or \n     policy.\n       ``In the majority of instances reviewed, the testimony of \n     subordinate DOJ employees, such as line attorneys and FBI \n     field agents, was taken formally or informally, and included \n     detailed testimony about specific instances of the \n     Department's failure to prosecute alleged meritorious cases. \n     In all instances, investigating committees were provided with \n     documents respecting open or closed cases that included \n     prosecutorial memoranda, FBI investigative reports, summaries \n     of FBI interviews, memoranda and correspondence prepared \n     during the pendency of cases, confidential instructions \n     outlining the procedures or guidelines to be followed for \n     undercover operations and the surveillance and arrests of \n     suspects, and documents presented to grand juries not \n     protected from disclosure by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules \n     of Criminal Procedure, among other similar ``sensitive'' \n     materials. Congressional Research Report,''--\n     Investgative Oversight: An Introduction to the Practice \n     and Procedure of Congressional Inquiry pp. 23-24 (April 7, \n     1995).\n       2. Examples of prior investigations in which Congress has \n     heard testimony from subordinate DOJ employees and/or \n     obtained information regarding open DOJ cases.\n     1. Teapot Dome--An Investigation of the Failure of the DOJ to \n         Prosecute Alleged Meritorious Cases\n       Beginning in 1924, a Senate Select Committee conducted an \n     investigation of ``charges of misfeasance and nonfeasance in \n     the Department of Justice'' in failing to prosecute \n     individuals involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. The Select \n     Committee heard testimony from scores of present and former \n     attorneys and agents of the Department of Justice and the \n     FBI, who offered detailed testimony about specific instances \n     of the Department's failure to prosecute alleged meritorious \n     cases. Some of the cases upon which testimony was offered \n     were still open at the time. The Committee also obtained \n     access to Department documentation, including prosecutorial \n     memoranda, on a wide range of matters.\n     2. Investigation of FBI Domestic Intelligence Operations\n       Beginning in 1975, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on \n     Civil and Constitutional Rights held hearings on FBI domestic \n     intelligence operations. At the request of the\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\n     Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the General Accounting \n     Office began a review of FBI operations in this area. In an \n     attempt to analyze current FBI practices, the GAO chose ten \n     FBI offices involved in varying level of domestic \n     intelligence activity, and randomly selected 899 cases in \n     these offices to review. FBI agents prepared a summary of the \n     information contained in the files of each of the selected \n     cases. These summaries described the information that led to \n     opening the investigation, methods and sources of collecting \n     information for the case, instructions from FBI headquarters, \n     and a brief summary of each document in the file. After \n     reviewing the summaries, GAO staff held interviews with \n     the FBI agents involved with the cases, as well as the \n     agents who prepared the summaries. GAO later did a follow \n     up investigation in which it reviewed an additional 319 \n     cases and held interviews with the agents involved with \n     these cases.\n     3. While Collar Crime in the Oil Industry--An Investigation \n         of the Failure of the DOJ to Effectively Investigate and \n         Prosecute Alleged Crimes\n       In 1979, joint hearings were held by the Subcommittee on \n     Energy and Power of the House Committee on Interstate and \n     Foreign Commerce and the Subcommittee on Crime of the House \n     Judiciary Committee to conduct an inquiry into allegations of \n     fraudulent pricing of fuel in the oil industry and the \n     failure of the Department of Energy and the Department of \n     Justice to effectively investigate and prosecute alleged \n     criminality. A DOJ staff attorney testified in open session \n     as to the reason for not going forward with a particular \n     criminal prosecution. Although a civil prosecution of the \n     same matter was then pending, DOJ agreed to supply the \n     committee with documents leading to the decision not to \n     prosecute.\n     4. Rocky Flats--A Review of a DOJ Plea Bargain\n       In 1992, the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight \n     of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology \n     commenced a review of the plea bargain settlement by the \n     Department of Justice of the government's investigation and \n     prosecution of environmental crimes committed by Rockwell \n     International Corporation in its capacity as manager of the \n     Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Facility. The Subcommittee took \n     testimony from the United States Attorney for the District of \n     Colorado, an assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of \n     Colorado, a Department of Justice line attorney and an FBI \n     field agent. It further received voluminous FBI field \n     investigative reports and interview summaries. According to \n     Subcommittee Chairman Howard Wolpe, the Justice Department \n     was not initially cooperative and agreed to the \n     Subcommittee's requests only after the Subcommittee \n     threatened to hold DOJ witnesses in contempt:\n\n       ``Our investigation was impeded by restrictions imposed by \n     the U.S. Department of Justice. All of the witnesses, upon \n     written instructions from the acting assistant attorney \n     general for the criminal division which were approved by the \n     Attorney General, refused to answer questions concerning \n     internal deliberations in which decisions were made about the \n     investigation and prosecution of Rockwell, the Department of \n     Energy and their employees.''--Statement of Chairman Wolpe, \n     October 5, 1992.\n\n       On September 23, the Subcommittee unanimously authorized \n     Chairman Wolpe to send a letter to President Bush asking him \n     either to assert executive privilege for the information that \n     the Justice Department directed the witnesses to withhold, or \n     to direct those witnesses to answer such questions. After \n     failing to receive an adequate answer from either the White \n     House or the Justice Department, the Subcommittee declared \n     its intention to hold the U.S. Attorney for the District of \n     Colorado in contempt. At this point, the Department changed \n     course and accepted an agreement which provided that:\n\n       ``The Department will issue a new instruction letter to all \n     personnel who have received prior instructions directing them \n     not to answer questions concerning deliberative privilege. \n     The new letter will inform them that they must answer all \n     Subcommittee questions fully and truthfully, including those \n     which relate to internal deliberations.'' Ibid.\n     5. DOJ Influence on the EPA--A Review of DOJ Environmental \n         Crime Prosecutions\n       From 1992 through 1994, the House Subcommittee on Oversight \n     and Investigations conducted an extensive investigation into \n     the impact of Department of Justice activities on the \n     effectiveness of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \n     criminal enforcement program. Overall, the Subcommittee \n     conducted detailed interviews with more than 40 current and \n     former Justice Department officials concerning the management \n     and operation of the Environmental Division and \n     environmental criminal enforcement policies. The \n     Subcommittee also reviewed hundreds of internal DOJ \n     documents on these matters. As the Subcommittee wrote in \n     its report:\n\n       ``One of the most significant accomplishments of the \n     Subcommittee's environmental crimes investigation was its \n     reinforcement of a number of important historical precedents \n     regarding Congressional oversight of the Justice Department. \n     The Subcommittee withstood repeated efforts to resist the \n     exercise of its Constitutional responsibilities to oversee \n     Executive Branch agencies. For months, Justice Department \n     officials stalled on Subcommittee requests to interview DOJ \n     line attorney and sought to deny Subcommittee access to \n     numerous primary decision-making documents as well as \n     documents prepared in response to the Subcommittee's \n     investigation. However, the Subcommittee ultimately obtained \n     the interviews and comments it deemed necessary to fulfill \n     its oversight duties in a responsible manner.''--Damaging \n     Disarray--Organizational Breakdown and Reform in the Justice \n     Department's Environmental Crimes Program, a staff report \n     prepared for the use of the Subcommittee on Oversight and \n     Investigations of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the \n     U.S. House of Representatives. December, 1994.\n     6. Governmental Affairs Hearing re Wen Ho Lee\n       On June 9, 1999, Mr. David Ryan, a line attorney at the DOJ \n     OIPR (Office of Intelligence Policy and Review) testified \n     before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about \n     details of the Department's handling of the Wen Ho Lee \n     investigation. Mr. Ryan appeared in response to a Committee \n     subpoena.\n     7. Governmental Affairs Hearing re Charlie Trie\n       On September 22, 1999, three FBI line agents--Roberta \n     Parker, Daniel Wehr, and Kevin Sheridan, testified before the \n     Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about the details of \n     their investigation into Charlie Trie. These agents appeared \n     in response to Committee subpoenas.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are in the midst of some very serious oversight on \nthe Department of Justice. We have seen the Wen Ho Lee case bungled \nbadly by the Department of Justice and the chances for successful \nprosecution placed in real jeopardy. We have seen very serious \nespionage violations by Dr. Peter Lee involving nuclear power and \ninvolving detection of submarines, to which there were confessions, \nwhere a plea bargain was entered into without having a damage \nassessment and without having the trial attorney notified as to his \nauthority to pursue very serious charges.\n  It is plain, in the context of what has gone on with the Department \nof Justice over the past many years in their refusal to provide \ninformation for oversight, even after the requests were made, and even \nafter the Attorney General personally agreed to the request, that the \nonly way to get to the bottom of it is to issue subpoenas and insist on \ncongressional oversight so we can find out why these travesties of \njustice were carried out.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2069-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2069-S2071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FISCAL YEAR 2001 BUDGET--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take such time as I may consume \non the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now in the very happy circumstance, \nas a nation, to be on the longest economic expansion in our country's \nentire history. As this headline shows from the February 1 edition of \nthe Washington Post, ``Expansion Is Now Our Nation's Longest.'' This \n107 months of economic growth beats the record of the 1960s.\n  This is a remarkable circumstance as we meet to discuss the budget \nresolution this year. The question before this body and the other body \nand the President is, What is the budget policy to pursue to keep this \neconomic expansion going? What is the best set of policies we can \nadopt?\n  Perhaps, to make a judgment on those questions, we ought to refresh \nourselves on the history of how we got to where we are. This chart \nshows a comparison of the last three administrations with respect to \nthe budget deficit. It shows, going back to 1981, 20 years ago, that \nthe deficits were rising and rising dramatically, and we embarked on a \nperiod of not only expanding deficits but expanding debt in this \ncountry--taking on enormous debt. In fact, during this period, we \nquadrupled the national debt. That fundamentally threatened the \neconomic security of our country. We saw, in the Bush administration, \nthat the deficit absolutely skyrocketed. It went from an already high \nlevel of $153 billion all the way up to $290 billion.\n  Then President Clinton came into office. In 1993, we passed a plan to \nreduce budget deficits, to start getting our fiscal house in order. \nThat was a 5-year plan. We can look at the 5 years of that plan and we \ncan see that each and every year the deficit was coming down and coming \ndown quite sharply. Those\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nwere very important decisions that were made in 1993. If my colleagues \nwill permit me to sound a partisan note, not a single Republican voted \nfor this plan of reducing the budget deficit. It was a controversial \nplan that cut spending and, yes, raised income taxes on the wealthiest \n1 percent in this country. But let's remember what worked. It worked. \nIt brought the deficits down. It got our country back on sound \nfinancial footing.\n  Then, in 1997, we passed a second plan. This time, it was bipartisan. \nThis time, we worked together and it finished the job so that we are \nnow running substantial surpluses. In fact, as shown here in 1998, a \n$70 billion unified surplus; in 1999, there was a $124 billion unified \nsurplus. In the year 2000, we anticipate a $176 billion budget surplus. \nThese are surpluses, the last 2 years, even counting Social Security as \na separate trust fund. In other words, not including Social Security in \nthe calculation, we balanced 2 years ago, last year, and will balance \nagain this year. So we have made enormous progress in this country.\n  What a difference it has made. Because we got on a sounder financial \nfooting, that took pressure off of interest rates. Lower interest rates \ncontributed to making our economy more competitive. It took Government \nout of the position of competing with the private sector for funds, so \ninterest rates came down. That made room for more productive \ninvestment. What we saw was an explosion in jobs. Over 20 million new \njobs were created during this period. But the good news didn't stop \nthere. We saw the unemployment rate drop to its lowest level in 42 \nyears.\n  The point I am making is that we are pursuing an economic strategy \nthat is working. It is working well for our country. We should not \nabandon it for risky schemes that some might propose. The unemployment \nrate is the lowest in 42 years. The inflation rate is at the lowest \nsustained level since 1965. These are facts. These tell us the economic \ngame plan and strategy we embarked on in 1993 is working and working \nwell. We have talked about deficits--and, of course, the deficits are \nthe annual difference between the spending of the Federal Government \nand the revenue of the Federal Government. We also need to talk about \nthe national debt. The debt is the cumulative total of the deficits. \nPeople often get confused about this question. But that is the \ndifference. The deficits are the annual difference between spending and \nrevenue. Of course, we don't have deficits anymore. We are in surplus, \nvery significant surplus. The debt is the cumulative total of all those \nannual deficits. Even that debt is starting to come down. You can see \nwe are right here on the line, so we have turned the corner.\n\n  We are actually starting to pay down the national debt. That is a \ncourse we must continue. It is absolutely critical for our economic \nfuture to keep paying down this debt. In fact, we are now in a position \nwhere we could pay off the national debt, completely retire the \npublicly held national debt, by the year 2013.\n  That is precisely what we should do to put our country in a strong \nposition for when the baby boomers start to retire. We all know what is \ngoing to happen then. We are going to see a substantial increase in \npressure on Social Security, Medicare, and other Federal programs. The \nbest way to prepare for that day is to grow the economy so that it is \nbest positioned to take that burden. How can we do that? Well, central \nto doing it is to get rid of this debt, dump this debt. That ought to \nbe on the top priority list of every Member in this Chamber.\n  That is the record--a very positive record--of what has occurred. It \ndoesn't end there because not only have we seen extraordinary periods \nof economic growth, not only have we seen the lowest unemployment, the \nlowest rate of inflation in many, many years--in fact, in decades--we \nhave also seen Federal spending put under control. We now see that \nFederal spending is at the lowest level since 1966 as a share of our \nnational income. This is as a percentage of our gross domestic product. \nWe can see that we got to a period back in the 1980s where Federal \nspending was over 23 percent of our gross domestic product. Look where \nwe are now. We are down below 19 percent and headed lower if we stay on \nthis course. It is remarkable what has happened.\n  If we look at what the priorities are now of the various budget \nresolutions before us, this is what we see by way of comparison. Over \nthe next 5 years of this budget resolution, we project a non-Social \nSecurity surplus of $171 billion. That is based on the assumption of no \nreal growth in the Federal budget. That is what is called a real \nspending freeze. It adjusts for inflation, but nothing more. So over \nthe next 5 years, we would have $171 billion under that set of \nassumptions--a real spending freeze and adjustments for inflation, but \nno more. Our Republican friends believe we ought to use nearly all of \nthat money for a tax cut. This is the Senate plan, a $150 billion tax \ncut. With the $18 billion in interest that would cost, it would be a \ntotal of $168 billion.\n  On the House side, you can see their plan: $223 billion, a tax cut of \n$150 billion, plus they have a $50 billion reserve for a tax cut, plus \nthe $23 billion of interest costs that would be entailed in that plan, \nfor a total of $223 billion.\n  You see that the problem with the plan is they use more than the \nsurplus than is available. Where is the money going to come from? I \nthink we all know what will happen. They will be right back to the bad \nold days of raiding the Social Security trust funds. That is what they \nwill do. That would be a profound mistake. We can't let them do it.\n  That is why these votes that are to come are so important.\n  It is one reason you see these headlines that the Republicans have \navoided the vote on the Bush tax cut. They avoided it in the House, and \nthey avoided it in the Senate because they know the Bush plan is even \nmore skewed than the plans they have passed. The Bush plan has a much \nlarger tax cut. There can be no question that his plan must raid Social \nSecurity in order to add up. There is no money left over under his plan \nfor further reduction of the debt. There is no money under his plan to \nextend the solvency of Medicare. There is no money under his plan for \nother high priority domestic needs because he is taking all the money \nand all the non-Social Security surplus and much more and giving it in \na tax cut to the wealthiest among us.\n  That is the question before us as a people. What are we going to do \nwith these forecasts of surpluses?\n  Let's remember their projections are over an extended period of \ntime--5 years. Many of us believe these projections will change and \nthat they are not something on which we can count.\n  We look at the plan Mr. Bush has put before all of us as a people. We \ncan see that over 5 years he proposes $483 billion in tax cuts. But we \nonly have $171 billion available in non-Social Security surpluses. \nWhere is the rest of the money going to come from? It can only come \nfrom one place: He is going to have to raid Social Security. He is \ngoing to have to go back to the bad old days of dipping in the till on \nSocial Security. That is a profound mistake. It is no wonder they have \navoided votes on that tax cut plan on both the House and Senate sides.\n  Beyond that, the Bush proposal is unfair because he is saying take 60 \npercent of the benefit of his massive tax cut and give it to the \nwealthiest 10 percent in the country. That is his plan. Senator McCain \nsaid it very well during his campaign. He said over and over again that \n60 percent of the benefit in the Bush tax cut goes to the wealthiest 10 \npercent. I even heard Senator McCain make the statement that 36 percent \nof the benefit goes to the wealthiest 1 percent. Mr. Bush has made the \npoint over and over that these surpluses belong to the American people. \nThey do not belong to the Government. He is exactly right about that.\n  These surpluses belong to the American people. The question is, What \ndo we do with them? Do we give them to the wealthiest among us, or do \nwe put the highest priority on taking a significant chunk of those \nfunds and pay down the people's debt? I submit to you the better \napproach is to take the significant majority of these funds and pay \ndown our national debt. That is what we ought to do. That is in the \nbest interests of the American people--not take the big chunk of this \nnon-Social Security surplus--in fact, under the Bush plan take more \nthan there is in the surplus--and hand it out to the wealthiest among \nus. It is much better to pay down the people's debt.\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n  If we look back and remember the history of what occurred, if we go \nback to the 1980s when we had those massive deficits, the blue line \nshows the outlays, the expenditures of the Federal Government. The red \nline shows the revenue of the Federal Government. It is not hard to \nfigure out why we had massive deficits. The spending line was much \nhigher than the revenue line.\n  It wasn't until 1993--we passed a 5-year plan that took down the \nspending line and raised the revenue line--that we were able to balance \nthe budget. That is the history of what has worked. We should stay on \nthis course. We shouldn't go out and go on a big new spending binge. We \nshouldn't go out and have a massive, risky tax scheme that threatens \nthis economic expansion and this economic success story. Why would we \ndo that? We have a plan that is working. We have a plan that is \nproducing results for this country.\n\n  As we look ahead, some say because the revenue line has gone up that \nwe have the highest taxes in our country's history; not true. We have \nthe highest tax revenue. We don't have the highest taxes. I know that \nseems odd to people. How can that be? How can you have high revenue but \nnot high taxes? The reason is this economic boom has generated dramatic \nrevenue. We are in a virtuous cycle where good fiscal policy and good \nmonetary policy have helped this economy grow. And the genius of the \nAmerican people has developed the circumstance in which our economic \nexpansion is extraordinary. Because we have this revenue, we are in a \nsituation that has allowed us to actually reduce taxes on individual \ntaxpayers.\n  That is not just Kent Conrad's statement. That is a review of the \nFederal tax system that shows that the Federal tax level falls for most \npeople. The studies show the burden now less than 10 percent. In fact, \nas this newspaper story says, for all but the wealthiest Americans, the \nFederal income tax burden has ``shrunk'' to the lowest level in four \ndecades.\n  Those who come out here and say we have the highest tax ever--no, no. \nWe have the best tax revenues ever. We have the most income ever. We \ndon't have the highest taxes ever. Tax rates for individual American \ntaxpayers have gone down. That is not the result of some study by some \nliberal think tank. This is a result of the work of the Congressional \nBudget Office. This is the work of the Treasury Department. This is the \nwork of the conservative Tax Foundation. These are their conclusions--\nthat tax rates have actually gone down.\n  Let's look at what those studies reveal. This is for a family of four \nearning $39,000 in 1999. This is according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. This is their total tax burden for Federal income taxes. You \ncan see their Federal income taxes have gone down from 8.3 percent to \n5.4 percent from 1981 to 1999. It is not just a family earning $39,000, \nbut this is what happened to the income tax burden for a median-income \nfamily earning $68,000 in 1999. Their tax burden has gone from 10.4 \npercent in 1957 to 8.9 percent in 1998. This is according to the very \nconservative Tax Foundation.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, this is the history. This is how we \nhave gotten to where we are today--by getting our fiscal house in \norder; by cutting spending; yes, by raising revenue on the wealthiest 1 \npercent in this country and lowering taxes on the vast majority of the \nAmerican people through expansion of the earned-income tax; by the $500 \nchild care credit; lowering taxes on the vast majority of the American \npeople; and now we are in this position of being able to actually \nretire the publicly held debt by the year 2013.\n  Virtually every economist that has come before us on the Budget \nCommittee and on the Finance Committee said this is exactly what you \nshould do--make the priority paying down the debt.\n  Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, says pay down debt \nfirst.\n  ``The best use of surplus is to reduce red ink, the Fed chief says.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2071-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire how much time we have \nused up totally off the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has used 1 hour, 31 minutes; the \nminority, 1 hour, 23 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For a total of what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 3 hours.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is 2 hours 54 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand from the minority they want to let Senator \nConrad complete his speech, and I am more than willing to do that. Will \nhe be along shortly?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am told he will be. But I do not want to hold up \nthe process if there is someone on the other side who seeks \nrecognition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Hutchison has an amendment. I have indicated to \nher we are trying to work on a process for 5 amendments, and hers would \nprobably be one of those from our side. So I would rather we not \nproceed with any amendments for now.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate that. There has to be an orderly \nstructure here. There are lots of Senators who want to offer amendments \nand Senators who want to just speak on the resolution itself. We will \nneed some time to do that. If we can ask our Members to just hold off \nuntil an agreement has been reached, then I think we will have a more \norderly process.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would Senator Hutchison like to deliver a speech about \nher subject rather than offering the amendment? She can do both, speak \nto the issue and then we can work out if hers is one of the amendments. \nWe will know about that shortly. If not, she is going to be free to \noffer it, subject to a second-degree amendment, of course.\n  Would the Senator want to speak to the marriage penalty a little bit \njust as a matter of substance for the Senate?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me ask a question. If I started with the speech \non the marriage penalty, then Senator Conrad would start on his speech \nand we would be negotiating how the amendments are handled, is that \nwhat the Senator is suggesting?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I might, Mr. President, Senator Conrad wanted to \nfinish his opening remarks. Certainly we invite anybody, from either \nside, to do that. But if we can hold off until he makes his remarks, \nassuming he will be here momentarily, then we can talk together about \nwhether or not we can make an agreement that would constitute a \nspecific number of amendments, equally distributed here, so we can \nbegin a process of amendments. I would certainly like to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Hutchison's remarks, if she makes them now, \nwould not prejudice her coming along later, with reference to the same \nsubject, and offering an amendment. But I can't assure her hers would \nbe the first amendment up. I am trying to work out a five and five, so \nwe can get on using up some of the time on the resolution. I can yield \nto the Senator if she desires. If not, I will suggest the absence of a \nquorum call.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would love to talk for maybe 5 \nminutes, prefatory, but I prefer to have my real debate on the issue \ncome during the debate on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, while the negotiations are going on, I \nwill say it is my intention to offer an amendment, which would be a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment, that we would eliminate the marriage tax \npenalty in this country. Certainly, the sense-of-the-Senate is quite \nshort and pretty\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nclear. The Senate would find that marriage is the foundation of \nAmerican society; that the Tax Code should not penalize those who \nchoose to marry; that a report to the Treasury Department's Office of \nTax Analysis estimates that, in 1999, 48 percent of married couples \nwill pay a marriage penalty under the present system; that averages \n$1,400 a year. The sense-of-the-Senate amendment will be that Congress \nshall pass marriage penalty tax elimination legislation that begins a \nphaseout of this penalty in 2001, pass marriage penalty tax legislation \nthat does not discriminate against stay-at-home spouses, and consider \nsuch legislation prior to April 15, 2000.\n\n  We are scheduled to debate marriage penalty relief next week. It is \ncertainly appropriate that we say to these people the week they are \nbeginning to write their checks to the IRS: If you are paying $600 more \nor $1,000 more or $1,400 more just because you are married, help is on \nthe way; the Senate is committed to eliminating this tax.\n  I do not even think we ought to call it a tax cut. This is a tax \ncorrection. This is a correction of an inequity in our code.\n  That clearly and simply is what my sense-of-the-Senate amendment is. \nIt is provided for in the budget resolution before us. The Senator from \nNew Mexico has provided $150 billion in this budget for tax relief for \nhard-working Americans.\n  If one looks at the tax relief we have already passed in the Senate, \nit still would not reach $150 billion. We passed tax relief for Social \nSecurity recipients so people between the ages of 65 and 70 could work \nwithout being penalized. We have passed tax relief for small \nbusinesspeople who are hard hit with the many regulations and taxes \nthat are put on their businesses. We have provided tax relief for \nfamilies who are trying to provide enhancements for their children's \neducation. Senator Coverdell has been the lead on that bill which gives \npeople the ability to take tax credits and tax deductions when they \nhave to buy their children computers, books, tutors, or enhance college \ntuition or private school tuition--whatever the cost is to parents, to \ngive children the enhancement their parents believe they need and that \ntheir parents would be able to give from tax cuts. And we add on top of \nthose marriage penalty relief.\n  We met with some wonderful people this morning--real people--who are \nsuffering from the marriage penalty. The bill that will come up next \nweek has the elimination of that penalty.\n  Kervin and Marsha Johnson met with us today. Kervin is a District of \nColumbia police officer. His wife is a Federal employee. They were \nmarried last July. This year they will owe $1,000 more in taxes because \nthey got married. They are newlyweds. They were shocked that this \nhappened.\n  We also met with Eric and Ayla Hemeon. Eric is a volunteer \nfirefighter who also works for a printing company. She works for a \nsmall business. They have been married for 2 years and are expecting \ntheir first child in about a month. Ayla talked to us about what this \nmeans. What it means to them is $1,100 they are paying to Uncle Sam \ninstead of doing something to benefit their first child who is almost \nhere.\n  We had the two newlyweds, and then we had an older couple who met \nwith our group this morning, Lawrence and Brendalyn Garrison. He is a \ncorrections officer at Lorton, and she is a teacher in Fairfax County. \nLast year, they paid about a $600 marriage penalty.\n  When we talked to them about what the bill which will come up next \nweek would do for them, they said: Gosh, do you think you could make it \nretroactive? Because they have been married for 25 years.\n  These are real people with real faces who would get marriage penalty \nrelief.\n  Mr. President, I will stop and yield the rest of my time to Senator \nSessions. I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he will allow me to take \n5 extra minutes for the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Does the \nSenator from New Mexico yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield as much time as the Senator from Texas wants.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield such time to the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \nleadership in this effort, Senator Roth for his determination to make \nit a reality, and Senator Domenici for providing us an opportunity in \nthis budget to try to end a penalty on marriage in America.\n  The time has come. We have talked about it long enough. We have a \nnational consensus to end this penalty. I have 425,000 Alabama \nfamilies, 48 percent of the married couples, who are paying excess \ntaxes simply because they got married. I know a couple who divorced and \nfound they had received a $1,600 bonus by being divorced.\n  Think about that. The U.S. Government is saying to married couples: \nIf you divorce, on average you will receive a $1,400 tax benefit. At \nthe same time, if you get married, you are going to pay a $1,400 tax \nincrease--unbelievable in a society that is experiencing substantial \nsocial problems from the breakup of families.\n  I chair the Youth Violence Subcommittee in the Judiciary Committee. \nWe have had a lot of testimony, and I have done a study over the years \nas a prosecutor, about why crime is occurring. Why are so many young \npeople involved in crime? Why is the crime rate higher with young \npeople than among older people?\n  One reason is we have an extraordinary decline in the unity of the \nfamily. More families have broken up in the last 20, 30 years than in \nthe history of the world. In fact, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. Moynihan, who studied these issues, said one time \nthat in the history of the world, no nation has ever gone forward with \nthe kind of family breakups we have in America today.\n  We do not know what the long-term consequences are. But more and more \nstudies indicate that all in all, it is better if we have an intact \nfamily. We have a U.S. Government policy to penalize marriage. That is \nnot the right way for us to go.\n  I am so thankful we are now moving to a vote on this piece of \nlegislation. People are going to have to stand up and be counted and \ndefend the practice of taxing people who decide to get married and \nraise a family in America.\n  The numbers, as the Senator from Texas said, are stunning. We have a \npoliceman and civil servant paying $1,000 extra a year, married for 2 \nyears; a volunteer fireman, a printer, and a small businessperson \npaying $1,100 extra per year.\n  What does that mean? That is $100 a month. That is $100 a month \naftertax money that could have been in their pockets, but the Federal \nGovernment reached in and took it out to spend on programs.\n  I am of the belief that is wrong. What can that young couple do with \n$100 a month? They can maybe start a savings account, maybe buy a new \nset of tires for their car--at least maybe a couple tires each month--\nor put a muffler on their car, or send their child to school with money \nfor a project or a program, let them go to a movie or two every other \nweek. This is real money for real people. I am glad we had Senator \nHutchison and others this morning who brought forth couples who are \npaying this tax to help us recognize that we are dealing with a problem \nthat needs to end.\n  I believe, and our Nation has always believed until recent years, \nthat public policy does affect behavior.\n  What we want to do when we adopt a public policy position is, we want \nto ask ourselves, will this foster good behavior or will it encourage \nbad behavior? I suggest we have a policy that is not only unfair but it \nis damaging to our goal as a nation to affirm and encourage marriage, \nto encourage partnership in the marital union in the raising of \nfamilies. Taxing that is not good public policy. The end of it is long \noverdue.\n  I am glad we will soon have a vote. I do hope and pray that the vote \nwill be overwhelmingly to end this penalty.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield such time as he needs to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the budget process is our chance to set\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nclear priorities for America's future. The budget which the Senate \nadopts this week will say a great deal about the values of those who \nvote for it. Our vote on this budget will emphasize what each of us \nsupports. It is easy to pay lip service to meeting the Nation's unmet \nneeds, but are we willing to allocate resources in a manner that will \neffectively address those needs?\n  This is a time of unparalleled prosperity. Both the CBO and OMB \nproject budget surpluses far into the future. We will never have a \ngreater opportunity to meet America's unmet needs than we have today--\nto improve the quality of education for all children; to strengthen \nSocial Security and Medicare in a way that will provide a secure and \nhealthy retirement for future generations, as well as a prescription \ndrug benefit; to provide access to good health care for millions of \nuninsured families; to make communities safer by keeping guns out of \nthe wrong hands, and by increasing the number of police officers on our \nstreets; and to expand scientific research to keep America on the \ncutting edge of progress.\n  These are the great challenges of our time. Unfortunately, the budget \npresented by the Republican majority does not meet those challenges. It \nwould actually cut spending on domestic discretionary programs by more \nthan 6 percent, by well over $100 billion over the next 5 years.\n  These cuts are far from necessary to curb uncontrolled Federal \nspending or to reduce inflationary pressure on the economy. In fact, \neven according to the Senate Budget Committee, and its Republican \nstaff, the amount provided for nondefense discretionary spending as a \npercentage of GNP is the lowest share for this category since such \nstatistics have been compiled.\n\n  We are already spending less on domestic discretionary programs as a \npercent of GNP than we ever have before. So why do our Republican \nfriends propose more drastic reductions? The answer is, so they can \nprovide more tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  The Republican budget would use up essentially the entire surplus \nwith extravagant tax cuts, primarily benefiting the wealthiest \nindividuals and corporations in our society.\n  CBO projects an on-budget surplus over the next 5 years of $171 \nbillion. The proposed GOP budget would use all but $3 billion of that \ntotal amount to finance ill-conceived tax cut schemes. They propose a \nminimum of $150 billion in tax cuts over the next 5 years. Because \nthose tax cuts will delay repayment of the national debt, they will \ncost an additional $18 billion in higher interest payments on the debt, \nas well.\n  Also, according to this GOP budget, if the projected surplus \nincreases, the additional amount must be used for even larger tax cuts. \nThe extra amount cannot be used to restore any portion of the serious \ncuts in domestic programs.\n  But this is only the tip of the tax-cut iceberg.\n  Last year, Republicans proposed a ten-year budget to the Congress. \nThey did so because using 10-year numbers enabled them to emphasize how \nlarge their proposed tax cut was--$792 billion. It demonstrated how \nrapidly the size of their tax cut would grow--from $156 billion in the \nfirst 5 years, to $635 billion in the second 5 years--or more than four \ntimes as much revenue.\n  But the Republicans badly miscalculated the reaction of the American \npeople. By large margins, the public agreed that the tax cut was far \ntoo large, because it would harm the economy and make it impossible for \nus to achieve the priority national investments needed to keep our \neconomy and the country strong for the future.\n  The American people consistently said that Congress should use the \nsurplus to put Social Security and Medicare on a sound financial \nfooting, before acting on large tax cuts. In fact, the American people \ndisplayed a great deal more common sense than the Republican \nleadership.\n  This year, Congressional Republicans have responded to these concerns \nby using a 5-year projection instead of a 10-year projection. By \nconsidering only the first 5 years, they hope to conceal the true \nmagnitude of their tax cut scheme. Rather than reducing the size of \ntheir tax cut, they are simply attempting to change the terms of the \ndebate from 10 years to 5 years. But this Republican accounting gimmick \nwon't work. The GOP tax cuts being proposed this year are just as \nlarge, if not larger, than last year. The Republican strategy is now to \nenact a stealth tax cut, concealing its true long-term cost from the \npublic.\n  How do we know their intent, since the budget is silent beyond fiscal \nyear 2005? Consider the tax cut plans which the Republicans have \nalready brought to the floor this year. The House version of marriage \npenalty relief would cost $51 billion over the first 5 years--but rises \nsharply to $182 billion over 10 years. The plan produced by Senate \nRepublicans would cost $70 billion over 5 years, and dramatically \nincreases to $248 billion over 10 years.\n  The Senate tax package attached to the minimum wage legislation costs \n$18 billion over the first 5 years--but grows to $76 billion over 10 \nyears. The annual cost by the 10th year would be nearly as large as the \ncost over the entire first 5 years. Similarly, the House tax package \ntied to the minimum wage costs $46 billion from fiscal year 2000 to \n2005--but $123 billion over the full 10-year period.\n  Clearly, Republicans have not abandoned their plan for tax breaks \ncosting far more than the country can afford. They are now spending the \ntax cuts over several bills, rather than combining them in one massive \nmeasure, and they're attempting to limit discussion of the budgetary \nimpact to the first 5 years. All of these GOP tax breaks are steeply \nbackloaded. They mushroom in cost after the first 5 years. It is a \nstealth tax break strategy, and it cannot stand the light of public \ndebate.\n  Defenders of the budget resolution contend that it does not mandate \nthe form which the tax cut will take, and it is wrong to claim that the \ntax cuts will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. That \nargument is truly disingenuous. It asks us to ignore the abundant \nevidence provided by the recent history of Republican tax cut \nproposals. Let us look at the record.\n  Last year, Republicans passed their ill-fated $800 billion tax cut. \nUnder that legislation, 81 percent of the tax benefits would have gone \nto the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers. The richest 1 percent of \ntaxpayers--those with incomes averaging $800,000 a year--would have \nreceived 41 percent of the total tax benefits, a tax saving of as much \nas $46,000 a year. In stark contrast, working families comprising 60 \npercent of taxpayers would have shared less than 8.5 percent of the tax \nsavings, an average tax cut of only $138 a year.\n  The Republican Presidential nominee, Governor George W. Bush, tells \nus his tax cut is designed to ``take down the toll booth on the road to \nthe middle class.'' However, 73 percent of the overall tax benefits in \nhis massive tax cut proposal--$1,8 trillion over 10 years--would go to \nthe wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers--37 percent of the tax breaks \nwould go to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. That ``toll booth'' \nGovernor Bush loves to talk about is on a highway most Americans never \ntravel. Just 11 percent of the tax benefits under the Bush plan would \ngo to the less affluent 60 percent of working men and women.\n  This year, congressional Republicans have rushed to pass tax cut \nproposals before the budget is even adopted. These tax cuts have \nalready consumed $115 billion of the surplus over the next 5 years and \n$443 billion over 10 years. The Marriage Penalty Relief Act passed by \nthe House would cost $182 billion over 10 years, and 77.8 percent of \nthe tax benefits would go to the most affluent 20 percent of taxpayers. \nThe Senate version reported out of the Finance Committee last week \nwould cost even more, $248 billion over 10 years, and gives an even \nlarger share of the tax savaings--78.3 percent--to the wealthiest \ntaxpayers. In both bills, the majority of the tax benefits actually go \nto couples who are not even paying a marriage penalty.\n  In addition, as the Republican leadership's price for allowing a \nmodest increase in the minimum wages the House recently passed a $123 \nbillion/10-year package of tax cuts. Eighty-nine percent of the tax \nbreaks in that bill would go to the richest 5 percent of taxpayers, \nwhile 90 percent of taxpayers would share less than 8.5 percent of the \ntax benefits.\n  In light of this history, there is no doubt that the benefits of any \ntax cut passed by this Republican Congress will be distributed in a \nblatantly unfair\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\nway, and will be designed to benefit the richest individuals and \ncorporations in our society.\n  I support reasonable, targeted tax cuts that benefit low- and middle-\nincome working families. But by enacting tax cuts of the magnitude \nproposed by the Republicans, we will lose the best opportunity in \ndecades to meet America's unmet needs. We will also forfeit the \nopportunity to strengthen Social Security and Medicare for future \ngenerations of retirees. Our shortsightedness will be justifiably \ncondemned by future generations as they struggle to deal with the \nnational needs we are so irresponsibly ignoring.\n\n  The larger the tax cut, the less is available for debt reduction and \ninvestments in national priorities, such as education, prescription \ndrugs for senior citizens, and research on energy and health.\n  The Republican budget shortchanges all of these priorities. Alongside \ntheir massive tax cuts, Republicans make reductions in domestic \ninvestments that are historically unprecedented. They want to reduce \ndiscretionary spending on domestic priorities, as I mentioned, by more \nthan 6 percent in real dollars over the next 5 years, even though our \npopulation is growing and even though present funding for many programs \nis already inadequate.\n  We are not talking about creating new programs or expanding existing \nprograms. By reducing the Government's ability to maintain even the \ncurrent level of services, Republicans forfeit any hope of addressing \nthe Nation's unmet priorities. Even in this time of prosperity, we are \nnot meeting the basic needs of large numbers of our people.\n  One in five of the Nation's children lives in poverty. Three out of \nfour third graders read below grade level. Hunger in low-income working \nfamilies has become a national crisis, with food pantries and soup \nkitchens unable to meet the daily needs for their services. Forty-three \nmillion people have no health insurance. That number is increasing by a \nmillion a year. The number of low-income renters who pay more than half \nof their income for housing or who live in dilapidated housing has \nreached an all-time high--a searing problem in many different parts of \nthe country.\n\n  One of the darker sides of this extraordinary economic boom has been \nthe explosion of the cost of housing, the cost of rent for working \nfamilies. The need for decent, affordable housing for working families \nis prohibitive in so many parts of America. There is very little in \nthis budget that would address that particular need.\n  Low-income families are forced to place thousands of children in \npoor-quality child care while they meet their work responsibilities \nunder the welfare reform. Every State in this country has long lines of \nworking parents who desire to have child care for their children while \nthey continue to work--and work hard--to provide for them.\n  This Republican budget would eliminate our ability to respond to \nthese grave concerns. Make no mistake about it, the spending cuts that \nwould be required to pay for these Republican tax breaks would have \nvery real consequences for the Nation.\n  Compared to the President's budget, Republicans would force the \nfollowing cuts in the next year alone:\n  20 million fewer meals delivered to ill and disabled seniors;\n  2 million fewer uninsured people with access to health care;\n  1.6 million fewer children in quality afterschool programs;\n  750,000 fewer infants receiving nutrition supplements;\n  644,000 fewer at-risk students helped with college preparation;\n  400,000 fewer families assisted with heating costs;\n  152,000 fewer State and Federal law enforcement officers;\n  120,000 fewer housing vouchers for families in poverty;\n  118,000 fewer dislocated workers helped to reenter the workforce;\n  88,000 fewer job opportunities for youth;\n  71,000 fewer college students assisted with Pell grants;\n  62,000 fewer children in Head Start;\n  30,000 fewer children immunized;\n  20,000 fewer elementary school teachers hired to reduce class sizes; \nand\n  11,000 fewer public schools prepared and ready for the 21st century.\n  That is what happens. We talk about a percentage of cuts in existing \nprograms. When you apply those cuts to programs that are targeted for \nthese needy groups, these figures that I have related indicate what the \nresults will be.\n  These are only a small part of the opportunities that will be lost if \nthe Republicans' risky tax cut becomes law. All nondefense \ndiscretionary programs will be cut by an average exceeding the 6 \npercent under the Republican plan. These cuts include meat and poultry \ninspection, Superfund toxic waste cleanups, National Science Foundation \nresearch, the Coast Guard, antidrug efforts, NASA, National Parks, and \nHIV/AIDS treatment and prevention.\n  Republicans have had a long history of cutting needed programs. They \ntried to abolish the Department of Education and the Department of \nEnergy, both of which are essential for addressing today's urgent \nproblems. Last year's GOP resolution also called for a massive cut \nin non-defense discretionary spending. After months of fighting \nDemocrats and further threats of government shutdowns, the Republicans \ngave up their attempt to slash Head Start, education, worker \nprotection, environment, and energy programs. In the end, Democrats \nsucceeded in protecting non-defense discretionary programs from real \ncuts last year. I want to put my Republican friends on notice that, \njust like last year, we will stay here as long as it takes this year to \nensure that the reckless and heartless cuts in this budget resolution \ndo not become law.\n\n  This is not the first, but the fourth, time that Republicans have \ntried and failed to sacrifice domestic investments for tax breaks for \nthe wealthy. So we can anticipate how they'll attempt to avoid the \nconsequences of their actions this time. They'll begin by promising to \nincrease funding for a few programs. They will emphasize only these \nincreases, while neglecting to mention the hundreds of other programs \nthat will be drastically cut. OMB estimates that if Republicans keep \ntheir promises to increase or hold harmless programs in elementary and \nsecondary education, the National Institutes of Health, and veterans' \nhealth, all other non-defense discretionary programs will have to be \ncut by 10 percent.\n  Another Republican gimmick used to conceal their harsh spending cuts \nis to compare spending levels without accounting for inflation. Even \nGeorge W. Bush does not use this tactic. When candidate Bush claimed \nthat spending only increased 2.5 percent during his years as Texas \nGovernor, he accounted not only for inflation, but also for population \ngrowth over this time. If Republicans followed this reasonable \naccounting method, the average domestic discretionary spending cuts \nrequired by Republicans under this budget resolution would far exceed 6 \npercent.\n  After Republicans finish trying to convince us that their spending \ncuts will be painless, we can expect them once again to oppose waste, \nfraud, and abuse. All of us support eliminating waste, fraud, and \nabuse--in defense and non-defense programs alike. But the proponents of \nthis GOP budget resolution are living in a fantasy world if they \nbelieve that preventing waste fraud, and abuse is going to make up for \nanything more than a small fraction of the massive cuts in their budget \nresolution.\n  Thanks in large part to Vice President Gore's leadership in his \nReinventing Government Initiative, the federal government is leaner, \nmore efficient, and more citizen-friendly than ever. If Republicans \nthink they can find $105 billion over 5 years in waste, fraud, and \nabuse, then they should condition their tax cut on finding it. They \nshould not condition the education or health or other priorities on \nabstract, unproved, and never-before-realized savings in waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  The party that gives us this budget resolution is the same party that \nlast year brought us ``smoke and mirrors,'' and untold numbers of \naccounting gimmicks. The Republican bag of tricks is doubtless full \nagain this year, and we need only stay tuned to see how they can make \ntheir numbers add up to protect their tax breaks for the rich.\n  Our Democratic alternative budget is in sharp contrast to the \nRepublican budget resolution. These two alternatives provide Americans \nwith a clear\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\npicture of the opposite directions that the two parties want to take \nthe nation.\n\n  Rather than squandering the surplus on tax breaks for the rich, \nDemocrats continue to strengthen the basic priorities to ensure that \nall Americans can reach their full potential. Not only is this the \nright way to treat our fellow citizens, it is the only sound policy for \nstrengthening the nation's future and maintaining its world leadership. \nOn investments in the nation's future, the differences between \nRepublicans and Democrats are like night and day.\n  I believe that the American people will support our Democratic \nalternative, and will reject the wholesale ravaging of domestic \nprograms proposed by the Republican budget. The Democratic alternative \nsets forth a more balanced and fiscally prudent way to allocate our \nresources. It provides more for debt reduction than the Republican \nbudget. It does not endanger the Social Security surplus, by making \nunrealistic budget assumptions which cannot be met.\n  It provides substantial support to assist senior citizens with the \ncost of prescription drugs, and it sets a firm date for the Finance \nCommittee to act on a prescription drug proposal. The Republican \nprescription drug proposal underfunded, and it is subject to so many \ncontingencies that it is unlikely to ever materialize.\n  The Democratic budget also makes a concrete commitment to \nstrengthening Medicare by reserving a portion of the surplus expressly \nfor Medicare each year. The Republican budget does not. The Democratic \nbudget fully funds the President's requests for education, health care, \nand other domestic priorities, and contains his proposed increase in \ndefense spending. It does not shortchange investment in the vital \ndomestic programs which improve the lives of millions of Americans. \nWhile accomplishing all of these goals, our Democratic plan still is \nable to offer $59 billion in tax cuts over the next 5 years, targeted \nto working families.\n  There is no reason to threaten the well-being of the American people \nby enacting tax cuts far larger than we can afford. The magnitude of \nthe Republican tax cut would deprive us of the flexibility we will \nneed, if revenues do not meet projections due to a slowing in the \neconomy, or if emergency spending is required to address domestic and \ninternational crises.\n  The precarious balance achieved by the Republican budget depends on a \nreduction in the rate of spending on domestic programs which would be \nunprecedented. Congress will not and should not cut domestic priorities \nthat deeply. By setting unrealistically low spending levels, the \nRepublicans actually undermine compliance with the budget process. Just \nas they did last year, members on both sides of the aisle will refuse \nto make the deep domestic cuts called for by the Republican budget. If \nthe surplus has already been used for excessive tax cuts, revenues will \nnot be there to restore funding for these urgent domestic programs.\n  This type of irresponsible budget also jeopardizes the Social \nSecurity surplus. Both parties have pledged to use the Social Security \nsurplus solely to meet Social Security's future needs. That is the \nright thing to do. But, as the events of last year amply demonstrate, \nthe Social Security surplus is threatened when we fail to reserve \nsufficient funds to adequately support domestic priorities and cover \nemergency needs. In fact, CBO determined last fall that the lock box \nprotecting the Social Security surplus was in danger of being broken. \nThe threat was not eliminated until January, when revenue estimates \nincreased beyond earlier projections. If we are serious about \nprotecting the Social Security surplus, we should not consume the \nentire on-budget surplus in tax cuts. These massive tax cuts are \nirresponsible. They do not deserve to pass.\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about protecting the Social Security \nsurplus, we should not consume the entire projected on-budget surplus, \nand these massive tax cuts are irresponsible. They do not deserve to \npass. The Democratic alternative does.\n  Mr. President, the point I was making was that virtually every \neconomist who has come before the Budget Committee or the Finance \nCommittee has told us our highest priority in this budget ought to be \nto pay down the debt. Not only have the economists told us that, but \nChairman Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, has told us that \nclearly and unequivocally.\n  This is from the January 27, 2000, Washington Post, Business Section. \nThe headline is: ``Pay Down the Debt First, Greenspan Urges.'' It \nreads, ``He says the best use of the surplus is to reduce red ink.''\n  I think the Federal Reserve Chairman has it exactly right. In this \nbudget the Democrats will be proposing, we save every penny of Social \nSecurity for Social Security. We put an emphasis and priority on paying \ndown the debt. We also have sufficient resources to protect Medicare, \nto provide prescription drugs, and to make an investment in education, \nwhich I think all of us believe is our future. Also, we provide for a \ntax cut for working families.\n  In the Democratic budget proposal, debt reduction is the highest \npriority. This may come as a surprise to many. Debt reduction is the \npriority of the Democratic budget because this is what will most assure \nour financial security into the future. Over the 10 years of the \nDemocratic budget plan, 82 percent of all the projected surpluses are \ndedicated to debt reduction; debt service is 3 percent; 14 percent is \nfor health initiatives, tax cuts, and other high-priority domestic \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, in looking at the non-Social Security surplus, our \npriorities are as follows: Again, the top priority is given to debt \nreduction--36 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to debt \nreduction; 29 percent to tax cuts; 23 percent to prescription drugs and \nother initiatives; 11 percent to interest costs. We think those are the \nappropriate priorities for the country, the appropriate priorities for \nthe Senate, and the appropriate priorities for the Congress. We very \nmuch hope that people will give close consideration to that alternative \nwhen it is voted on.\n  Let me conclude by again publicly commending the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici. It is not easy to bring a budget \nresolution to the floor. I think there is perhaps no more difficult job \nin the Senate than bringing a budget resolution. Once again, Senator \nDomenici has done it and he has done it under challenging \ncircumstances. It is always challenging to bring a budget resolution to \nthe floor. I commend him for his leadership. I also thank our ranking \nmember, Senator Lautenberg, who has given extraordinary leadership to \nthose of us on the Democratic side.\n  I am proud of the budget alternative we will offer. It is a budget \nthat is in line with the priorities of the American people, which puts \ndebt reduction first, focuses on securing Social Security, extending \nthe solvency of Medicare, and providing for high-priority domestic \nneeds such as defense and education and agriculture, and that also has \nroom for tax cuts targeted to working families with an emphasis on \nincentives for savings. That is one area where we are not doing so well \nin the national economy. We are not doing a good job with savings as a \nsociety. We should provide the incentive for people to save more.\n\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for their \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, although we should be rotating, on our \nside Senator Grams has been willing to have Senator Byrd go next, and \nthen Senator Grams, if that is all right with Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if I may speak for 2 minutes, I don't \nhave any big charts to show you, but I want to put this up. It may be \nthe best way to explain our budget. It is very simple.\n  The non-Social Security surplus total for the years 2001 through 2005 \nis $400 billion. That is the amount of surplus that will be available \nduring the next 5 years, locking up Social Security in a lockbox. Don't \nuse it. That is $400 billion.\n  That $400 billion, as we see it, will be spent using $230 billion for \nnew spending, $150 billion for tax reductions and tax relief and debt \nreduction, with an additional $20 billion to go along with the Social \nSecurity money. That is going toward the debt.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\n  Frankly, the other side will not have a chart such as this because \nthey will assume we have to spend $230 billion to increase every \nfunction of Government, by inflation, for each of the next 5 years, and \nthat it is automatic. They don't call that ``spending,'' they call it \n``automatic.'' Everybody is entitled to that.\n  We start with a real zero. We start with no growth and say how much \nwe put back. We put back $230 billion. If my arithmetic is right, that \nis about $46 billion a year of new money appropriated.\n  In addition to what we are already spending to start with, we are \nalready spending this amount. There is $46 billion more a year for each \nyear. That comes out of this surplus.\n  We have tax relief of $150 billion, which is only $13 billion in the \nfirst year, and then we have an extra $20 billion going on the debt.\n  I think that is a pretty fair approach. In fact, Democrats keep \nsaying they are doing what the American people want. I think if the \nAmerican people understand ours--and they will--they will say that is \nplenty of new spending; some of this overpayment we ought to get back. \nThat is what we provide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it has been said that the more things \nchange, the more they stay the same. We are warned by the American \nphilosopher George Santayana (1863-1952) that, ``those who cannot \nremember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' Those words of warning, \nI think, are appropriate to have in mind as the Senate debates the \nFiscal Year 2001 Budget Resolution.\n  It was less than two decades ago that the Nation inaugurated a new \nPresident, who campaigned on a pledge to cut taxes, cut federal \nspending except for defense, and pay down the Federal debt. The so-\ncalled ``Reagan Revolution'' was based on the supply-side economic \nideology that massive tax cuts would generate large increases in \nrevenues to the Federal Treasury, sufficient to allow a large build-up \nin military spending; while, at the same time, balancing the Federal \nbudget. That was the blueprint--the budgetary plan of the Reagan-Bush \nAdministration. To be sure, there were those who doubted that this \nsupply-side program would achieve the results that were projected in \nthe Reagan-Bush budget. Indeed, during his campaign against Reagan for \nthe GOP nomination, Mr. Bush called Reagan's supply-side economic plan \n``voodoo economics.'' Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker called the \nReagan-Bush budget blueprint a ``riverboat gamble.''\n  Despite those ominous warnings in 1981, Congress did enact a massive \ntax cut, and Congress increased the military budget. But, entitlement \nspending continued to grow, while projected increases in revenues did \nnot materialize. As a result, the Reagan-Bush Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, David Stockman, resorted to what amounted to \n``cooking the books'' in the annual Reagan-Bush budgets. Mr. Stockman, \nI believe, was the person who came up with the strategy, later termed \n``Rosy Scenario'' to describe the fanciful budget forecasts during his \nservice as OMB Director.\n  As a result of those budgetary policies, rather than being able to \npay down the federal debt, or even to reduce deficit spending, the \ntwelve Reagan-Bush years brought the Nation the largest annual deficits \nin its history and, consequently, the Federal debt grew to levels that \nendangered the Nation's economic prosperity.\n  In fact, as this chart entitled ``National Debt'' shows, on the day \nthat Mr. Reagan was sworn into office on January 20, 1981, the national \ndebt stood at $932 billion. As Mr. Reagan alluded in his State of the \nUnion Address that year, it would take a 63-mile high stack of one \ndollar bills to equal $932 billion.\n  That $932 billion represented the debt that had been accumulated \nthrough all of the previous administrations from George Washington's \nadministration, the first administration, on down through those years.\n  What was the fiscal health of the Nation when this supply-side fiscal \nconservative, President Reagan left office? As shown on the chart, on \nJanuary 20, 1989, the day that Mr. Reagan left office and Mr. Bush was \nsworn in to succeed him, the Nation's debt was some two trillion, six \nhundred and eighty three billion dollars. It took the Nation over 200 \nyears to get to $1 trillion in national debt. It took the Reagan-Bush \nAdministration just 8 years to nearly triple the national debt--from \n$932 billion on the day Mr. Reagan took office to $2.683 trillion on \nthe day he left office.\n  Let me say that again. From $932 billion on the day that Mr. Reagan \ntook office to $2.683 trillion on the day he left office.\n  In other words, the stack of $1 bills, which was supposed to be 63 \nmiles high, as Mr. Reagan spoke to a nationally televised audience, an \naccumulation through all of the administrations prior to the Reagan \nadministration--that stack of $1 bills he portrayed very vividly, I \nrecall, as being 63 miles high--on the day he left office, that stack \nof $1 bills would be 182 miles into the stratosphere.\n  Then, we had the Bush-Quayle Administration for the next four years. \nDid that Administration make progress in reducing deficit spending and \nbegin to pay down the national debt? Unfortunately, such was not the \ncase. The national debt just kept right on going. It was as if someone \nwere feeding it growth hormones! The debt reached over $4 trillion by \nthe time Mr. Bush was voted out of office and President Clinton was \nsworn in on January 20, 1993.\n  That stack of $1 bills then as represented by the national debt would \nhave been 277 miles high. In other words, it had grown from 63 miles \nhigh at the beginning of the Reagan administration to 277 miles high at \nthe end of the Reagan-Bush administration.\n  Supporters of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, over the years, \nhave attempted to lay the blame for this massive increase in debt at \nthe doorstep of Congress, claiming that Congress holds the purse \nstrings. I have two responses. First, during the first 6 of the 8 years \nof the Reagan Presidency, the Republicans were in the Majority in the \nUnited States Senate. Second, during the entire 12 years of the Reagan \nand Bush Administrations, only a handful of times did President Reagan \nveto an appropriations bill for containing too much funding; and \nPresident Bush did not do so even once. Furthermore, the total of all \nthe appropriations bills during the 12 years of the Reagan/Bush and \nBush/Quayle Presidencies amounted to more than $60 billion in cuts \nbelow the budget requests of both Presidents.\n  Since the Presidencies of Reagan and Bush, the fiscal condition of \nthe Nation has greatly improved, for a myriad of reasons. Among those \nare the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, and the great \nincreases in productivity of the American workforce and in our \nindustries. Some of the credit, I believe, can also rightly be \nattributed to the Federal budgetary policies of the past several years. \nThe deficit reduction packages of 1990, 1993, and 1997 set out very \nstringent targets on Federal spending, which helped reduce deficits to \nthe point that in 1998, we enjoyed the first unified budget surplus in \n30 years--a surplus of $69 billion.\n  Both of the latest OMB and Congressional Budget Office forecasts \nproject huge federal budget surpluses far into the future. The CBO now \nprojects unified budget surpluses ranging from $3.2 trillion to more \nthan $4.2 trillion, over the next 10 years, depending on spending \nlevels under various scenarios.\n  Of those 10-year surpluses, some $2.3 trillion will be generated by \ncontributions into the Social Security Trust Fund, in excess of the \npayments to retirees over the period of Fiscal Years 2001-2010. There \nis virtually unanimous agreement that any and all Social Security \nsurpluses over the next 10 years should go toward reducing the national \ndebt, rather than being spent. This means that, if CBO's projections \nturn out to be correct, the national debt would go down by more than $2 \ntrillion over the next 10 fiscal years.\n  The question, then, is what to do with any remaining, or non-Social \nSecurity surpluses over the next 10 years. Should we cut spending \nfurther; should we maintain spending at current levels; or should we \nincrease spending? Should we use some of the non-Social Security \nsurpluses to pay down the debt, and perhaps even eliminate the publicly \nheld debt by 2031? Or, should we enact\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nhuge tax cuts that eat up all of the projected non-Social Security \nsurpluses?\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Budget Resolution now before the \nSenate, as was the case last year, chooses the worst possible fiscal \ncourse for the Nation. This Budget Resolution proposes a huge tax cut, \nwhich would drain the Treasury of more than $150 billion over the next \n5 years, and could easily cost in excess of $800 billion over the next \n10 years. Combining that size tax cut with the resulting increase in \ninterest payments on the debt that it would cost, could drain the \nTreasury of as much as $950 billion over 10 years. That figure is \nlarger than the total $893 billion in non-Social Security surpluses \nthat CBO has projected for the next 10 years.\n  What that means is that, in order to pay for the tax cut in this \nfiscal blueprint, we will either have to go back to deficit spending, \nor raid the Social Security Trust Fund. That is assuming the CBO \nprojected surpluses actually occur. Is that likely? What has been the \nrecord of CBO projections in the past? Have their projections been \nfairly close to what actually occurred? The answer is ``no.'' Not so \nclose as to enact tax cuts that would use up all of the CBO projected \nsurpluses, and then some. In fact, over the period of 1980 through \n1998, the CBO projections of revenues contained in budget resolutions \nwere off by an absolute average of $38 billion per year! Over 5 years, \nthat is $190 billion, Similarly, the CBO's deficit projections erred by \nan absolute average of $54 billion per year over the period of 1980-\n1998.\n  Like last year, the tax cuts proposed in this budget resolution are \nunwise in the extreme. The American people won't buy this plan. They \nare not clamoring for tax cuts. The American people have learned that \nlocking in huge tax cuts before the money to pay for them has \nmaterialized is just plain, old, common, country gambling. They want to \nmake sure that the money is there before we mandate huge tax cuts. The \npeople don't wont to go back into debt, with the interest charged to \nthem.\n  Now, let's turn to discretionary spending. That's the portion of the \nFederal budget that is funded in the annual appropriations bills. \nDiscretionary appropriations amount to about one-third of the Federal \nbudget and include spending for Defense, as well as a wide array of \ndomestic investments, including education, health, veterans' medical \ncare, highway and airport construction, parks and recreation, the FBI \nand other law enforcement agencies, water projects, environmental \nprograms, Head Start, and the operational costs of all of the \ndepartments and agencies of the Executive Branch, as well as those of \nthe Legislative Branch and the Judiciary. These are the programs that \nsupport the physical and human infrastructure of this Nation.\n  What is being proposed for the discretionary portion of the budget in \nthis Budget Resolution? As this chart shows, this budget plan would \nincrease spending for the military by $24 billion above what is \nrequired to maintain current levels, over the next five years. For all \nother discretionary spending, this budget plan would cut $105 billion, \nor 6.5%, over the next 5 years below what is needed to maintain current \nservices, adjusted for inflation.\n  To get right to the point, let's look at what is being proposed in \nthis Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2001. That is the fiscal year \nwhich will begin on October 1 of this year. This budget proposes budget \nauthority totaling $597 billion for discretionary programs for the \nupcoming fiscal year. That is a cut of $10 billion below what will be \nneeded to maintain this year's discretionary spending levels, adjusted \nfor inflation.\n  It would take $607 billion just to keep up with inflation and avoid \nreal cuts in discretionary spending for Fiscal Year 2001; only $597 \nbillion is allowed in this budget resolution. Of that amount, what is \nallowed for Defense? The CBO tells us it would take $298 billion in \nbudget authority to maintain this year's level of Defense spending. \nBut, the Budget Resolution before the Senate would provide $307 \nbillion--a real increase of $9 billion above what it would take to \nmaintain this year's level of Defense spending, adjusted for inflation.\n  For all other discretionary programs, CBO says it would take $309 \nbillion in budget authority to maintain this year's spending levels. \nThis resolution provides only $290 billion, a cut of $19 billion in \nbudget authority. Yet, at the same time, the budget resolution promises \nto increase funding for education, veterans' health care, and other \npopular initiatives. This means that all of the other unprotected \nprograms will have to be cut even more in order to accommodate the \nprotected ones.\n  What does that mean in real terms? For an example, let's take a look \nat national crime-fighting programs. According to the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the Senate Budget Resolution does not appear to \nprovide any funds for the hiring of additional police officers, or for \ncommunity crime-prevention programs. For the Coast Guard, this budget \nresolution would severely impact their ability to carry out their \nmissions in the areas of drug interdiction, national security, and \nfisheries enforcement.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, funding for education would be cut by \nmore than $5 billion below the President's request in Fiscal Year 2001. \nThis would require cuts of some 62,000 children from Head Start; and it \nwould make it impossible to hire some 20,000 additional teachers for \npublic schools or provide urgent repairs for some 5,000 schools across \nthe Nation.\n  For Science, a reduction of this magnitude would result in more than \n19,000 fewer researchers; educators and student receiving support from \nthe National Science Foundation. It would appear that a lot of this \nrhetoric about protecting education is just that--rhetoric.\n  Is it realistic to suggest that the Nation's important domestic \ninvestment needs will be cut by almost $20 billion this year? Is that \nwhat we want to propose to the American people? I do not support any \nsuch proposition. To follow this budget plan will mean endorsing large \npermanent tax cuts, based on budget surplus projections which may or \nmay not come to pass. If the tax cuts are enacted, they will be real. \nThey will be in law. But, the money to pay for them may be only a \nfigment of the forecasters' imaginations. The result may make it a \nvirtual certainty that this flawed budget plan would lead the Nation, \nonce again, down the road of annual triple-digit billion dollar \ndeficits. We slew that gremlin after the twelve Reagan-Bush years. Let \nus heed the warning of Santayana and not condemn ourselves and the \nAmerican people to repeat those failed policies. Let the evil, bloated \ndeficit monster sleep.\n\n  If we follow the plan before us today, we will probably see another \nin a series of session-ending omnibus appropriations negotiations with \nthe White House. Such a process demeans the Congress, elevates the \nExecutive, and allows the President's aides to sit at the table and \nbecome instant appropriators while Congress completes its \nappropriators' work. That process always reminds me of a high stakes \npoker game--``I'll see your veterans' programs and raise you five \nbillion more for defense.'' Unfortunately, it is often the American \ntaxpayer who ends up the loser. I implore my colleagues to reject this \nBudget Resolution. Let's get off this treadmill to nowhere. We should \nnot give tax cuts with money we don't yet have, and may never have. To \ndo so is like writing checks before the money is firmly in the bank.\n  In recent testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his longstanding view \nthat, ``The most effective means of raising the level of future \nresources, in my judgment, is to allow the budget surpluses projected \nin the coming years to be used to pay down the Nation's debt.'' I agree \nwith Mr. Greenspan in that statement. We should adequately invest in \nour Nation's infrastructure needs and use the balance of future \nsurpluses to pay down the Federal debt, thereby enhancing the ability \nof the Nation to be in the position to meet the future needs of both \nSocial Security and Medicare. The American people, I believe, recognize \nthe wisdom of such an approach. They instinctively realize that massive \ntax cuts at this time, based on flimsy projections and on promises to \ncut spending far below levels that could sustain the economy into the \n21st century, are precisely the opposite of sound fiscal policy. The \nAmerican people will not buy these Disney World policies anymore. They \nexpect a fair deal in budgeting, and\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\nthis Senate should, as well. To fail to do so would amount to deja-voo-\ndoo all over again!\n  I yield the floor. I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota \nfor yielding to me.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon \nto talk, not of the budget in general but about a particular part of \nthe budget. I wish to speak in support of the amendment of Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison of Texas. I commend her efforts and leadership on a \nvery important issue; that is, the marriage penalty tax that is part of \nthis overall budget. I know we are still working on an agreement \ndealing with this amendment but, because of other commitments, I wanted \nto take time to come to the floor and speak on this issue, the marriage \npenalty tax, a little bit out of order. I want to at least voice my \nstrong support for the issue. I support, strongly, the elimination of \nthe marriage penalty entirely and I believe that Congress should pass \nthis legislation and we should do it as quickly and as early as \npossible.\n  There is compelling reason to repeal the marriage penalty tax: The \nfamily has been and will continue to be the bedrock of our society. \nStrong families makes strong communities; strong communities make for a \nstrong America. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax treats \nmarried couples unfairly. Even President Clinton agrees that the \nmarriage penalty is unfair, although he said--well, we just can't help \nit; we need the money here in Washington.\n  If we do not get rid of this bad tax policy that discourages \nmarriage, millions of married couples will be forced to pay more taxes \nsimply for choosing to commit to a family through marriage.\n  In fact, the Tax Code contains 66 provisions that can affect a \nmarried couple's tax liability.\n  Let me give a real example of how average Americans have been hit by \nthe marriage penalty. Newly wedded Alicia Jones from my state of \nMinnesota and her husband graduated from college and had just begun \nworking full-time 2 years ago. In 1998, Alicia and her husband both \nworked full time in professional careers. They had no children and were \nrenting an apartment, saving to buy a house. They had to pay at least \nan additional $1,400 for simply being married. As a result, on top of \nthe over $10,000 tax they already paid, they had to take an additional \n$700 from their limited savings account to pay for Federal taxes--taxes \nthat they wouldn't have had to pay if they weren't married.--The \nmarriage penalty.\n  She wrote to me:\n\n       I am frustrated by this, I'm frustrated for the future--how \n     do we get ahead, when each year we have to take money from \n     our savings to pay more for our taxes. I hope that you will \n     remember my concern.\n\n  Alicia's story is not uncommon. There were 21 million American \nfamilies in the same situation.\n  A 1997 study by the Congressional Budget Office entitled For Better \nor Worse: Marriage and the Federal Income Tax, estimated 21 million \ncouples or 42 percent of couples incurred marriage penalties in 1996. \nThis means 42 million individuals paid $1,400 more in tax than if they \nare divorced, or were living together. It has grown to even more in the \nyear 2000.\n  But marriage penalties can run much higher than that. Under the \ncurrent tax laws, a married couple could face a Federal tax bill that \nis more than $20,000 higher than the amount they would pay if they were \nnot married.\n  This is extremely unfair. This was not the intention of Congress when \nit created the marriage penalty tax in the 1960s by separating tax \nschedules for married and unmarried people.\n  The marriage penalty is most unfair to married couples who are both \nworking, it is discriminative against low-income families and is biased \nagainst working women.\n  The trend shows that more couples under age 55 are working and the \nearnings between husbands and wives are more evenly divided since 1969. \nAs a result, more and more couples have received, and will continue to \nreceive, marriage penalties and fewer couples benefit under the Tax \nCode.\n  The marriage penalty creates a second-earner bias against married \nwomen under the Federal tax system. The bias occurs because the income \nof the secondary earner is stacked on top of the primary earner's \nincome. As a result, the secondary earner's income may be taxed at a \nrelatively higher marginal tax rate. In many cases it even forces the \nwhole family budget into a higher tax bracket so the whole family faces \nthis marriage penalty. Married women are often the victims of the \nsecond-earner bias.\n  As more and more women go to work today, their added incomes drive \ntheir households into higher tax brackets. In fact, women who return to \nthe work force after raising their kids face a 50 percent tax rate--not \nmuch of an incentive to work.\n  The marriage penalty tax has discouraged women from marriage. It even \nhas led some married couples to get friendly divorces. They continue to \nlive together, but save on their taxes.\n  Repealing the marriage penalty will allow American families to keep \nan average of $1,400 more each year of their own money to pay for \nhealth insurance, groceries, child care, or other family necessities.\n  This is what we hear all the time, whenever we want to cut a tax or \nreduce the tax burden on average Americans--it is a windfall for the \nrich. No one else is going to benefit. This is completely false. The \nfact is, the elimination of the injustice of the marriage penalty will \nprimarily benefit minority, low- and middle-class families. Studies \nsuggest the marriage penalty hits African-Americans and lower-income \nworking families hardest.\n  Couples at the bottom end of the income scale who incur penalties \npaid an average of nearly $800 in additional taxes which represented 8 \npercent of their income. Eight percent, Mr. President. Repeal the \npenalty, and those low-income families will immediately have an 8 \npercent increase in their income. They would be able to keep it to \nspend on what their families need, rather than shipping it off to \nWashington.\n  It is unfair to continue marriage penalty tax. It is time now to end \nit. I strongly support Senator Hutchison of Texas and her efforts to \nrepeal the marriage penalty too. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I need.\n  I was here for most of Senator Byrd's remarks. I do not choose to \ndiscuss the history of 10, 12, or 14 years ago. That does not mean \nthere is not a different version to his well charted speech. There is \nanother version.\n  All I want to talk about is right now and what we plan and how we see \nthings a little differently in terms of what we are going to do with \nthe surplus that does not belong to Social Security.\n  Remember that we already have established a new dynamic, and it is \nprobably a very salutary one and maybe, as the Federal Reserve Chairman \nhas said, the most significant fiscal policy change if we follow \nthrough for a decade or so. That is, if all of the Social Security \nsurplus goes to debt service, that means we do not spend it and the \ndebt owed to the public that we have out there in Treasury bills that \nbanks have bought, that countries have bought, that we really have to \npay interest on every year, all this money from Social Security reduces \nthat.\n  I believe when the President suggested we only save 62 percent of the \nSocial Security surplus, that was the first time we ever invented and \nused the budget for longer than 5 years. He wanted to do 10 years then. \nAlmost everyone thought: How in the world will we do 15 years, and why? \nI can tell my colleagues why.\n  One starts with a proposition that if we only put 62 percent of the \nSocial Security money into a fund that belongs to Social Security, we \nhave to tell the American people that sooner or later we are going to \npay all the Social Security money back. It took 15 years to do that. It \njust happened almost miraculously. So the President drew up a 15-year \nbudget. After the fifth year, it was pretty irrelevant. In the 7th, \n10th, 14th, and 15th years, it got to be speculative. Nevertheless, it \nkept showing a very big and increasing surplus.\n  I got the idea, as all of us heard the 62-percent speech, why not 100 \npercent? I am very proud that as to the new dynamic to which I was just \nalluding, that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve says is positive \nthinking and a positive approach to the future, I said\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nwhy not 100 percent of the Social Security fund? Then we thought up the \nidea of a Social Security lockbox. Whether one likes the lockbox or \nnot, it is pretty descriptive. We make it darn hard to get the money \nout of the lockbox. We put it in there every year.\n  This budget does that again. For the next 5 years, it says every \npenny of Social Security surplus goes to the debt; it cannot be used \nfor anything of a general government nature. That turns out to be a \nvery large number. I will give you the number in just a moment.\n  Believe it or not, for the next 5 years, in addition to that big \nnumber, the surplus that goes to Social Security, there is another big \nnumber, and it is a surplus that does not belong in Social Security. I \nshare with the Senate and with my friend, Senator Byrd, how big the on-\nbudget surplus is, that which does not belong to Social Security. It is \n$400 billion over the next 5 years--$400 billion.\n  The point is, we are deciding what ought to happen to that $400 \nbillion. The Democrats would say there really isn't $400 billion--I am \nnot saying where Senator Byrd would be, but I think his speech \nindicates this is a fair statement. They would say there isn't $400 \nbillion because, each of the years, all of the accounts of Government \nmust grow by inflation. They say anything above that--that is, $171 \nbillion--is all that would be left over out of the $400 billion if you \ngive every account in Government an inflation increase every year.\n\n  We said that is not quite what we think the American people want to \nmeasure us by. So we said: Let's start at zero. Let's not have any \nadditions, and then let's go to the $400 billion and put it back in the \nbudget and put it back in other places. What we did, I say to my good \nfriend, Senator Byrd, is we put $230 billion of that $400 billion back \ninto the domestic and defense accounts.\n  That may not be enough for some, and who knows, the prediction that \nbefore we are finished it will not be enough, I do not know about that. \nBut to get the votes to bring a budget to the floor, there is \nessentially $230 billion in new money on top of inflation divided by 5, \nwhich is $46 billion a year--if one does it on an average--$46 billion \nthat we can add to the freeze and see where it turns out.\n  We think it turns out with almost a 6-percent growth in defense \nspending this first year and almost 4-percent real growth in the \nappropriated accounts--I should say growth in each instance. We do \nthat, and there is some money left over.\n  Frankly, we believe that money ought to be looked at very carefully \nbecause it is the American people who are overpaying their taxes. That \nis why we have a surplus. We decided that over the whole 5 years we \nwould provide a tax reduction of $150 billion, spread out over 5 years. \nIn the first year, it is $13 billion.\n  Do my colleagues know how much the debt reduction is in the first \nyear? It is $174 billion. What is the ratio? It is $13 billion in debt \nreduction for $1 of tax relief.\n\n  Would the American people say: That's unfair? We ought to spend more \nof that money? We said: Over the full 5 years, the debt of the American \npeople will be reduced by $1.1 trillion--a huge reduction. We put that \nalongside of $150 billion in tax relief; and the ratio, over the 5 \nyears, is $8 in debt reduction for $1 in tax relief--a pretty fair \nratio.\n  The whole difference is, when you have $400 billion in surplus, what \nshould you do with it? Some would say: Inflate every account of \nGovernment by the rate of inflation for each of the next 5 years, and \ndon't even worry about that. They say: You make that automatic.\n  We do not make it automatic. We add back each year. As I indicated, \nif you did it, on average, you could almost add $50 billion a year to a \nbase of about $500 billion. That is the combined defense and \nnondefense. That is pretty good.\n  Will it be tough? Of course, it will be tough because in the last 5 \nyears, the tendency was to significantly reduce expenditures in the \nfirst 3 years of that 5 years, and then in the last 2 years to start \nspending it, maybe a 7-percent or 8-percent or 6.5-percent-per-year \nincrease.\n  I close by saying there is a stark difference between the President \nof the United States and the Republicans. Believe it or not, the \nPresident of the United States would increase domestic discretionary \nspending in the first year--the year for which we are doing the budget, \nnext year--by 14 percent.\n  The 14 percent includes inflation, plus a whole bunch more. In fact, \nthat is the biggest increase since one of the years of President Jimmy \nCarter when there was super inflation.\n  We say that is too much. In fact, they say there is something bad \nabout $150 billion in tax cuts. But I say, if there is anything that is \nrisky, it is to spend the surplus. A 14-percent-a-year increase, if \nkept for 3 years, will spend the entire non-Social Security surplus, \nand we will start using up some of the Social Security surplus. Just \nthink of that.\n  Why does the President offer $14 billion in 1 year? In fact, I do not \neven think his loyal minority on the Democrat side has anything like a \n14-percent increase in mind. He does because it is an election year, \nand you get to do it one time on your way out the door; the next \nadministration has to live with what you have left.\n  But we decided not to do that. We decided we would do it the way we \njust described: $230 billion in spending over a freeze for the next 5 \nyears, $150 billion in tax relief, and an extra $20 billion in debt \nreduction besides the Social Security money.\n  Frankly, why would the President offer such a huge increase in the \nlast year of his Presidency? I would think one of two things is \npossible: It is a political budget. He would like to make hay out of \nbean for almost everything or, secondly, he really thinks that is what \nwe ought to spend.\n  I do not know that there is any other reason in between. If he thinks \nit is what we ought to spend, then he ought to stop saying we will not \nspend Social Security money because you cannot increase the budget 14 \npercent a year and not use Social Security money.\n  What I know is, we have sound fiscal policy today for which a lot of \npeople can take credit. There are a lot of things which happened that \ncaused it to be this way. But it surely is not solely and significantly \nbecause the President offered a proposal that all of his party voted \nfor, and we did not, to raise taxes $195 billion. That happened. \nClearly, that cannot be the singular item that caused this 7 years of \ngrowth.\n\n  In fact, we are very proud that once the Congress became Republican \nwe started really reducing the amount of Federal expenditures per year, \nyear after year. We made a bipartisan deal in 1997 of which we are very \nproud. It reduced all parts of Government significantly, including some \nentitlements that we are going back and looking at, such as Medicaid, \nMedicare, and home health care.\n  So that, plus the Federal Reserve Board acting prudently--I do not \nknow whether the last increases in the interest rate are as prudent as \nthe previous ones by the Federal Reserve Board Chairman, but he and his \nBoard deserve ample credit for this fantastic growth. But ultimately \nthe growth is because we turned loose American innovation. They changed \nthings. They brought equipment and technology into the marketplace that \nsaves human effort by the thousands of hours per week per business. \nThus, more profit is made and more pay can be made. The gross domestic \nproduct can grow without inflation. That is where we are today.\n  We think our budget will keep us there. We think it is too risky to \nspend more money, especially when we have provided more than \nadequately, with some discretion to pick and choose between accounts of \nGovernment.\n  The approach of allowing inflation to be added to every account, and \nthat unless you start with that you are cutting something, is an \nacknowledgement that every one of the 2,800 programs of America--some \n30 years old, some 40 years old, some in the Education Department that \nthe Presiding Officer has seen as duplicative, where there are 20 or 30 \nof the same kind--deserve an increase equally and none deserve to be \nrestrained.\n  We say many of them should be abolished. If that is what it takes the \nappropriators to do to live within these numbers, that would be pretty \ngood for America.\n  Those are my observations. I do not know that we are going to be able \nto\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\nreach an agreement on amendments. But I am going to now ask the \ndistinguished minority leader what he would like to do next, and we \nwill proceed.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the manager of the bill for the majority, our \nmanager wishes to speak on the bill some more.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. Perhaps during that time we can work something out as to \nthe order of amendments. We have already worked on that. We will see \nwhat we can do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take a moment for those who \nmay be wanting to take a look at the Budget Committee Democrats' new \nweb site--I do not know how rapidly people can write down the address, \nbut here it is in full colored splendor: http://budget.senate.gov/\ndemocratic.\n  That is the address. We know people will immediately run, in large \nnumbers, to see what is being said there.\n  At the site they will see a summary of the budget resolution, the \nDemocratic alternative, background on the budget process, links to \nother budget-related information, presented on a colorful chart. We \neven provide a budget quiz for those who want to test their perception \nof what we are doing. We will also be maintaining a mailing list for \nthose people who want to stay up to date about budget matters.\n  Please take a look, if you will, at the address. Once again, we will \nprovide it in case people want to jot it down. I need not read it. I \nthink it is visible. They ought to be able to contact Democratic Budget \nCommittee members. I thank Rock Cheung of our staff for doing such a \ngreat job in putting that web page together.\n  I now wish to talk about something that has troubled me, something \nthat, frankly, I do not understand. But to put it simply, there was a \nchange from the budget resolution--if I might have the attention of the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  I want to point out the fact that there was a change from the budget \nresolution as passed by the committee by a majority vote--a change in \nnumbers, which is hardly allowable, and certainly not acceptable--after \nthe committee deliberation, after the committee passed the bill, after \nthe committee presented it to the Senate body, as we see it now. To \nmake a change in the numbers--whether it is small or large doesn't \nmatter, but the process is not allowed, as I understand it, by virtue \nof rule XXVI. I want to point out that this resolution is not the same, \nand it was not only a technical change but, rather, it is dramatically \ndifferent. It was changed after our markup, after we all sat around and \nvoted; some voted for it and some voted against it. It is a change to \nthe tune of $60 billion in lower spending in each of the fiscal years \n2001 and 2002.\n  There was a reason this was done, Mr. President. While it is \nunderstandable, it is not acceptable to change it after the markup, \nafter the contract is signed, essentially. If a contract is signed and \nsomebody decides let's change the terms of the contract, that would be \nunacceptable in a business structure. As a matter of fact, it would \nengender a lawsuit in very easy fashion if it were done in the business \nworld. This was done to avoid a point of order against the resolution.\n  Whenever we talk in this arcane language around here, I believe we \nneed to spell it out. What we are saying to those who don't work here \non a regular basis is that instead of 51 votes, you need 60 votes if \nyou want to make a change. Well, in other words, if there is a call for \na waiver of the budget, it falls to one side or the other to get 51 \nvotes, which can easily be accomplished by the majority because they \nhave 55 Members. But it doesn't include any of the Democrats. While \nnone of the Democrats voted to move this bill, nevertheless we don't \ngive up our proprietorship on what goes out of there. No Senator does. \nNo Senator gives up their rights without respect for the rule.\n  This is not appropriate. It is a terrible precedent for the Senate as \na whole. When a bill passes out of a committee, it must carry the same \nmessage when it arrives on the Senate floor. It ought not be changed on \nthat short trip from the Dirksen Building to this building. It is \ncalled a technical modification. We saw initially that $4.4 billion \nworth of additions were going to be made. When we finally got it here, \nit was almost a $60 billion cut from programs. It went into a catchall \ncategory that can then be distributed. It was $60 billion. So we are \nlooking at something bordering on a 10-percent shift without the \npublic, frankly, being aware of it.\n  Under the Budget Act, there is a point of order against any budget \nresolution that exceeds the discretionary spending caps. It is very \nclear this budget resolution is intended to break those caps. In fact, \nit says so in section 209, on page 41 of the budget resolution. I will \nread directly from that subsection:\n\n       The functional totals with respect to discretionary \n     spending set forth in this concurrent resolution, if \n     implemented, would result in legislation which exceeds the \n     limit on discretionary spending for the fiscal year set out \n     in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  That is a quote from the budget resolution itself. In effect, it says \nthat we are breaking the caps and the spending limits as modified in \n1997. In fact, when the Budget Committee approved this resolution, it \ndid break the caps, just as it claimed it did. It told the truth. But a \nfunny thing happened on the way to this forum--the difference between \nthe close of the markup and arrival on the floor of the Senate. As if \nby magic, the spending totals were changed dramatically so that they no \nlonger break the caps. The changes were made to what we call function \n920 and left completely unspecified, just thrown in there. This is a \ncatchall. But when it has to be distributed--and it does--then it will \nhit all of the categories for which we appropriate. I am talking about \na significant change.\n\n  When the committee approved the resolution, the total for function \n920, as indicated on the chart, was $4.4 billion in budget authority. \nIn fact, if you look at the committee report--on page 38 and again on \npage 50--that is what it says: $4.4 billion in budget authority.\n  Budget authority means that which we are allowed by law to spend. \nThat is what the committee approved. Now, when we look at the \nresolution before us, which is claimed to be the same, the one approved \nby the Budget Committee, on page 27, line 7, it says that the total for \nfunction 920 is negative $59.931 billion. So in the fiscal year 2001--\nthe one we are preparing the budget for--the resolution includes $59.9 \nbillion in unspecified cuts. But the Budget Committee, I remind you \nagain, only approved $4.4 billion in such cuts for the fiscal year \nbeginning October 1.\n  If you look at fiscal year 2002, the same type of thing happened. The \ncommittee approved a plan this time that had no budget authority for \nfunction 920. That means they weren't allowing any expenditure, \npositive or negative--well, you can't have negative expenditures, but \nreductions in the account--in fiscal 2002. Now we have a resolution \nbefore us that has $59.729 billion in negative budget authority--\nunspecified cuts that appeared, seemingly, out of thin air.\n  I have to ask, What is happening here? Well, obviously, the majority \nis making huge cuts in order to claim they are abiding by the \ndiscretionary spending caps, so that they can avoid a point of order \nand then the need to get 60 votes. They can't get 60 and they know \nthat.\n  I don't criticize them for exceeding the caps. But they are wrong to \nhide this back-room change to pretend they are not breaking the caps. \nThat is not being honest with the Senate or the American people.\n  The fact is, under the Budget Act--which I negotiated with Senator \nDomenici in 1997--it is supposed to take 60 votes to break the caps. \nThat is the law. Yes, it gives the minority, or at least a few of the \nMembers of the minority, a little bit of leverage. It means the \nRepublicans are supposed to seek some Democratic votes to approve their \nbudget resolution.\n  But instead of playing by the rules, the majority today is flouting \nthem. They are trying to have it both ways--breaking the caps, but then \npretending in the resolution that they are not doing that, all to avoid \ngiving the minority a say in this resolution. I think it is wrong that \nwe are here today considering a resolution that isn't the one approved \nby the Budget Committee; it is a different resolution.\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\n  At the end of a budget markup, the staff is given the right to make \ntechnical changes. That is not unusual, and I don't object to that. But \nby cutting spending by $60 billion a year, they are eliminating the \nprospect that this could be a technical change. I know some people \naround here are used to sloughing off a few million dollars here and \nthere. But $60 billion in a year? Even here that is a large sum of \nmoney. That doesn't just sidestep the rules; in my opinion, it goes \nover the line. I am going to ask the Parliamentarian now whether or not \nthere are prohibitions to changing a Committee-passed resolution or \nbill without consulting the committee before it is presented to the \nfloor for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Rule XXVI requires a quorum to report out a \nmeasure, and it is not in order to change a measure once reported.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the \nParliamentarian.\n  All this then, as I see it, is designed to deny the minority the \nright to participate meaningfully in this debate and hide the facts \nfrom the American people.\n  Anytime the Senator from New Mexico has a question, I am happy to \nanswer; or shall I finish what I am doing?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sure. The Senator may finish his speech. I am \ngoing to make my point as to why it is in order, if the Senator from \nNew Jersey is talking about this.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Shall I finish?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am going to have more to say later \nabout the breakdown of the budget process and what I consider the abuse \nof the minority rights.\n  I personally believe the exclusion of the minority through the budget \nresolution and reconciliation process is one reason the whole budget \nprocess is in such a difficult mess, and it largely explains why we \nhave these terrible train wrecks and huge omnibus bills at the end of \neach fiscal year.\n  Be that as it may, I would be happy, before I leave this place, to \nhave a series of discussions with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle about what maybe we can do to get the fiscal year kicked off in a \nproper fashion with the budget, and as we should do with the Budget \nCommittee.\n  But that is not for the moment because that doesn't have anything to \ndo with the $60 billion per year ``technical change'' being simply \nwrong. I think it is an abuse of the committee process. It is not fair \nto the minority. Frankly, it does raise a bit of a sad commentary on \nthe whole budget process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am just without words about such an \nargument that we did something really wrong. We did nothing wrong. The \nstaff of the minority had an invention in their mind. They kept it \nquiet.\n  Have you ever hunted quail? You know that they spread after you \nshoot. They hunker down and hide and don't want anybody to hear them.\n  They had in mind knocking this whole budget resolution out because of \nthis issue right here. If we had not made the technical change that is \nin this resolution, indeed, they would have made the whole thing die \nand we wouldn't have a budget resolution.\n  Let me tell you, their budget resolution would fail on the same \ngrounds. The President's would fail on the same grounds. And the truth \nof the matter is that I sought and received, with a quorum present \nbefore the final vote, unanimous consent to make technical amendments. \nI asked for that. I received consent. And the technical changes are \nvery clear. The language of the chairman's mark made it clear that the \ncaps would be met. That is $540 billion, and an adjustment would be \nmade of nearly $60 billion. We don't cut anything. We say the first \nappropriations bill will lift the caps, and a $60 billion fund that is \nin title 14 will become operative.\n  That is not untoward. It is not making shambles of the budget \nprocess. If people want to know what makes a shambles with it, I can \nstay here for a month and talk about it. But this isn't one.\n  As a matter of fact, this Senator has been a very loyal supporter of \ngetting things done right. I am absolutely amazed that he would read \nsuch language from a piece of paper--that this particular technical \nchange has wreaked havoc.\n\n  I would like to meet with both sides to talk about how to fix the \nbudget resolution. Let me tell you, we will meet with both sides. He \ncan be present, and I will be present. We will have a list of 50 items \nbefore we ever get around to technical changes that are harming the \nbudget process.\n  It is absolutely clear to everyone what we are doing. If we were \ntrying to deceive anyone and were really in some way cutting $60 \nbillion out of this budget, and in some clandestine way we were going \nto do it, then I would be here saying I did something that is untoward. \nI didn't do that. That is not the case.\n  There is no objection to this budget resolution based upon what I did \nand the unanimous consent that was granted. There is no question about \nit, in my opinion. I wouldn't have done it if there were any question.\n  Soon I would like to suggest we get on to a couple of amendments. But \nI don't have them ready yet. So I will sit down and let the minority \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2081-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2081-S2083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE NEED FOR TAX SIMPLIFICATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in less than two weeks, American taxpayers \nface another federal income tax deadline. Although this year's deadline \nfalls on a Saturday, and is thus deferred for two days, the date of \nApril 15 stabs fear, anxiety, and unease into the hearts of millions of \nAmericans. Some discomfort with filing tax returns and, especially, \nwith paying taxes, is understandable and probably unavoidable. Paying \ntaxes will never be fun. But neither should it be cruel and unusual \npunishment.\n  But because of the complexity of our federal income tax system, for \nmillions of American taxpayers, completing the forms can be sheer \ntorture. According to the Tax Foundation, American taxpayers, including \nbusinesses, spend more than 5.4 billion hours and $250 billion each \nyear in complying with tax laws. That works out to more than $2,400 per \nU.S. household. This is astounding, Mr. President.\n  Last year, over 126 million individual income tax returns were filed. \nThe good news is that about 25 million of these were filed on Forms \n1040EZ or 1040A, which are significantly easier to complete than Form \n1040. Nearly six million more taxpayers last year filed over the \ntelephone, simply by pushing buttons. I am pleased to note that the \nInternal Revenue Service is making strides in improving telefiling and \nalso electronic filing. The bad news is, however, that the majority of \ntaxpayers still face filing tax forms that are far too complicated and \ntake far too long to complete.\n  According to the estimated preparation time listed on the forms by \nthe IRS, the 1999 Form 1040 is estimated to take 12 hours and 51 \nminutes to complete. This is an increase of 77 minutes from 1998.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, this does not include the estimated time to \ncomplete the accompanying schedules, such as Schedule A, for itemized \ndeductions, which carries an estimated preparation time of 5 hours, 39 \nminutes, or Schedule C, for taxpayers with a business, which has an \nestimated time of 10 hours, 19 minutes. Schedule D, for reporting \ncapital gains and losses, shows an estimated preparation time of 5 \nhours 34 minutes.\n  Even though millions of taxpayers are spared having to file the more \ncomplex 1040 with its many schedules, I believe the majority of \nAmericans are intimidated by the sheer number of different tax forms \nand their instructions, many of which they may be unsure whether they \nneed to file. Simply trying to determine that a certain form is not \nrequired can itself be an overwhelming task, given the massive set of \ninstructions and the approximately 325 possible forms that individual \ntaxpayers must deal with.\n\n  This is the instruction book for 1999 individual tax returns, Mr. \nPresident. It includes 116 pages, not counting the forms themselves.\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\n  It is no wonder that well over half of all taxpayers, 56 percent \naccording to a recent survey, including a large number of my colleagues \nin the House and Senate, now hire an outside professional to prepare \ntheir tax returns for them. However, the fact that only 29 percent of \nindividuals itemize their deductions shows that a significant \npercentage of our taxpaying population believes that the tax system is \ntoo complex for them to deal with, even though they may qualify to file \none of the simpler forms.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, this complexity is getting worse each year. \nAs I mentioned, just from 1998 to 1999 the estimated time to prepare \nForm 1040 jumped 77 minutes. Going back a few years, to tax year 1988, \nwe see that the estimated preparation time was only 9 hours and 17 \nminutes, so we have an increase of 38 percent since 1988. The number of \npages in this 1988 instruction book is only 59. So, in a matter of 11 \nyears, we have nearly doubled the hassle factor for our constituents.\n  I might note, Mr. President, that the income tax system was not \nalways so complicated. I hold here the very first Form 1040, the 1913 \nedition. This form totaled three pages for the form and just one page \nfor the instructions. But as Congress changed the tax code over the \nyears, the cumulative results have left us with a quagmire of tax rules \nthat would challenge the wisdom of Solomon and the genius of Einstein--\nnot to mention the patience of Job. In fact, the genius of Einstein \nmight not even help here. Albert Einstein himself is quoted as saying \n``the hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.''\n  As much as we in Congress would like to blame the Internal Revenue \nService for this mess, Mr. President, I am afraid that we instead need \nto look in the mirror to see who is responsible for the complexity of \nour tax system. After all, the Internal Revenue Code is our creation. \nAnd what a creation it is. According to the Congressional Research \nService, the tax code last year included over 2.8 million words. The \nHoly Bible itself has only about 775,000 words. Obviously, God did not \nneed to issue such copious instructions for living as we currently have \nfor complying with the tax laws.\n  Moreover, the pace of change to the Internal Revenue Code is \nquickening. According to Charles Rossotti, Commissioner of Internal \nRevenue, Congress made about 9,500 tax code changes in the past twelve \nyears. And we are far from being finished. Currently, there are at \nleast 11 pending bills that have been reported by the House Ways and \nMeans and Senate Finance Committees that have changes to the Internal \nRevenue Code. In addition, we are talking about passing still more tax \nbills this year. What started as a trickle in 1913 has become an \navalanche in 2000.\n\n  So, what is the solution, Mr. President? Many of my colleagues, \nmyself included, have berated the tax code and the Internal Revenue \nService, calling for both to be eliminated and replaced with a system \nthat is much simpler. Such an idea seems to be a popular one, judging \nby the applause lines I receive when I mention this concept in \nspeeches, and by the mail I have received on the subject.\n  I do believe that our current tax is seriously flawed and that \nCongress, led by the President, should enact legislation that would \ngive the American people the tax system they deserve --one that is \nsimpler, fairer, and geared to the needs of our economy in the 21st \nCentury.\n  This is not an easy proposition, Mr. President. Nor is it one that \ncan be completed in a short period of time. One major problem has been \nthe lack of presidential leadership. As with so many other vital issues \nfacing this great country, the Clinton-Gore Administration has been \nAWOL on tax reform--aloof without leadership.\n  It seems that the Administration's solutions to almost every societal \nand economic problem has boiled down to one of two things--targeted tax \ncuts or revenue increases. Both have had devastating effects on the \ncomplexity and fairness of the tax code. And again, there is plenty of \nblame to go around for this, right here on Capitol Hill.\n  But even when we have a president willing to show us the way to a new \ntax system, the problems of such a monumental undertaking are enormous. \nJust the task of educating ourselves and the taxpaying pubic on what \nthe effects of fundamental tax reform would be, and how each taxpayer \nwould be affected, is a large one indeed.\n  Moreover, computing the effect of such a change on the economy and \nfiguring out how to make a fair transition will be truly daunting. This \nwill be the case whether we decide to adopt a flat-tax, a consumption \ntax, or some hybrid system. Indeed, the inability of members of \nCongress to unite behind one reform plan, after years of discussion, is \nbut one indication of how difficult this job of fundamental tax reform \nwill be.\n  This is not to indicate in any way, Mr. President, that I shrink from \nor do not favor the idea and need for fundamental tax reform. I am \nfully convinced that we, as a nation, must find a better tax system. I \nmerely wish to point out that getting to that point is a long and \ndifficult journey that, when looked upon with a realistic eye, will not \nbe accomplished in the next two to three years under the best of \ncircumstances. I believe it will take a minimum of five years.\n\n  In the meantime, what do we do? Do we simply sit on our hands and \nlament the terrible tax code and wish for the day we can change things? \nNot in my book, Mr. President. I believe we should take action, \nstarting this year, to improve our present tax system. For all of the \nInternal Revenue Code's many flaws, there are numerous incremental \nsteps we can take this year and over the next two years that can \ndramatically lessen the complexity and increase the fairness of our tax \ncode.\n  In the next few weeks, I intend to introduce legislation that will \nrepresent the ``down payment'' or first installment of what I believe \nwill be a significant multi-year tax simplification package. This first \ninstallment will include a number of tax simplification provisions \ndesigned to make tax life easier for each category of taxpayers, \nincluding business filers. A considerable portion of the bill will be \nrepeal provisions. After all, repeal of a overly complex and outdated \ntax provision is the ultimate reform.\n  My tax simplification plan will be in three installments because I \nbelieve that, for a number of reasons, trying to simplify the entire \ncode in one year may be too large an undertaking to succeed. Rather, I \nbelieve that a three-part plan, each containing significant, but \ndigestible, relief for different classes of taxpayers, is a more \npractical approach.\n  Each of these three installments will include a centerpiece repeal \nprovision that would remove from the Internal Revenue Code a major \nsource of complexity that, in my view, is beyond repair and should \nsimply be eliminated. For the first installment, the provision to be \nrepealed is the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT).\n  The individual AMT is growing out of control and, if left unchecked, \nwill become a source of major complexity to millions of taxpayers, most \nof whom it was never intended to affect. The alternative minimum tax \nwas originally established in 1969 as a sort of backstop provision to \nensure that sophisticated taxpayers who took advantage of some of the \ntax code's incentive provisions, called tax preferences, paid at least \nsome minimum amount of tax.\n  The AMT was expanded as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, with the \nchanges taking effect in 1987. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimates that only 140,000 individual taxpayers were required to pay \nthe individual AMT that year. By 1999, that estimate had grown to \n823,000 taxpayers, largely because the thresholds for determining \nminimum tax liability were not indexed for inflation. In other words, \nas incomes grew because of inflation and other factors, more and more \npeople found themselves subject to the AMT. This is a major flaw, Mr. \nPresident, which will bring millions of middle-class families into the \nnet of the minimum tax over the next ten years.\n  As serious as this problem is, a worse one also lurks in the AMT. \nBecause of structural problems with the provision, some of which have \nbeen temporarily solved on a year-to-year basis through 2001 only, the \nminimum tax serves as a limitation to families receiving the major tax \nrelief Congress passed in 1997 in the form of the child credit and the \neducation credits. If not corrected or repealed, this ``AMT time bomb'' \nwill affect 17 million taxpayers by 2010, according to the Treasury \nDepartment.\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n  Many of these taxpayers, Mr. President, are not wealthy by any \nstretch of the imagination. We are talking about middle-class American \nfamilies here, many struggling just to raise their children. Let me \ngive you an example from this chart entitled: The Effect Of The \nAlternative Minimum Tax on a Middle-Class Family of Five.\n  Todd and Mary Anderson live in Murray, Utah, and have three children. \nTheir oldest daughter, Sarah, is a freshman in college. The younger two \nchildren, Mark and Marcia, are twins in the fifth grade. Todd and Mary \nare both school teachers and together earn $80,000 per year. This is \nnot a wealthy family by any measure.\n  However, Mr. President, this family will be paying at least $878 of \nalternative minimum tax beginning in 2002. Moreover, because the AMT \nexemption is not indexed for inflation, the minimum tax for the \nAndersons will get larger each year as their income rises because of \ncost of living adjustments.\n  Perhaps almost as aggravating for this family as the higher taxes is \nthe fact that they will need to file the alternative minimum tax form \nwith their annual tax return. Not only does this entail mastering an 8-\npage set of instructions, which are estimated to require 6 hours to \nlearn about and complete, but also preparing a 50-line form along with \na 10-line worksheet.\n  This kind of extra complexity is simply unjustified for any taxpayer, \nbut more especially for families like the Andersons, who have nothing \nout of the ordinary about their financial situation.\n  Mr. President, the best way to reform provisions like the individual \nalternative minimum tax is simply to repeal them. This is exactly what \nmy bill would do.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this first installment of my simplification \ninitiative will have provisions that are designed to simplify the tax \nlives of every group of taxpayers. Let me outline what the major \nprovisions would be and who they would benefit.\n  For lower-income taxpayers, probably the most complex feature of the \ncurrent tax law is the earned income tax credit (EITC). This credit is \nvital to the livelihoods of millions of working American families. \nUnfortunately, the computation of the credit is so complicated that \nmany professional tax preparers do not even know how it works. My bill \ndoes two things, Mr. President. First, it would significantly simplify \nthe credit, and second, it would enhance it so more low-income families \ncould take advantage of it.\n\n  Besides the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, my bill will also \naid middle-class taxpayers by vastly simplifying the capital gains tax. \nMany of my constituents were thrilled in 1997 when Congress lowered the \ncapital gains tax rates from 28 percent to 20 percent. However, many \nwere not as excited when they found out what the new law meant come tax \nreturn filing time--a 54-line Schedule D accompanied by two worksheets \nand seven pages of instructions. This is compared to a 39-line form and \njust two pages of instructions prior to the change.\n  I plan to simplify capital gains by changing from the current maximum \nrate approach to a 50 percent exclusion approach, as was the case \nbefore the 1986 Tax Reform Act repealed the capital gains preference. \nIn other words, taxpayers would be allowed to exclude 50 percent of the \nlong-term capital gain from gross income. The remaining 50 percent \nwould be taxed at ordinary income rates. This would do away with the \nneed for a special computation on the tax forms. It would also result \nin a lower capital gains rate for every tax bracket, with those in the \nlowest tax brackets getting the largest rate decreases.\n  My tax plan would greatly simplify taxes for taxpayers in the upper-\nmiddle income and upper-income brackets by repealing two phaseout \nprovisions that are both unwarranted and very complex. These \nprovisions, which phase out the benefits of personal exemptions and \nitemized deductions for taxpayers with incomes above certain \nthresholds, are nothing more than backdoor tax increases Congress \npassed in 1990. Repeal of these provisions would make a significant \ncontribution to simplification.\n  Corporate taxpayers will also find tax simplification provisions in \nthis first installment of my tax plan, Mr. President, including a \nprovision to equalize the interest rate that the IRS pays corporate \ntaxpayers on overpayments with the rate that companies must pay when \nthey owe the government. Future installments of my simplification plan \nwill have even more corporate provisions.\n  Finally, each of the three installments of my simplification plan \nwill include ten to fifteen smaller, yet important, simplification \nprovisions that, taken together, would make a significant difference in \nlessening the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  American taxpayers are fed up with our tax system and want to see \nsome serious changes made. Like all members of this body, I hear from \nmy constituents each day who complain about taxes. This has been the \ncase since the first year I was privileged to represent the State of \nUtah here in the Senate. Over the years, the nature of the complaints \nhas changed, however. Years ago, I mostly heard from constituents that \ntaxes were too high or were unfair. While I still hear plenty of \ncomplaints of this nature, I have begun hearing more and more from \nUtahns who are just plain sick and tired of the complexity of our tax \ncode.\n  We need to take action now to reduce complexity. We should not wait \nfor a new president, nor for a groundswell of popular support for \neither the flat tax or a national consumption tax. Let's start this \nyear, Mr. President, with a tax simplification plan that begins the \nlong process of making our current system both fairer and simpler. In \nthe meantime, we should also continue the national debate about how to \nbest replace the tax code with a new system. I urge my colleague to \njoin me in this undertaking.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2083-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2083-S2097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FISCAL YEAR 2001 BUDGET--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will respond to my distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who assailed my \ncomments about whether or not there was something --let me call it \nsurreptitious; perhaps I even suggested that--in the challenge that I \nraised to the so-called point of order dispute or technical change.\n  Once again I read, as I did before, from the concurrent resolution on \nthe budget, page 41, line 8:\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The functional totals with respect to discretionary \n     spending set forth in this concurrent resolution, if \n     implemented, would result in legislation which exceeds the \n     limit on discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001 set out \n     in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  That is pretty clear; it says if we exceed the ``limit on \ndiscretionary spending,'' which we do, and the Parliamentarian confirms \nthat because we say the ``functional total.'' These words are very \nsignificant words. This is not happenstance; it is in here.\n  This is not simply a technical change. They are changing the amount \nsubstantially. My friend, the chairman, says it was approved in \ncommittee action. What was approved? The fact is, there was probably an \nerror because these totals do break the discretionary caps and \neverybody knows that based on the functional totals.\n  Suddenly we knock off, to use the expression, $60 billion when, in \nfact, it was purported to be $4.4 billion. What do we have? It is not a \ntechnical change. That doesn't fit the definition anymore than a $30 \nbillion change in the highway spending was a technical change. That \nhappened. These are not technical changes. This is the real thing.\n  I challenge the Republicans again in the committee. I hate being on \nthe other side of the debate with my friend from New Mexico. He knows \nthe subject; however, he can make mistakes as all Members can. There is \ndefinitely an attempt, in my view, to remove the 60-vote point of order \nin order to accomplish their goal because there are only 55 Republicans \nand they can't get 60 votes. They made a neat change after the \ncommittee finished its deliberation, in the functional totals, and \nthereby abolish the 60-vote point of order.\n  We are not going to stand by and let it go unnoticed whether it is \ncomfortable or uncomfortable for the majority. They made the decision. \nWe\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\nhave nothing to do with how this budget resolution is finally \npresented. We will let it rest.\n  The numbers are simple: $4.4 billion expected to be a plus in the \nyear 2001. It has a $60 billion minus, $59.9 in 2001. In 2002, it goes \nfrom zero allocated for that catchall account to $59.7 billion. That is \na lot of money. It will make a huge difference when we try to fund the \nprograms we care about.\n  The public ought to know we are changing the totals and we are \nreducing the numbers of people who can be used to carry on the tasks we \nhave assigned. That is where we are. I think it is more than \nenlightening that we have seen this kind of a gimmick introduced into \nthe budget resolution.\n  I yield such time as the Senator from Rhode Island needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we begin our debate on the budget. I \nthink we should begin by noting that remarkable economic progress has \nbeen made in this country over the last 7 years, since 1993. There are \n20 million new jobs in this country. Unemployment is at a record low. \nHome ownership is expanding dramatically. Productivity has been \nincreased significantly. Inflation remains low. All of that good news \nis a result of budget decisions we made years ago under the direction \nof President Clinton and with the support of my colleagues in the \nDemocratic caucus.\n  I am afraid this budget brought to us today by the Republican \nmajority will undo most of that good work. We can all reflect upon the \nnay saying that took place years ago in 1993 where, when I was in the \nother body, my colleagues said this Clinton proposal would cause \nunemployment; it would cause a huge collapse; a recession would take \nplace.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. The proof really is in the \npudding. The plans the President proposed, and in which he was \nsupported by the Democratic caucus, produced remarkable economic \nprosperity and recovery throughout this country.\n  As I said, we have gone from a huge deficit to a surplus. But now we \nare prepared to forget the lessons of the last several decades and \nembark upon another extravagant and reckless, in fact, budget plan that \nwill essentially, through untargeted tax reductions, dissipate the \nsurplus and miss a significant opportunity to invest in the families of \nAmerica, invest in those programs that are so critical to their future, \nand invest in ways that will make this country stronger. I am afraid if \nwe support this proposal by the Republican majority, we will, in fact, \nsee the great progress of the last decade undone.\n  What we should be doing, instead, is investing in our people, not \nproposing drastic tax cuts which essentially soak up all these hard-won \nsurplus dollars. Rather than investing in health care and education, in \nthose programs that are so central to the American family, this budget \nwould result in drastic reductions in discretionary spending. At least \n6 percent, or $20 billion, in fiscal year 2001 alone would be cut away \nfrom discretionary spending. We would find ourselves unable to keep up \nwith simple inflation. Indeed, we would find ourselves lagging behind \nour requirements to fund programs on just a continuing basis, let alone \nmaking those additional investments which are so critical to the future \nof this country--in education, in health care, in veterans' affairs, in \nenvironmental policy.\n  This is also particularly suspicious when you look at the last \nseveral years and the avowed purpose of holding the line on spending of \nthis Republican Congress. In fact, under the last few Republican \nCongresses, nondefense spending rose 3.2 percent in 1997, 2.6 percent \nin 1998, 5.3 percent in 1999, and 10.7 percent last year. Somehow this \nbudget says we will hold spending 2.7 percent less than last year's \nspending. It would defy the history of this Republican Congress, going \nback several sessions.\n  So we begin with a budget plan that is faulty on its assumptions and \nfaulty on its presumptions about what we can and what we will do. What \nwe will see, in fact, is that we will forgo billions of dollars of \nnecessary spending that we have never been able to forgo in the past, \nand we will not invest additional resources in important programs. In \nfact, with this budget plan, I fear we will end up, as we have in \nseveral past years, where, at the end of the session, we are in almost \na train wreck; we come together with an omnibus appropriations bill \nthat pays scant attention to this budget. I hope we can do better. I \nhope we can invest in those programs that are going to make a \ndifference in the lives of working families rather than dissipating \nroughly 98 percent of the projected surplus into untargeted and \nmisguided tax cuts.\n\n  Also, I hope we can do those things which all our constituents are \nasking us to do. One is a Medicare prescription benefit. I commend \nSenator Wyden and colleagues on the Budget Committee because they at \nleast were able to put in a $40 billion set-aside for a new Medicare \nprescription drug program. But, unfortunately, this initiative has been \ncomplicated, in a way compromised, because the last several years of \nthe projected spending is tied into substantial Medicare reform. Again, \ngiven the record of this Congress over many sessions, to make a wise \nand necessary investment in our seniors contingent upon reform of \nMedicare is, to me, looking for an escape hatch rather than directly \nconfronting this issue, directly appropriating the money, directly \nmaking the commitment of resources right now, unconditionally making \nthat commitment.\n  I believe, also, we have a wealth of things to do with respect to our \ninvestment in education: reducing class size, increasing professional \ndevelopment for teachers, and giving the States resources for more \naccountability. We have, in fact, additional challenges in taking care \nof a generation of Americans who fought in World War II and who are now \ncoming, with increasing numbers, to the Veterans' Administration with \nincreased and more complex needs.\n  We have requirements to ensure that our natural resources are \nprotected.\n  We have requirements to ensure we maintain a strong defensive posture \nin the world.\n  All of these cannot be done as well as we will and can do them if we \nabandon the strategy of massive tax reductions and rather look at \ntargeted tax reductions for middle and lower-income Americans, together \nwith wise investments across the range of initiatives.\n  The other aspect of this budget is a continuing need to invest in our \ninfrastructure, not only our human capital in terms of education but \nour physical capital: Roads, bridges, better schools. All these things \nwe cannot do if we essentially dissipate our resources the way this \nbudget proposes.\n  There is something else we can and should do, and that is to begin to \nreduce our national debt held outside the Government. The President has \nproposed a plan to do that. Again, I think this budget represents a \nplan that is less adequate and less satisfactory.\n  For all these reasons, I urge this budget be carefully examined and \nthen, just as carefully, rejected; that we embrace the alternative \nbudget of my colleagues on the Democratic side. Also, in the course of \nthis debate we have an opportunity to look at other issues which are \nclose to all of us, issues that do not go to the financing, \nessentially, of the Government, but issues of importance to the time \nand moment of this great debate, issues such as gun control and others \nthrough which we can send a signal to the American public that we are \nlistening.\n  I hope at end of the process we can come forward with a budget that \nrepresents an investment in America, that represents a recognition we \nhave worked hard to bring ourselves to a place where we have surpluses \nwhich can be used--we hope wisely. We do not want to undo that \nprogress. We do not want to go back; we want to go forward into a \nbrighter future for all the families of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes just to answer \nthe distinguished Senator who just spoke with reference to Medicare and \nthe budget resolution.\n  To Senator Reed, I would like to suggest that things are a little bit \ndifferent in the budget resolution regarding Medicare and prescription \ndrugs, to which he has alluded. First of all, in\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\nthe budget resolution there is $40 billion of new money for Medicare. \nIt is put in a reserve fund and it is said it can be spent for two \npurposes: $20 billion for prescription drugs and $20 billion for \nreform. So, in a sense, we have done what he says he would like, and \nthat is for there to be prescription drug money separate and distinct \nfrom reform money. That is the Snowe amendment, cosponsored by Senator \nWyden--actually, the suggested modifications made by Smith of Oregon, \nthat passed the committee without a dissenting vote.\n  I believe we have all the Medicare prescription drug language \nnecessary for the Congress to get started. Frankly, I think it is a \nvery good start and we are headed in the right direction.\n  I am going to propose a unanimous consent request. I believe it has \nbeen cleared.\n  I inquire of Senator Reid, the minority whip, if the Senator from \nTexas can send her amendment to the desk, after which time we will \npropound the unanimous consent request which centers on that.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2914\n\n (Purpose: Sense of the Senate to provide for relief from the marriage \n                              penalty tax)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Ashcroft, and Mr. Brownback, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2914.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM THE \n                   MARRIAGE PENALTY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Marriage is the foundation of the American society and \n     a key institution for preserving our values;\n       (2) The tax code should not penalize those who choose to \n     marry;\n       (3) A report to the Treasury Department's Office of Tax \n     Analysis estimates that in 1999, 48 percent of married \n     couples will pay a marriage penalty under the present tax \n     system;\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office found that the average \n     penalty amounts to $1400 a year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the level in this budget resolution assume that the \n     Congress shall:\n       (1) pass marriage penalty tax relief legislation that \n     begins a phase down of this penalty in 2001;\n       (2) consider such legislation prior to April 15, 2000.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to make sure that when the \nSenator is finished or her time has expired the next Senator will be \nSenator Robb, who will offer a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the manager of the bill, yes, he is \ngoing to offer the amendment, but we also have somebody who wants to \nmake brief remarks on the marriage penalty.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So long as there is time remaining on the amendment or \nanyone wants to speak on the amendment, then that will be the case, \nafter which we will proceed to the Robb second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in \nrelation to the Robb second-degree amendment regarding prescription \ndrugs, to be followed immediately by a vote on or in relationship to \nthe pending Hutchison amendment, as amended, if amended, at 11 a.m. on \nWednesday, and the Senate resume consideration of the pending \nconcurrent resolution at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, and the time between \nnow and 11 a.m. be equally divided between the two managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I state on behalf of the leader, in \nlight of this agreement, there will be no votes this evening and the \nnext votes will occur at 11 a.m. on Wednesday.\n  I inquire of the minority manager if he is in any position to agree \nto reduce the overall time available on the budget resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Not at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I regret the minority side cannot agree to a reduction \nof time. I yield back any remaining general debate time allotted to the \nmajority party, with the exception of 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The manager has that right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I inquire of the Chair, how much general debate time \nremains on the concurrent resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two hours 22 minutes on the minority \nside; 1 hour on the majority side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Do I have 1 \nhour on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be sponsored \nby myself, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator Brownback, and be referred to \nas the Hutchison-Ashcroft amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \nwill express the sense of the Senate that it is time for marriage \npenalty relief. Why would we have a Tax Code that says a policeman and \na schoolteacher getting married owe Uncle Sam $1,400 more in taxes? In \nfact, that is exactly what the Internal Revenue Code does, and that is \nexactly what we want to change.\n  My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that we will start \nworking to relieve the marriage tax penalty, and it says we will do it \nbefore April 15 of this year.\n  Of course, we all know what April 15 is. It is tax day. We want \npeople who are writing their checks to pay their taxes this year to \nstart thinking about the penalty they pay because they are married, and \nwe want them to know that if our bill passes and the President signs \nit, they will be relieved of that penalty next year.\n  We are saying it is time for Americans to have a fair Tax Code. This \nis not so much a tax cut as it is a tax correction, and it is high time \nwe do this.\n  It is amazing we even have to take up a bill such as this because one \nwould think the Tax Code would not discriminate one way or the other \nbetween people who are single and people who are married. We are trying \nto get the fairest return for all Americans.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 21 million married \ncouples pay this penalty. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the \npenalty averages $1,400.\n  The bill that will be coming from the Finance Committee next week is \na terrific bill. It is very simple and very clear. It doubles the \nstandard deduction so that every married couple will have double the \nstandard deduction than they have today. It will be totally fair. The \nstandard deduction will be $4,400 for a single person and $8,800 for a \nmarried couple.\n  In addition, it doubles the brackets at the 15-percent level and the \n28-percent level. That takes in the large majority of people in our \ncountry who pay taxes. In fact, in the 15-percent bracket, over 6 \nyears, we increase the amount that can be made as a couple and still \npay 15 percent from $43,000 to $52,000. So we would have $8,650, to be \nexact, more in the 15-percent bracket before one goes into the 28-\npercent bracket.\n  The 28-percent bracket today stops at $105,000, and we take it to \n$127,000, so one would still pay in the 28-percent bracket rather than \ngoing to the 31-percent bracket.\n  In addition to that, we take the very lowest income people who \nreceive an earned-income tax credit and we make that credit $2,500 \ninstead of the $2,000 it is today.\n  We are trying to do something for people in the lowest bracket and in \nthe middle bracket. We think this is going to help the 21 million \ncouples who are affected by this onerous tax disadvantage.\n  I had the privilege of meeting today with three couples, all of whom \nwould have their marriage tax penalty totally eliminated if we pass the \nbill that will be before us next week.\n  We met with Kervin and Marsha Johnson. Kervin is a District of \nColumbia police officer. His wife is a Federal employee. They have been \nmarried 1 year. They are going to have to pay\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\n$1,000 more in taxes because they got married last year.\n  We also met with Eric and Ayla Hemeon. Eric is a volunteer \nfirefighter and works for a small printing company. Ayla works for a \nsmall business. They have been married for 2 years and are going to \nhave a wonderful event in about 1 month; they are going to have their \nfirst baby. But, unfortunately, they are paying a marriage penalty of \n$1,100 that will take away from what they can do for their new baby.\n\n  We heard from a couple who have been married 25 years, Lawrence and \nBrendalyn Garrison. He is a corrections officer at Lorton. She is a \nteacher in Fairfax County. Last year, they paid $600 in a marriage tax \npenalty. Mrs. Garrison is clearly a schoolteacher because she said to \nme: If you pass this bill, do you think we could make it retroactive? \nTwenty-five years? I applaud her spunk. We will not be able to do that. \nBut we can certainly give them the next 25 years with a little more \nrelief.\n  What we are saying today is, we want the Senate to vote, before April \n15, before people are required to have their taxes in, in order to let \nthem think about exactly what they are paying this year; and if they \nare one of the 21 million couples, they can think about how much less \ntheir taxes will be next year if we pass our legislation.\n  So the Hutchison-Ashcroft amendment is going to say it is the sense \nof the Senate that we pass this simple legislation next week. I do not \nsee how anyone could possibly oppose having the marriage tax penalty \nrelieved from so many of the taxpayers in our country.\n  Congress is trying to give relief to a lot of people in our country \nwho have been burdened with unfair taxes. This year, for instance, we \nhave given tax breaks to small businesspeople because we know the \neconomic engine of America is small business. We know that the taxes \nand regulations hurt small business the most because they have the \nsmallest margins. They are having a hard time making ends meet. So we \nhave given tax relief to small businesses.\n  This year, we have given tax relief for parents who are trying to \nenhance their children's education. We are trying to give tax relief to \na parent who would want to buy a computer for a child, or extra books, \nor perhaps a tutor, or perhaps tuition, or perhaps a band uniform. All \nof these things enhance education. We want people to have some tax \nbreaks to be able to do that. Senator Coverdell passed that bill \nearlier this year.\n  We have given medical savings accounts as tax relief for people who \nwould build up a savings account for their medical expenses--tax free--\nas an encouragement to provide for their medical needs.\n  We have given relief to Social Security recipients who are 65 to 70 \nyears of age who want to keep working but heretofore have been \npenalized for that right.\n  All of these tax cuts that we have given this year--plus the marriage \npenalty tax relief we will give next week--total about $136 billion \nover 5 years.\n  The budget resolution we are debating today has $150 billion in tax \ncuts reserved because we are committed to tax relief for hard-working \nfamilies. So we are well within this budget resolution with the tax cut \nbills that have been passed by this Congress so far.\n  So far, the President has not signed any of these bills. Some of them \nhave not gone to the President. But we hope he will sign the Social \nSecurity bill, which will be the first one on his desk, so that Social \nSecurity recipients will have the option to work if they so choose. We \nhope we will put the others on his desk in due order, including the \nmarriage penalty relief.\n  We have passed marriage penalty relief before, but the President \nvetoed it last year. We are coming back. The President said: Send me \nthese bills one at a time. That is exactly what we are doing. We are \nsending him marriage penalty relief by itself to see if he really is \ncommitted to tax relief for hard-working American families.\n  I hope we can pass this sense-of-the-Senate amendment; it will take \nthe first step toward saying the Senate is serious about marriage \npenalty relief. I believe we will be able to pass this bill next week. \nI think we will send it to the President. I think he will have a chance \nto explain to the American people that he either does support marriage \ntax penalty relief or he does not and, if not, why.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I hope they will not \nsupport any amendments that are extraneous to this amendment because it \nis pretty simple and pretty clear; we are seeking the support of the \nSenate for marriage penalty relief. I hope we can do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. ROTH. I rise today in support of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Getting married is not cheap. According to Bride's magazine, a couple \ngetting married today can expect to spend $20,000 for the big event--\nreception, flowers, food, dress, band, and cake. Throw in another \n$4,000 for the honeymoon, and the sticker shock is complete. But it is \nnot over. Just when the newlyweds thought their debts were paid off, \ntax time arrives and they are faced with a new bill--the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  Last week, the Senate Finance Committee approved legislation that \nwill provide relief from this bliss-busting tax.\n  Our legislation would provide $248 billion in relief to America's \nfamilies by eliminating the marriage penalty in the standard deduction; \nproviding broad based relief by widening the 15- and 28-percent tax \nbrackets; expanding the earned income credit to more lower income \nworking families and ensuring that families can take the tax credits \nfor which they qualify by permanently eliminating any cutbacks of the \ncredits because of the minimum tax.\n  Even after the honeymoon's over and paid for, today's newlyweds are \ngoing to find their married life perpetually filled with financial \nchallenges. That $20,000 wedding is going to look cheap compared to \nsaving for a down payment on a house, saving for a college education \nand saving for retirement. Letting families keep more of what they earn \nby lowering their taxes will make each of these financial challenges \neasier to face and, in the process, hopefully help make that wedded \nbliss last a little longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Texas, I am sure \nthe minority will support her amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, based upon the agreement we have had \nwith the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Virginia be allowed \nat this time to offer his amendment on prescription drugs.\n  As I also explained to the Senator from New Mexico, we have a time \nagreement on when the vote will take place. Senator Robb is here to \noffer a prescription drug amendment. That does not mean someone else \ncannot come before tomorrow at 11 o'clock and talk on the marriage \npenalty.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  But has the Senator completed her hour?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I reserved the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You would reserve it, even if a second-degree amendment \nwere going to be offered now? Is that what the Senator wants to do?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have other speakers who wish to \nspeak on my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if the Senator reserves her time and the \nsecond-degree amendment is offered, does that impact on her reservation \nat all? Does she still have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It depends on the nature of the unanimous \nconsent by the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, Senator Robb \nwould offer his amendment on prescription drugs. After he completes his \nstatement, someone from the majority can come and speak on the marriage \ntax penalty, or maybe we could. We have a time agreement when the votes \nwill take place on these two matters, so I do not think anyone would be \nadvantaged either way by his stepping forward at this time. There is no \none else on the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If that is the unanimous consent agreement, \nthe Senator from Texas would retain her time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no such unanimous consent request. But if you\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\nare construing that to be a request, I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2915 To Amendment No. 2914\n\n      (Purpose: To condition Senate consideration of any tax cut \n  reconciliation legislation on previous enactment of legislation to \n  provide an outpatient prescription drug benefit under the Medicare \n            program that is consistent with Medicare reform)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement just \nreached, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb] for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2915 to amendment No. 2914.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REVENUE REDUCTION CONTINGENT ON OUTPATIENT \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUG LEGISLATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit should \n     be established before exhausting the on-budget surplus on \n     excessive tax cuts;\n       (2) while the Senate budget resolution provides a date \n     certain for the consideration of $150,000,000,000 in tax \n     cuts, it does not include a similar instruction for the \n     enactment of an outpatient prescription drug benefit;\n       (3) all seniors should have access to a voluntary, \n     reliable, affordable medicare drug benefit that assists them \n     with the high cost of prescription drugs and protects them \n     against excessive out-of-pocket costs; and\n       (4) 64 percent of medicare beneficiaries have unreliable or \n     no drug coverage at all.\n       (b) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider a reconciliation bill resulting in a net \n     reduction in revenues unless Congress has previously enacted \n     legislation that--\n       (1) provides an outpatient prescription drug benefit under \n     the Medicare program consistent with Medicare reform; and\n       (2) includes a certification that the legislation complies \n     with paragraph (1) of this section.\n       (c) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--The point of order \n     established in this section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by an affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the members, \n     duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of \n     the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today, we begin our annual debate over our \nNation's budget. This is an important debate. Because when you set \naside the partisan squabbling and political posturing, this debate is \ncrucial: it is about establishing our priorities as a nation.\n  Throughout my career, I have fought for fiscal discipline and tried \nto stop the Federal Government--and during the time I served as \nGovernor of my State, State government--from spending more than it \ntakes in.\n  Maintaining fiscal discipline means meeting Government obligations \nwithout borrowing from future generations. The budget resolution allows \nus to determine the nature and extent of our obligations by \nestablishing our priorities. The question, then, is, What sort of \npriorities will Congress set for the American people this year? Will we \nopt to continue our path of fiscal discipline? Or will we enact a \nbudget that ignores our $5 trillion-plus debt in our haste to provide \npolitically appealing tax cuts? Will we choose to make new investments \nin education? Or will we simply decide to maintain the status quo? Will \nwe modernize and strengthen Medicare? Or will we choose instead to use \nthose dollars on a risky tax cut that endangers Medicare and erases the \nsurplus?\n  These are the sort of decisions the Senate will make over the next \nfew days. I believe we need a budget that will make America stronger \nand one that will address our most vital priorities.\n  I rise at this time to speak on the second-degree amendment I just \noffered, an amendment that will address one of our most pressing \npriorities--the need to bring Medicare into the 21st century. It is \nvery similar to an amendment I offered last year.\n  This amendment states, simply, that if Congress is going to consider \ntax cut legislation, it must first pass legislation that will modernize \nMedicare through the creation of a prescription drug benefit.\n  Thirty-five years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare into \nlaw. At the time, our country transcended politics and put our \ndifferences aside to come together, as a nation, to do the right thing \nwith regard to acute care for our Nation's seniors. Few programs in our \nNation's history have had such a lasting, positive effect on so many \nlives. Poverty among seniors, for example, has fallen nearly two-thirds \nsince Medicare was first created in 1965.\n  Today, seniors live longer and better than they ever have before. But \nwhile Medicare is still a success today, the program has become \nhopelessly outdated. New technology and new health practices have \nchanged medicine. The private sector has responded by integrating them \ninto modern medicine. Perhaps the greatest change has been the \nemergence of prescription drugs as an integral part of modern medicine. \nToday, thanks to years of biomedical research funded by both Government \nand the private sector, prescription drugs have enabled us to treat, \nand often cure, all sorts of ailments and sicknesses in ways we could \nonly dream of back in 1965. Yet while Medicare will pay for so many \nother parts of medicine--surgery, visits to the doctor, physical \ntherapy, durable medical equipment, et cetera--Medicare has stayed \nwedded to the 1965 model of not paying for prescription drugs, even \nwhen the drugs clearly help prevent seniors from having more \ncomplicated and expensive health problems. That doesn't make sense.\n  Think about it. While our engineers used slide rules in 1965, we \ncertainly would not expect them to go without the latest computer \ntechnology today. Likewise, medical equipment has advanced by leaps and \nbounds. We would not think of using a 35-year-old heart monitor on a \npatient; nor would we think it is sound policy to deny a patient access \nto a CAT scan simply because the technology wasn't around in 1965. Yet \ntoday many seniors are forced to go without needed medication because \nMedicare offers no coverage for outpatient prescription drugs.\n\n  To illustrate this point, I want to share with colleagues a letter I \nreceived 2 weeks ago from a constituent in Williamsburg, VA, a veteran \nwho served our country in Vietnam. He writes:\n\n       I have gone for almost two months without my blood pressure \n     medicine . . . because I can't afford the $150 a month to get \n     it refilled . . . . I constantly feel feverish and have a \n     splitting headache. I'm afraid I'm going to have a stroke.\n\n  Another woman from St. Stephens Church, VA, writes:\n\n       My husband and I are both retirees and rely on Social \n     Security and Medicare. Recently we both had to go to our \n     family doctor and the drugs that were prescribed for us would \n     cost us out of pocket approximately $300 per month. Due to \n     the cost of the two prescriptions, we are forced to choose \n     not to take the medication and live with the illness.\n\n  It is time we did something to change this. While over 90 percent of \nthe private sector employees with employer-based health insurance have \nprescription drug coverage, the 38 million-plus Medicare beneficiaries \nin America today have no basic prescription drug benefit. At the same \ntime, the average Medicare beneficiary fills 18 prescriptions each year \nand will have an estimated average annual drug cost of nearly $1,100 \nthis year.\n  We have an obligation to our seniors, and future generations of \nseniors, to strengthen and modernize Medicare by adding a prescription \ndrug benefit. Unfortunately, the Republican budget resolution does not \nrequire that Congress spend a dime on this vital benefit. However, \ntheir resolution does require that we pass $150 billion in tax cuts. \nThis is an issue where we need to reassess our priorities.\n  Let me state for the record that I am not opposed to all tax cuts. \nThis past Congress, I have introduced or supported several targeted tax \ncut proposals, including bills to repeal the estate tax, eliminate the \ntrue marriage penalty, repeal the 3-percent telecommunications excise \ntax, and extend\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nthe R tax credit, among others. What I am opposed to, however, is \nusing our surplus for tax cuts before we have also addressed our other \ncritical obligations--because a surplus, by definition, is what you \nhave left over once you have met all your obligations.\n  The question is, Do Senators want tax cuts, or do they want to help \nour Nation's seniors? Our friends on the other side say they would like \nto do both, but the language in the budget resolution suggests \ndifferently.\n  Reading their resolution, they require the Finance Committee to \nreport out a giant tax cut bill by September 22. Yet when it comes to \nadding a prescription drug benefit for seniors, there is no such \nrequirement--although the resolution has a reserve fund that would \nallow the Senate to consider a drug bill on the floor if the Senate \nFinance Committee has not reported a bill by September 1.\n  This resolution makes the Republicans' priorities very clear: The \nSenate must pass tax cuts, and as for prescription drugs, well, we hope \nwe can find some time to take it up later in the year. Maybe we can \ntake it up if we have any money left after the tax cuts.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have suggested this is not \nthe case. They have said they want to pass a prescription drug benefit \nthis year. They have claimed there is ample money in their budget \nresolution to add a drug benefit to Medicare and enact their massive \ntax cut.\n  But a close examination of their budget resolution reveals that it \nwould be impossible for them to do anything but enact a massive tax cut \nthis year. The Republican budget resolution assumes $150 billion in tax \ncuts over the next 5 years. Combined with the interest America will pay \nfrom this revenue loss, the total budgetary impact will be $168 \nbillion. Given that their budget resolution only assumes $171 billion \nin total surplus over this same time period, all but 2 percent of the \non-budget surplus will be devoted to tax reduction. This leaves \nvirtually nothing for prescription drug coverage, much less other \npriorities, such as defense or education, unless Congress makes deep \ncuts in other domestic discretionary programs.\n  As we have seen in past years, these cuts are simply unrealistic; \nthey will never materialize, and they pose a real threat of a raid on \nSocial Security.\n  How do they propose to help our seniors access prescription drugs \nwhen they have devoted 98 percent of the surplus over the next 5 years \nto tax cuts?\n  We ought not to be enacting major tax cuts until we have first \nfulfilled our obligation to our seniors to add a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare. Let's get our priorities in order and put seniors \nbefore tax cuts.\n  I urge all Senators to support this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Robb, for introducing this \nimportant amendment.\n  Today, we have before us the opportunity to achieve our collective \ngoal of reforming the Medicare program. To do so, we must both realize \nand accept the fact that the face of health care has changed since the \ninception of Medicare in 1965.\n  In 1965, America's health system focused upon the inpatient setting, \nreacting to both acute and chronic conditions. In turn, Medicare \nfollowed this model.\n  Today, our health care system benefits from the advantage of new \ntechnologies, preventive measures and prescription drug therapies. \nUnfortunately, Medicare does not share these advantages, due to our \ninability to put reform first.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues have spoken eloquently about the need to \ninclude a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare package--certainly \nbefore we turn to tax cuts. This benefit would be an essential part of \nupdating Medicare to adequately service the health care needs of \ntoday's seniors.\n  Currently, private health care plans cover medication because it is a \nvital component of modern health care. Prescription drugs are viewed as \nintegral in the treatment and prevention of diseases.\n  Accordingly, we must find an approach to a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit that will best provide the most meaningful coverage for the \nmost beneficiaries. And, I would argue that we take one step further \nand recognize that the development of a prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare beneficiaries is directly related to the need for preventive \ncare.\n  As one of the primary guardians of the Medicare program, the Senate \nhas the sobering responsibility to design a program that focuses on \nhealth promotion and disease prevention for all Medicare beneficiaries. \nThis approach will slow the growth in costs to the program in the \nfuture, and, more importantly, will improve the quality of life for \nolder Americans.\n  It has been proven time and time again, that a combination of \npreventive services and appropriate medication can reduce the incidence \nof stroke, diabetes, and heart disease among other serious and costly \nillnesses.\n  Detailed programmatic changes--changes based upon the realization \nthat prescription drugs and preventive services go hand in hand--are \nnecessary to convert the current Medicare system into one that will \nbest serve our seniors.\n  Mr. President, I am not convinced that the tax cut that is \nincorporated into this budget resolution will achieve our goal of \nmuchly needed reform.\n  Our seniors have been pleading with this Congress to create a drug \nbenefit. And, maybe it is because I hail from a state where nearly one-\nfifth of the population is over age 65 . . . but I have not heard such \nimpassioned pleas for tax cuts.\n  We are very fortunate to be living in an age of prosperity. But, I \ncannot sit idle while this Congress squanders our good fortune on the \nfolly of tax cuts.\n  Instead, I implore you to take advantage of these good economic times \nand use the dollars that are available to us today to implement change \nthat will benefit us tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Chair inform us about how much time \nis left on the second-degree amendment on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Under the time of the minority on the bill, we yield an \nadditional 12 minutes to the Senator, for a total of 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I don't believe I will need all of \nthat time. But I appreciate leadership yielding the time.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nRobb, for offering this amendment. I welcome the chance to join with \nhim and my colleague and friend, Senator Wyden of the State of Oregon. \nI commend him for the way this amendment has been fashioned and for the \nexcellent presentation and compelling case he made in favor of this \namendment.\n  When you get right down to it, as he said so well, this is really a \nquestion about priorities. As the Senator from Virginia pointed out, if \nwe reject this amendment, we are putting tax breaks before our senior \ncitizens. If the Senate accepts this amendment, it is putting our \nsenior citizens, their health and their well-being, ahead of tax breaks \nfor the wealthy.\n  As we start this debate on the budget, we have an issue that makes a \ngreat difference to millions of senior citizens and their families--\nbecause so often elderly people need assistance from their family \nmembers in order to purchase their necessary prescription drugs. This \nis a significant drain on both the senior citizen and their family's \nincome.\n  I again commend the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, for the superb \npresentation he made in the Budget Committee, and for his outreach to \nMembers on the other side of the aisle. I admire their strong \nwillingness to support the Wyden proposal because I think it will make \na difference in the lives of many of our seniors.\n  As I mentioned, a budget is a statement of our national priorities. \nThere is no more important priority than Medicare coverage of \nprescription drugs. Our amendment puts the Senate on record that \nquality health care for senior citizens is more important than new tax \nbreaks for the wealthy.\n  The need for action on prescription drugs is as clear as it is \nurgent. Too many elderly Americans today must choose between food on \nthe table and the medicines they need to treat their illnesses. Too \nmany senior citizens can\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\nonly take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or must forego needed \nprescriptions, because they cannot afford the high cost of prescription \ndrugs. Too many senior citizens are paying twice as much as they should \nfor the drugs they need because they are forced to pay full price when \nalmost everyone with private insurance coverage has the benefit of \nnegotiated discounts. Too many senior citizens end up hospitalized, at \nan immense cost to Medicare, because they cannot afford the drugs they \nneed or can't afford to take them correctly.\n  As numerous discoveries in recent years have made clear, \npharmaceutical products increasingly offer cures for many dreaded \ndiseases. Far too many senior citizens are being left out and left \nbehind because Congress has failed to act.\n  I strongly believe this century is going to be the life-sciences \ncentury. We know about the extraordinary possibilities for breakthrough \nprescription drugs. We know, for example, if we were to have a \nbreakthrough drug for delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease, half \nthe nursing home beds in my State of Massachusetts would be empty. The \nimpact on quality of life would be significant. At the same time, we \ncould save the Medicare system money.\n  I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to review why this \namendment is so important.\n  There is a drug crisis for senior citizens: Coverage is going down, \nand costs are going up.\n  I want to take a few moments to review for the Senate exactly what is \nhappening across America.\n  We have 36 million American seniors, as this chart indicates. We are \nfinding that 12 million of them have no coverage whatsoever; 11 million \nhave employer-sponsored coverage. I will come back to that. Three \nmillion have Medicare HMOs. Four million have Medigap coverage. Four \nmillion have Medicaid coverage. This is the only group, the poorest of \nthe poor, in America that have reliable prescription drug coverage. \nThree million have coverage as veterans or through other programs.\n\n  This is what is happening in America today. We know a third of all \nseniors have no coverage whatsoever. Let's take a look at seniors with \nemployer-sponsored; they represent about one-third of all seniors.\n  Look at this chart. From 1994 to 1997, we see a precipitous drop in \nemployer-sponsored coverage. We see a drop of 25 percent over the 3 \nyears from 1994 to 1997.\n  If 1997 and 1998, coverage is dropping like a stone. A third of all \nthe elderly people have no coverage; another third have employer-\nsponsored coverage, but that number is dropping rapidly.\n  What is happening in Medicare HMOs? This is what is happening to \nMedicare HMO drug coverage: It's inadequate and unreliable. First of \nall, the drug benefit is only offered at the option of the HMO. More \nthan 325,000 Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage this year--\n325,000 have been dropped.\n  The Medicare HMOs are also reducing the level of drug coverage. \nSeventy-five percent of all the Medicare HMOs will limit prescription \ndrug coverage to less than $1,000 this year, an increase of 100 percent \nsince 1998. In 1997, 37 percent of Medicare HMOs had caps of less than \n$1,000; in 1998, this number increased to 75 percent. Thirty-two \npercent of Medicare HMOs have now imposed caps of less than $500 for \nprescription drugs.\n  Twelve million seniors with no coverage, 11 million and dropping with \nemployer-sponsored coverage, and 3 million with coverage through \nMedicare HMOs, and we find that the HMOs are setting caps of $500 or \nless. This suggests very poor, unreliable prescription drug coverage \nfor our senior citizens.\n  Four million seniors have prescription drug coverage through Medigap. \nLook at what is happening to the cost of Medigap plans with drug \ncoverage--$2,600 for someone who is 75 years old; $2,600 a year in \nDelaware; New York, almost $2,000; Iowa, almost $2,000; Maine, almost \n$2,500; and almost to $2,500 in Mississippi--and many seniors are not \neven eligible for Medigap drug coverage. You can only purchase the \nMedigap plans that include prescription drug coverage at the time you \nfirst become eligible for Medicare. These plans are incredibly \nexpensive. The cost of Medigap which includes prescription drugs is \nunaffordable and unavailable for most senior citizens.\n  Again, the level of Medicare HMO drug coverage is dropping \ndrastically. We see the collapse of coverage for seniors with employer-\nsponsored plans, for seniors in Medicare HMOs, and for seniors with \nMedigap. This effectively leaves persons with Medicaid as the only \nseniors with reliable drug.\n  At the same time coverage is collapsing, drug costs are growing at \ndouble-digit rates: a 9.7 percent increase in 1995; 10 percent in 1996; \n14 percent in 1997; 15 percent in 1998; 16 percent in 1999.\n  What about the rates of inflation? Inflation was 2.5 percent in 1995; \n3.3 percent in 1996; 1.7 percent in 1997; 1.6 percent in 1998, and 2.7 \npercent in 1999. In other words, drug costs are going up significantly \nfaster than the rate of inflation. Coverage is collapsing, and costs \nare going through the roof. We are not meeting the needs of our elderly \npeople.\n  That is why we on this side of the aisle believe, unlike the other \nside of the aisle, we should have agreement on the principles for a \nquality Medicare prescription drug benefit. There should be coverage \nfor all seniors, coverage must be basic and catastrophic, and it should \nbe affordable both to the Federal Government and to the individual. \nThese principles were not recognized by the Budget Committee.\n  These two charts demonstrate what the budget resolution has done for \ntaxes and what it has done for prescription drugs. Section 104: ``Not \nlater than September 22, 2000, the Senate Committee on Finance shall \nreport to the Senate a reconciliation bill proposing changes''--that \nwould be tax cuts for the next 5 years.\n  Note the words, ``shall report.''\n  Regarding the reserve fund for prescription drugs: ``The Senate \nspending aggregate and other appropriate budgetary levels and limits \nmay be adjusted and allocations may be revised for the legislation \nreported by the committee on . . . to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit for fiscal year 2001, 2000, and 2003.''\n  See the difference? That is why we are offering this amendment. We \nare treating tax breaks the same as prescription drugs--the other side \nof the aisle is not. That is why the Robb amendment is before the \nSenate. There is one criteria for tax breaks for wealthy individuals \nand another criteria for our elderly Americans. That is the issue we \nare addressing.\n  The tax measure is a permanent measure. Can we say that about the \nprescription drug measure? No, no, no, it only goes on for 3 years. \nAfter 3 years, it only continues ``if legislation is reported by the \nSenate Committee on Finance that extends the solvency of the Medicare \nHospital Insurance Trust Fund without the use of transfers of new \nsubsidies from the general fund.''\n  It says, ``that extends the solvency of the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund without the use of transfers . . .''\n  Why is the Budget Committee saying we cannot use any of the surplus? \nThat is what this provision says. You are not able to use any surplus \nto extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. This says ``that \nextends the solvency'' ``without the use of transfers of new \nsubsidies''--that is the surplus ``from the general fund.''\n  They are saying after the first 3 years you cannot have funds for the \nfourth or the fifth year unless you have a complete revamping of \nMedicare. And you cannot use any surplus money to extend solvency.\n  How does that translate? To the senior citizens it means there will \nbe a cut in Medicare benefits. If you are going to have prescription \ndrug coverage, you will have to cut your Medicare benefits or raise the \npayroll tax. Those are the options the Budget Committee is leaving for \nprescription drug coverage.\n  They don't set that criteria for the tax breaks. They say you \n``shall.'' It is permanent. It will go on ad infinitum. But not for \nprescription drugs. We may provide coverage for 3 years, but we will \nnot extend coverage beyond that unless there is a complete revamping of \nthe Medicare system. And we can't use any surplus funds--as President \nClinton and Al Gore suggest, and as every Member on this side believes \ncan and should be used.\n  They are saying no, no, you cannot use any of the surplus for \nMedicare solvency. And you will only be able to get\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\na prescription drug benefit if you either cut Medicare benefits or \nincrease the payroll tax.\n  What does this mean for senior citizens? This means they have a very \npoor deal on prescription drug coverage. It is a better deal than we \nhad last year and we are encouraged that we have made some progress. \nBut this does not give the assurances that our elderly people need that \nthey are going to have affordable, reliable prescription drug coverage.\n  No matter how many times they say it, the language is very clear. The \nRobb amendment is very clear. It says we want a prescription drug \nbenefit that is worthy of its name, that covers all seniors, that is \naffordable to both beneficiaries and the Government, and we will do \nthat before we cut taxes.\n  This $20 billion for years 4 and 5 will not be adequate because we \nare seeing a phasing in of the coverage over a period of time. The \nmoney for the fourth and fifth years is completely inadequate. The cost \nof the President's plan is up to $31 billion, 50 percent higher, and \nthat was without catastrophic coverage. The cost of the President's \nprogram is about $200 billion over 10 years. That is a sizable amount, \nbut it is a good program. It will make a major difference in the lives \nof our seniors. It will relieve many of our elderly citizens from the \nanxiety they currently face.\n  This amendment is of enormous importance and consequence. I cannot \nexpress my appreciation enough to the Senator from Virginia. Everyone \nin the State of Virginia, every elderly citizen and their family, will \nbe affected by this effort that the Senator has put forward. It will \naffect the seniors not only in his State but in my State of \nMassachusetts and all across this country.\n  This is the first opportunity we have had--since the President of the \nUnited States identified prescription drugs in his State of the Union a \nyear and a half ago--to have this debate and to have a rollcall on a \nmeasure that can make such a difference in so many lives. The Senator \nfrom Virginia is offering this opportunity. Tomorrow at 11 o'clock this \nSenate will have the chance to say whether it wants to put the \ninterests of our elderly people first, or if we want tax breaks for \nwealthy people to come before them.\n  It is very clear from the presentation that has been made by the \nSenator from Virginia and the Senator from Oregon where they stand. I \nam proud to stand with them. I hope the Senate will stand with them \ntomorrow also.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his time on the \namendment. The Chair recognizes the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what the manager and I would like to do is \nenter into a unanimous consent agreement so we know what is left for \nthis evening. It is my understanding the Senator from Massachusetts has \ncompleted his statement for today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. Thank you.\n  Mr. REID. What we would like to do is recognize, next, Senator \nGorton, to speak for up to 12 minutes; Senator Feingold, to speak for \nup to 7 minutes; Senator Ashcroft, up to 10 minutes; and Senator Bryan \nfor 10 minutes. After that, we would be out until the morning--at 9:30?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's leave that up to the leader.\n  Mr. REID. I thought that was what it provided. All it says is back in \nat 9:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does it provide for a closing, or is it up to the \nleader to provide for a closing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be up to the leadership.\n  Mr. REID. Fine. We will end at that, when Senator Bryan completes his \nstatement. Whatever the leadership wants to do, we can do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank all the Senators for not taking any more time. \nThere is more time tomorrow. There are events planned by the leadership \nfor tonight. Senators, if they wanted to listen to us, could go on to \ntheir events and still have heard what we have to say. I wish to make \none observation and then I will agree to the rest. It will just take me \n1 minute.\n  I, first, want to remind the Senate and anybody listening, in the \nSenate Budget Committee, regarding the reserve fund of $40 billion for \nMedicare and prescription drugs, the cosponsor of that was a Democrat \nSenator named Wyden who was praised in our committee by Senators \nLautenberg and Conrad as doing the right thing for Medicare. I think we \nhave done the right thing.\n  Our budget says: Do prescription drugs first. That was because of the \nlanguage offered by the distinguished occupant of the Chair, which said \nby September 1 we would have to have a package on the floor or we could \noffer it on the floor. And, incidentally, it then says taxes would be \nconsidered on the 22nd day of September, almost a month later. So our \napproach was Medicare first, tax cuts almost a month later--about 17 \ndays later. I think that is the way it ought to be.\n  The Robb amendment is nongermane and is unnecessary, but we will make \nthat case tomorrow before we vote. I am going to leave the floor. I \nthank everyone again for the discussion. I thank Senator Robb for the \nway he has handled the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the motion?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. ROBB. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwould like to respond to my distinguished friend from New Mexico and \nsay, if that is the intention of the Senator from New Mexico and others \non the other side of the aisle, this amendment should not be a threat. \nI hope, in that case, the majority party, and all of those who are \nmembers of the majority party, would support this amendment.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts for laying out \nthe case in eloquent detail with some very informative charts and for \nmaking what I think is a very persuasive case. But if it is the \nintention of the majority to follow through with the plan they have \noutlined, then this amendment should pose no threat to them whatsoever. \nI hope, then, we would have this amendment approved by unanimous \nconsent.\n  With that, I do not object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had objected to the time scenario until I clarified \nsomething.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I clarify something with the Senator? Is there any \nguarantee in the budget instructions that we will have prescription \ndrug legislation on the floor by September 21?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. It says the 60-vote point of order against any such \nlegislation will disappear on the date I just described, which was the \ndate suggested by the occupant of the chair. So if the Senator wants to \noffer a bill on the floor after that date, that budget resolution, it \nwill not be subject to a point of order under the Budget Act. It will \nbe permissible, with prescription drug and/or reform.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I objected to the scenario because I did \nnot understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask a question. I don't want to have to object. \nWhen the Senate recesses tonight, there should be 90 minutes, as I \nunderstand it, equally divided in the morning.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. Will the Senator repeat that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When the Senate recesses, there should be 90 minutes \nleft for tomorrow morning. That would be to debate on the Hutchison and \nthe Robb amendments. If not, the Senate intends to remain in session \nuntil the time is used or yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding, after we complete the statements \ntonight, hoping to finish around 6 o'clock, that tomorrow morning we \nwill come in and each side will have 45 minutes to debate either the \nHutchison amendment or the Robb amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous consent \nrequest is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday, a bus load of seniors traveled \nfrom Seattle to Canada to buy prescription drugs. Just a short drive \nfrom where these seniors live, they can buy the medicine they need to \nstay healthy for much lower prices than they would pay at their \nneighborhood pharmacy.\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\n  Why? Because our own U.S. manufacturers sell exactly the same product \nto Canadian pharmacies for much less than the price they charge drug \nstores in the United States. Americans end up going to Canada and \nMexico in order to afford to buy products that were discovered, \ndeveloped and manufactured in America. Shocking? Yes. But every day \nU.S. based drug companies sell identical FDA approved, U.S. \nmanufactured products in Canada and Mexico at discount prices \nunavailable to American purchasers in the United States.\n  Here are a few examples:\n  The Pecks from Tacoma, Washington recently saved $600 by going to \nCanada to buy a three month supply of blood pressure, stomach and sinus \nmedications. Tomaxifen to treat cancer costs $15 for a one month supply \nin Canada and $95 a month in Vermont. Prozac to treat depression, is \njust .95 cents a pill in Mexico and costs $2.21 in the United States.\n  These price differences are by no means unusual. I was astounded to \nlearn that for the top ten most commonly prescribed drugs, average \nprices are 64 percent lower in Canada than in Washington state.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of a survey of price differences be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  GORTON TOP TEN PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND CANADA \\1\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                       Zithromax\n                                   Premerin    Synthroid    Lipitor    Prilosec     Norvasc   Prozac (10   Clairitin   z-pak, 6     Zoloft    Glucophage\n                                    (.3 mg)    (.05 mg)     (10 mg)                               mg)       (10 mg)     tablets                (1000 mg)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpokane.........................     $25.69      $15.02      $68.12     $111.25      $51.69      $81.62      $79.69      $47.42      $83.69      $26.72\nBellingham......................      26.69       16.69       75.69      150.69       78.69       91.98       80.69       89.69       87.69       60.69\nVancouver, WA...................      25.69       16.69       75.69      132.88       51.69       90.69       79.69       52.69       83.69       60.69\nTacoma..........................      25.69       50.98       75.69      119.68       46.52       90.69       79.69       52.69       75.32       60.69\nVancouver, B.C..................      11.63        9.54       61.48         N/A       48.69       63.52         N/A       39.48       35.70   \\2\\ 15.88\nVancouver, B.C..................       9.00       11.11       67.64   \\3\\ 73.00       49.00       65.74   \\4\\ 13.99       44.31       46.56       17.00\nCalgary, Alberta................      10.57       12.50       61.95   \\3\\ 75.00       49.00       45.20       33.98       40.70       35.00   \\2\\ 18.20\nVictoria, B.C...................      11.00       10.00       65.00   \\3\\ 81.00       54.00       50.00         N/A         N/A       30.00       17.00\n                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWashington State................      25.94       24.84       73.79      128.63       57.15       88.75       79.94       60.62       82.60       52.19\nCanada..........................      10.55       10.78       64.02       73.50       48.96       16.12       33.98       41.50       39.08       17.02\n(in U.S. $).....................

That is outrageous.\n  A major reason for this disparity is that foreign governments have \nimplemented price control policies that tempt--successfully I may say--\nU.S. drug companies to discriminate against American consumers. Other \ncountries offer to pay the nominal costs of manufacturing a drug, some \nprofit and little else. Our drug companies agree because they can still \nmake a profit, leaving our citizens to pay the high costs associated \nwith research and development of new drugs. And where has the Clinton/\nGore Administration been? In my opinion it has done a wholly inadequate \njob of protecting Americans from this form of price discrimination--it \nsimply ignores the problem.\n  I believe it is time to change the law so that Americans are no \nlonger discriminated against with respect to the cost of prescription \ndrugs. The best way I know to do that is to prevent drug companies from \nselling any product in Canada or Mexico at a lower price than they sell \nit for in the United States.\n  These are the principles found in the Robinson-Patman Act, a law \nCongress passed more than 60 years ago to address price discrimination \nin the United States. That act simply tells manufacturers that they \ncan't act to undermine one business by selling the same product to a \ncompetitor at discounted rates, unless the price difference is due to \nlegitimate quantity discounts.\n  What will this proposal mean? Once drug companies have the incentive \nto charge non-discriminatory prices overseas and other countries pay a \nfare share of drug research and development costs--people in Washington \nstate and across the country will pay lower prices for prescription \ndrugs.\n  Let me speak briefly about what I am not trying to do. I am not \ntelling drug companies what price they have to charge for their \nproduct. I am simply saying that manufacturers can no longer \ndiscriminate against American consumers by charging Canadian and \nMexican pharmacies lower prices than they charge Americans for \nprecisely the same product.\n  It is not my intent to harm the research going on in the U.S. Drug \ncompanies should be able to recoup the research and development costs \nfor both unsuccessful and successful new drugs. But my constituents in \nWashington and other Americans should not be forced to pay all of those \ncosts for the rest of the world.\n  I have talked to seniors, doctors and others in our health care \nsystem about these pricing problems, but I wanted to hear from the \nindustry as well. So last week, I asked the President of PhRMA and \nrepresentatives from most of the big drug companies why Americans pay \nmore than people in Canada or Mexico for the same exact drug. They told \nme that they shared my concern that American consumers pay most of the \nresearch and development costs associated with making new medicines. I \nwas pleased to hear that we were on common ground in that area.\n  Unfortunately, I was left with the impression that the pricing issue \nis not a top concern to the drug companies. Instead of engaging me in a \nreal discussion about the pricing issue and the vast difference between \nthe cost of drugs in Canada and the cost of drugs here, I learned about \nthe companies' commitment to having drug coverage extended to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. They have a point on that issue, and I am working with \nmy colleagues on such an extension.\n  But still this so-called solution is just one piece of the puzzle. \nExpanding Medicare coverage will help some people, but it doesn't help \neveryone, and it seems more like an effort by the drug companies to \nincrease their markets at high prices, as opposed to dealing head on \nwith policies that encourage them to charge Americans more for \nprescription drugs than they charge people in Canada and around the \nworld.\n  While I did not hear much about this issue in my meeting, or in the \ndays following our meeting, I still want to hear from the drug \ncompanies on this question. It is a vital one that needs to be \naddressed, and since they are the experts on this matter, I hope that \nthey will come to me in the next few days with alternative ideas for \ncorrecting this injustice. It may well be that there is a better idea \nthan my own. If so, I am anxious to hear it from the drug companies or \nfrom anyone else. One company incidentally has already made a \nconstructive suggestion.\n  Fortunately, I have also heard from several of my colleagues on this \nidea, and the news is good for American families frustrated by this \ninequity. Several Republican Senators have committed to supporting my \nidea and the majority leader has expressed interest. I suggest that \nthis is serious incentive for the drug companies to develop some ideas. \nOtherwise, I am prepared to introduce my proposal promptly.\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\n  Let me be clear that I recognize the importance of biopharmaceutical \nresearch. Some of the cutting-edge research going on today may one day \nopen up new avenues of science that will help crack the code of complex \nhuman illness and aid in finding treatments and cures for those in need \nof improved medicine. The United States is the global leader in \nbiotechnology. As we work on proposals to help the American consumer \nafford prescription drugs, I will be mindful of the fact that we don't \nwant to undermine this important industry.\n\n  That said, the current system hurts a lot of people, and leaves a lot \nof Americans feeling ripped off. The list of those who are \ndiscriminated against because of these unfair pricing policies includes \nthe 40 million Americans who are uninsured and those seniors without \ndrug benefits who pay higher prices at the drugstore cash register than \njust about anyone else in the world. It affects the cost of health care \ninsurance and also is a growing problem for our doctors, hospitals, and \nnursing homes as more of the total of health care spending is allocated \nto drug costs.\n  The other group that gets hurt is the drug companies themselves. \nBecause of these backward pricing policies, the drug companies have \nbecome the new ``health care villains.'' In my State, I hear constantly \nfrom constituents who rail against the drug companies for charging them \nhundreds of dollars more than what they would pay in Canada. For years, \nthe drug companies were respected for their innovative products, the \nrisk they were willing to take to improve our health, and the medical \nadvances they created. Those good feelings have been earned, and while \nthey have not been destroyed, that reputation is at risk by the \ncompanies' unwillingness to step forward on the pricing issue.\n  And specifically, their reputation is at risk when they do not speak \nout loudly against policies that cause harm to their very best \ncustomers--American families.\n  I hope they will speak out. But Congress can no longer allow other \ncountries to get away with policies that force drug companies to \ndiscriminate against American consumers by charging dramatically lower \nprices in Canada and Mexico and thus higher prices here at home. Other \ncountries must pay a fair share of the research and development costs \nfor new drugs. Seniors, the uninsured, and every other American should \nbe able to walk into their neighborhood drug stores and buy the \nmedicines they need at affordable prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \ncome off the time for general debate of the resolution rather than the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, America's economy is strong. The Nation \nis enjoying the longest economic expansion in its history, at 107 \nconsecutive months and counting. Last Friday's papers reported that the \nfourth quarter of 1999 grew at a blistering 7.3 percent, the fastest \nquarterly rate since 1984. We have the lowest unemployment rate in \nthree decades, and home ownership is at its highest rate--at 67 \npercent--on record.\n  As the old saying goes, ``[V]ictory finds a hundred fathers but \ndefeat is an orphan.'' There is an economic corollary: The advocates of \nhundreds of policies claim to have fathered economic growth, but none \nadmit to have spawned recession.\n  While certainly several causes contributed to the current economic \nexpansion--among them technological innovation, free markets, and \nharder- and longer-working workers--there can be no denying that a key \ncontributor to our booming economy has been the Government's fiscal \nresponsibility since 1993.\n  In 1992, the Government ran a unified budget deficit of $290 billion \nand a non-Social Security deficit of $340 billion. When President \nClinton took office in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office greeted \nhim with a projection that the unified budget deficit would climb to \n$513 billion in 2001. Instead, CBO now projects that in fiscal year \n2001, the Government will run a unified budget surplus of $181 billion \nand a non-Social Security surplus of $15 billion.\n  Our responsible fiscal policy means that the Government has borrowed \nless from the public than it otherwise would have, and indeed has paid \ndown debt held by the public. No longer does the Government crowd out \nprivate borrowers from the credit market. No longer does the Government \nbid up the price of borrowing--interest rates--to finance its huge \ndebt. Our fiscal policy has thus allowed interest rates to remain lower \nthan they otherwise would be, and millions of Americans have realized \nsavings on their mortgages, car loans, and student loans. In this \nfavorable credit market, businesses large and small have found it \neasier to invest and spur yet more new growth.\n  But just as victory engenders multiple claims of fatherhood, a \nsurplus seems to breed ready ways to spend it away, and the greatest \nsingle threat to that surplus, to responsible fiscal policy, and to the \nstrong economy to which it has contributed is represented by the budget \nresolution before us today. This budget would spend away all of the \nnon-Social Security surplus in one fell swoop on a massive tax cut plan \nreminiscent of the early 1980s. The budget would launch this \nirresponsible tax enterprise before having taken any steps to save \nSocial Security or to reform Medicare or to lock away on-budget \nsurpluses to pay down the debt.\n\n  This budget does more than merely portray those tax cuts. This budget \nresolution would create a fast-track reconciliation vehicle to move \nthat massive tax cut bill through the Congress. As my colleagues know, \nreconciliation comes with a 20-hour limit on debate, so that no one can \ndebate it at length. Reconciliation bills can pass with a simple \nmajority, so the majority does not have to reach consensus or \ncompromise with others, as the rules of the Senate otherwise require. \nThe reconciliation process prevents bringing up any tax cut that the \nmajority of the Finance Committee does not bring up for us. In terms of \nreal world consequences, the only value of this budget resolution is as \na tax cut delivery device.\n  Sadly, as well, this budget continues the gimmickry of the last few \nyears in connection with the annual appropriations process. We all have \nseen this pattern before. The budget resolution begins with an \nunrealistic appropriations level to pave the way for fiscally \nirresponsible tax cuts. The appropriators try to live within it by \nusing one gimmick after another, and then, at the end of the year, the \nPresident and Congress negotiate a final spending package far above the \nlevels originally provided for in the budget resolution.\n  I am sorry to say, we are well down that road again this year. This \nbudget resolution advertises appropriations levels--at $596 billion--\nhalfway between a freeze and what is needed to fund current \nservices. But the resolution actually gives the Appropriations \nCommittees a much lower level than either of these with which to work. \nRead the fine print in section 209 of this resolution, in the numbers \nin function 920, and on page 2 of the committee report. As our ranking \nmember on the Budget Committee, the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey has already pointed out, there we find that this resolution \nactually gives the Appropriations Committee $541 billion, the cap \nlevels for fiscal year 2001. That is $45 billion less than a freeze. \nWhat is this?\n\n  This is a recipe for gridlock, just like last year, and the year \nbefore. This budget resolution simply invites a giant, omnibus \nappropriations measure at the end of the year, instead of working our \nway carefully through the 13 regular appropriations measures. This \nbudget resolution invites even more budget gimmickry than last year, in \norder for the appropriators to live within these unrealistic levels. \nAnd it does so simply to advance a tax cut that is too big and would \nstick our kids with the bill.\n  I would suggest, this is no way to govern. Rather than playing \nanother year of budget chicken, Congress should work with the President \nto reach a consensus on fiscal policy. Rather than force a giant train \nwreck at the end of the year, Congress should work on a responsible \nbudget at the beginning--right now.\n  Mr. President, regrettably, this budget resolution is yet another \nmissed opportunity. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2914\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I believe that at this time it is \nappropriate for me to make remarks about the marriage penalty \nreduction. I am pleased to have this opportunity. I thank my colleagues \nfor making it possible to have this time scheduled.\n  Before I begin my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nSessions as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the budget resolution before us is a \nresponsible framework for spending. I believe sincerely that Senator \nDomenici has done a superb job in creating this budget. He deserves our \npraise. His budget will fully protect Social Security over 5 years \nwhile balancing the important goals of debt reduction, tax relief, and \nprudent spending levels.\n  One of the important goals allowed by this budget resolution is the \nreduction of the marriage penalty. I rise in favor of the Hutchison-\nAshcroft-Brownback amendment calling for marriage penalty relief.\n  I am happy to report that the relief called for in this amendment \nshould be arriving very shortly. Just today, the Finance Committee \nfiled a plan to increase the marriage penalty relief passed by the \nHouse. Some people have referred to this as a tax cut for married \nindividuals. Frankly, I like the way Senator Hutchison labels this \nparticular measure. She calls it a tax correction.\n  This is an effort which is designed to take some of the penalty out \nof being married. The Finance Committee plan, which the budget \nresolution anticipates, makes the income brackets for couples in the \n15-percent and 28-percent tax brackets double that of single filers. It \nincreases the standard deduction and alleviates marriage penalties in \nthe EITC, the earned-income tax credit, and the AMT, the alternative \nminimum tax. This plan, passed by the committee, improves upon the \ninitial finance bill which, in turn, improves upon the bill passed by \nthe House.\n  As a result of these improvements, more people will receive more \nneeded relief from the marriage tax penalty. We need this relief \nbecause our Tax Code discriminates against the fundamental societal \nvalue of marriage.\n  I would like to pause for a moment to say how important it is for us \nto have, as policy in this country, an approach to institutions that \nare crucial to our success and survival which is nondiscriminatory and \nnot hostile. I cannot think of any institution that means more to the \nfuture of the United States of America than the institution of the \nfamily. There is very little that could possibly mean more to a family \nthan the potential of having marriages.\n  When we find ourselves in a setting where the Tax Code of the United \nStates penalizes persons for tying the knot, for becoming committed in \nthe durable, lasting relationship of marriage, we find ourselves in a \nvery sorry state.\n  We need to provide relief. We need to correct this terrible mistake \nin our Tax Code which discriminates against the fundamental societal \nvalue of marriage. The Tax Code simply must stop penalizing Americans \njust because they make the right decision and they choose to get \nmarried.\n  Incidentally, this isn't only a penalty on young people. Frequently, \nthis penalty hits older Americans as well. In my home State of \nMissouri, there are 573,000 couples affected by the marriage penalty in \nthe Tax Code.\n  This bill is a raise in pay for the 25 million hard-working families \nnationwide who have been paying a penalty because they have been \nmarried. It is time for us to signal to that population that no longer \nwill we take it out on you. Because you have had the honor and the \nintegrity and the foresight and the commitment to each other, and the \ngood will to foster a family, no longer will we penalize you taxwise. \nIn my own State, it will put more money in the household budgets of \nthose half million or so married couples.\n\n  We hope to pass this needed tax relief by tax day when millions of \nAmericans feel the tax burden most acutely.\n  I predict that the President, when he gets this bill, will not veto \nit. I predict that he will, instead, recognize the need to help keep \nhard-working moms and dads in a position to provide for their children \nand not to discriminate against them merely because they are married.\n  When the time comes, I believe the President will choose to liberate \nAmerican families from paying an outrageous $29 billion per year fine \nfor being married, for having that durable lasting commitment in our \nculture.\n  I look forward to a future in America where men in this country will \nno longer have to visit an accountant before they ask the woman's \nfather for the daughter's hand in marriage.\n  I think it is time for us to say we do not want the Government \nstanding between individuals who might otherwise be married and \ncharging a toll that does not just last like the few days of a marriage \nlicense but becomes a recurrent toll that, on average, in this country \nconstitutes about $100 a month for married couples who suffer this \npenalty.\n  I rise to support this amendment. It is an amendment that should \nharmonize the Tax Code of the United States with the culture of this \ncountry and with the values of this country.\n  It is outrageous, to say the least, that when couples want to get \nmarried they have to pay the equivalent of a tax fine or a tax penalty \nin order to get married.\n  We need to have families with durable, lasting relationships. \nFamilies are the best department of social services, they are the best \ndepartment of education, they are the best department of health and \nassistance that we could ever expect in a culture. They are the core of \nwhat our civilization is all about. For us to charge extra to \nindividuals who form these families is simply wrong.\n  This is a measure which brings common sense to the Tax Code, as \nstrange as that may be. We need more common sense in the Tax Code. We \nneed less of the pernicious discrimination against wholesome, healthy \ninstitutions such as marriage.\n  It is with that in mind that we should work to mitigate the damage \nimposed on America by the marriage penalty in the tax law. As a result, \nwe have offered this amendment and look forward to its adoption by the \nSenate, and eventually to its signing by the President of the United \nStates, liberating individuals who deserve to have the resources they \nearned to support their families left in their hands and not \nconfiscated as a result merely of their marriage by the Federal \nGovernment to spend in its programs.\n  That will be a happy day not only for the married people who will be \nreleased from this kind of penalty, but it will be a happy day for this \nculture because it will signal that, indeed, we favor an institution \nthat means so much to us: long, durable, lasting relationships, through \nthe commitment of marriage, which provides the basis for our best \nfamilies. It is with that in mind we have sponsored this amendment. I \nlook forward to its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Nevada is not here, so the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden, will speak, as if he were next. His time and that of \nSenator Bryan will be taken off the Hutchison amendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that following Senator Wyden and Senator \nBryan, Senator Brownback be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2915\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Robb amendment on prescription medicine \ntells senior citizens and families across this country that the Senate \nis listening to them.\n  This amendment tells those seniors and all of those families--and I \nhave been contacted by more than 4,000--that getting prescription drug \ncoverage for older people under Medicare is a priority of this Congress \nand a priority that has to be addressed now. Pass the Robb amendment \nand you don't get into a situation where, at the end of the session, \nsomebody says, gee, there just wasn't enough time; we just weren't able \nto address that prescription drug issue; it's too bad, we will have to \nwait until the next Congress.\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\n  I think it is particularly important to pass the Robb amendment now \nbecause it builds on the important work, the important progress that \nwas made in the Budget Committee.\n  I particularly commend my colleague from Oregon in the chair today, \nSenator Smith, and also Senator Snowe, for their courage. The two of \nthem have worked with me and others for more than 15 months as a result \nof the concern of older people. We thought it was time to come together \non a bipartisan basis and get this relief for older people now.\n  I have come to the floor more than 25 times in the last few months to \ndescribe the problem of seniors who are supposed to be taking three \npills but they can only afford two. They are breaking their Lipitor \ncapsules--the ones that help lower cholesterol and various blood \npressure problems--in half because they can't afford their medicine.\n  So in the Budget Committee, as a result of the work of my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Smith, and Senator Snowe, we have made a good \nbipartisan start. We locked in $40 billion to spend on prescription \ndrugs, and we said there was a sense of urgency because the Senate \nFinance Committee ought to act on or before September 1, and if they \ndidn't, it would be possible to come directly to the floor of the \nSenate and bring this issue up so that the American people could see \nwho was on the side of covering prescription drugs for older people.\n  The older people, right now, get shellacked twice. Medicare isn't \ncovering these important therapies. There is not a specialist in health \ncare, Democrat or Republican, who would not offer this coverage if they \nwere reinventing Medicare today. But in addition to not getting \ncoverage, those older people and their families are subsidizing the big \nbuyers. If you are in a small pharmacy in rural Oregon or rural \nMinnesota, or in another community across this country, in effect, if \nyou don't have prescription drug coverage, you are out there \nsubsidizing the big buyers, the health maintenance organizations and \nthe health plans that do.\n  So the start we made in the Budget Committee by making sure there \nwould be an adequate amount of money to put this program in place, to \nmake sure we had a timetable to get the job done, so that Congress \ncould not duck this issue and would have to see action by the Finance \nCommittee or face the prospect early this fall of dealing with it on \nthe floor of the Senate--that progress in the Budget Committee is \nsomething we would build on with the Robb amendment.\n  The Robb amendment makes it very clear that Congress cannot duck this \nissue, and budgets are about more than numbers; they are about more \nthan charts and graphs and cold figures. The Robb amendment reflects \nthe hopes and aspirations of our seniors and our working families--the \nones my colleague and friend, Senator Smith, and I have met at townhall \nmeetings who came to us and told us, as so many seniors have said to \nme: I cannot make ends meet. My Social Security went up by only a \nlittle bit, and my prescription drug bill went up hundreds of dollars \nduring that period of time.\n\n  The Robb amendment says that we have been listening to those older \npeople; that we understand this issue is a priority for them, this \nissue is so important that Congress is not going to go home until it \nhas been addressed. I was very proud of what was done in the Budget \nCommittee. I think my colleague from Oregon and Senator Snowe, because \nof the many discussions we had, were under a tremendous amount of \npressure when that discussion came up because it was a very tense \nmoment.\n  I think my colleague from Oregon said it well, and the Robb amendment \nreflects this also: This is time to be on the right side of history. \nThis is time to revolutionize American health care. In effect, the \nrevolution in American health care has bypassed the Medicare program. \nThese medicines today help older people stay well. They help folks \nlower their blood pressure and cholesterol. Now we have a chance, using \ncompetitive marketplace principles, to come together and put this \nprogram in place.\n  Senator Daschle has emphasized in talking to me on almost a daily \nbasis how he wants to bring the Senate together on this issue. The \nchairman of the Budget Committee was very patient in working with us as \nwe tried to deal with this issue in committee. The Robb amendment \ncompliments those efforts, builds on those efforts by making it clear \nthat Congress should not leave for this session until we have put this \nimportant program in place.\n  For the older people of this country who average 18 prescriptions a \nyear, 20 percent of whom spend over $1,000 a year out-of-pocket on \ntheir medicines, when they see the Robb amendment get passed by the \nSenate, they will say, finally, Congress is listening to us. My friend \nand colleague from Oregon and I have had the experience where seniors \nbrought their bills to us at these sessions. When we pass the Robb \namendment, we will make it clear to those seniors and working families \nthat we have heard them. There is not a specialist in the health care \nfield, Democrat or Republican, who now doesn't believe that \nprescription drugs ought to be part of this program. This is a chance \nto revolutionize American health care, to concentrate on keeping people \nwell.\n  Just one brief example: If we can get anticoagulant medicines covered \nfor older people, which is something the Robb amendment would make \npossible, it might cost $1,000 a year for seniors to get help with that \nmedicine, and we could end up saving $100,000 in costs incurred by Part \nA of Medicare, the hospital program, when an older person suffers a \nstroke because they could not get their medicine on an outpatient \nbasis.\n  I am going to wrap up by describing what really brought this problem \nhome to me and my friend from Oregon, Senator Smith. We have been to \nHillsboro in our State many times. Recently, I got a letter from a \nphysician in Hillsboro who told me he had to put a senior citizen in a \nhospital for 6 weeks because that older person could not afford their \nmedicine on an outpatient basis. When the physician in Hillsboro, in \nour home State, put the older person in the hospital, they were able to \nget help under Part A of Medicare, the hospital portion of the program. \nBut the Government could have saved money with the effort that is \nbehind the Robb amendment and what we tried to start in the Budget \nCommittee. We could have gotten help for that senior in Hillsboro, OR, \nin a most cost-effective way, more quickly, and in a way that would \nhave left the older person more comfortable because they would have \nbeen in the community rather than in a hospital.\n\n  So I only ask, as we continue this debate--and I gather it will go \ninto tomorrow--that we focus on building on the progress that was made \nin the Budget Committee, to a great extent because two of my \ncolleagues, Senator Snowe and Senator Smith, showed real courage in \nworking with us. If we pass the Robb amendment, we build on that \nimportant progress and again demonstrate to the older people and the \nworking families of this country we are listening to them.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Robb, the effect of which would be to tie the \nconsideration of any tax cut to enactment of legislation to provide a \nprescription drug benefit under the Medicare program.\n  For many in the viewing audience, this process may seem obscure and \nconvoluted, but the budget is really an opportunity for us as a party \nand as individuals to make the case in terms of our priorities. We have \na fundamental philosophical difference with our friends on the other \nside of the aisle who have offered a majority resolution which, in my \njudgment, does not reflect the priorities of the country.\n  In my view, our priorities ought to be to reduce the national debt. \nWe have made enormous progress in the last 3 years. We have an \nopportunity to continue that progress.\n  Parenthetically, virtually every economist, as well as the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board, has made the case to us in the Finance \nCommittee, on which I am privileged to serve, in the Banking Committee, \nand generally before other committees in this Congress, that the most \nimportant thing we can do is to reduce the national debt. But I believe \nit is entirely\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\nappropriate to take some of that surplus and provide a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  The budget resolution before us offered by the majority would \ndedicate 98 percent of that surplus to finance tax cuts. In my view, \nthat is not an appropriate priority. The priority, in my judgment, is \nto provide a Medicare program with prescription drug benefits.\n  In 1956, when Lyndon Johnson and Congress enacted Medicare, it \nreflected a comparatively contemporary program. Prescription drugs were \nnot a major part of the health care of Americans. Today, nobody would \nargue, if we were adopting Medicare, that it should exclude \nprescription drug benefits. Older Americans deserve the same benefits \nof modern science the rest of us enjoy.\n\n  Prescription drugs are frequently the best and indeed the only way to \ntreat many of the diseases faced by the elderly. They have become an \nintegral part of the health care system--every bit as important as \ndoctor visits, hospital stays, and other health care services. Yet many \nseniors don't have prescription drug coverage, and most of those who do \noften have inadequate coverage. Thirty-four percent have no coverage at \nall--more than one-third of those on Medicare have no prescription drug \ncoverage at all. And another 42 percent lack meaningful coverage. By \nthat we mean the benefit is so modest, it still requires a substantial \namount of out-of-pocket dollars to purchase the prescriptions which \ntheir physicians have prescribed for them.\n  Many beneficiaries have chosen managed-care plans for access to drug \ncoverage. What is occurring is most destructive: 325,000 beneficiaries \nlost their HMO coverage this past year. For those who have not lost it \nin its entirety, many are left with very skimpy plans. Seventy-five \npercent of Medicare HMOs will limit coverage to less than $1,000 this \nyear, and 32 percent have imposed caps of less than $500. That is not \nmeaningful coverage.\n  With 22 million beneficiaries spending more than $500 annually on \nprescription drugs, and drug costs topping $9,000 for those seniors \nwith cancer or chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, the \ncurrent HMO coverage can hardly be considered adequate by any standard.\n  Retiree coverage and Medigap are frequently no better. Retiree \ncoverage is declining dramatically, and Medigap policies are out of \nreach for many seniors, with premiums averaging $1,360 a year. Indeed, \nin some States premiums greatly exceed that. For example, a 75-year-old \nMississippian faces a Medigap premium of $2,379. That is a lot of \nmoney. Most beneficiaries do not have the ability to pay that.\n  Over half of the Medicare beneficiaries without prescription drug \ncoverage are in the so-called middle class. I think it is important to \nnote what we are talking about by ``middle class.'' That is a couple \nearning greater than $17,000 annually. I don't think anyone would \nconclude that $17,000 of total annual income for a couple is adequate, \nand few I think would consider themselves securely entrenched in the \nmiddle class if they were making $17,000 a year combined. This is yet \nanother reason we need universal coverage--a policy that is affordable \nwith Medicare prescription drug benefits.\n  Medicare is an extremely popular program. Prior to 1965, seniors \nfaced a great deal of uncertainty when they needed medical care. The \nprivate sector had not responded by providing adequate, affordable \ninsurance options, and indeed almost all of the elderly in America in \n1956, 35 years ago, before the enactment of Medicare, had no coverage \nat all. They were uninsured.\n  With the creation of Medicare, we made a promise to our seniors that \nthey would have affordable, adequate health care coverage.\n  While the program has been immensely successful, Medicare today is in \nneed of reform both to strengthen and to modernize the program. We have \nfallen behind in our commitment to those promises. We are once again \nfaced with a situation in which the private sector has not provided \nadequate, affordable insurance options for prescription drugs, and \nthree-fourths of the Medicare beneficiaries lack meaningful drug \ncoverage.\n\n  The addition of an affordable, universal Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit is only one step necessary in reforming the program, but it is \na crucial step. Medicare prescription drug coverage is necessary to \nupdate the program and to keep pace with the times. It is critical to \nkeep our promise--access to necessary care and protection from \nfinancial ruin--to the Nation's Medicare beneficiaries.\n  If we were creating Medicare today, no one would suggest we should \ncreate a program without a prescription drug benefit. Anyone who votes \nagainst this amendment will need to explain to his or her senior \nconstituents why we, as Senators, have a prescription drug benefit but \nthe more vulnerable seniors among us do not.\n  It is critically important for this Congress to provide prescription \ndrug benefits. We have the opportunity to do so. We have the \ncircumstances with respect to the budget that will permit us to follow \nour priorities of reducing the national debt and providing a \nprescription drug benefit as well. We should do so, and we should do so \nthis year.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2914\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. I thank my colleague from Nevada \nfor his comments.\n  I want to address the Hutchison amendment. I ask that my time be \ncharged to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \nthe marriage penalty. And to speak in support of the pending amendment \nto the budget resolution offered by myself and by my colleagues, \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Senator John Ashcroft.\n  I have addressed this issue often, and I think Senators are familiar \nwith it. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Our sense-of-the-Senate is simple. It simply states that the Congress \nshould pass marriage penalty tax elimination legislation that begins a \nphase-out of this penalty in 2001. That the marriage penalty tax \nlegislation considered does not discriminate against stay at home \nspouses and that the Congress should consider this legislation before \nApril 15, 2000.\n  In our resolution, we note that the marriage penalty tax affects \nnearly half of married couples in America.\n  I have a chart behind me that enumerates some of those States hit by \nthe marriage penalty tax. You can see Kansas with 259,904; in Oregon, \n329,289 couples. That is times two-plus frequently because they will \nhave children.\n  We just heard from the Senator from Nevada--146,142 in that category.\n  You can see this is a broad-based tax, a broad-based penalty. This \npenalty needs to be eliminated. It is time we do it. We have the chance \nto do that now in this body within the next couple of weeks. I hope it \ndoesn't get hijacked by partisanship. I hope that can be avoided so we \ncan move on.\n  I applaud the chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman Roth, for \nhis important work on this legislation. Last week, they considered and \npassed a bill providing important marriage penalty tax relief to \nmillions of the families suffering under this. They only provide this \nrelief in some narrow areas because the marriage penalty is throughout \nthe Tax Code in about 66 different places. We do not get it all. We do \nget at key ones.\n  First, the standard deduction. We get 59 in that area of the marriage \npenalty. This year, for single taxpayers it is $4,400. However, for a \nmarried couple filing jointly, the standard deduction is only $7,350. \nOur bill is simple, clear, and fair: doubling the standard deduction, \nmaking it $8,800 for married couples filing jointly. This change begins \nfor filers in 2001.\n  Second, our bill widens the 15-percent tax bracket. Under current \nlaw, the 15-percent bracket for a single taxpayer ended at an income \nthreshold of $26,250; for married couples, it is $43,850, less than \ndouble. If our bill were fully phased in this year, the 15-percent \nbracket would extend upward to an income of $52,500. In other words, it \ndoubles the 15-percent bracket. Whether single, or married and filing \ntogether, taxpayers get the same total amount that fits under the 15-\npercent bracket. Again, it seems fair and equitable to do it that way.\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\n  Third, our bill applies the same principle of bracket widening to the \n28-percent bracket as I enumerated and listed in the 15-percent \nbracket.\n  Fourth, our bill increases the phaseout range for the earned-income \ntax credit. This is another way that most people do not realize that \nthe marriage penalty is impacting couples. The low-income families with \nchildren can incur a significant marriage penalty because of current \nlimits on the earned-income tax credit. If both spouses work, the \nphaseout of the EITC on the basis of their combined income can and does \nlead to the loss of some or all of the EITC benefits to which they \nwould be entitled as singles. Our bill works to begin fixing this \nproblem, as well. Our bill helps families at all income levels.\n  Finally, our bill permanently extends the provision that allows the \npersonal nonrefundable credits to offset both the regular tax and the \nminimum tax.\n  That is the nuts and bolts. I think the best way to talk about the \nmarriage penalty is from people who contact my office and write in, the \npeople I meet with who talk about the marriage tax penalty. They are \nfed up with it. They don't see it as fair; it doesn't make sense. They \nwonder why on Earth their Government penalizes them for the privilege \nof being married; Isn't it tough enough without this?\n  Listen to some of the letters I have received. They are clear in \nasking: Why am I being penalized for being married?\n\n                                                       Topeka, KS.\n       Dear Senator Brownback, I am a college student at Washburn \n     University. My girlfriend and I have been thinking about \n     getting married for several months.\n       As part of the planning we went through our finances. I \n     checked our taxes and found that if we were married this \n     year, we would have paid $200 extra in Federal taxes.\n       Granted that may not sound like much, but at $9 and change \n     an hour, $200 is a lot of money.\n       I calculated how much we could be making in a few years and \n     found that we will pay $600 more for being married than just \n     shacking up.\n       Basically, we have to pay $600 for the privilege of being \n     married.\n       I always thought the government tried to reward \n     constructive, positive behavior through the tax code, but it \n     is punishing one of the most socially stabilizing behaviors, \n     marriage.\n       We don't think we or anybody else should be punished for \n     being married and hope you can do something about it.\n     David.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I am writing to express my support \n     for The Marriage Tax Elimination Act recently passed in the \n     House of Representatives and to urge you to vote in support \n     of this measure when it comes to the Senate.\n       This legislation would address a serious inequity in \n     current tax law by eliminating the disparity that exists with \n     respect to the total ``standard deduction'' allowed two \n     married taxpayers versus the total ``standard deduction'' \n     allowed two single taxpayers. Tax policy should not \n     discriminate either in favor of or against two individuals \n     with respect to their decision to be married (or not be \n     married). Rather, the same total itemized deduction amount \n     should be allowed married taxpayers who choose to file \n     jointly as two individuals who file separately.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Mark.\n\n  That is basic and makes pretty good sense.\n  Another letter:\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I would like to thank you for \n     expressing your ideas and opinions on the marriage penalty \n     tax to the senate on behalf of the Kansas taxpayers.\n       Doubling the standard deduction for married couples, and \n     doing so as quickly as possible, lessens the blow with which \n     nearly 21 million couples are hit every year. I have seen \n     many people struggle with their taxes each year and I am \n     writing on behalf of these people to recognize you for your \n     tremendous effort to make their lives easier.\n\n  I have a number of letters from different individuals. Any Member in \nthis body checking their e-mail inbox will find the exact same thing. \nPeople know about the tax and don't think it is fair and we cannot \nexplain why it is right because it isn't right.\n  It is time we do away with this penalty. We have a chance this week \nto pass the budget resolution and to send a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to the rest of the body next week to pass this bill. This is \nonly a prelude to next week when we get a chance to actually pass the \nelimination of the marriage penalty.\n  I call on my colleagues to support this underlying resolution by \nSenator Hutchison from Texas, Senator Ashcroft, and myself, and next \nweek to vote in favor of eliminating the marriage penalty. It is time \nto do it.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will comment briefly on the budget \nresolution generally, but I also recognize Senator Hutchison, \nprimarily, and many others who have been working a long time for the \nrepeal of the marriage penalty which this budget accommodates.\n  We will have a historic vote in the Senate tomorrow morning. I think \nour leadership--the Senator in the Chair, the Senator from Texas, and \nmany others--deserves a lot of credit for bringing to fruition our \nefforts to eliminate this marriage tax penalty. I think tomorrow, as a \nresult, will be a historic day.\n  The budget resolution that we began considering will result in a \nbalanced Federal budget now for the third year in a row. As in the \nbudgets of the past 2 years, it will also balance the budget without \nrelying on one dime of the Social Security surplus. The last time \nCongress balanced the budget 3 years in a row without raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund was in the period of 1947 to 1949. Again, I \nthink this will be a historic year.\n  It is worth recalling where we were only 5 short years ago, to put \nthis in perspective. At that time, President Clinton, after shepherding \nthrough the largest tax increase in the history of our country, sent \nCongress a budget in 1995 that would have spent every penny of the \nSocial Security surplus and still left annual deficits stuck at about \n$200 billion for the foreseeable future. That includes this year. In \nother words, the Clinton tax increase of 1993 only paid for new \nspending. According to the President's own budget in 1995, it did not \nbring and never would bring the budget even close to balance.\n  The Clinton budget of five years ago projected a deficit that would \nhave amounted to roughly $289 billion this year alone. not counting \nSocial Security. I recall that the Senate unanimously rejected this \nproposal on May 19, 1995. Congress then went on to chart a different \ncourse, and, as a result, we managed to balance the budget, protect the \nSocial Security surplus, begin paying down the public debt, provide \nmodest tax relief, and free up additional resources to devote to other \nnational priorities, like health care, education, and defense. Balance \nwas even achieved four years earlier than initially anticipated under \nthe alternative budget we adopted in 1995.\n  But there is still much to do. The resolution reported by the Budget \nCommittee builds upon past progress by ensuring that we will protect \nthe entire $976 billion surplus that is expected to accrue to the \nSocial Security trust fund over the next five years. Setting this \nprecedent against using the Social Security surplus for other things is \nperhaps Congress' greatest accomplishment during the last two years.\n  The FY2001 budget would cut the public debt by an additional $184 \nbillion in fiscal year 2001, and by nearly $1 trillion over the five-\nyear period. It would accommodate a modest amount of tax relief--$13 \nbillion next year--still leaving over $2 trillion flowing to the \nTreasury. After accounting for the proposed tax relief, non-Social \nSecurity surpluses would still amount to $8 billion next year and $20 \nbillion over the next five years.\n  Let me stop for a moment to discuss taxes more fully. According to \nthe non-partisan Tax Foundation, the total tax burden dipped slightly \nin 1998. That's the good news. The bad news is that Americans still \nspent more on federal taxes than on any of the other major items in \ntheir household budgets. For the median-income, two-earner family, \nfederal taxes amounted to 39 percent of the family budget--more than \nwhat they spent on food, housing, and medical care combined.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, the total tax burden is still very \nhigh in historical terms. In 1955, the total tax burden was about 17.9 \npercent compared to the 39 percent it totalled in\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\n1998. The largest growth occurred in payroll taxes, and state and local \ntaxes. Adjusting for inflation, the total of all taxes paid by the two-\nearner family in 1998 was 4.9 times greater than in 1955.\n  These year-to-year comparisons provide a useful gauge, but \nultimately, the goal should be to set tax rates as low as possible \nafter the federal government has met its obligations. The substantial \nsurpluses that are projected alone suggest that we can and should \nprovide additional tax relief.\n  Another observation: According to Census Bureau data, the labor-force \nparticipation of married women, as a proportion of all married women, \nhas nearly tripled from 23 percent in 1951 to 62 percent in 1997. Some \nof that increase, no doubt, can be attributed to women pursuing their \ncareer goals, and that is a good thing. We want our mothers, wives, and \ndaughters to pursue their dreams and fulfill themselves in the \nworkplace. But I suspect that a good part of the increase can also be \nattributed to the need for many families to earn extra income to pay \ntheir bills, including their tax bill.\n  More people in the labor force means that tax rates do not have to \nrise substantially to produce more revenue for the government. But when \nmore families have to have two wage earners because they cannot make \nends meet, no one is left home with the kids. That is not such a good \nthing. providing tax relief will give more families the choice and \nopportunity to have one parent stay home to raise the children.\n  As for defense, the increase allowed in the Committee budget is \ncertainly not enough to repair the harm done by the Clinton \nAdministration's underfunding in previous years, but it builds upon the \nstart we made last year.\n  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall 10 years ago, the strength of our \nnation's military forces has shrunk from 2.1 million to slightly under \n1.4 million active-duty troops. Spending on the military has declined \n29 percent since 1989, while spending on almost all other areas of \ngovernment has gone up. Defense spending has shrunk at the same time \nthat our military has increasingly been called upon to carry out global \npeacekeeping, domestic disaster relief, the war on drugs, and other \nless traditional missions.\n\n  While many of these objectives are important, they are often pursued \nwithout regard to the wear and tear they inflict on our troops and \nequipment. If we continue to simultaneously increase demand on our \nforces and cut their budget, we will leave our country vulnerable to \npotential aggressors. Indeed, according to a review conducted last year \nby the Pentagon, the U.S. could not today muster a force equal to that \nwhich won the 1991 Persian Gulf War so rapidly and decisively.\n  Last year, Congress reversed this trend by approving an $18 billion \nincrease in defense spending to: improve the pay and benefits necessary \nto attract and keep qualified people in uniform; purchase badly needed \nnew equipment, spare parts, and maintenance; improve training; and \ndefend the United States from the growing threat of ballistic missile \nattack. Yet even this increase merely kept defense spending on pace \nwith inflation.\n  So the Budget Committee's recommendation to put more money toward \ndefense in this next budget represents a step in the right direction \nand a good effort to set priorities.\n  The Committee identified other high priorities, as well, and \nrecommended allocating significant increases toward them. For example, \nthe Committee budget would fund education at a level that is $13 \nbillion higher than last year--$600 million more than the President \nrequested. It would increase spending on veterans health by $1.1 \nbillion, and provide a like increase for the National Institutes of \nHealth for medical research. It would reserve $40 billion over five \nyears for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. These are things \nthe American people are telling us are most important to them and they \nwant funded. We do that, in this budget.\n  Of course, providing these increases in high priority areas will mean \nthat spending on other, less important activities will have to be \nrestrained. But unless we want to return to the days when Congress \nraided Social Security to pay for other programs, or to the days of big \nbudget deficits, prioritizing spending is key. We have come too far to \nabandon the discipline that has finally restored some order to the \nbudget process.\n  I will conclude by talking just briefly about one other aspect of \nthis resolution. To ensure that we ultimately do what we say is \nintended here, the budget includes some important enforcement \nprovisions. It would establish a 60-vote point order--that is, it would \neffectively require a supermajority vote to run an on-budget deficit \nand thus make it harder to raid Social Security in the future. It would \nsimilarly require a supermajority vote to declare spending as an \nemergency that is exempt from spending limits. It would establish a \nfirewall to ensure that we abide by spending limits for defense and \nnon-defense activities. And finally, it would make it much harder to \nshift appropriations into future years in order to avoid current-year \nspending limits.\n  I commend the Chairman and members of the Budget Committee for their \nwork on this resolution, and particularly acknowledge the work of \nSenators Gramm, Nickles, Gregg, and Grams, who helped hold the line on \nspending and ensure that many of the budget gimmicks employed by \nCongress and the President in recent years were not employed again. As \na result of their efforts, I think we have a much better budget.\n  I urge support for this spending plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY.

Mr. President, I have been asked whether I intend to call \nup for consideration on the Senate floor legislation that has been \nintroduced in the Senate with respect to asbestos. After conferring \nwith the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the chairman \nof the subcommittee with jurisdiction of this issue, it is clear that a \nmarkup has not yet been scheduled, and that extensive work would be \nneeded before the bill is ready for Senate floor action. I have also \nconferred with the sponsor of the bill who informs me that since the \nbill was introduced, the consensus regarding this legislation, S. 758, \nbetween industry, the plaintiffs, and other concerned parties, and \namong industry itself, appears to have deteriorated substantially. This \nbill is not ready for Senate floor action. The Senate will soon be \noccupied with budget, appropriations, tax and other legislation. For \nthese reasons, and in all candor, the necessary floor time will not be \navailable to act on the Senate asbestos bill this year.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's \ncomments and candor on this issue.\n  Last year I introduced S. 758, the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation \nAct in response to two Supreme Court rulings urging Congress to act on \nnational legislation that would fairly and efficiently compensate \nvictims of asbestos. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter wrote \nfor the court in Ortiz versus Fibreboard: ``The elephantine mass of \nasbestos cases . . . defies customary judicial administration and calls \nfor national legislation . . . to date Congress has not responded.''\n  It was my hope that this bill could serve to bring all parties \ntogether to\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\nsolve this issue. It is now clear, however, that this bill will not \nmove in its current form. As I mentioned to the majority leader, the \nconsensus regarding S. 758 between industry, the plaintiffs, and other \nconcerned parties, and among industry itself, appears to have \ndeteriorated substantially since S. 758 was introduced.\n  It is also clear that there is virtually no time in the Senate to \nconsider this bill this year. The Senate has a target adjournment date \nof October 6 this year. Before adjourning, the Senate will work to \nrepeal the Social Security earnings limit, repeal the marriage tax \npenalty, pass agriculture sanctions reform to open markets for American \nfarmers and ranchers, timely pass the budget and 13 separate \nappropriations bills, reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, give final approval to legislation to combat the \nmethamphetamine crisis, and adopt legislation to protect Social \nSecurity. These issues will take up my time this year. And these issues \nare just a partial list of the ambitious agenda for the year.\n  In light of this situation, and the fact that the House appears to be \ntaking a different approach entirely, I appreciate the majority \nleader's candid assessment of the legislative prospects for this bill. \nBecause it serves no purpose to represent that S. 758 will pass or be \nacted upon this year or in the future, I appreciate the remarks of the \nmajority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2098-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL TYLER H. FLETCHER\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary citizen and public servant who has dedicated his life to \nthe noble endeavor of law enforcement and the edification of those \ncommitted to this distinguished profession. Tyler H. Fletcher of \nHattiesburg, Mississippi, exemplifies the qualifies of honor, courage, \ndedication, and service that reflect the outstanding character of this \nformer colonel in the United States Army Military Police. With the \nretirement of Colonel Fletcher on Friday, April 7, 2000, I express my \nhighest gratitude to him for over 50 years of service and leadership to \nthe United States of America.\n  As an officer in the United States Army Military Police, Colonel \nFletcher was recognized with the Police Medal of Honor from the \nRepublic of South Vietnam, three Legion of Merit awards, the Bronze \nStar, an Army Commendation, and four Meritorious Unit Citations. After \nretirement from the Military Police in 1971, Colonel Fletcher continued \nhis exemplary service as associate professor and chairman of the \ndepartment of criminal justice at the University of Southern \nMississippi, garnering the distinction of Who's Who in American Law \nEnforcement in 1978 and the Excellence in Teaching Award in 1980.\n  Colonel Fletcher's extraordinary accomplishments in the professional \narena are matched only by his dedication to the service of his fellow \nAmericans. He has greatly contributed to the field of law enforcement \nby authoring numerous books and articles on the subjects of \ncorrectional administration, juvenile justice, and community policing. \nHe is a pioneer in his research into areas of police education, crimes \nagainst the elderly, and victims of crime in Mississippi. He is a \nleader in his field as an active contributor to the National Society of \nPolice and Criminal Psychology, the Mississippi Association of chiefs \nof Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nNational Council on Crime and Delinquency, the Disabled Americans \nVeterans, and the Mississippi Corrections Officers Association.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished career of Colonel Tyler H. Fletcher \nassociates him with the best of the best in the United States, \nsurpassing the accolades of personal accomplishments and awards only \nwith the gift of inspiration to future leaders and former colleagues. \nColonel Fletcher is a great American, and his service to his country, \nhis profession, and his fellow man serves as the benchmark by which we \nall should hope to achieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2098-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JOSEPH ILETO POST OFFICE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that yesterday the \nSenate unanimously passed a bill I introduced to name a United States \nPost Office after Joseph Santos Ileto. He was the U.S. Postal Service \nemployee of Filipino descent who was brutally gunned down last August \nby the same man who opened fire on the North Valley Jewish Community \nCenter. This bill designates the new post office located at 14071 \nPeyton Drive in Chino Hills, California as the ``Joseph Ileto Post \nOffice.''\n  Joseph Ileto's death on the job exemplifies the ultimate sacrifice of \npublic service. He served our nation with honor and will be remembered \nby his family, friends, and community as a kind-hearted man who touched \nmany lives. Despite the tragedy of his death, we can take comfort in \nknowing that Joseph's life will continue to touch others.\n  By passing this bill, Congress recognizes the urgent need to address \nand condemn hate crimes and racism. Dedication of the newly constructed \npost office in Joseph's hometown is the very least we can do to honor a \nman who gave his life to his country.

Mr. President, in less than a month's time, we will \ncelebrate the first Memorial Day of the second millennium, our first \nopportunity in this new century to honor and salute the men and women \nwho, through the decades, have sacrificed so gallantly to keep us free. \nIt will be our first opportunity to thank them publicly for the \nsacrifice they made, the pain they suffered, and the trauma they \nendured to ensure that the flame of freedom would never be \nextinguished.\n  Each and every one of those patriots, Mr. President, those who died, \nthose who returned, and those we are blessed to still have with us, \nshouldered squarely the highest responsibility of citizenship; remained \ndedicated to the survival of our Nation; were willing to pay the \nhighest price to preserve peace and freedom. And they risked it all \nunder the one symbol that summed up their strength and sharpened their \ncourage--our bright banner of red, white, and blue.\n  We are a Nation of images and symbols, but that's not a 21st century \nphenomenon. It has always been so. Throughout our history, we have been \ncaptivated by scenes that seem to capture all the emotion of a \nparticular event--George Washington's winter encampment at Valley \nForge, Robert E. Lee's last ride to Appomattox along a path lined by \nranks of Union troops standing at attention, JFK's funeral cortege \nmaking its way to Arlington across the Memorial Bridge.\n  But the most poignant image of all--the one that will live forever in \nthe hearts and minds of all Americans--is the image of a handful of \nMarines braced against a whipping Pacific wind, raising the American \nflag over Iwo Jima.\n  That symbol of freedom that flies over the dome of the building in \nwhich we now stand, that adorns the flagpoles of our schools and \ncommunities, that graces the windows and doorways of our homes, that is \ndraped in silent tribute over the coffins of our dead--that symbol \ndeserves our protection.\n  It should not, under any--any--circumstances be desecrated. And that \nis why I support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ensure that \nthis is so.\n  The Constitutional Amendment proposed by this resolution is \nsurprisingly simple--astoundingly simple when compared to anything that \nemanates from Washington these days. It does not dictate a particular \ncourse of action to the states. It does not threaten the separation of \npowers. It does not set a complex set of rules and regulations that \nrequire a team of lawyers to interpret. It does not change the \nintegrity of the Constitution. And it does not cost the taxpayers one \ncent. The entire amendment is contained in a single sentence: ``The \nCongress and the States shall have power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag of the United States.''\n  To those who maintain that this amendment would be a violation of \nFirst, I quote perhaps the greatest proponent of First Amendment \nfreedoms, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who stated, ``It passes my \nbelief that\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\nanything in the Federal Constitution bars making the deliberate burning \nof the American flag an offense.'' Let me repeat: ``It passes my belief \nthat anything in the Federal Constitution bars making the deliberate \nburning of the American flag an offense.''\n  Let us not let one more Memorial Day pass without clarifying and \ncodifying that protection. Let us not let one more soldier, sailor, \nairman or marine nobly and unselfishly risk his life without honoring \nhim and the ideals for which he is willing to die, without protecting \nthe most sacred and visible symbol of his freedom.\n  Let us not let one more minute pass, without enacting into law, and \nsending to the states, this amendment to protect the flag under which \nso many--so many--were willing to, as one soldier-poet put it, ``taste \ndeath in youth so that Liberty might grow old.''\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, last week the Senate engaged in an \nemotionally charged debate about one of our nation's most precious and \nbeloved symbols, the flag. American history is rich with examples of \nthe significance of our flag. Francis Scott Key's lyrics equate our \n``star spangled banner'' with the essence of our national identity, \n``the land of the free and the home of the brave.'' Betsy Ross is known \nto school children from the Aleutian Islands to the Florida Keys as the \nwoman who painstakingly sewed our first flag. Many Senators referred to \nthe raising of the flag by a handful of beleaguered, yet still brave, \nMarines on Iwo Jima. And who among us will ever forget the sight of \nNeil Armstrong planting the flag on the moon as he took that giant step \nfor mankind. During the Judiciary Committee's hearings on S.J. Res. 14, \nthe proposed Constitutional Amendment to protect the flag, Senator \nMcCain told of a fearless POW who fashioned a flag from scraps of \nmaterial. Each night under threat of torture, an extraordinary group of \nprisoners displayed the makeshift flag and renewed their commitment to \ndemocracy and their courage to withstand a barbarous imprisonment.\n  As children, we started each day with our hands respectfully pressed \nto our hearts as we recited the pledge of allegiance. As Senators, we \nstart the day in much the same manner, renewing our respect for this \nvisible symbol of democracy.\n  Unlike Senator McCain and Senator Bob Kerry, some of us have not \nserved our country in the military. Our national pride, our fundamental \ncourage, our commitment to country has not been tested on the \nbattlefield, but just a few months ago, I stood in the well of this \nChamber and, as my wife held the Bible on which my left hand rested, I \nswore to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution is the document that \nprovides each citizen with broad rights. It doesn't fly majestically in \nfront of government buildings. We do not pledge allegiance to it each \nday. Yet, it is the source of our freedom. It tells us that we are free \nto assemble peacefully. We are free to speak and publish without fear \nof censorship. We are free to worship without interference; free from \nunlawful search and seizure; and free to choose our leaders. It is \nthese freedoms that define what it is to be an American.\n  In its more than 200 years, the Constitution has been amended only 27 \ntimes. With the exception of the Eighteenth Amendment which was later \nrepealed, these amendments have reaffirmed and expanded individual \nfreedoms. This Resolution would not have expanded our rights. This \nAmendment, instead, would limit individual freedom.\n  As I think about this effort to amend the Constitution, I cannot help \nbut conclude that in a free society, respect cannot be mandated. It \nsprings from the heart. Furthermore, it seems ironic that the Senate \nwould endeavor to protect this symbol of freedom by acting to limit the \nvery freedom it represents.\n  I am gratified to know that Senator Bob Kerrey, the only Member of \nthe Senate who holds the Congressional Medal of Honor, and General \nColin Powell, a living symbol of patriotism, also oppose this \nResolution.\n  My heartfelt belief that this is the wrong approach was shaped by a \nman whose life was spent in a passionate struggle to protect and \nconserve the Constitution in the face of menacing threats. The early \nTwentieth Century was marked by World War I and by the Bolshevik \nRevolution, a time in world history during which the ``Red Scare'' was \nvery real. Zechariah Chafee, a young Harvard Law professor and civil \nlibertarian, wrote eloquently about ``Freedom of Speech in Wartime.'' \nZechariah Chafee argued that even during wartime the freedom of speech \nguaranteed by the First Amendment must be upheld. He wrote, ``[A] \nprovision like the First Amendment to the federal Constitution is much \nmore than an order to Congress not to cross the boundary which makes \nthe extreme limits of lawful suppression. It is also an exhortation and \na guide for the action of Congress inside that boundary. It is a \ndeclaration of a national policy in favor of the public discussion of \nall public questions.'' My great uncle had the courage to stand up for \nour Constitutional rights during a time of extremely high emotions in \nour national history. I am inspired by his example to defend that which \nseparates this nation from all others--our freedoms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2099-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2099-S2100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL ESTUARY CONSERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, I rise to commend the Senate \nfor passing, last Thursday, S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration \nPartnership Act. Section 12 of this legislation is taken from \nlegislation that I introduced, S. 878, with Senators Boxer, Gregg, \nMack, Graham, Kennedy, Lieberman, Moynihan, Reed, Feinstein, Kerry, \nMurray, and Sarbanes.\n  Today our nationally significant estuaries are threatened by \npollution, development, or overuse. With 45 percent of the Nation's \npopulation residing in estuarine areas, there is a compelling need for \nus to promote comprehensive planning and management efforts to restore \nand protect them.\n  Estuaries are significant habitat for fish, birds, and other wildlife \nbecause they provide safe spawning grounds and nurseries. Seventy-five \npercent of the U.S. commercial fish catch depends on estuaries during \nsome stage of their life. Commercial and recreational fisheries \ncontribute $111 billion to the nation's economy and support 1.5 million \njobs. Estuaries are also important to our nation's tourist economy for \nboating and outdoor recreation. Coastal tourism in just four states--\nNew Jersey, Florida, Texas, and California--totals $75 billion.\n  Due to their popularity, the overall capacity of our nations's \nestuaries to function as healthy productive ecosystems is declining. \nThis is a result of the cumulative effects of increasing development \nand fast growing year round populations which increase dramatically in \nthe summer. Nowhere is this more pronounced than New Jersey. At \nBarnegat Bay, the population doubles in the summer months.\n  Land development, and associated activities that come with people's \ndesire to live and play near these beautiful resources, cause runoff \nand storm water discharges that contribute to siltation, increased \nnutrients, and other contamination. Bacterial contamination closes many \npopular beaches and shellfish harvesting areas in estuaries. Also, \nseveral estuaries are afflicted by problems that still require \nsignificant research. Examples include the outbreaks of the toxic \nmicrobe, Pfiesteria piscicida, in rivers draining to estuaries in \nMaryland and Virginia.\n  Congress recognized the importance of preserving and enhancing \ncoastal environments with the establishment of the National Estuary \nProgram in the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987. The Program's \npurpose is to facilitate state and local governments preparation of \ncomprehensive conservation and management plans for threatened \nestuaries of national significance. In support of this effort, Section \n320 of the Clean Water Act authorized the EPA to make grants to states \nto develop environmental management plans. To date, 28 estuaries across \nthe country have been designated. However, the law fails to provide \nassistance once plans are complete and ready for implementation. \nAlready, 22 of the 28 plans are finished.\n  As the majority of plans are now in the implementation stage, it is \nincumbent upon us to maintain the partnership the Federal government \ninitiated ten years ago to insure that our nationally significant \nestuaries are protected. S. 835 will take the next step by including \nlanguage from S. 878 that will give EPA the authority to make\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\ngrants for plan implementation and authorize annual appropriations in \nthe amount of $25 million. I am also hopeful that when this bill goes \nto conference, this authorization can be increased to $50 million. With \nsuch an increase areas will be able to upgrade sewage treatment plants, \nfix combined sewer overflows, control urban stormwater discharges, and \nreduce polluted runoff into estuarine areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2100-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, throughout my great State of \nWashington, there are thousands of gifted students who need some extra \ntime and attention to help further their talents. At Skyline Elementary \nin Ferndale, a teacher by the name of Greg Hart, has turned a program \ncreated by the school district into a tremendous success and created an \nenvironment where gifted students can excel. For his achievements with \ngifted students in the Aiming High program, I am proud to award him \nwith my next ``Innovation in Education'' Award.\n  The Aiming High program consists of students from all over the \nFerndale School Districts for gifted students in the top 1 to 2-percent \nof the district and was created by the Ferndale School District to \nencourage highly capable students to develop critical thinking and \nanalytical skills, act responsibly and respectfully, and promote \npositive self-esteem. Mr. Hart's classes consists of fifth and sixth \ngrade students.\n  Both the Ferndale Superintendent and Skyline Principal believe that \nMr. Hart is the driving force behind the success of this program. One \nof the ways Mr. Hart improves student learning is by tackling issues of \nnational and historical importance. Students must work together on \nresearch projects and give presentations to their classmates. One of \nthe most recent projects was by two students who focused on race in the \nUnited States and how it was manifested on the baseball field. Mr. Hart \nbelieves that by empowering children, they become better learners and \nhave the confidence to tackle topics and develop skills well-beyond \ntheir grade level.\n  Superintendent Roger Lenhert describes Mr. Hart as the model of an \nideal teacher. His energy in the classroom motivates his students to \nnot only to advance in their studies, but to also pursue goals and \ninterests outside of the classroom. Mr. Hart also encourages his \nstudents to act responsibly and to treat others with respect.\n  Mr. Hart's students succeed in academic competitions, both under his \ntutelage and after, and he continue to guide his students well after \nthey left the elementary school. I am told by Dr. Berres that it is not \nuncommon to see Mr. Hart's old students coming by his classroom to \nvisit him and to update him on their current achievements. It is clear \nby the visits of his former students and praising words of the \nsuperintendent and principal that Mr. Hart makes an enormous impact on \nhis students.\n  Educators like Greg Hart clearly demonstrate that it is the people \nthat know our children's names--their parents, their teachers, their \nadministrators, and their school board members--who will make the best \ndecisions about their education. I applaud Mr. Hart's hard work and \ndedication to his students and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing his outstanding contribution to education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2100-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF DAVID AND DOREEN HERMELIN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nextraordinary couple from my home state of Michigan. David and Doreen \nHermelin will be given the Dream Maker Award and the Rabbi Jacob Segal \nAward by Hillel Day School of Metropolitan Detroit on June 6, 2000.\n  It is truly fitting that among the honors David and Doreen will \nreceive is the Dream Maker Award. The Award is given to those who have \ndemonstrated an extraordinary commitment to the community and \nespecially to Jewish education. It can be fairly said that David and \nDoreen are ``Dream Makers,'' because they both have committed so much \nof their lives to making people's dreams come true.\n  One of David Hermelin's mottos is ``The harder you work, the luckier \nyou get.'' Thanks to his and Doreen's hard work, countless people in \nMetro Detroit have found themselves wealthy in luck as well. David and \nDoreen have opened their home for hundreds of charitable fundraisers, \nand their efforts on behalf of these good causes do not stop with \nopening their front door. They both have personally raised tens of \nmillions of dollars for organizations that serve people in need in \nMichigan and in Israel as well. David's reputation as a fundraiser has \nbecome so widely recognized, in fact, that he has been known to joke \nthat people wouldn't recognize him if his hand was in his pocket. But \nas he often notes, he asks people to contribute their time or talents \nto those in need ``not until it hurts, but until it feels good.'' Maybe \nthat's the secret to David and Doreen's seemingly endless capacity for \nhelping others--it truly does feel good.\n  Added to all of their other accomplishments, David just finished an \nextraordinary tour as U.S. Ambassador to Norway. He and Doreen made a \nvery positive impact on our relations with this great ally. They played \na major role in arranging for a United States Presidential visit, the \nfirst in a long time, and when my wife Barbara and I visited Norway, it \nwas obvious from everyone we met that our country could not have \nselected a greater representative and symbol of what we stand for.\n  David and Doreen Hermelin's commitment to helping others is truly \nworthy of recognition, not only by Hillel Day School of Metropolitan \nDetroit but also by all of us. I know my colleagues will join me in \noffering them congratulations on this special occasion and a heartfelt \nthank you for all that they have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2100-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2100-S2101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE HUMANITARIAN WORK OF MR. JAMES KELLY IN MOLDOVA\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to recognize one of my constituents, Mr. James Kelley of \nFort Wayne, Indiana, for his humanitarian work in the country of \nMoldova.\n  Moldova is a small country located between Ukraine and Romania. \nThroughout the Cold War it was a part of the Soviet Union but recently \ngained its independence from the USSR on August 27, 1991. The United \nStates has supported Moldova in its journey toward democracy and \nsovereignty.\n  I met with Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi last year in \nWashington. We discussed some of the challenges facing the newly \nindependent Moldova. Our meeting revolved around U.S. security \nassistance including counter-proliferation training, efforts to combat \norganized crime and border security training. We also discussed our \ncooperation to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The United States and Moldova have enjoyed a positive\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\ntrack record of cooperation, and I am hopeful that this relationship \nwill continue.\n  Of the many challenges for this new country, two of the most pressing \nare economic growth and the health of the Moldovan people. In an effort \nto create economic growth in the region, Mr. Kelley established a grain \nbusiness in Moldova's farm communities. With a purchase of a grain \nelevator he provided opportunity for many farmers to market their \ncrops. This effort to bolster a local economy will assist in relieving \nthe financial burden many families face in these rural communities.\n  In an effort to address the pressing health care needs of this \nnation, Mr. Kelley recently led a group of Fort Wayne area health \nprofessionals to Moldova. The team of trained physicians, nurses and \nhealth care professionals performed necessary surgeries, administered \ntreatments, delivered medical equipment, supplies and medicines to the \nRepublican Hospital in Chisinau.\n  I commend Mr. Kelley for his energy and commitment to helping the \npeople of Moldova. His leadership and selfless dedication to helping \nothers have made a difference in this small country.\n  Good relationships between the United States and former Soviet \nrepublics, such as Moldova, enhance the security of the United States. \nI am pleased to recognize the contributions of a fellow Hoosier in this \nimportant effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2101-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO RABBI PHILIP LAZOWSKI\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nman who, for 45 years, has served the Greater Hartford community with \nhonor and distinction. On April 9, 2000 the friends of Beth Hillel \nSynagogue will mark the retirement of Rabbi Philip Lazowski at a dinner \ncelebration in his honor.\n  Since accepting the position of Spiritual Leader at Congregation Beth \nSholom in 1955, Rabbi Lazowski has helped the families of his \ncongregation find strength through the principles of faith, humility, \ndetermination, forgiveness, and service. As the congregation has grown \nto include hundreds of families and take the name Beth Hillel \nSynagogue, Rabbi Lazowski has continued to impart his wisdom on these \nprinciples with the same energy and enthusiasm that has been his \ntrademark. Through a number of books and interfaith efforts, Rabbi \nLazowski has earned a lofty position within the state's distinguished \nhistory of spiritual leaders.\n  A survivor of the Holocaust, Rabbi Lazowski has also left his mark on \nthe countless young people across the region who have heard him speak \nabout his childhood in Poland during World War II. From the town of \nBelitza to the Dvorets ghetto to more than a year of hiding in the \nwoods, his story has resonated within the youth of the community. With \nhis many talks and presentations on this dark chapter of human history, \nRabbi Lazowski has embraced his obligation to history and has proven \nthat the light of truth can dispel all shadow.\n  For more than a quarter century, Rabbi Lazowski has served as \nChaplain for the Hartford Police Department and has recently been named \nChaplain for the Connecticut State Senate. His commitment to the \nspiritual health, not only of his congregation but all of the Greater \nHartford area, is truly beyond question. Although he will be retiring \nfrom his position as Spiritual Leader of Beth Hillel Synagogue, I have \nevery confidence that he will remain active as leader, educator and \nfriend to the people of Connecticut.\n  Rabbi Lazowski stands as a shining example of the type of selfless \nindividual that keeps our communities vibrant. It is with great \npleasure that I formally extend to him my very best wishes on this \nspecial day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2101-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING GENE R. ``ROCKY'' ROCCABRUNA\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on March 15, 2000, Gene R. \n``Rocky'' Roccabruna retired as Director of the State of Wyoming's \nDepartment of Transportation. Mr. Roccabruna stepped down from his \nposition after rendering more than 30 years of outstanding public \nservice. I regret his departure in the sense that it is indeed a loss \nto both the agency he headed and to the traveling public at large. But \nat the same time, I wish to extend, on behalf of my state's \nCongressional delegation, our gratitude for a job well done and our \nsincerest wishes for a long and happy retirement.\n  Mr. Roccabruna's retirement represents a milestone in Wyoming highway \nhistory as he was the last active Department of Transportation employee \nwhose association with the agency dated back to the beginning of \nInterstate Highway System in 1956. After starting as an engineer \ntrainee, he earned steady promotions and soon was in charge of multi-\nmillion dollar highway construction contracts. Several sections of \nInterstate 80 were built under his supervision and that road has since \nbecome not only Wyoming's busiest highway but a major artery for \ntranscontinental commerce as well.\n  Mr. Roccabruna left the employ of state government to start his own \ncontracting business but later returned and went on to hold several \nmanagerial positions within the Department of Transportation. His \nreputation grew along with his responsibilities. He became widely \nrecognized for abilities as a good listener and consensus builder. For \nthese and numerous other good reasons, Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer \nappointed him in December 1996 to head the Department, which is the \nlargest Wyoming state agency. During the past three-plus years, I, \nSenator Enzi and Representative Cubin, and our staffs, have had \nnumerous opportunities to work with Mr. Roccabruna on many important \nstate and national transportation issues. His advice was particularly \nvaluable when we helped craft the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century, and his contributions will provide benefits well into the \nfuture. While I look forward to a continuing good relationship with the \nWyoming DOT under its new director, Sleeter C. Dover, I take this \nopportunity to again say thanks to Mr. Roccabruna for dedicating so \nmuch of his time and talents to making transportation more efficient, \nmore enjoyable and safer for Wyoming residents and the entire traveling \npublic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2101-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2101-S2102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OSHKOSH SENIORS CENTER\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th \nAnniversary of the Oshkosh Seniors Center. Since its beginnings in a \nsingle room at the First Presbyterian Church in 1975, the Oshkosh \nSeniors Center has grown to occupy the present site at 200 North \nCampbell Road.\n  Friends of the Oshkosh Seniors Center were crucial to the success of \nraising $500,000 of the $1.2 million needed to build the beautiful \nfacility on Campbell Road. The Friends of the Center, on behalf of the \nCity of Oshkosh, worked unfailingly to realize what has become a first \nclass center for senior citizens. They remain committed to meeting the \ndemands of the continuing growth of the Center. Just as the dedication \nof the Friends of the Center has remained steadfast, the staff and \nvolunteers of the Oshkosh Seniors Center have never wavered from its \nstated mission in 1975 ``to become a multi-purpose seniors center.''\n  The center meets the social, physical and emotional needs of senior \ncitizens in the Oshkosh community by providing inter-generational, \nsocial, recreational, cultural and volunteer opportunities. These goals \nare supported by more than one hundred programs and activities in arts \nand crafts, fine arts, continuing education, games and recreation, \ncommunity services, support groups, health and wellness, and other \nevents. These offerings have been delivered at the center and at \nseveral locations in the area to thousands of people during the past \nyear.\n  It is through the efforts of the center's Director, Sue Kreibich, \nstaff members and countless volunteers who work diligently to make \ncertain the Oshkosh Seniors Center continues to offer opportunities \nthat allows senior citizens of the Oshkosh community to remain active \nand involved.\n  The center will observe its twenty-fifth anniversary during the week \nof April 2nd by announcing the inauguration of the Oshkosh Seniors \nCenter Endowment Fund. This Fund will allow the organization to meet \nthe needs of expansion to accommodate the substantial growth that \ncontinues at the\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\ncenter. It is organizations like the Oshkosh Seniors Center and their \nfriends that make Oshkosh a stronger community.\n  Congratulations to the Oshkosh Seniors Center on their 25th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2102-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LATE JOSEPH L. FISHER\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, it is my privilege to be a co-sponsor \nof S. 2234, a bill which recognizes the exceptional service of two \nformer Congressmen from Northern Virginia, Joseph L. Fisher and Joel T. \nBroyhill, by renaming two area facilities of the United States Postal \nService in their honor. I'd like to say a few words about one of the \nhonorees, the late Joseph L. Fisher.\n  I knew Joe Fisher well. He was a friend, colleague and mentor. Joe \nepitomized the very best in public service--with his integrity, first-\nrate intellect, decency and compassion for others.\n  It was Joe who provided me with my first formal entry into Virginia \npolitics when I hosted a reception for his re-election bid to the \nArlington County Board in 1971. He earned the respect of his fellow \nArlingtonians with his ten years of service on the Board, including two \nterms as its Chairman. In championing regional solutions to many of the \nissues that faced Arlington County, he was ahead of his time. At \nvarious points during his tenure on the Board, he represented Arlington \nas Chairman of both the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority \nand the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.\n  My first time handing out literature at the polls in Virginia on \nElection Day was for Joe's first successful campaign for Congress in \n1974--I remember the experience well because it rained most of the day. \nWe were all proud of Joe's service in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. He was a recognized leader in Congress on tax, energy \nand budget issues. Joe was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee in \nhis first term, and he facilitated the work of seven tasks forces in \nwriting the Energy Policy Act of 1978.\n  In 1982, the year I took the oath as Governor of Virginia and about a \nyear after the end of his service in Congress, I persuaded Joe to join \nmy Cabinet as Virginia's Secretary of Human Resources. As in every \nother endeavor he undertook during his lifetime, Joe led the Department \nof Human Resources with distinction. He succeeded in eliminating \nVirginia's Medicaid deficit which had resulted from recession and \ncutbacks at the federal level. Joe also left a legacy of improvements \nin Virginia's prevention efforts in such areas as health, social \nservices, mental health, rehabilitation, job training and independent \nliving. After serving in my Administration, Joe spent the remainder of \nhis professional years as a professor of political economy at George \nMason University where he inspired many a student.\n  However, Joe Fisher's service as a public official only tells part of \nthe story. He served his country in the Pacific during World War II. \nJoe worked his way through college as a professional boxer and was also \na semi-professional basketball player in the Northern New England \nLeague. He was a Harvard trained economist and led the Unitarian \nUniversalist Association.\n  Joe passed away in 1992 from cancer. He left behind his most \nimportant legacy--a wonderful family. His wife Peggy, an exceptionally \ntalented individual in her own right and the secret to Joe's success, \nremains a valued friend to me and my family. Joe is also survived by \nseven children, sixteen grandchildren and two great grandchildren.\n  In a sermon he wrote entitled ``Endings and Beginnings,'' Joe \nreferred to ``the only immortality we can count on'' as ``the \nimmortality of the good and worthy life whose influence lives on in the \nhearts and minds of those whom it touches.'' Joe Fisher lived this \n``good and worthy life'' and his influence will always live on in those \nwhom he had such an indelible impact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2102-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECOND COMPANY GOVERNOR'S FOOT GUARD\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the \noldest military organizations in the United States, founded even before \nour country became a unified nation; the Second Company Governor's Foot \nGuard of New Haven. Later this week the men and women of the Second \nCompany will celebrate their 225th anniversary which is truly a \nmonumental observance in this first year of the new millennium.\n  Mr. President, let me share with you the history of the Second \nCompany because it is essentially, the history of the new nation and \nthe colonies that became the United States of America. The first \nmeeting of the yet to be named military organization was during the \nwinter of 1774 and included many men whose names are known to every \nstudent who has studied American history; Benedict Arnold, Ethan Allen \nand Aaron Burr. Later that winter, on March 2, 1775, fifty eight men \nsigned a memorial to form themselves into a military company. At that \ntime, the General Assembly of the Governor and Colony of Connecticut \nwas sitting in New Haven and made this memorial special business. On \nthat same day, recognizing the importance and significance of this \nmemorial, the General Assembly granted a charter to the Second Company \nGovernor's Foot Guard. It didn't take long for the Second Company \nGovernor's Foot Guard to see action when, at the beginning of the \nAmerican Revolution, under the command of Captain Benedict Arnold, the \nSecond Company answered the Lexington Alarm, seized the stores of \ngunpowder at the Town of New Haven and marched to the Siege of Boston. \nThe date was April 22, 1775, and each year the Second Company \nGovernor's Foot Guard performs a colorful reenactment of this event on \nPowder House Day in New Haven.\n  Three years later, during the British invasion on July 2, 1779, \nCaptain Hezekiah Sabin and the Second Company Governor's Foot Guard \ndefended New Haven at the bridge over the West River. Time and again \nour nation has been defended by the Second Company Governor's Foot \nGuard. In 1861 the Second Company formed a war company which was known \nas the Company K, Sixth Connecticut Volunteers, left for the front in \nthe Civil War, and fought in twenty six battles and skirmishes before \nbeing mustered out in August of 1865.\n  Since 1775, the Second Company Governor's Foot Guard has been escort \nto every Governor of the Colony and the State of Connecticut and has \nserved as honor guard to fourteen American Presidents and in our \nBicentennial Year, the Queen of England. Mr. President, were it not for \nthe dedicated service of the Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard for \nthe past 225 years, I dare say the history of Connecticut, the \nConstitution State, as well as the United States of America would be \ndifferent. Every one of us in this Chamber owes a debt of gratitude to \nthe Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard. As the Second Company \ncelebrates 225 years of service, under the leadership of Major \nCommandant Peter A. Wasilewski, I rise in humble thanks to the hundreds \nof men and women who have proudly worn the red coat uniform and to \nthose who will in the future. I ask those in this Chamber to join me in \nhonoring the Second Company Governor's Foot Guard for 225 years of \nservice to the Governor, the General Assembly and the people of the \nColony and State of Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2102-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2102-S2103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DIONNE A. COLE NAMED ACHIEVER OF THE MONTH\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in October of 1993, the State of \nMichigan Family Independence Agency commemorated the first anniversary \nits landmark welfare reform initiative, To Strengthen Michigan \nFamilies, by naming its first Achiever of the Month. In each month \nsince, the award has been given to an individual who participates in \nthe initiative and has shown outstanding progress toward self-\nsufficiency. I rise today to recognize Ms. Dionne A. Cole, who was the \nrecipient of the award for the month of March, 2000.\n  Ms. Cole is the single mother of a three-year-old son. She began \nreceiving assistance from the Family Independence Agency in September \nof 1999. Though at this time she was a single mother with no job \nexperience, through a self-initiated job search Ms. Cole obtained \nemployment as a security guard for Strategic Protection Group that same \nmonth. To ease the transition,\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\nF.I.A. assisted Ms. Cole with child care and provided her with funds to \npurchase a car.\n  In December of 1999, her cash assistance from F.I.A. ended because of \nearned income. Nonetheless, by budgeting her money wisely, Ms. Cole \nrecently has signed the lease on her first apartment. With the help of \nher Family Independence Specialist, electric and heat accounts were \nestablished for her at this residence.\n  Ms. Cole has her high school diploma and would like to attend Wayne \nCounty Community College to study Business Management. Her ultimate \ngoal is to own her own beauty shop.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Ms. Dionne Cole for being named Achiever of \nthe Month for March of 2000. It is an honor for which she has worked \nvery hard and she truly deserves. On behalf of the entire United States \nSenate, I congratulate Ms. Cole, and wish her continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2103-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HILLEL JEWISH DAY SCHOOL HONORS MR. AND MRS. DAVID HERMELIN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today in \nrecognition of David and Doreen Hermelin, long-time residents of \nDetroit, Michigan. The couple recently returned home from Norway, where \nMr. Hermelin served as United States Ambassador. On June 6, 2000, the \nHermelins will be honored by Hillel Day School, an independent \nConservative Jewish Day School located in Farmington Hills, Michigan. \nTogether, they will receive the 2000 Dream Maker Award, which \nrecognizes the achievements of a person or persons who are committed to \nthe cause of Jewish education, and also the Rabbi Jacob Segal Award, \ngiven annually in blessed memory of Rabbi Segal, one of the founders of \nHillel Day School.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Hermelin have often been recognized for their dedication \nto the Jewish community, both nationally and internationally. Before \nhis ambassadorship, Mr. Hermelin served as the International Chairman \nof State of Israel Bonds, and as Vice-Chair of United Jewish Appeal. He \nhas been honored by the State of Israel with the Golda Meir Leadership \nAward, given the Knights of Charity Award by the Archdiocese of \nDetroit, and received the Golden Menorah Award for Community Service \nfrom B'nai B'rith. Mrs. Hermelin is a recipient of the Women of Valor \nAward from the State of Israel Bonds, the Humanitarian Award from B'nai \nB'rith, the Heart of Gold from the United Foundation, and was also \nnamed the Woman of the Year by B'nai B'rith Women.\n  The Hermelin's philanthropic and humanitarian work has extended well \npast the bounds of their faith. Mrs. Hermelin currently serves on the \nBoard of Directors of the Michigan Foundation for the Arts and on the \nBoard of Trustees of the Michigan Opera Theater and the Michigan \nParkinson's Foundation. She is a member of the Cranbrook Art \nAssociation and the Women's Committee of the Michigan Lung Association. \nMr. Hermelin serves on the Board of Directors of the Community \nFoundation for Southeastern Michigan, the Greater Detroit Interfaith \nRound Table, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra Hall. He sits on the \nBoard of Trustees of the Michigan Developmental Foundation and on the \nAdvisory Board of the United Way for Southeastern Michigan. Together, \nDavid and Doreen have volunteered their efforts on behalf of Friends of \nModern Art of the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Children's Hospital \nof Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that June 6 will be a special day for David \nand Doreen Hermelin. They have long supported Hillel Day School, and \ntheir eldest of six grandchildren, Matthew Orley, will also be rewarded \nby the school this spring, with his high-school diploma.\n  It is my hope that these two events remind David Hermelin and Doreen \nCurtis how far they have come since they first met at Camp Tamakwa in \n1949. I also hope that they take the time to think about just how many \nlives they have touched with their many charitable efforts.\n  Mr. President, I would like to welcome Ambassador and Mrs. Hermelin \nback to metropolitan Detroit. While I do appreciate the work the couple \ndid in Norway, it is my preference that they stay in Michigan for a \nwhile. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate \nDavid and Doreen Hermelin on receiving the 2000 Dream Maker Award and \nthe Rabbi Jacob Segal Award, and I applaud Hillel Day School for \nrecognizing this magnificent pair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2103-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO MR. JIM CASH\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and in \nmemory of a dear friend of mine, Mr. Jim Cash, who passed away on March \n24 at the age of 59. Jim is internationally recognized as a screenplay \nwriter. He co-wrote the movies ``Top Gun,'' ``The Secret of My \nSuccess,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' and ``Turner and Hooch,'' among others. I \nwould like to recognize him today, however, not for his writing \nachievements, but for his contributions to the Lansing, Michigan, \ncommunity, and the campus of our alma mater, Michigan State University. \nIt is there, I believe, where his words found their most attentive \nlisteners. It is also there where they had their most profound effects.\n  Jim began teaching a film history course at Michigan State in 1974, \ntaking the job as an adjunct professor. He hoped only to earn some \nmoney to continue his screenplay writing. When he and co-writer Jack \nEpps, Jr., a former student, found success together in the mid-1980's, \nit would have been easy for Jim to leave Michigan State behind for the \nbrighter pastures of Hollywood. Instead, Jim stayed in Lansing. He \nstayed because he had discovered that he loved to teach as much as he \nloved to write. And the reason that he loved teaching was because he \nloved instilling into his students the same love for writing and for \nfilm that he had. Witnessing this process occur in his students never \ngot old. He stayed, Mr. President, because he realized that with his \nteaching he had a true impact on the lives of individuals, something he \ncould not have attained in Hollywood, not on the same level as he could \nat Michigan State.\n  Jim taught more than just the six-hundred students who often filled \nhis classrooms, though. He and his wife, Cynthia, were very active in \nLansing community fine arts programs, volunteering their time \nthroughout the area. They provided money for the creation of many fine \narts scholarships. Jim also helped to write and direct a production at \nEast Lansing High School entitled ``4 Years to Life,'' which dramatized \nthe rigors of high school life. In the last year of his life, Jim and \nCynthia could often be found at the Silverscreen Cafe, a coffee shop \nthat they owned together.\n  Mr. President, with his writing ability, Jim forever left his mark on \nHollywood. With his incredible spirit and immense knowledge, he forever \nleft his mark on Lansing, Michigan, Michigan State University, and \nthousands upon thousands of students. And with his personality, he \nforever left his mark on anyone who had the chance to meet him. Plain \nand simple, he was an incredible man, and he will be greatly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2103-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2103-S2104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DR.

Dr. Fay is truly a role model for women not only in Detroit \nbut across the nation, and I am glad that Alternatives For Girls has \nrecognized her as such.

It now has a staff \nof over fifty employees, one-hundred and seventy active volunteers, and \nan annual operating budget of over $2 million. It has been honored by \nCrain's Detroit Business Weekly as one of the best-managed non-profit \norganizations in the Detroit metropolitan area, and has also been named \nby Newsweek as a social service agency that works.\n  Mr. President, the staff and volunteers of Alternatives For Girls \nhold the firm conviction that they can make a difference in the lives \nof girls and young women in metropolitan Detroit by helping them build \nthe foundations for trust, responsibility and success; by providing \nthem with educational support and vocational guidance to become to \nbecome self-sufficient; by counselling them and linking them with the \nresources they need to build safe and healthy lives; and by listening \nto their concerns, responding to their needs, standing by them in times \nof frustration, and congratulating them in times of success.\n  Alternatives For Girls has three program areas, a Prevention Program, \na Crisis Shelter and Transition to Independent Living Program, and a \nStreet Outreach Program. The Prevention Program serves girls, ages 5-\n17, and their families, who are at risk for school dropout, early \npregnancy, and involvement with gangs, drugs, and violence.

A bill to amend the National Historic Preservation Act for \nthe purposes of establishing a national historic lighthouse \npreservation program; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         NATIONAL HISTORIC LIGHTHOUSE PRESERVATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with my colleague from Michigan, I am \nproud to introduce the National Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. \nThis bill would amend the National Historic Preservation Act to \nestablish a historic lighthouse preservation program within the \nDepartment of the Interior. It is similar to a bill that the Senate \npassed in the 105th Congress.\n  The legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior and the \nAdministrator of General Services to establish a process for conveying \nhistoric lighthouses which are around our coastal areas and Great Lakes \nwhen these lighthouses have been deemed to be in excess of Federal \nneeds of the agency owning and operating the lighthouse. For entities \neligible to receive a historic lighthouse, it would be for the uses of \neducational, park, recreation, cultural, and historic preservation. And \nthe agencies that would be included would be Federal or State agencies, \nlocal governments, nonprofit corporations, educational agencies, and \ncommunity development organizations, and so forth.\n  There is no question that the historic lighthouses would be conveyed \nin a nonfee structure to selected entities which would have the \nobligation to maintain the integrity of these historic structures.\n  The historic lighthouses would revert back to the United States if a \nproperty ceases to be used for education, park, recreation, cultural or \nhistoric preservation purposes, or failed to be maintained in \ncompliance with the National Historic Preservation Act.\n  Lighthouses are among the most romantic reminders of our country's \nmaritime heritage. Marking dangerous headlands, shoals, bars, and \nreefs, these structures played a vital role in indicating navigable \nwaters and supporting this Nation's maritime transportation and \ncommerce. These lighthouses served the needs of the early mariners who \nnavigated by visual sightings on landmarks, coastal lights, and the \nheavens. Hundreds of lighthouses have been built along our sea coasts \nand on the Great Lakes, creating the world's most complex aids to \nnavigation system. No other national lighthouse system compares with \nthat of the United States in size and diversity of architectural and \nengineering types.\n  My legislations pays tribute to this legacy and establishes a process \nwhich will ensure the protection and maintenance of these historical \nlighthouses so that future generations of Americans will be able to \nappreciate these treasured landmarks.\n  The legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Department of the \nInterior, through the National Park Service, to establish a historic \nlighthouse preservation program. The Secretary is charged with \ncollecting and sharing information on historic lighthouses; conducting \neducational programs to inform the public about the contribution to \nsociety of historic lighthouses; and maintaining an inventory of \nhistoric lighthouses.\n  A historic light station is defined as a lighthouse, and surrounding \nproperty, at least 50 years old, which has been evaluated for inclusion \non the National Register of Historic Places, and included in the \nSecretary's listing of historic light stations.\n  Most important, the Secretary, in conjunction with the Administrator \nof General Services, is to establish a process for identifying, and \nselecting among eligible entities to which a historic lighthouse could \nbe conveyed. Eligible entities will include Federal agencies, State \nagencies, local communities, nonprofit corporations, and educational \nand community development organizations financially able to maintain a \nhistoric lighthouse, including conformance with the National Historic \nPreservation Act. When a historic lighthouse has been deemed excess to \nthe needs of the Federal agency which manages the lighthouse, the \nGeneral Services Administration will convey it, for free, to a selected \nentity for education, park, recreation, cultural, and historic \npreservation purposes.\n  My legislation also recognizes the value of lighthouse friends \ngroups. Often, these groups have spend significant time and resources \non preserving the character of historic lighthouses only to have his \nwork go to waste when the lighthouse is transferred out of Federal \nownership. Under current General Services Administration regulations, \nthese friends groups are last on the priority list to receive a surplus \nlight station in spite of their efforts to protect it. My bill gives \npriority consideration to public entities who submit applications in \nwhich the public entity partners with a nonprofit friends group.\n  Everyone agrees that the historic character of these lighthouses \nneeds to be maintained. But the cost of maintaining these historic \nstructures is becoming increasingly high for Federal\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\nagencies in these times of tight budgetary constraints. These \nlighthouses were built in an age when they had to manned continuously. \nToday's advanced technology makes it possible to build automated aids \nto navigation that do not require around-the-clock manning. This \ntechnology has made many of these historic lighthouses expensive \nanachronisms which Federal agencies must maintain even if they no \nlonger use them as navigational aids.\n  My legislation ensures that the historic character of these \nlighthouses are maintained when the lighthouses are no longer needed by \nthe Federal Government. When the historic lighthouse is conveyed out of \nFederal ownership, the entity which receives the lighthouse must \nmaintain it in accordance with historic preservation laws and \nstandards. A lighthouse would revert to the United States, at the \noption of the General Services Administration, if the lighthouse is not \nbeing used or maintained as required by the law.\n  In the event no government agency or nonprofit organization is \napproved to receive a historic lighthouse, it would be offered for sale \nby the General Services Administration. The proceeds from these sales \nwould be transferred to the National Maritime Heritage Grant Program \nwithin the National Park Service. Congress established the National \nMaritime Heritage Grant Program in 1994 to provide grants for maritime \nheritage preservation and education projects. Unfortunately, funding \nfor this program has been nonexistent so the proceeds from any historic \nlighthouse sales would help ensure the program's viability.\n\n  It is my intent to ensure that coastal towns, where a historic \nlighthouse is an integral part of the community, would receive a \nhistoric lighthouse when it is no longer needed by the Federal \nGovernment. These historic lighthouses could be used by the community \nas a local park, a community center, or a tourist bureau. It also would \nensure that historic lighthouse friends groups or lighthouse \npreservation societies, which have voluntarily helped to maintain the \nhistoric character of the lighthouse, could receive an excess \nlighthouse.\n  Mr. President, I know firsthand the importance and allure of these \nhistoric lighthouses. When I was in the Coast Guard, I helped maintain \nlighthouses and other navigational aids. These lights were critical to \nsafe maritime traffic and I took my responsibilities seriously knowing \nthat lives were dependent on it.\n  By preserving historic lighthouses, we preserve a symbol of that era \nin American history when maritime traffic was the lifeblood of the \nNation, tying isolated coastal towns through trade to distant ports \naround the world. Hundreds of historic lighthouses are owned by the \nFederal Government and many of these are difficult and expensive to \nmaintain. This legislation provides a process to ensure that these \nhistoric lighthouses are maintained and publicly accessible.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the National \nHistoric Lighthouse Preservation Act. Michigan is second only to Alaska \nin length of shoreline. However, Michigan is second to none in the \nnumber of lighthouses which grace its shores. Michigan has over 120 \nlighthouses. As such, it is most appropriate indeed that I work with my \nfriend and colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, in introducing \nthis legislation.\n  For centuries our nation's lighthouses have served as beacons to \nmariners guiding them on their journeys. Due to recent navigational \nadvances, these lights often no longer serve the noble purpose for \nwhich they were built. The current custodian of many of these lights, \nthe United States Coast Guard, has neither the funding nor manpower to \nmaintain these majestic lights. This act will help ensure proper \nstewards are found for these American Castles, thus ensuring they will \nremain cultural beacons for generations to come.\n  Over the next 10 years the U.S. Coast Guard has said it will be \ntransferring from its ownership at least 70 of Michigan's historic \nlighthouses. I have been working with the Michigan Lighthouse Project \nto identify future custodians of these lighthouses. This legislation is \nessential to facilitate the transfer of the Michigan lighthouses and \nother lighthouses around the country. Currently, through the existing \ngovernment transfer process, there is no way to easily transfer \nlighthouses to non-profit historical societies. This legislation sets \nup an expedited GSA process allowing lighthouses to be transferred by \nthe government directly to non-profit historical organizations.\n  This legislation is needed to allow for and facilitate the transfers \nof these lighthouses to non-profit historical organizations who will \npreserve and care for them and keep them in the ``public domain'' where \nthey can be enjoyed by all, once they are transferred.\n  Last Congress I cosponsored a similar bill which passed the Senate \nbut died in a House Committee. This Congress, we have worked with all \nthe Federal agencies involved with lighthouse transfers as well as with \nthe Great Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association to develop this slightly \nmodified bill.\n  I hope the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act will be \nenacted quickly so that we can begin the orderly and timely process of \ntransferring our treasured historic lighthouses to the appropriate \nhistorical institutions that will care for them and make them \naccessible to the public.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2347. A bill to provide grants to partnerships to establish and \ncarry out information technology training programs and to provide \nincentives for educators to obtain information technology \ncertification, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                   information technology act of 2000\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in the past decade, the United \nStates has experienced unparalleled economic growth. Unemployment has \nbeen low, inflation has not been a major concern and job opportunities \nfor college graduates and many other U.S. workers have been plentiful. \nIn so small measure, this economic achievement has been the result of \nthe extraordinary growth and opportunities provided by the high tech \nindustry.\n  According to the most recent information from the American \nElectronics Association (AEA), the high technology industry has added \nmore than 1 million jobs to the U.S. economy between 1993 and 1998. \nHigh tech employment has soared from 3.9 million jobs in 1993 to more \nthan 4.8 million jobs in 1998. The industry is one of the fastest \ngrowing segments of the U.S. economy.\n  In North Dakota, growth in high technology, particularly in software \nand computer-related services, has tracked U.S. high tech expansion. \nInformation from the American Electronics Association shows that North \nDakota was one of the few states that led the nation in the percentage \nof high-tech employment growth. Between 1990 and 1997, North Dakota \nalmost doubled its high tech employment from 2,800 to 5,300 workers, a \ngrowth rate of 91 percent.\n  Despite this extraordinary growth in the high tech industry over the \npast decade, and trends which indicate that the high-tech industry will \ncontinue to be among the fastest growing job segments in the 21st \ncentury, one of the biggest challenges of the high-tech industry is \nensuring an adequate supply of skilled IT workers.\n  In 1997, the Department of Commerce and the Information Technology \nAssociation of America (ITAA) reported on the critical shortage of \nskilled high-tech workers in the U.S. The ITAA released a study which \nestimated the current shortage of skilled workers in various \ninformation technology fields at more than 340,000. Moreover, the \nDepartment of Labor projected that our economy would require more than \n130,000 jobs in information technology--systems analysts, computer \nscientists, and engineers--annually for the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, during the closing days of the 105th Congress, the \nSenate took the first steps to respond to the IT worker shortage by \nvoting to increase the annual cap on H1B visas. This increase, which I \nsupported, enables foreign workers to be employed in the U.S. high-tech \nindustry.\n  During this debate on H1B visas and the IT worker shortage, I \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\nlegislation to encourage IT training partnerships between the private \nsector and education communities as another option for responding to \nthe worker shortage.\n  Now, as the Senate returns for the 2d Session of the 106th Congress, \nand as projections for the IT worker shortage are increasing, the \nSenate will consider legislation to raise the cap on H1B visas beyond \nthe increase approved in 1998. There are few proposals, however, to \nauthorize significant incentives to encourage IT training for American \nworkers. In 1998, we authorized only a small amount of funding for IT \ntraining and education from the fees collected under the H1B expansion.\n  There is no question that recruitment of skilled foreign workers is \nvery important for the IT industry. Indeed, it will be necessary to \nincrease that cap again before adjournment of the 106th Congress. \nIncreasing the H1B visa cap alone, however, will not solve the IT \nworker shortage.\n\n  Congress must also examine longer term solutions to encourage the \nexpansion of IT training and education. Many key firms, including Cisco \nSystems, Texas Instruments, Microsoft, EDS, Lucent and IBM, are \ncurrently providing excellent training and educational opportunities in \nIT. These firms are also encouraging individuals of all ages to think \nabout career opportunities in information technology. But, without \nquestion, the demand for IT workers is growing, and raising the H1B cap \nby itself will not provide the skilled IT work force that is necessary \nin the coming decade.\n  Following up my initiative in the 106th Congress to authorize a tax \ncredit for information technology training, S. 456, I am introducing \nthe Information Technology Act of 2000 to provide additional incentives \nfor IT training and education partnerships. I am very pleased that \nSenators Reid, Johnson, Levin, Kennedy, Lincoln, Bayh, and Rockefeller \nare joining as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  The Information Technology Act of 2000 would authorize $100 million \nin FY 2001 in matching Federal funds through the Departments of \nEducation and Labor to encourage IT training partnerships between the \neducation community and private sector. The education partnerships \nwould encourage IT training for those individuals that are the most \nunderrepresented in the information technology field--dislocated \nworkers, women, veterans, senior citizens, the Native American \ncommunities and students who have not completed their high school \neducation.\n  Additionally, my legislation would help teachers improve their \ninformation technology teaching skills by authorizing a $5,000 bonus \nfor educators who become certified in one or more information \ntechnology skills including integrating technology into the classroom. \n$100 million would be authorized annually for this program for five \nyears beginning in FY 2001.\n  Currently, the Department of Education, through a number of \nprofessional development programs including the Technology Literacy \nChallenge Fund, offers educators a number of opportunities for training \nto integrate technology into school classrooms.\n  But according to the National Center for Education Statistics, only \n20 percent of full-time public school teachers believe that they are \nwell prepared to integrate technology into the classroom. Approximately \n79 percent of teachers believe that they do not get enough help in \npreparing to use technology in the classroom.\n  The need for this technology training was also underscored in a \nrecent survey of educators by Education Week. Highlights of this survey \nregarding teacher's training were reported in a Washington Post article \non March 18, 2000. Clearly, teachers should be offered more \nopportunities for information technology training.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate considers options to respond to the IT \nworker shortage, several pending measures, including raising the H1B \ncap, reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and \ntax relief legislation will provide excellent opportunities to \nestablish a comprehensive IT worker shortage policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together during the remaining days of \nthe 106th Congress and support a package of IT worker shortage \ninitiatives that will help American firms not only maintain their \ncompetitive edge in the world market, but enable Americans who are not \nnow part of the IT expansion to have that opportunity. I welcome \ncosponsors of the Information Technology Act of 2000. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation and the article \nentitled ``Teachers Online but Disconnected,'' from the Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2347\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In fourth-grade social studies, classes explore the \n     Web to learn about American Colonial history. In English \n     classes in various grades, children write stories on \n     computers and turn them into a multimedia presentation.\n       But what's routine at Sanders Corner is not at all typical \n     at Jermantown Elementary School in Fairfax County. Although \n     Jermantown has plenty of computers, its teachers say they \n     don't know enough to take full advantage of them.\n       Sixth-grade teacher Eric Fleming, for example, would love \n     to convert his students' weekly newspaper into a classroom-\n     designed Web site where parents could see what their children \n     had learned each day. The school's hardware and software are \n     capable of such an effort, but he isn't. ``That's all well \n     beyond me,'' said Fleming, considered one of Jermantown's \n     most computer-fluent instructors. ``I need someone to teach \n     me how to do this.''\n       Contrasts like the one between Sanders Corner and \n     Jermantown--both in affluent school districts--turn up many \n     times across the Washington suburbs, and sometimes exist \n     within the same school. Some classrooms use computers \n     constantly, while others rarely incorporate them into daily \n     activities.\n       It is a digital divide that often has little to do with a \n     school's supply of technology equipment; Sanders Corner has \n     4.4 students per computer, as does Jermantown. Nor is it \n     necessarily a question of how much formal training a school's \n     teachers have received.\n       Teachers and school officials say the gap instead boils \n     down to the fact that some teachers are getting far more help \n     than others in building on what they learned in technology \n     training class. And some teachers are more motivated than \n     others to seek such help in the first place.\n       Some schools, like Sanders Corner, have a full-time \n     technology specialist who is regularly giving teachers ideas \n     on how to use computers to enliven their lessons; many \n     others, like Jermantown, have to share that person with other \n     schools.\n       Even at a school with its own technology coach, it is \n     ultimately up to each classroom teacher to make the effort to \n     plan a computer-centered lesson or project. And patience, \n     enthusiasm, learning curve and planning time can vary \n     enormously from one teacher to another.\n       ``There are some teachers out there who are extraordinary. \n     They pretty much taught themselves,'' said Linda G. Roberts, \n     director of educational technology at the U.S. Department of \n     Education. ``Another group is using some of the resources but \n     is easily discouraged . . . Most teachers want to learn, but \n     they say it takes time and they need help.''\n       The result is that the impact of computers on instruction \n     continues to lag behind their presence in schools, both in \n     the Washington area and nationwide. More than 95 percent of \n     schools and nearly two-thirds of class-rooms have computers \n     connected to the Internet. Yet in a recent survey by the \n     National Center for Education Statistics, 79 percent of \n     teachers said they don't get enough help using technology in \n     the classroom. Another poll, by Education Week magazine, \n     found that only 50 percent of teachers support lessons with \n     computer software.\n       Educators and business leaders worry that the \n     inconsistencies threaten the popular notion that the nation's \n     billion-dollar investment in hardware and software will lead \n     to better learning for schoolchildren.\n       ``We're not seeing the professional development at the \n     level that we'd like, and there is not the integration of \n     technology day in and day out that we'd like to see,'' said \n     June Streckfus, executive director of the Maryland Business \n     Roundtable, a nonprofit group of business leaders that is \n     monitoring computer use in Maryland schools.\n       School administrators generally do not measure how well or \n     how often teachers use classroom technology. Nor have schools \n     developed guidelines on what role computers should play in \n     the curriculum, either by academic subject or by grade level. \n     Some school systems, such as Montgomery County, have started \n     posting technology ideas for teachers on their Web sites, and \n     some schools are cataloguing technology resources for class \n     instruction.\n       There is no consensus among educators on how much computers \n     benefit the learning process. But teachers who use them often \n     in their classes say that Web browsing and educational \n     software usually increase students' interest in a topic and \n     sometimes trigger understanding when either teaching methods \n     have failed.\n       ``It's such a part of our lives,'' said Susan Jones, a \n     fifth-grade teacher at Sanders Corner who constantly includes \n     technology in her lessons. ``Any way I can do it, I will.''\n       Jones recently posed this question to her fifth-grade \n     history class: Did Patrick Henry really commit such a heinous \n     act as treason?\n       The lights went off and the Web site of Henry's last home \n     and burial place, www.redhill.org, was projected onto a \n     screen dangling from the black-board. Browsing the site \n     spurred a debate among the students about Henry's motives in \n     challenging England.\n       When they studied Benjamin Franklin, Jone's fifth-graders \n     e-mailed a Web site on Franklin and got responses as if they \n     were written by the historical figure. They also took a \n     virtual tour of Colonial Williamsburg on www.history.org.\n       Jones and other teachers at Sanders Corner say they get a \n     huge boost from having someone at the school all day whose \n     sole job is to help them blend technology with instruction.\n       That person is Kathy Hayden, a technology resource teacher \n     since 1995. Hayden was a fourth-grade instructor in Loudoun \n     who loved using computers in class. School staff members say \n     her advice carries weight because she truly understands a \n     class-room teacher's job.\n       At Sanders Corner, Hayden started ``Tech Tuesday,'' a \n     weekly training session that rotates among small groups of \n     teachers with common interests or skills. She also attends \n     planning meetings of same-grade teachers. Some-times she will \n     teach a lesson with a classroom instructor who is shy about \n     using computers.\n       Ricki Fellows had been teaching for 23 years but rarely \n     used computers with her students until she arrived at Sanders \n     Corner last fall and got some coaching from Hayden. ``I had \n     some mixed feelings about it,'' Fellows said. ``It was really \n     fear of the unknown.''\n       Now, that fear is gone. Recently Fellows's third-graders \n     went on a field trip to the Smithsonian Institution. With a \n     digital camera, she snapped photos of Egyptian art for social \n     studies class, and rocks and minerals for science. Back in \n     class, the students downloaded the film, selected photos, and \n     wrote and edited essays on their computers about what they \n     had seen at the museum.\n       ``I really am excited again about teaching,'' Fellows said. \n     ``I'm learning and I'm growing--that's what it's all about.''\n       The Maryland Business Roundtable has urged school districts \n     to put a full-time technology specialist in every school. \n     Loudoun already does that, but most Washington area districts \n     don't.\n       ``After you're trained, you can't ask anyone any \n     questions,'' said Ann Mallon, a first-grade teacher at \n     Jermantown Elementary, which shares a technology specialist \n     with six other schools, the typical ratio in Fairfax County's \n     school system. ``When we don't have a person here, we stop \n     using the programs.''\n       Fairfax school officials have proposed spending $4 million \n     to hire an additional 114 technology specialists, so that \n     each would be assigned to no more than two schools.\n       But even teachers who have regular access to an expert \n     coach say they don't get enough planning time to develop \n     computer-based lessons. In many cases, teachers say, they \n     spend hours on their home computers rummaging for Web sites.\n       In coming weeks, Kim Price will teach meteorology to her \n     fourth-graders at Fairfax's Crossfield Elementary by having \n     them create a weather map based on data they find on the Web. \n     ``This is the coolest thing I've ever done,'' she said.\n       It also took her an entire school day and about three hours \n     on her computer at home to develop the project and write the \n     instructions on a specially designed Web site.\n       ``This is one of the problems,'' said Price, whose school \n     has a part-time specialist. ``It takes hours to do anything \n     worthwhile. If you have a half-hour to 45 minutes in any one \n     block of planning time, that's not enough.''\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\n       More planning time must be built into teachers' schedules, \n     at least until they acquire more hands-on experience with \n     their computers, said Roberts, the U.S. Department of \n     Education official.\n       As for the formal computer training their school systems \n     provide, most of the teachers interviewed said it is usually \n     just a few hours at the beginning of the school year and \n     covers only the basics.\n       Patrick F. Chorpenning Jr., who teaches government at \n     Fairfax's West Potomac High School, says he seldom bother to \n     take such courses. Chorpenning acquired his technology know-\n     how during his former career as a business executive, and he \n     says he has learned on his own how to use computers in his \n     classes.\n       He projects Web sites in his classroom to illustrate \n     various points about today's politics, and he gives students \n     lists of sites to peruse and assigns them to report back on \n     what they find.\n       Education officials and business leaders say making \n     computers a more standard part of instruction will require \n     more spending on teacher training and tougher standards for \n     technology competency.\n       Virginia has established teacher competency standards in \n     technology, although they are not related to a teacher's \n     recertification. Maryland has no such requirements.\n       Business executives also have urged teacher colleges to \n     assess whether they are giving students enough technology \n     advice. Surveys have shown that even recent graduates of such \n     programs, who were raised with computers, are poorly prepared \n     to use them in class.\n       At Jermantown Elementary, teachers' computer literacy is \n     likely to be higher next year. Because it is merging with \n     another school and is being designated a ``focus school'' for \n     communications and art, Jermantown will get three fully-time \n     technology specialists, as well as more computers.\n       ``A whole new world will open up,'' said Susan D. Kane, the \n     school's principal. ``You can see where they're at now--where \n     you do what you can and you hope for the best.''\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Conrad \nand Senator Reid in introducing the Information Technology Act. The \ndual goal of this legislation is to ensure that every teacher in \nAmerica has the ability to integrate technology into the classroom and \nthe curriculum; and to train our citizens to meet the demand for the \nthousands of jobs that will need to be filled in the next decade.\n  Mr. President, our legislation establishes two initiatives that are \naimed at achieving these goals. First, it authorizes $100 million for \nthe creation of a Teacher Tech Bonus in the amount of $5,000. The \nbonuses will be awarded to teachers who successfully train and receive \ncertification in the use of technology in the classroom and in the \ncurriculum, or teachers who become certified to teach courses in \ncomputer technology. Bonuses would be provided by the U.S. Department \nof Education through grants to Local Education Agencies (LEA). As a \ncondition for receipt of bonuses, teachers are required to enter into \nagreements with their LEA to continue to teach within that LEA for \nperiods of not less than three years, and such other requirements as \nestablished by the Secretary. This provision of the Information \nTechnology Act is essential, if we are going to realize the full \npotential of our investment in new technology in the classroom. So few \nof our school districts have been able to offer state-of-the-art \ntraining, or any training at all for that matter, to their teaching \nstaff. Students today are in the midst of a technology explosion that \nhas opened up limitless possibilities in the classroom. In order for \nthem to tap into this potential and be prepared for the jobs of the \n21st century, they must learn how to use new technologies. But all too \noften, teachers are expected to incorporate technology into their \ninstruction without being given the training to do so. It is not enough \nfor teachers to be able to email or use computers to keep attendance or \ngrade their students, they must use this education technology to \nadvance their curriculum. According to a recent survey by the National \nCenter for Education Statistics, 79 percent of teachers said they do \nnot get enough help using technology in the classroom. Last year, a \nreport by Education Week's National Survey of Teachers' Use of Digital \nContent revealed some startling findings relative to the lack of \nteacher training in integrating technology into the curriculum. In a \nnational poll of over 1,400 teachers, 36 percent of teachers responded \nthat they received absolutely no training in integrating technology in \nthe curriculum; another 36 percent said they had only received 1 to 5 \nhours of such training; 14 percent received 6 to 10 hours of such \ntraining; and only 7 percent received between 11-20 hours.\n  In a very in-depth look at Michigan schools and technology several \nyears ago, I learned that despite the utilization of education \ntechnology in a few localities, Michigan as a whole was below the \nnational average in every measure of the use of technology in our \nschools. Michigan ranked 44 in teacher training in the use of \ntechnology. Ten percent of Michigan teachers reported that they had \nless than 9 hours of technology training. Michigan ranked 32 among the \nstates in the ratio of students per computer. These findings propelled \nme in a direction that has resulted in a number of initiatives to turn \nMichigan around--to raise the State's use of education technology. I \nconvened an Education Technology Summit that brought together over 400 \nbusiness leaders, school administrators, school board members, \nfoundation representatives, deans of Michigan's colleges of education \nand others to identify ways in which Michigan could excel in the area \nof Education technology.\n  Some key elements of the plan of action which followed that Education \nTechnology Summit include the formation of a consortium that will \nestablish the Nation's highest standards for training and certifying \nnew teachers to use technology in the classroom and to integrate it \ninto the curriculum. Beginning with the 1999-2000 academic year, the \nConsortium for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching with Technology \n{COATT} will award special credentials to new teachers who have \ndemonstrated an exceptional ability to use information technology as a \nteaching tool. The legislation we are introducing today supports and \ncompliments this effort in Michigan. It will advance current efforts in \nmy state to excel in education technology. And it will advance \neducation technology across this Nation. Our legislation provides an \nincentive and a reward that will result in effectively equipping more \nand more teachers with the technology expertise they need to stimulate \nthe interests of their students, raise student potential for learning, \nand increase student achievement. It has been a pleasure working with \nSenator Conrad in fine tuning specific provisions of this legislation \nto more directly reflect the successful model we've created in my home \nstate for giving special recognition to new teachers who are able to \napply technology in classroom instruction.\n\n  I am pleased that the formation of COATT gives my state a head start \nin this direction. And, I am delighted that such an impressive slate of \nhigher educational institutions from Michigan have signed on to the \nCOATT initiative, including Albion College, Andrews University, Eastern \nMichigan University, Ferris State University, Lake Superior State \nUniversity, Michigan State University, Oakland University, University \nof Detroit-Mercy, University of Michigan, University of Michigan-\nDearborn, Wayne State University and Western Michigan University. New \nteachers with COATT credentials will have an advantage in the job \nmarket and school districts will benefit by knowing which applicants \nare qualified in using technology effectively in their instruction. The \nletter of agreement signed by each COATT member in committing their \ninstitutions to provide the resources to achieve the success of the \nCOATT initiative is included at the end of my remarks. Michigan is \nalready recognized as a leader in producing new teachers and if we set \nour minds to it, I'm convinced we can be one of the best in the nation \nwhen it comes to teaching teachers how to integrate technology in the \nclassroom and into the curriculum.\n  I'd like to mention yet another key effort I've led to advance \nMichigan's standing in education technology. It is the establishment of \nthe Teach for Tomorrow Project (TFT), which provides on-line and in-\nperson technology training, including credentials, to in-service \nteachers, who then return to their schools and teach other teachers \nwhat they have learned. By using technology to teach the technology, \ntraining can be accessed statewide and at a time and location which are \nconvenient to the learners. Central Michigan University has approved \nthe use of TFT materials as a professional development course eligible \nfor graduate credit\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\n hours when done in conjunction with local onsite training. Under the \nlegislation we are now introducing, teachers may also qualify for a \nbonus if they train and become certified to teach other teachers.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing creates an \nInformation Technology Training initiative through which Federal \nmatching grants would be awarded to partnerships between higher \neducational institutions, or a private organization or a business, \nwhich may include a commercial information technology training provider \nand information technology trade or professional association, to \nprovide training and education to individuals who are under-represented \nin the information technology profession. Under-represented individuals \nwould include, but not be limited to, such individuals as dislocated \nworkers, veterans, students who have not completed their high school \neducation, older Americans, women, individuals who have already \nreceived training but have not been certified, and others. The bill \nalso authorizes $100 million for this provision, which requires a 50 \npercent non-Federal match requirement that may be in the form of cash, \nequipment and/or in-kind services.\n  This legislation, The Information Technology Act, will be good for \nour schools. It will be good for the U.S. economy. I urge its speedy \nenactment. In closing, I would like to share with my colleagues the \norganizational endorsements of this legislation, which include: The \nNational Education Association, Technology Workforce Coalition, \nComputing Technology Industry Association, American Society for \nTraining and Development, Information Technology Training Association, \nGreen Thumb, International Society for Technology in Education, \nAmerican Association of University Women, Consortium for School \nNetworking, and the Software Information Industry Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nCOATT member agreement signed by higher education institutions in \nMichigan.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Consortium For Outstanding Achievement in Teaching With Technology \n                          Letter of Agreement\n\n       We, the undersigned, commit our institutions to be members \n     of the Consortium for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching \n     with Technology (COATT). In doing so our institutions accept \n     the following requirements.\n       (1) Each institution shall designate a faculty liaison to \n     COATT. This person will participate in an annual review of \n     the COATT standards and participate in periodic meetings with \n     other core members of the COATT organization.\n       (2) Each institution shall designate a person to act as a \n     point of contact within the institution for potential COATT \n     candidates.\n       (3) Each institution shall promote COATT to potential \n     candidates.

A bill to provide for fairness and accuracy in student \ntesting; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              FAIRNESS AND ACCURACY IN STUDENT TESTING ACT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, education is, among other things, a \nprocess of shaping the moral imagination, character, skills and \nintellect of our children, of inviting them into the great conversation \nof our moral, cultural and intellectual life, and of giving them the \nresources to prepare to fully participate in the life of the nation and \nof the world.\n  But today in education there is a threat afoot to which I would like \nto call your attention: the threat of high-stakes testing being grossly \nabused in the name of greater accountability, and almost always to the \nserious detriment of our children.\n  Allowing the continued misuse of high-stakes tests is, in itself, a \ngross failure of moral imagination, a failure both of educators and of \npolicymakers, who persistently refuse to provide the educational \nresources necessary to guarantee an equally rich educational experience \nfor all our children. That all citizens will be given an equal start \nthrough a sound education is one of the most basic, promised rights of \nour democracy. Our chronic refusal as a nation to guarantee that right \nfor all children, including poor children, is a national disgrace.\n  Today I am introducing legislation that would stem the growing trend \nof misusing high stakes tests. The legislation would require that \nstates and districts use multiple measures of student performance in \naddition to standardized tests if they are going to use tests as part \nof a high stakes decision. The amendment will also require that if \ntests are used, they must be valid and reliable for the purposes for \nwhich they are used; must measure what the student was taught; and must \nprovide appropriate accommodations for students with limited English \nproficiency and disabilities.\n  I would like to explain exactly why this bill would be so important \nand why I seek your support for it. If there is any question about \nwhether or not we have, as a nation, overemphasized high stakes \nstandardized testing, and if there is any question that this \noveremphasis has taken so much of the excitement out of teaching and \nlearning for so many people across the country, I would like to open my \nremarks with some excerpts from a newspaper article from one of our \nstate capitols earlier this year. The state is in the process of \nimplementing high stakes tests for promotion. This article addresses \nhow schools and students in the state are dealing with the preparation \nand stress of the pending high stakes test. The test, which lasts five \ndays, will determine, among other things whether students will be \npromoted and whether schools will be sanctioned for poor performance.\n  The article describes one teacher who said, ``I'm thinking about \nletting us have a scream day sometime in March, when we just go outside \nand scream,'' and it continues, ``her principal . . . is keenly aware \nof the stress on both students and teachers. He told teachers during a \nmeeting . . . that he expects some students to throw up during the \ntest. He arranged to have all of the school's janitors on duty to clean \nup any messes.''\n  It is no wonder that students are stressed. According to the article, \n``For the past eight weeks, Northwestern's school billboard has been \nupdated daily with the number of school days left until the test.''\n  When I read this story, I wonder why we cannot let children be \nchildren? Why do we impose this misplaced pressure on children as young \nas eight years old? When I see what is happening around the country, \nwith more and more states and districts adopting the harsh agenda of \nhigh stakes testing policies, I am struck by National Education \nAssociation President Bob Chase's comparison of all of these \neducational trends to the movie, ``Field of Dreams.'' In my view, it is \nas though people are saying, ``If we test them, they will perform.'' In \ntoo many places,\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\ntesting, which is a critical part of systemic educational \naccountability, has ceased its purpose of measuring educational and \nschool improvement and has become synonymous with it.\n  Making students accountable for test scores works well on a bumper \nsticker and it allows many politicians to look good by saying that they \nwill not tolerate failure. But it represents a hollow promise. Far \nfrom improving education, high stakes testing marks a major retreat \nfrom fairness, from accuracy, from quality and from equity.\n\n  It is ironic, because standardized tests evolved historically as one \nway to ensure more equal opportunity in education. They are supposed to \nbe an instrument of fairness because they are graded objectively and \nallow any person, regardless of background, to demonstrate their skill.\n  When used correctly, standardized tests are critical for diagnosing \ninequality and for identifying where we need improvement. They enable \nus to measure achievement across groups of students so that we can help \nensure that states and districts are held accountable for improving the \nachievement of all students regardless of race, income, gender, limited \nEnglish proficiency and disability. Tests are a critical tool, but, \nthey are not a panacea.\n  The abuse of tests for high stakes purposes has subverted the \nbenefits tests can bring. Using a single standardized test as the sole \ndeterminant for promotion, tracking, ability grouping and graduation is \nnot fair and has not fostered greater equality or opportunity for \nstudents. First, standardized tests can not sufficiently validly or \nreliably assess what students know to make high stakes decisions about \nthem.\n  The 1999 National Research Council report, ``High Stakes,'' concludes \nthat ``no single test score can be considered a definitive measure of a \nstudent's knowledge,'' and that ``an educational decision that will \nhave a major impact on a test taker should not be made solely or \nautomatically on the basis of a single test score.''\n  The ``Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing,'' 1999 \nEdition, which has served as the standard for test developers and users \nfor decades, asserts that: ``In educational settings, a decision or a \ncharacterization that will have a major impact on a student should not \nbe made on the basis of a single test score.''\n  Even test publishers, including Harcourt Brace, CTB McGraw Hill, \nRiverside and ETS, consistently warn against this practice. For \nexample, Riverside Publishing asserts in The ``Interpretive Guide for \nSchool Administrators'' for the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, ``Many of \nthe common misuses (of standardized tests) stem from depending on a \nsingle test score to make a decision about a student or class of \nstudents.''\n  CTB McGraw Hill writes that ``A variety of tests, or multiple \nmeasures, is necessary to tell educators what students know and can do \n. . . the multiple measures approach to assessment is the keystone to \nvalid, reliable, fair information about student achievement.''\n  There are many reasons tests cannot be relied upon as the sole \ndeterminant in making high stakes decisions about students. The \nNational Research Council describes how these tests can be unreliable. \nThe Council concludes that ``a student's test score can be expected to \nvary across different versions of a test . . . as a function of the \nparticular sample questions asked and/or transitory factors, such as \nthe student's health on the day of the test. Thus, no single test score \ncan be considered a definitive measure of a student's knowledge.''\n  The research of David Rogosa at Stanford University shows how test \nscores are not valid, in isolation, to make judgements about individual \nachievement. His study of California's Stanford 9 National Percentile \nRank Scores for individual students showed that the chances that a \nstudent whose true score is in the 50th percentile will receive a \nreported score that is within 5 percentage points of his true score are \nonly 30% in reading and 42% on ninth grade math tests.\n  Rogosa also showed that on the Stanford 9 test ``the chances, . . . \nthat two students with identical ``real achievement'' will score more \nthan 10 percentile points apart on the same test'' is 57% for 9th \ngraders and 42% on the fourth grade reading test. This margin of error \nshows why it would not be fair to use a cut-score in making a high \nstakes decision about a child.\n  Robert Rayborn, who directs Harcourt's Stanford 9 program in \nCalifornia reenforced these findings when asked about the Stanford 9. \nHe said, ``They should never make high-stakes individual decisions with \na single measure of any kind,'' including the Stanford 9.\n  Politicians and policy makers who continue to push for high stakes \ntests and educators who continue to use them in the face of this \nknowledge have closed their eyes to clearly set professional and \nscientific standards. They demand responsibility and high standards of \nstudents and schools while they let themselves get away with defying \nthe most basic standards of the education profession.\n  It would be irresponsible if a parent or a teacher used a \nmanufactured product on children in a way that the manufacturer says is \nunsafe. Why do we then honor and declare ``accountable'' policy makers \nand politicians who use tests on children in a way that the test \nmanufacturers have said is effectively unsafe?\n  There is no doubt that when mistakes are made, the consequences are \ndevastating. The bad effects of retention in grade have been clearly \nestablished in science. Study after study shows that retention leads to \npoorer academic performance, higher dropout rates, increased behavioral \nproblems, low self-esteem and higher rates of criminal activity and \nsuicide. Research on high school dropouts indicates that students who \ndo not graduate are more likely to be unemployed or hold positions with \nlittle or no career advancement, earn lower wages and be on public \nassistance.\n  On a more immediate level, many of my colleagues will remember how \n8,600 students were mistakenly held in summer school because their \ntests were graded incorrectly.\n  When we talk about responsibility, what could be more irresponsible \nthan using an invalid or unreliable measure as the sole determinant of \nsomething so important as high school graduation or in-school \npromotion?\n  The effects of high stakes testing go beyond their impact on \nindividual students to greatly impact the educational process in \ngeneral. They have had a deadening effect on learning.\n  Again, research proves this point. Studies indicate that public \ntesting encourages teachers and administrators to focus instruction on \ntest content, test format and test preparation. Teachers tend to \noveremphasize the basic skills, and underemphasize problem-solving and \ncomplex thinking skills that are not well assessed on standardized \ntests. Further, they neglect content areas that are not covered such as \nscience, social studies and the arts.\n  For example, in Chicago, the Consortium on Chicago School Research \nconcluded that ``Chicago's regular year and summer school curricula \nwere so closely geared to the Iowa test that it was impossible to \ndistinguish real subject matter mastery from mastery of skills and \nknowledge useful for passing this particular test.'' These findings are \nbacked up by a recent poll in Texas which showed that only 27% of \nteachers in Texas felt that increased test scores reflected increased \nlearning and higher quality teaching. 85% of teachers said that they \nneglected subjects not covered by the TAAS exam.\n  Stories are emerging from around the country about schools where \nteachers and students are under such pressure to perform that schools \nactually use limited funds to pay private companies to coach students \nand teachers in test taking strategies. According to the ``San Jose \nMercury News,'' schools in East Palo Alto, which is one of the poorest \ndistricts in California, paid Stanley Kaplan $10,000 each to consult \nwith them on test taking strategies. According to the same article, \n``schools across California are spending thousands to buy computer \nprograms, hire consultants, and purchase workbooks and materials. \nThey're redesigning spelling tests and math lessons, all in an effort \nto help students become better test takers.'' The teacher from the \narticle I mentioned before had even bought blank score sheets with \nbubbles on them so students can practice filling in circles.\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\n  The richness and exploration we want our own children to experience \nis being sucked out of our schools. I was moved by an op-ed I read \nrecently in the New York Times. It was written by a fifth grade \nteacher, who obviously had a great passion for his work. He said, ``But \nas I teach from day to day . . . I no longer see the students in the \nway I once did--certainly not in the same exuberant light as when I \nfirst started teaching five years ago. Where once they were \n`challenging' or `marginal' students, I am now beginning to see \n`liabilities.' Where once there was a student of `limited promise,' \nthere is now an inescapable deficit that all available efforts will \nonly nominally affect.'' Children are measured by their score, not \ntheir potential, not their diverse talents, not the depth of their \nknowledge and not their character.\n\n  It has been clearly established through research that high stakes \ntests for individual students, when used in isolation, are fatally \nflawed. I would, however, also like to address a general issue that \nthis bill does not address directly, but that I think is really what \nall of this is about in the end. The trend towards high stakes testing \nrepresents a harsh agenda that holds children responsible for our own \nfailure to invest in their future and in their achievement. I firmly \nbelieve that it is grossly unfair, for example, to hold back a student \nbased on a standardized test if that student has not had the \nopportunity to learn the material covered on the test. When we impose \nhigh stakes tests on an educational system where there are, as Jonathan \nKozol says, ``savage inequalities,'' and then we do nothing to address \nthe underlying causes of those inequalities, we set up children to \nfail.\n  People talk about using tests to motivate students to do well and \nusing tests to ensure that we close the achievement gap. This kind of \ntalk is backwards and unfair. We cannot close the achievement gap until \nwe close the gap in investment between poor and rich schools no matter \nhow ``motivated'' some students are. We know what these key investments \nare: quality teaching, parental involvement, and early childhood \neducation, to name just a few.\n  But instead of doing what we know will work, and instead of taking \nresponsibility as policy makers to invest in improving students' lives, \nwe place the responsibility squarely on children. It is simply \nnegligent to force children to pass a test and expect that the poorest \nchildren, who face every disadvantage, will be able to do as well as \nthose who have every advantage.\n  When we do this, we hold children responsible for our own inaction \nand unwillingness to live up to our own promises and our own \nobligations. We confuse their failure with our own. This is a harsh \nagenda indeed, for America's children.\n  All of us in politics like to get our picture taken with children. We \nnever miss a ``photo op.'' We all like to say that ``children are our \nfuture.'' We are all for children until it comes time to make the \ninvestment. Too often, despite the talk, when it comes to making the \ninvestment in the lives of our children, we come up a dollar short.\n  Noted civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer used to say, ``I'm sick \nand tired of being sick and tired.'' Well I'm sick and tired of \nsymbolic politics. When we say we are for children, we ought to be \ncommitted to invest in the health, skills and intellect of our \nchildren. We are not going to achieve our goals on a tin cup budget. \nUnless we make a real commitment, unless we put our money where our \nmouth is, children will continue to fail.\n  If one does not believe that failure on tests has to do with this \ncrushing lack of opportunity, look at who is failing. In Minnesota, in \nthe first round of testing, 79% of low income students failed the \nreading portion of the high school exit exam and 74% failed the math \npart. It is unconscionable.\n  We must never stop demanding that children do their best. We must \nnever stop holding schools accountable. Measures of student performance \ncan include standardized tests, but only when coupled with other \nmeasures of achievement, more substantive education reforms and a much \nfuller, sustained investment in schools.\n  When we use high stakes tests as the sole determinant in making \ndecisions about students, we get the sequence backwards. We lose sight \nof our fundamental objective--to provide children with the tools they \nneed to achieve, to think critically and to understand deeply the \nmaterial they need to meet high standards. We cannot get away with \nmaking children pay for our failure to provide them with the high \nquality education they need, deserve and is their right.\n  Gunnar Myrdal said that ignorance is never random. If we ignore what \nscience tells us, if we close our eyes to the impact of high stakes \ntests, we can continue as we are now--sounding good while doing bad. \nThe Fairness and Accuracy in Student Testing Act would be a strong step \nin the the right direction--toward fairness and equity and accuracy and \na love of learning that will last children their lifetimes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2349. A bill to amend part D of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to permit States with proven cost-effective and efficient child \nsupport collection systems to continue to operate such systems; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              child support collection systems legislation\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleague Senator Thomas that would give a small amount of \nStates the flexibility to operate their locally-run child support \nsystems. Wyoming's Parental Obligation System for Support Enforcement \n[POSSE] fulfills the federal requirements for effective child support \ncollections and disbursement. For example, Wyoming has increased child \nsupport collections by 140 percent since establishing its federally \nmandated automated network in 1995. Comparatively, the increase of \nchild support collections nationwide since 1995 is only 49 percent. \nPOSSE has proven to be the most cost-effective and efficient way to \nassist Wyoming's children and families.\n  However, a provision was included in the 1996 welfare reform law that \nrequires States to establish a single address for the collection and \ndisbursement of all wage-withholding child support payments. Although \nthe intent was to relieve employers of burdensome redtape, the welfare \nreform law does not allow employers to continue submitting payments \nlocally. My State's children and families and the business community \nbenefit from the local system due to the convenience factor for its \nparticipants. Most importantly, POSSE is already achieving the desired \nresults with the current local system in place. Clearly, this single \naddress requirement is a one-size-fits-all solution to a problem that \ndoes not accommodate Wyoming.\n  The bill we are introducing today would amend Part D of title IV of \nthe Social Security Act to permit States with proven cost-effective and \nefficient child support collection systems to continue to operate such \nsystems. States can continue to operate their current systems if they \nmeet the following criteria: the State has established an automated \ndata tracking system; the State allows employers to send all wage \nwithholding payments to a single address; and, the State provides data \non a quarterly basis that demonstrates under the current system, for \nthe most recent four fiscal year quarters, that at least 90 percent of \nall child support obligations paid are disbursed within two business \ndays after receipt. My home State of Wyoming effectively and \nconsistently meets these criteria.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would give States more \nflexibility to operate their local system; however, States must adhere \nto federal performance standards in order to maintain State and local \nflexibility. As Senator Thomas stated, what works for one state does \nnot necessarily yield the same results in another. Wyoming's system \nworks.\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation with my colleague Senator Enzi that would allow states to \ncontinue to operate their locally run child support systems. Since \nestablishing its federally mandated automated network in 1995, the \nState of Wyoming has increased child support collections by 140 \npercent. Over 98 percent of the payments are processed within 2 days. \nNot only does Wyoming measure up to the Federal requirements for \neffective child support\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\ncollections and disbursement, it far exceeds the bar. Under the award-\nwinning Parental Obligation System for Support Enforcement [POSSE], \nwhich is administered by the Clerks of the District Court, the clear \nwinners are Wyoming's children and families.\n  Unfortunately, that stands to change. Due to a provision of the 1996 \nwelfare reform law, states are required to establish a single address \nfor the collection and disbursement of all wage-withholding child \nsupport payments. The intent of the law was to relieve employers from \nmailing payments to numerous locations, as part of a greater effort to \nimprove child support collections across the nation. While these goals \nare certainly laudable, the law does not allow employers to continue \nsubmitting payments locally, even if it is more convenient for them to \ndo so, and even if a state's localized system is already achieving the \ndesired results. Ultimately, states are being forced to make changes to \ncorrect a problem they may not have, and they could end up creating new \nones along the way.\n  Simply put, the legislation we are introducing today would give \nstates the flexibility to operate their local systems--as long as they \ncontinue to meet federal performance standards. One size does not fit \nall. Methods that work well in Chicago, Illinois do not necessarily \nyield the same results in Chugwater, Wyoming. In this case, the results \nin Wyoming speak for themselves.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee to pass this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2350. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey to \ncertain water rights to Duchesne City, Utah; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n               duchesne city water rights conveyance act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Duchesne City \nWater Rights Conveyance Act. This bill will resolve an issue, nearly a \ncentury old, that has kept the city of Duchesne, Utah, from obtaining \ntitle to water rights that have been reserved for the city's use. The \nsolution I propose is simple and long overdue. It is the result of \ncareful negotiations between the city and the Ute Indian Tribe of the \nUintah and Ouray Reservation. I congratulate both these parties for \ncoming together to resolve this issue.\n  In 1905, the city of Duchesne, Utah was established when the \nSecretary of Interior directed the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to \nselect certain tracts of land in the Uintah Indian Reservation for the \ntown site. At the time, the acting Indian Agent for the Unitah Indian \nReservation filed applications to appropriate water to the municipal \nand domestic uses. The U.S. Indian Service was designated as the holder \nof these of three water rights.\n  Mr. President, for many years, efforts have been made to clear the \ntitle to these water rights in the name of Duchesne City, but these \nefforts have been unsuccessful, because the U.S. Indian Service no \nlonger exists. The extinction of the U.S. Indian Service has created a \nlegal anomaly, making it impossible to transfer the water rights of \nDuchesne.\n  The water in question has always been used by Duchesne, and neither \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of the Interior, nor the \nUte Indian Tribe claims any right in the use of this Water. In fact \nthey are supportive of this legislation which ties up a legal loose end \na manner agreed with upon both Indian Tribe and the city of Duchesne.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this \nissue this today, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2351. A bill to provide for the settlement of the water rights \nclaims of the Shivwits Band of the Paiute India tribe of Utah, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affiars.\n\n\n     shivwits band of the paiute indian tribe of utah water rights \n                             settlement act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Bennett to introduce the Shivwits Band of the Paiute \nIndian Tribe of Utah Water Rights Settlement Act, which will finally \nprovide a settlement of water rights issues of the Santa Clara River in \nWashington County, Utah. This settlement is an important piece of the \nVirgin River Adjudication, which was initiated by the State of Utah in \nJuly of 1980.\n  To understand the consequence of this bill, Mr. President, it is \nimportant to keep in mind that Washington County is the driest county \nin Utah, and Utah is the second driest state in the Union. The Santa \nClara river is a fairly small river which runs through the Shivwits \nBand's reservation near the city of St. George, Utah. This water must \nbe shared by the Washington County Water Conservancy District, the city \nof St. George, the town of Ivins, the town of Santa Clara, and the \nShivwits Band, and an endangered fish species. Needless to say, finding \na settlement on the use of this water was not simple, but it has been \nachieved. I would like to publicly praise all the parties that came \ntogether and put the agreement together.\n  One of the benefits of this legislation is the St. George Water Reuse \nProject. This project will provide 2,000 acre-feet of treated water for \nthe Shivwits Band. This settlement will also establish the Santa Clara \nProject. This project will provide a pressurized pipeline from the \nnearby Gunlock Reservoir and will deliver a total of 1,900 acre-feet of \nwater to the Shivwits Band.\n  Mr. President, the project will also provide that sufficient water \nremains in the Santa Clara river for the survival of the Virgin \nSpinedace, an endangered fish species. In addition, the Secretary of \nInterior will be authorized to establish a program to purchase water \nrights and habitat in the Virgin River Basin for fish and other \nspecies.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, this agreement provides an excellent \nbalance between the needs of the cities, the Shivwits Band, and the \nenvironment. It is no wonder that this legislation has the support of \nall interested parties. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to give this \nproposal their full support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 2352. A bill to designate portions of the Wekiva River and \nassociated tributaries as a component of the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 WEKIVA WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION ACT\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you for allowing me this \nopportunity to introduce legislation affecting the Wekiva River, which \nis located east central Florida.\n  With millions of people moving to Florida every year and the \nresulting urban sprawl, we must work to preserve our state's natural \ntreasures. The Wekiva River is worthy of our protective efforts.\n  The Wekiva River and the Wekiva River Basin are unique and important \nriver habitats because of their outstanding scenic, recreational, \nfishery, wildlife, historic, cultural, and water quality values. The \nWekiva River Basin is home to many species of wildlife including \nFlorida black bears, sandhill cranes, turkeys, and burrowing owls. \nFossils of prehistoric mammals, such as saber tooth cats, mastodons, \nand giant sloths, have been found along the length of the river.\n  Generations of Floridians and Florida visitors have enjoyed the \nbeauty and tranquility of the Wekiva River. It is a popular spot for \ncanoeing, camping, hiking, and trail biking because of its intrinsic \nbeauty and quintessential Florida appeal.\n  The legislation I introduce today will declare the Wekiva River a \nWild and Scenic River and preserve it for the future enjoyment of \nFloridians and visitors to Florida. Today, the House Resources \nCommittee, National Parks and Public Land Subcommittee will hold a \nhearing on this bill. Mr. President, I hope that we will move forward \nsoon in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Murkowski, Ms. \n        Johnson, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2353. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve \nthe program for American Indian Tribal Colleges and Universities under \npart A of title III; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\nlegislative fix for tribal colleges and universities and alaska native \n                and native hawaiian serving institutions\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that \nrepresents a simple, straightforward correction of an inequity that is \nnegatively impacting some of this country's most underfunded \ninstitutions of higher education. These include Tribal Colleges and \nUniversities and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving \nInstitutions.\n  Many of these institutions apply for Institutional Aid under Title \nIII of the Higher Education Act. Title III provides grants to a \nspecific set of colleges and universities that serve disproportionate \nnumbers of minority, low-income, and first generation college students.\n  These institutions have considerable impact on improving the quality \nand quantity of educational and career opportunities for their \nstudents, who face unique socio-economic barriers. Title III was \ncreated to help improve and expand the academic capacity of \ninstitutions specifically established and committed to serving these \nstudents.\n  In 1998, Part A of Title III, the Strengthening Developing \nInstitutions Program, was amended by the Higher Education Amendments to \nintroduce a special program for Tribal Colleges and Universities and \nfor Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions. This was a \npositive step in recognizing the needs of these distinctive \ninstitutions and the populations that they serve.\n  However, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 also instituted a \nchange that requires grantees to ``wait out'' for at least two years at \nthe end of their grant before applying for a new grant. This wait out \nperiod was originally created to ensure that Title II funding would \nreach the maximum number of students and institutions as possible.\n  The provision applied to all Title II grantees with the exception of \nHistorical Black Colleges and Universities, which receive formula \nfunding under the title. Before the higher education reauthorization \nbecame law, Hispanic Serving Institutions were transferred to a new \ntitle so that the wait out period no longer applied to them.\n  Therefore, as signed into law, the wait out only affects Sections 316 \nand 317, which cover Tribal Colleges and Universities and Alaska Native \nand Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions. In my State of Hawaii, this \ninvolves the major college campuses and community colleges in the \nUniversity of Hawaii system, which essentially affects the entire \nState.\n  This bill, which I am introducing along with my colleagues--Senators \nInouye, Murkowski, Johnson and Stevens--would make a technical change \nexempting Sections 316 and 317 from the harmful two-year wait out \nrequirement. Similar legislation, H.R. 3629, was introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives on February 10th of this year.\n  This legislation must be passed immediately because any delay in \ncontinued assistance can prove critical for any college or university \nserving small, disadvantaged, populations.\n  Furthermore, because the applicant pool for Title III, Part A, \nassistance is already so limited in size, the failure to exempt \ninstitutions from the two-year wait out provision will likely result in \nno institutions being eligible to apply for future funds under this \nprogram. We must not allow this unnecessary scenario to come about. \nCurrently, there are six institutions in the states of Washington, \nMontana, California, North Dakota, and South Dakota that are currently \nstuck in the first year of their two-year wait out period.\n  This non-controversial correction has broad support in the higher \neducation community and obviously from the institutions that will be \nnegatively affected. I strongly urge that my colleagues join me in \npushing this simple change forward to correct a problem that, if \nunaddressed, will have adverse impacts on Tribal Colleges and \nUniversities and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving \nInstitutions, and the students that they serve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 2354. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent \nthe duplication of losses through the assumption of liabilities giving \nrise to a deduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  REVISED REVENUE PROVISION FOR THE TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce--along with \nSenator Moynihan--a bill that will clarify a revenue provision that has \nbeen reserved for the Trade and Development Act of 1999.\n  Last fall, the Senate Finance Committee reserved from the Tax Relief \nExtension Act of 1999 a revenue provision regarding the prevention or \nduplication of loss through assumption of liabilities, for inclusion in \nthe Trade and Development Act of 1999. This revenue provision addresses \na tax-avoidance transaction in which the assumption of certain \nliabilities or potential liabilities may permit the acceleration or \nduplication of a loss attributable to those liabilities. The bill that \nSenator Moynihan and I introduce more precisely defines the types of \ntransactions that are excepted from this revenue provision. Our bill is \noffered as a substitute for last fall's provision, and we introduce it \ntoday seeking public comment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2355. A bill to amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct to modify authorizations of appropriations for programs under such \nact; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\nthe growing resources in educational achievement for today and tomorrow \n                                  act\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation to dramatically increase funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act (IDEA). My legislation would more than double the \nfederal commitment to IDEA funding within four years. The legislation, \n``Growing Resources in Educational Achievement for Today and Tomorrow'' \n(GREATT IDEA) will take significant steps toward fulfilling the federal \ncommitment to IDEA funding. The legislation will also free up \nadditional funds for local school districts to be spent on their \nhighest priorities, whether it be teacher training or salaries, \nreducing class sizes, school construction, library resources, \ntechnology, or music and arts education. The legislation is supported \nby the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and Pennsylvania Governor \nTom Ridge who chairs the education committee of the National Governor's \nAssociation.\n  Every child is deserving of a high-quality education in an \nenvironment that encourages them to learn and grow to the best of their \nability. Thanks to IDEA, many students are learning and achieving at \nlevels previously thought impossible, graduating from high school, \ngoing to college and entering the workforce as productive citizens. We \nmust encourage this progress and continue to give parents and teachers \nthe resources they need to create opportunities for special children. \nBy boldly increasing the IDEA funding level, we can keep more students \nin schools and help them achieve new measures of success.\n  Prior to IDEA's implementation in 1975, approximately 1 million \nchildren with disabilities were shut out of schools and hundreds of \nthousands more were denied appropriate services. Since then, IDEA has \nhelped change the lives of these children. Congress had originally \ncommitted to cover 40 percent of IDEA's costs when it passed the \noriginal IDEA bill in 1975, with the remaining balance to be met by \nlocal communities and states. Over the years, however, while the law \nitself continues to work and children are being educated, the intended \ncost-sharing partnership has not been realized. The federal commitment \nof 40 percent will be reached within eight years if the funding stream \nestablished in GREATT IDEA is sustained. This is my first priority in \nhelping local school districts provide the best education possible for \nelementary and secondary education.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort to double funding for \nIDEA within the next four years as we continue to work to fulfill this \nlong neglected federal commitment and free up educational resources for \nlocal education. This legislation will fully fund more than 700,000 \nadditional IDEA students at an average cost of $13,860 per student. We \nmust accelerate the progress we have made by passing and funding this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\n  S. 2356. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to improve management of the child and adult care food program; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n  CHILD AND ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nrestore confidence in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) by \nattacking fraud and abuse discovered in the operation of the program.\n  Last year, the Inspector General of the United States Department of \nAgriculture released an audit of the CACFP, a nutrition program that \nreimburses the cost of meals at adult day care centers, child care \ncenters and family day care homes. The IG's audit detailed extensive \nabuse of program funds by sponsor organizations. Sponsors are \nresponsible for substantial monitoring and oversight of providers. In \naddition to the oversight function, the sponsors verify and forward \nCACFP claims to the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the USDA and \nreceive and distribute payments to providers. For their efforts, \nsponsors retain a portion of the reimbursement to large child care \ncenters and are paid a flat administrative fee for each small day care \nhome under their auspices. The Inspector General's findings were \ncritical of both the FNS management of the program as well as the \nstructure of CACFP that gives wide responsibility as well as the \ncontrol of finances to sponsor organizations.\n  The results of the audit are staggering. The IG found in ``Operation \nKiddie Care'' that 37 of 49 sponsors investigated were seriously \ndeficient in program administration. Of the 37 sponsors, 16 have \nultimately been terminated from the program. These 16 sponsors were \nreceiving about $35 million annually. Forty-four people have been \nindicted or named in criminal documents for defrauding CACFP and \ntwenty-eight of these individuals have pled guilty or have been \nconvicted.\n  The IG concluded that the structure of CACFP is flawed. The program \ncreates pools of money that invite abuse; sponsors of centers are able \nto retain up to 30 percent of program funds. The program encourages \nsponsors to ignore provider deficiencies since sponsors' administrative \ncost reimbursement is based on the number of providers they administer \nand the providers' reimbursement is based on the number of meals \nserved. In addition, sponsor officials may increase their salaries by \nreducing funds for day care monitoring activities.\n  USDA has prepared this legislation to address the IG's concerns and \nconclusion. This bill will enable state agencies to deny the \napplication of any sponsor that is found to be seriously deficient in \nany publicly-funded program, unlike current law which looks only at \nnutrition programs. For example, if the sponsor also runs a Head Start \ncenter and is not meeting Head Start management rules, that finding can \ndisqualify the organization from participation in CACFP. The proposal \nwill require organizations to have tax-exempt status from the Internal \nRevenue Service and will limit the amount a sponsor can withhold from \nchild care centers. Public agencies (e.g., local health departments and \nschools) will be encouraged to participate as sponsors through reduced \nadministrative requirements.\n  State agencies will have the ability to temporarily suspend payments \nwithout a hearing for up to 90 days. States will also be allowed to \nretain one-half of the funds collected through audits and state \nreviews. The FNS will also receive one-eighth of one percent of program \nfunds to provide oversight which will generate $3 million annually \ncompared to $1 million received under current law. Finally, FNS will be \nrequired to study the administrative payment structure.\n  While I am not certain that I will support all the provisions in \nUSDA's bill, I am introducing it today to begin the process of \ndiscussing and refining it. I encourage all interested parties to \ncontact the Agriculture Committee with their comments and suggestions.\n  Mr. President, the Federal government's nutrition programs are \nvitally important to millions of Americans. We cannot allow fraud and \nabuse of these programs to waste taxpayer dollars and undermine support \nfor these crucial programs.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to join my colleague, the distinguished Chairman of the \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, Senator Lugar, to \nintroduce this legislation designed to address the fraud and abuse that \nhas been found to be all too common in the Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram (CACFP). It is intolerable that bad actors have tarnished the \nimage of this important and laudable program of nutrition assistance. \nWe need to move aggressively to pass legislation to make the necessary \nchanges to root out fraud and abuse while maintaining CACFP's \neffectiveness and restoring its integrity.\n  Finding quality day care is one of the most difficult problems facing \nworking families today. CACFP is a very good program that helps meet \nthat need. The program, which is administered through the Food and \nNutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reimburses the \ncosts of meals and snacks at family day care homes, child care centers \nand adult day care homes. Because of the important role CACFP serves, \nCongress expanded it modestly in 1998 to help support after-school \nactivities for older children. In fiscal 1999, some 2.6 million \nchildren were served on average each day through CACFP, with the total \ncost of the program amounting to about $1.6 billion.\n  It is my understanding that USDA's Food and Nutrition Service \nrecognized that there were problems in the operation of CACFP and asked \nUSDA's Inspector General to audit the program. Simply put, the results \nof the audit cry out for action. In an audit covering nearly three \nyears, the IG found 37 sponsors in 23 states have had serious problems \nin carrying out CACFP. There were at least 30 criminal investigations \nand more than 40 individuals charged with defrauding CACFP. Notably, \nthe IG found that the Department of Agriculture and the States should \nhave done more to prevent the fraud and abuse that was prevalent in the \nprogram. Also the IG found structural problems in CACFP itself that \nmake the program more susceptible to fraud and abuse.\n  The legislation Senator Lugar and I are introducing today has been \ndrafted by USDA to respond to the problems and shortcomings in CACFP \nidentified by the IG. There are a number of good provisions and ideas \nin this legislation. I do not necessarily endorse all of the specific \naspects of this bill, but it is a strong and thoughtful starting point \nfor further consideration and for urgently-needed legislative action to \naddress problems in CACFP that cannot be allowed to continue.\n  I echo the remarks of my colleague, Senator Lugar, on the importance \nof the Federal nutrition programs and the need to combat fraud and \nabuse, so that we can prevent the waste of taxpayer dollars and \nmaintain support for the programs. There is no inconsistency in \nstrongly supporting child nutrition programs, yet vigorously fighting \nfraud and abuse in those programs. The truth of the matter is that \nevery dollar siphoned off to fraud and abuse is a dollar that could \nbetter be spent improving the nutrition of our nation's \nchildren.\n\n

Con. Res. 102\n\n       Whereas on August 2, 1944, a squadron of P-51s from the \n     United States 364th Fighter Group strafed a German munitions \n     train in Remy, France;\n       Whereas the resulting explosion killed Lieutenant Houston \n     Braly, one of the attacking pilots, and destroyed much of the \n     village of Remy, including 7 stained glass windows in the \n     13th century church;\n       Whereas despite threats of reprisals from the occupying \n     German authorities, the citizens of Remy recovered Lieutenant \n     Braly's body from the wreckage, buried his body with dignity \n     and honor in the church's cemetery, and decorated the grave \n     site daily with fresh flowers;\n       Whereas on Armistice Day, 1995, the village of Remy renamed \n     the crossroads near the site of Lieutenant Braly's death in \n     his honor;\n       Whereas the surviving members of the 364th Fighter Group \n     desire to express their gratitude to the brave citizens of \n     Remy; and\n       Whereas to express their gratitude, the surviving members \n     of the 364th Fighter Group have organized a nonprofit \n     corporation to raise funds through its project ``Windows for \n     Remy'' to restore the church's stained glass windows: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the bravery and honor of the citizens of Remy, \n     France, for their actions with respect to the American \n     fighter pilot Lieutenant Houston Braly, during and after \n     August 1944; and\n       (2) recognizes the efforts of the surviving members of the \n     United States 364th Fighter Group to raise funds to restore \n     the stained glass windows of Remy's 13th century church.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution. I \ntried to submit it during the first session of the 106th Congress, but \ndue to a clerical error, it was never printed. This resolution commends \nand remembers events that transpired in Remy, France as its citizens \nhonored the fallen World War II Army Air Corps pilot, Lieutenant \nHouston Braly. This inspiring story happened over fifty years ago, but \nits example of compassion and brotherhood remains in our hearts and \nminds.\n  On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in \nnorthern France encountered a German munitions train. After three \nunsuccessful attacks at the camouflaged train, Lt. Braly's fire hit a \ncar carrying explosives, causing a tremendous explosion.\n  Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel \nfrom the train, haystacks in fields some distance away burned, and \nnearly all\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\nbuildings in the small French town were demolished. A 13th century \nchurch in the town of Remy barely escaped destruction, but its historic \nstained-glass windows were shattered.\n  It was this explosion that tragically claimed the life of Lt. Braly \nat only twenty-two years of age.\n  Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents \nof Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled \nBraly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the \nnylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. \nHundreds of villagers left flowers around his body, stunning German \nauthorities.\n  The next morning, German authorities discovered that villagers \ncontinued to pay tribute to the young pilot despite threats of \npunishment. The placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued \nuntil American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople.\n  Almost 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, \ndiscovered this story in his research. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the \nstory that he visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass \nwindows of the magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in \nthe explosion had never been replaced. He contacted members of the \n364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. After hearing \nhow the residents of Remy had honored their fallen friend, veterans \njoined together to form Windows for Remy, a non-profit organization \nthat would raise $200,000 to replace the stained glass windows as a \ngesture of thanks to Remy for its deeds.\n  On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty years after the war ended, \nthe town of Remy paid tribute once more to Lt. Braly. On that day they \nrenamed the crossroads where he perished to ``Rue de Houston L. Braly, \nJr.''\n  I know that my fellow Senators will want to join me in commending the \npeople of Remy for their kindness and recognized the comrades of Lt. \nBraly for their goodwill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2120-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2120-S2130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       ARCTIC COASTAL PLAIN DOMESTIC ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               STEVENS (AND MURKOWSKI) AMENDMENT NO. 2905\n\n  (Ordered referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.)\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Murkowski) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. 2214) to establish and \nimplement a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in \nan environmentally sound and job creating program for the exploration, \ndevelopment, and production of the oil and gas resources of the Coastal \nPlain, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 15, beginning on line 7, delete ``and (20)'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof:\n       ``(20) require project agreement to the extent feasible \n     that will ensure productivity and consistency recognizing a \n     national interest in both labor stability and the ability of \n     construction labor and management to meet the particular \n     needs and conditions of projects to be developed under leases \n     issued pursuant to this Act; and\n       ``(21)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 ALLARD (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2906\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Grams) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution \n(S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the General Accounting Office, for every \n     dollar spent on elementary and secondary education funding \n     for all students, the Federal Government provided an \n     additional $4.73 per low-income student.\n       (2) Between 1992 and 1998, there was no significant change \n     in the percentage of 4th graders who met the proficient or \n     advanced standard in reading on the National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress.\n       (3) Thirteen percent of 4th grade students assisted under \n     part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 who took the 1998 National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress reading test scored at or above the \n     proficient level, compared with 40 percent of higher-income \n     students.\n       (4) After 35 years and more than $120,000,000,000 spent on \n     part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965, the goal of closing the achievement gap for \n     disadvantaged students is still unmet.\n       (5) New Federal education programs emphasize inputs, while \n     educational reform under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 will emphasize accountability in \n     exchange for flexibility and student achievement for all \n     children by closing the achievement gap.\n       (6) The funding levels in this resolution assume a net \n     increase of $19,600,000,000 over the fiscal years 2001 \n     through 2005 for programs under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 that will be reauthorized in 2001.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that increased \n     funding for the reauthorized programs under the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 should be dedicated to \n     innovative reforms that require academic achievement for all \n     students and aim to close the achievement gap that exists for \n     disadvantaged students.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBAL SELF-GOVERANCE AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CAMPBELL AMENDMENT NO. 2922\n\n  Mr. KYL (for Mr. Campbell) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 979) \nto amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to \nprovide for further self-governance by Indian tribes, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Self-Governance \n     Amendments of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the tribal right of self-government flows from the \n     inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes and nations;\n       (2) the United States recognizes a special government-to-\n     government relationship with Indian tribes, including the \n     right of the Indian tribes to self-governance, as reflected \n     in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the \n     course of dealings of the United States with Indian tribes;\n       (3) although progress has been made, the Federal \n     bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, has \n     eroded tribal self-governance and dominates tribal affairs;\n       (4) the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project, \n     established under title III of the Indian Self-Determination \n     and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450f note) was \n     designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-\n     government relationship between Indian tribes and the United \n     States and to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding \n     and program management;\n       (5) although the Federal Government has made considerable \n     strides in improving Indian health care, it has failed to \n     fully meet its trust responsibilities and to satisfy its \n     obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other \n     laws; and\n       (6) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-\n     Governance Demonstration Project and finds that transferring \n     full control and funding to tribal governments, upon tribal \n     request, over decision making for Federal programs, services, \n     functions, and activities (or portions thereof)--\n       (A) is an appropriate and effective means of implementing \n     the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with \n     Indian tribes; and\n       (B) strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-\n     determination.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of Congress--\n       (1) to permanently establish and implement tribal self-\n     governance within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services;\n       (2) to call for full cooperation from the Department of \n     Health and Human Services and its constituent agencies in the \n     implementation of tribal self-governance--\n       (A) to enable the United States to maintain and improve its \n     unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility \n     to, Indian tribes;\n       (B) to permit each Indian tribe to choose the extent of its \n     participation in self-governance in accordance with the \n     provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act relating to the provision of Federal services \n     to Indian tribes;\n       (C) to ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility \n     of the United States to Indian tribes and Indian individuals;\n       (D) to affirm and enable the United States to fulfill its \n     obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other \n     laws;\n       (E) to strengthen the government-to-government relationship \n     between the United States and Indian tribes through direct \n     and meaningful consultation with all tribes;\n       (F) to permit an orderly transition from Federal domination \n     of programs and services to provide Indian tribes with \n     meaningful authority, control, funding, and discretion to \n     plan, conduct, redesign, and administer programs, services, \n     functions, and activities (or portions thereof) that meet the \n     needs of the individual tribal communities;\n       (G) to provide for a measurable parallel reduction in the \n     Federal bureaucracy as programs, services, functions, and \n     activities (or portion thereof) are assumed by Indian tribes;\n       (H) to encourage the Secretary to identify all programs, \n     services, functions, and activities (or portions thereof) of \n     the Department\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\n     of Health and Human Services that may be managed by an Indian \n     tribe under this Act and to assist Indian tribes in assuming \n     responsibility for such programs, services, functions, and \n     activities (or portions thereof); and\n       (I) to provide Indian tribes with the earliest opportunity \n     to administer programs, services, functions, and activities \n     (or portions thereof) from throughout the Department of \n     Health and Human Services.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Self-Governance \n     Amendments of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the tribal right of self-government flows from the \n     inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes and nations;\n       (2) the United States recognizes a special government-to-\n     government relationship with Indian tribes, including the \n     right of the Indian tribes to self-governance, as reflected \n     in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the \n     course of dealings of the United States with Indian tribes;\n       (3) although progress has been made, the Federal \n     bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, has \n     eroded tribal self-governance and dominates tribal affairs;\n       (4) the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project, \n     established under title III of the Indian Self-Determination \n     and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450f note) was \n     designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-\n     government relationship between Indian tribes and the United \n     States and to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding \n     and program management;\n       (5) although the Federal Government has made considerable \n     strides in improving Indian health care, it has failed to \n     fully meet its trust responsibilities and to satisfy its \n     obligations to the Indian tribes under treaties and other \n     laws; and\n       (6) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-\n     Governance Demonstration Project and finds that transferring \n     full control and funding to tribal governments, upon tribal \n     request, over decision making for Federal programs, services, \n     functions, and activities (or portions thereof)--\n       (A) is an appropriate and effective means of implementing \n     the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with \n     Indian tribes; and\n       (B) strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-\n     determination.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for Mr. Campbell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2922.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2922) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment, as amended, be agreed to, and the bill be read for the third \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 979), as amended, was read the third time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \npass S. 979, a bill to make permanent the Self-Governance in Health \nCare Demonstration Project that was begun in 1994.\n  After numerous hearings by the Committee on Indian Affairs and months \nof\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\nnegotiations aimed at getting consensus on this legislation, the Senate \nhas voted to continue and expand the successful Self-Governance in \nHealth Care pilot that has proven so helpful in improving the health \ncare of Native people and in assisting tribes in the development of \ntheir governments and economies.\n  I thank and acknowledge Senator Gorton and his staff for their \nefforts in helping to iron out the differences that stood in the path \nof agreement on this bill.\n  I am hopeful this legislation will make its way to the President in \nshort order for his favorable consideration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will pass H.R. \n1167, the Tribal Self-Governance Amendments of 1999. This legislation \nis the culmination of years of work by the Indian Affairs Committee, \nIndian tribes and the Indian Health Service, IHS, to make permanent the \nsuccessful tribal self-governance demonstration program.\n  Since its inception, tribes have enthusiastically embraced the self-\ngovernance program because it allows them to assume greater control \nover health care programs and services which are now provided by the \nIHS. Tribal self-governance has succeeded because it respects the \nspecial trust relationship between Indian tribes and the United States. \nIt puts into practice the principles of government-to-government \nrelations and tribal sovereignty. It allows increased tribal \nflexibility and transfers control from federal bureaucrats to tribal \ngovernments who are closer to the people they serve.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Campbell for his leadership in fostering \nan agreement on final legislative language for this bill and for adding \nlegislative provisions which will designate an Assistant Secretary for \nIndian Health within the Department of Health and Human Services. The \nproposal to designate a new Assistant Secretary position primarily for \nIndian health policy is one that enjoys unanimous support by the tribal \ncommunity, bipartisan support by Congress, and is also endorsed by the \nAdministration.\n  The tribal self-governance bill is critically important to Indian \ncountry because it will finally put into place permanent authority for \nIndian tribes to directly manage their own health care programs. With \nthe passage of the IHS elevation bill as part of this legislation, we \ncan make progress for improved health conditions for Indian people \nnationwide.\n  Many of my colleagues may not realize that the year 2000 marks the \n30th anniversary of the inception of the Indian self-determination \npolicy, ending the era of failed Federal policies of termination and \npaternalism. A few days ago, I joined my colleagues, Senators Campbell \nand Johnson, in sponsoring S. Res. 277 commemorating this important \npolicy. In continuation of building upon the fundamental tenets of \ntribal self-determination, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to move quickly to send this bill to the President.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 419, H.R. 1167, the House companion measure. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 979, as amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof, and the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the Senate then insist on its \namendment and request a conference with the House.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that S. 979 be placed on the \ncalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1167), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2138-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 2000\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, the Department of Defense announced about \n2 weeks ago that they are going to delay a critical feasibility test of \nan interceptor which would protect the United States from a ballistic \nmissile attack. This delay, it should be noted, will give Congress and \nthe President some additional breathing room before we begin the debate \nto deploy a missile defense system. It may even mean the final decision \non deployment may not occur until after the November Presidential \nelection, as many have urged already.\n  However, I believe, we should use this opportunity to consider anew \nthe threats which the United States faces as a consequence of nuclear \nweapons. The approximately $25 billion missile defense system being \ncontemplated is in response to a threat that does not exist today but \nvery assuredly could if nations such as North Korea, Iran, or Iraq \ncontinue to develop their weapons of mass destruction programs. Under \nestimates provided to us by the CIA's National Intelligence Estimates \nand a panel of experts headed by Mr. Donald Rumsfeld we have been \nalerted to, the possibility exists that these countries could have \nweapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them to the United \nStates within 5 years. It is this potential threat, along with a \npossible accidental or unauthorized launch by Russia, that justifies \nthe attempt to build an effective missile defense system.\n  Three facts should be understood before proceeding further. First, \nthis system is not the original Star Wars proposal of President Reagan. \nIn other words, it is not a system which would protect us against a \nmassive attack by Russia, a threat we now believe no longer exists. \nSecond, the annual costs to build and maintain this new system would be \nin addition to the estimated $15 to $25 billion annual costs of the \nnuclear arsenal we maintain against the old threat of the Soviet Union. \nThird, the deterrent argument we used during the cold war was based on \nthe rational presumption that the Soviet Union would never attack us if \nthey knew that an attack would result in the destruction of their \nnation. However, we cannot presume rational behavior from North Korea, \nIraq, Iran, or potential terrorists will be the order of the day. We \npresume they would be willing to suffer the consequences of retaliation \nto do terrible damage to the United States of America.\n  A scenario which imagines such an attack quickly justifies the \ninvestment in missile defenses. Even one relatively small nuclear \nweapon which North Korea, Iran, Iraq, or a non-nation-state terrorist \ncould launch at the United States would inflict more damage than\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\nthe largest natural disaster our country has ever experienced. An \nunauthorized or accidental launch by Russia would be a catastrophe that \ncould kill millions and inflict grave economic and psychological damage \nto our country.\n  Such a scenario is part of the new world of threats where even, or \nperhaps especially, the United States, the nation with the largest and \nmost deadly nuclear arsenal, is at risk and can be held hostage to the \nthreats made by otherwise insignificant world leaders. This truth \nincreases the appetite of a few to command even a relatively crude and \nsmall nuclear weapon as well as a delivery system to hit us. A strong \noffensive nuclear capability is not a deterrent because of the \nirrational behavior of someone who hates and wants to hurt us. Nor was \nour strong offense a deterrent to India and Pakistan first testing \nnuclear weapons and then threatening each other with possible first \nuse.\n  We have come a long ways since the beginning of the nuclear age a \nhalf century ago. I recently went to the web page of Gen. Paul Tibbets \nand read his account of the 6-hour flight on August 6, 1945, that \ndropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. The 86-year-old \nTibbets was the pilot of the B-29 called Enola Gay that dropped the \natomic bomb, a uranium core device with a 15 kiloton yield nicknamed \nLittle Boy. Three days later a second atomic bomb nicknamed Fat Boy, on \naccount of its plutonium core, was dropped from another B-29 on \nNagasaki. The two violent detonations contributed to Japan's \nunconditional surrender on August 14, 1945.\n\n  Before I go further, I must declare that I am not an impartial \nobserver of these bombings. My father became part of an occupation \nforce rather than the invasion force, which had been planned for \nSeptember of 1945. His brother was captured by the Japanese on the \nBataan peninsula of Luzon, Philippines, and was killed just days before \nAmerican forces began the second battle of the Philippines, one of the \nbloodiest battles of the war. So I am on the side of those who believe \nPresident Truman made the right decision. I simply cannot and will not \nrevise history to reach any other conclusion.\n  Still, the civilian deaths caused by those two bombs shock and sicken \nall who have examined the aftermath of just two atomic detonations. So \nshocking are the stories that during the 50 years that followed, no \nAmerican Commander in Chief has ever used these weapons again. Even \nwhen a good argument could be made for their effectiveness in saving \nmilitary and civilian lives by shortening and winning wars, the \n``bomb'' was not used.\n  Indeed, as the recent NATO operation against Yugoslavia demonstrated, \ntoday's military planners and their political bosses measure the \nbenefits of using conventional weapons against the potential moral and \npolitical losses associated with even unintended civilian casualties. \nThus has the experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki become a real and \npowerful deterrent against the use by the United States of nuclear \nweapons.\n  This makes it all the more surprising that both the United States and \nRussia continue to maintain, on hair-trigger alert, huge stockpiles of \nvastly more powerful and more accurate strategic nuclear weapons than \nthose used 56 years ago this summer. To understand why, we must trace \nthe arguments used since 1945 for the development of our nuclear \narsenal. For the first 20 years or so of the cold war, nuclear weapons \nwere seen as an inexpensive alternative to unacceptably high levels of \nconventional forces that would have been needed to deter a belligerent \nSoviet Union with an open ambition for more territory in Europe. As the \nSoviet Union built up its own nuclear capability a new argument--the \nneed to deter a bolt out of the blue attack--eclipsed the old.\n\n  But, today, neither the Russian conventional or nuclear forces are \nthe threat they once were. Today, we are not fearful of an intentional \nattack on Europe with conventional forces or a nuclear attack on the \nUnited States. Today's threat is that a nuclear weapon could be \nlaunched accidentally or without the authorization of the \ndemocratically elected Russian President. Today's threat also includes \nthe possibility that Russian technology or materials could be purchased \nby nations like Iran that have indicated their desire to become a \nnuclear nation. Finally, today's threat assessment also includes the \npossibility that Russian elections could once again produce a more \ndangerous leader whose intentions were less trustworthy.\n  Even with all of these factors considered, I believe our current \ninventory of strategic nuclear weapons is much larger than what is \nneeded to keep America safe today and in the foreseeable future. This \nlarger inventory forces the Russians to maintain an inventory larger \nthan they can control--which in turn increases the risk of accidental \nor unauthorized launches and decreases the effectiveness of missile \ndefense. And this larger inventory diverts much needed resources from \nthe modernization of our conventional forces, which we are much more \nlikely to be using in the future.\n  Consider the arsenal currently available to our President. Our \nCommander in Chief could order the launch of 500 Minutemen III and 50 \nPeacekeeper missiles in the land-based arsenal. The bulk of the \nMinutemen III missiles are armed with three 170 to 335 kilotons \nwarheads. The 50 Peacekeeper missiles are each armed with 10, \nindividually targetable warheads with a yield of 300 kilotons each. \nThese land-based missiles would produce 2,000 nuclear detonations each \nof which each would be 10 to 20 times larger than the Hiroshima bomb.\n  At sea, our President commands 18 Ohio-class submarines. These are \nthe ultimate in survivability, able to stay undetected at sea for long \nperiods of time. As such, our submarine force must give pause to any \npotential aggressor. Eight of these boats carry 24 C-4 missiles. Each \nof these missiles are loaded with 8 warheads with 100 kilotons of \nyield. The other 10 subs carry 24 of the updated D-5 missiles. These \nmissiles also are equipped with 8 warheads with varying degrees of \nyield from 100 to 475 kilotons. Again, if the President launched all \nthe missiles in the submarine arsenal he would produce 3,500 \ndetonations.\n  In the air, the President commands a strategic bomber force which \nincludes both the B-2 and B-52 bombers. These bombers, in total, have \nthe capacity to carry about 1,700 warheads via nuclear bombs and air \nlaunched cruise missiles.\n  Our land-based force can deliver approximately 2,000 warheads on over \n500 delivery vehicles with a total yield of about 550 megatons. Our \nsea-based force can deliver over 3,000 warheads on over 400 delivery \nvehicles for a total yield of approximately 490 megatons. Our air-based \nforce can deliver 1,700 warheads on approximately 90 delivery vehicles \nwith a yield of 820 megatons. In total, this is about 7,000 warheads \nwith a total yield of over 1,800 megatons.\n  Russia has a similarly deadly force, but with an increasing inability \nto modernize or maintain these weapons. Because of this, I remain \nhopeful that President Putin's election will improve the chances of the \nRussian Duma ratifying START II sometime this spring. But even under \nSTART II, the United States and Russia will each maintain in excess of \n3,000 warheads at the end of 2007. While both sides hope to quickly \nfollow ratification of START II with a START III agreement, U.S. \nnegotiators have insisted on maintaining approximately 2,500 warheads \nper side. This comes despite strong indications that within a matter of \nyears Russia will not be able to maintain a force of more than a few \nhundred weapons and an offer from Russian negotiators that START III \nfocus on warhead levels of approximately 1,500.\n\n  I think it is fair for the American people to ask why. Why, when the \nRussians have indicated a willingness to go lower, are we insisting on \nkeeping so many strategic nuclear warheads? I think the answer can be \nfound in the way in which we target our nuclear weapons. The United \nStates nuclear blueprint of targets and targeting assignments are \ncontained in a highly classified plan known as the Single Integrated \nOperational Plan, or SIOP. To understand our nuclear policy, one must \nunderstand how the SIOP drives nuclear force levels. Because the SIOP \nis highly classified, I cannot describe it in public.\n  But I can say that targeting strategies have changed a lot since \nHiroshima. The variables which dictate\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\nchanges have been arms control agreements, perception of today's \nthreat, and estimation of tomorrow's. Understanding the history of U.S. \nnuclear policy may help explain the rationale for the targeting plan.\n  In the beginning, we had a letter from Albert Einstein to then-\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt in 1939. In this letter, Einstein alerted \nRoosevelt of the potential of nuclear chain reactions and warned him \nabout Nazi Germany's efforts to monopolize the necessary uranium. \nEinstein also urged the President to foster ties between the Government \nand scientists working in the area of atomic research. As a result of \nEinstein's letter, Roosevelt authorized a study of the potential of \natomic power. But it was not until the U.S. entered World War II that \nRoosevelt formalized the Government's participation in this new area of \nscience. The result was the creation of the Manhattan Project. The \nManhattan Project was a monumental undertaking that employed over \n200,000 men and women at a cost of $20 billion in today's inflation-\nadjusted dollars. Ultimately, it was successful in creating the world's \nfirst atomic bombs, whose devastating impact helped end the Second \nWorld War in the Pacific.\n  The second phase of our effort was the strategic bombing phase. \nHaving created this powerful new weapon, and as the cold war began, \nU.S. policymakers faced the task of deciding how to incorporate these \nweapons into the U.S. arsenal and under what circumstances they should \nbe used. Our initial policy was based on the concept of strategic \nbombing, which mirrored our strategy during the Second World War. Early \nplans called for the targeting of urban industrial centers--not unlike \nHiroshima and Nagasaki--and specifically targeted 34 bombs on 24 Soviet \ncities. Given the fact that Japan had surrendered following the use of \njust two bombs, this was thought sufficient to devastate the Soviet \nUnion under any circumstance.\n  The third phase of our planning was called massive retaliation \nbecause in 1949 the U.S. approach to nuclear weapons had to be \nreconsidered following reports that the Soviet Union had acquired a \nnuclear weapons capability of their own. From this point on, U.S. \npolicymakers had to consider Soviet nuclear sites in targeting and had \nto be able to deal with the fact that for the fist time Americans lived \nunder the threat of a nuclear attack.\n  Into the 1950s U.S. nuclear policy continued to develop. By the \nEisenhower administration, the U.S. nuclear arsenal had greatly \nincreased in numbers, but we had adopted a policy of massive \nretaliation. This policy stated that an attack by the Soviet Union \nwould result in an instant, all-out U.S. nuclear response. The greater \nreliance on nuclear weapons allowed the United States to decrease its \ncommitment to conventional weapons and keep defense spending in check.\n  The next phase is what was called flexible response. It occurred \nbecause the number of nuclear weapons needed to maintain this policy \nincreased significantly as U.S. intelligence improved its ability to \nidentify Soviet targets. As a result of the expansion of possible \ntargets, there was an increased demand for nuclear weapons. Toward the \nend of the Eisenhower administration, policymakers began to recognize \nthe need to create greater flexibility in the U.S. nuclear strategy.\n  During the last months of the Eisenhower administration and into the \nKennedy administration, the focus shifted to creating a flexible \nresponse strategy that would allow the President to respond to Soviet \nprovocation through a range of options--not simply an all-out attack. \nThe result of this effort was the creation of the SIOP. The original \nSIOP, SIOP-62, embodied the policy of massive retaliation. It contained \none plan in which the United States would launch all of its nuclear \nweapons in a single attack. SIOP-62 targeted every city in the Soviet \nUnion and China with an estimated 360 to 425 million civilian \ncasualties.\n  When President Kennedy entered office, he immediately called for a \nchange in the SIOP to reflect the policy of flexible response. As a \nresult, SIOP-63 included limited nuclear responses and negotiating \npauses as a part of the overall nuclear strategy. SIOP-5 and SIOP-6 \ncontinued the trend toward increasing flexibility by creating a wider \nrange of nuclear targeting and response options. While the various \nSIOPs were successful in creating greater options for the President, \nthey also helped to create a phenomenon in which the number of nuclear \nweapons were increased dramatically.\n  As the SIOP sought to create an inclusive list of Soviet targets, \nweapons were manufactured and assigned to those targets. As \nintelligence gathering capabilities grew, the number of targets were \nalso increased. Furthermore, as the Soviets created more weapons to \ntarget our weapons, the U.S. would increase our arsenal to match. The \nresult was a classic arms race. According to a recent book called \nAtomic Audit, edited by Stephen Schwartz, this process was further \nescalated when in 1974 Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger ordered \nthat U.S. nuclear forces ``be able to destroy 70% of the Soviet \nindustry that would be needed to achieve economic recovery in the event \nof a large-scale strategic nuclear exchange.'' This order was \nmistakenly thought to mean that 70% of each individual factory or \nindustrial unit would have to be destroyed rather than 70% of the \noverall production capability. In order to achieve assurance of 70% \ndestruction, each target was often assigned multiple warheads, thus \nincreasing the nuclear arms spiral.\n  Near the height of this nuclear build-up, a remarkable thing \noccurred: communism collapsed in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. \nMany people assume that the end of the Cold War has caused the United \nStates to fundamentally rethink the SIOP. However, most of the changes \nappear to have occurred at the margin and have not involved \nfundamentally rethinking in the face of democratic changes in Russia. \nOpen sources estimate the number of Russian targets in the SIOP have \nbeen reduced from a Cold War high of approximately 11,000 to around \n2,000. The current SIOP--SIOP-99 which went into effect in October \n1998--also includes approximately 500 non-Russian targets.\n  While the reduction in number of targets has allowed us to make \nreductions in our nuclear arsenal, too many of the underpinnings of our \nnuclear policy are still based on Cold War thinking. Our planners still \nassume that deterrence requires the capability of hitting as many as \n2,000 targets in a democratic Russia.\n  Our nuclear policy should recognize that the Cold War is over and \nshould recognize that Russia has completed its third democratic \nPresidential election. It should recognize that we are less safe--if by \nkeeping more weapons than we need to defend ourselves--we force Russia \nto keep more weapons than they can control. Furthermore, we are less \nsafe if by keeping more than we need, we encourage new nuclear nations \nlike India and Pakistan. And we are less safe if all of this activity \nboth justifies and makes possible the acquisition of nuclear weapons by \nrogue nations or terrorist non-nation-state groups.\n  Most importantly our strategy should acknowledge that we have a moral \ndeterrent that makes it unlikely that a U.S. President would order the \nfirst use of nuclear weapons. Since the dollars needed to maintain our \nnuclear arsenal could be used to support military programs our \nPresident is likely to use, this factor has much more significance than \nwe have been giving it.\n  It is time for us to re-examine both our nuclear deterrent needs and \nthe way in which we target our weapons to better reflect the realities \nof a post-Cold War world. We must realize the end of the Cold War and \nthe rapid pace of globalization is changing both the nature and the \nsource of today's threats. The world is still dangerous; nuclear \nthreats still exist and will require us to maintain an overwhelming \ndeterrent capability. But that capability must recognize what the world \nlooks like today and what it will look like in 2005 and in 2010, not \nwhat it looked like in 1950 or in 1970 or even 1989.\n  Just as Rip Van Winkle awoke to find his world had completely changed \nwhile he was asleep, we too must realize that in less than a decade our \nworld has been completely transformed. The time to readjust our world \nview, to transform our nuclear policies, and to work cooperatively with \na democratic Russia is now.\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\n  I believe the numbers of highly accurate, deadly and survivable \nnuclear weapons needed to protect the United States today and in the \nfuture is in the 1,000 to 1,500 range, considerably less than either \nthe 6,000 permitted under START I which has been ratified by the United \nStates and Russia, or the 3,000 permitted after 2007 under START II, \nwhich the Russian Duma may yet ratify this year. I believe both common \nsense and careful evaluation of targeting requirements would support \ngoing to this lower number much more rapidly than we will under the \nSTART process. I believe such a reduction would make it far more likely \nwe would succeed in reducing the growing threat of nuclear \nproliferation and the growing desire of non-nuclear nations to go \nnuclear. Finally, I believe such a reduction would increase the chances \nof getting Russia to cooperate with the deployment of a missile defense \nsystem that would benefit both them and us.\n  Mr. President, regardless of whether or not my colleagues agree with \nthis assessment I hope they will agree that the status quo modified \nwith improved defenses is a strategy which will increase the risk that \nthe world will experience a third hostile nuclear detonation, and that \nthis time the detonation could occur in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our economy is in great shape: 108 months \nof economic growth; unemployment has been near 4 percent for some time; \neconomic growth is doing very well; productivity is breaking all recent \nrecords; incomes of average Americans are finally growing again, and \ninflation, outside of gasoline, is low. I think we ought to take \nadvantage of our situation by paying off the publicly held debt while \ntimes are good.\n  The President proposes that we should plan on doing that by 2013, \njust the point when large numbers of the post-World War II baby boomers \nare reaching 65. That way we shore up the capacity to be able to repay \nthe bonds that have been going to the Social Security trust fund.\n  I also believe we should use the surplus to put the Medicare trust \nfund on a sound footing for the long term. We should also be providing \nfor a prescription drug benefit. It is wrong that many modest-income \nseniors do not have the ability to buy the drugs they need for their \nhealth care.\n  I would also like to see the expenditures made to cover the costs of \nour veterans' health, increased medical research, increased funds for \neducation, and for day care. These are some key priorities.\n  Clearly, however, the No. 1 priority presented by the majority in the \nbudget resolution before us is to cut taxes for the wealthy. When you \nadd the interest costs from failing to reduce the debt, the $150 \nbillion cut in taxes that is in the budget resolution before us uses up \n98 percent of the non-Social Security surplus. That assumes cutting \nsome nondefense discretionary spending. If you take the $150 billion \ntax cut that is in the budget, and if you don't cut spending on the \ndiscretionary side, that tax cut actually eats up over 100 percent of \nthe non-Social Security surplus. So in order to get the $150 billion \ncut in taxes, the Republican majority on the Budget Committee actually \nhad to cut spending in a number of areas. Even with that cut, that $150 \nbillion tax cut uses up 98 percent of that surplus. There is virtually \nnothing left over for improving the health of the Social Security trust \nfund or the Medicare trust fund. There is very little chance to provide \nfor a Medicare prescription drug benefit. It is going to be very \ndifficult, if not impossible, to provide increases for education, \nmedical research, veterans' health, money to fight crime, and other \npriorities without eroding the Social Security surplus.\n\n  Personally, I would like to see us give some tax relief to younger \nfamilies with modest incomes trying to raise their children, to \nfamilies with considerable child care expenses, to families who have \nexpenses caring for aging parents. I would like to reduce the penalty \nof higher taxes when two people marry and both work.\n  The Democratic budget we have offered provides for many of those \ntargeted tax cuts while still meeting the other needs such as for \nhealth care and fighting crime and medical research.\n  I would like to pay for tax cuts by eliminating some of the \noutrageous loopholes in the Tax Code that allow huge multinational \ncorporations to escape paying their fair share of taxes. I would like \nto see some loopholes closed that allow some of the wealthy to escape \npaying their fair share. That, unfortunately, does not appear to be the \nwill of the Republican majority on the Budget Committee. It certainly \nwas not their will when they passed out the budget resolution on a \nstraight party-line vote. So I will be offering an amendment that says \nif we are going to enact--if we are, and if it is the will of the \nmajority party to enact the $150 billion in tax cuts mandated by the \nbudget; and that was the same sum agreed to in the House by, I might \nadd, a narrow 4 vote margin--I want to have the Senate go on record \nthat whatever tax cuts are passed follow a very simple rule: that those \nat the highest level of income--the top 1 percent--not receive more \nthan 1 percent of the tax cuts. I will be offering an amendment that \nessentially says it is the sense of the Senate that if we do have a tax \ncut, no more than 1 percent of the tax cut benefits can go to the top 1 \npercent income earners.\n\n  Doesn't that sound fair? If you are in the top 1 percent, maybe you \nought to get 1 percent of the cuts. Who is at that level of income? \nWell, those who are making what is now estimated to be more than \n$317,000 per year. This group, on average, makes $915,000 a year. So \nthe average income of the top 1 percent income earners in America is \n$915,000 a year. I believe it is clear that people at this income level \ndo not need a large tax cut, while many working families are in far \ngreater need.\n  So I hope the Senate will go on record saying that we have a limit on \nany tax cut, that those at the very top are receiving no more than 1 \npercent of the benefits, and let's give the middle class their fair \nshare of the tax break.\n  I have a chart that I think provides some illustration. First, we \nhave the George Bush tax cut proposal. Let's look at how the benefits \nof that proposal work. It is a very large cut. But under this Bush \nplan, as estimated by Citizens For Tax Justice, the bottom 20 percent \nof the taxpayers get 0.6 percent of the tax cuts, less than 1 percent. \nThe next 20 percent get about 3 percent of the tax cuts. The next 20 \npercent get about 7.4 percent of the tax cuts. The fourth one--those \nwho make, on average, about $50,000 a year--gets 15.4 percent of the \ntax benefits. But here is where we really have to look, out here on \nthis end. Those in the top 1 percent, making over $319,000 a year--and \nthey average about $915,000 a year--these folks in ``need'' get about \n37 percent of the benefits. They get a higher percentage than anybody \nelse and, in dollar amounts, they get about $50,000 a year in tax \nbreaks.\n  So, again, this is what we are facing. Why do people in the upper 1 \npercent need this kind of a tax break? I don't hear it from them. I \nmust admit, I know some people in that bracket. I have some good \nfriends who make that kind of money. They are good Americans and they \ninvest a lot of money. A lot of them work very hard, and they employ \npeople. I have yet to have one of them tell me they need this tax cut. \nIn fact, I have had a number of them say: What are you doing? Pay off \nthe public debt; don't give us a tax break. Pay off the public debt. \nThat would do more for ensuring the economic health of this country \nthan giving the top 1 percent that kind of a tax break.\n  Well, that is why I want to offer this amendment. It is very simple. \nIt provides that the top 1 percent of taxpayers should not get any more \nthan 1 percent of the tax cuts--net. After all, the bottom 20 percent \ngets less than 1 percent of the tax cuts. Why should the top 1 percent \nget 37 percent?\n  So my amendment says if you are in that top 1 percent, you should not \nget more than 1 percent of the tax breaks. So if you are for tax \nfairness, if you want to give the middle-class Americans their fair \nshare of tax relief, then I ask for your support of this commonsense \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/04/senate-section/article/S2141-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2141-S2142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our economy is in great shape: 108 months \nof economic growth; unemployment has been near 4 percent for some time; \neconomic growth is doing very well; productivity is breaking all recent \nrecords; incomes of average Americans are finally growing again, and \ninflation, outside of gasoline, is low. I think we ought to take \nadvantage of our situation by paying off the publicly held debt while \ntimes are good.\n  The President proposes that we should plan on doing that by 2013, \njust the point when large numbers of the post-World War II baby boomers \nare reaching 65. That way we shore up the capacity to be able to repay \nthe bonds that have been going to the Social Security trust fund.\n  I also believe we should use the surplus to put the Medicare trust \nfund on a sound footing for the long term. We should also be providing \nfor a prescription drug benefit. It is wrong that many modest-income \nseniors do not have the ability to buy the drugs they need for their \nhealth care.\n  I would also like to see the expenditures made to cover the costs of \nour veterans' health, increased medical research, increased funds for \neducation, and for day care.
