Mr. President, I wish to make a brief comment, if I may, \non one of the items referred to in a statement by the majority leader \nabout the appropriations process, which I think will be of interest to \nour colleagues and perhaps to others who may be watching on C-SPAN 2.\n  We had negotiations beginning at 4 o'clock on Sunday afternoon with \nofficials from the White House, and we are trying to resolve those \nissues in a spirit of accommodation. With respect to the dollars \ninvolved, the bill which came out of the Appropriations Committee was \n$93.7 billion for the three Departments. That was $600 million more \nthan the President's figure, and it was $300 million more than the \nPresident's figure on education.\n  I worked on a bipartisan basis with my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Harkin. The bill was crafted with what we thought was the right \ndollar amount--frankly, the maximum amount--to pass with votes in \nsubstantial numbers from Republicans and an amount which would be \nacceptable to Democrats and to the President because it was somewhat \nhigher than his figure and we emphasized increased funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  The administration has come back with a figure of $2.3 billion \nadditional, and Congressman Porter and I made an offer yesterday to add \n$228 million, provided we could find offsets because it is very \nimportant that we not go into the Social Security trust funds. So that \nwhatever dollars we add to accommodate the President's priorities--we \nare going to have to have offsets on priorities which the Congress has \nestablished. We are prepared to meet him halfway on priorities on \ndollars--we are going to have to have offsets on priorities which the \nCongress has established.\n  There is a much more difficult issue in this matter than the dollars, \nalthough the dollars are obviously of great importance, and the issue \nwhich is extremely contentious is what will be done on the President's \ndemand to have $1.4 billion to reduce classroom size to have additional \nteachers.\n  The Senate bill has appropriated $1.2 billion which maintains the \nhigh level of last year's funding. When it comes to the issue of the \nutilization of that money, we are prepared to acknowledge the \nPresident's first priority of reduction of classroom size for teachers. \nBut if the local school board makes a factual determination that is not \nthe real need of the local school board, then we propose that the \nsecond priority be teacher training. If the local school board decides \nthat is not where the money ought to be spent, then we propose to give \nit to the school board the discretion as to the spending to local \neducation, as opposed to a straitjacket out of Washington.\n  The White House Press Secretary has issued a statement this morning \nsaying that these funds could be used for vouchers, and that is not \ntrue. That is a red herring. To allay any concern, we will make it \nexplicit in the bill that the President's concern about the use of \nthese funds for vouchers will be allayed. We are prepared to make that \naccommodation, although there had never been any intent to use it for \nvouchers. However, we will make that intent explicit in the bill.\n  Behind the issue of classroom size and the President's demand is a \nmuch greater constitutional issue. That is the constitutional issue of \nwho controls the power of the purse. The Constitution gives the \nauthority to the Congress to establish spending priorities, and we have \nseen a process evolve in the past few years which does not follow the \nconstitutional format. The Constitution is very specific that each\n\n[[Page S14341]]\n\nHouse will decide on a bill, have a conference, and send that bill to \nthe President for his signature or for his veto; and if he vetoes it, \nthe bill then comes back to the Congress for reenactment. But what has \nhappened in the immediate past has been that executive branch officials \nsit in with the appropriators and are a part of the legislative \nprocess, which is a violation of the principle of separation of powers. \nNow, I must say that I have been a party to those meetings because that \nis what is going on. But I want to identify it as a process which is \nnot in conformity with the Constitution. It is something we ought to \nchange. When it comes to the power and the control, what we have seen \nhappen in the last 4 years is that the President has really made an \neffort, and to a substantial extent a successful effort, to take over \nthe prerogative of the Congress on the power of the purse.\n\n  When the Government was closed in late 1995 and early 1996, the \nRepublican-controlled Congress was blamed for the closure. That, \ncandidly, has made the Congress gun-shy to challenge the President on \nspending issues. Since that time there has been a concession to the \nPresident on whatever it is that he wants, sort of ``pay a price to get \nout of town'' when people are anxious to have the congressional session \nadjourn.\n  Speaking for myself and I think quite a few others in the Congress \nare not going to put on the pressure to get out of town. We are going \nto do the job and do it right. Senator Lott held a news conference \nyesterday and was asked about the termination time. He said he thought \nit was possible to finish the public's business by the close of the \nlegislative session on Wednesday, which is tomorrow, but it was more \nimportant, as Senator Lott articulated, to do it right than get it \nfinished by any arbitrary deadline. I concur totally with Senator Lott. \nI think it is possible to get the business finished by the end of the \nworking day tomorrow. But it is more important to get it right than to \nget it finished on any prescribed schedule. In modern times there is \ntoo much concern about getting out of town, than perhaps getting the \njob done right. But we are determined to get it done and to get it done \nright. If we can get it done by the end of business tomorrow, that is \nwhat our goal is. But we are not going to sacrifice getting it done \nright in order to be able to finish up by Wednesday afternoon to get \nout of town.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question? Will the Senator \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, I will not yield here, but I will in just a minute.\n  What we have seen is the President's ultimatum. He says this issue on \nschoolteachers is nonnegotiable. That is hardly the way you get into a \nnegotiation session. Then his Chief of Staff, John Podesta, said on \nSunday that if the Congress wants to get out of town they are going to \nhave to accede to the President's demands on teachers, to do it his \nway. I think that is not appropriate. Congress has the power of the \npurse under the Constitution. It is our fundamental responsibility on \nappropriations. We are prepared to negotiate, but we are not prepared \nto deal with nonnegotiable demands. We are not prepared to deal with \nultimatums. We are going back into a session--I don't know whether I \nshould call it a negotiating session or not, because the President \ntalks about nonnegotiable demands. Frankly, I am prepared to meet that \nwith a nonnegotiable demand, not giving up on our prerogative to make a \ndetermination as to how the money is to be spent and getting local \ncontrol over a Presidential straitjacket.\n  Now I would be delighted to yield to my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wanted to inquire of the desk what the Senate business \nwas supposed to be? I was under the impression we were supposed to be, \nat 9:30, on the minimum wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have concluded. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask we extend the time. How much time \ndid the Senator from Pennsylvania expend?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What was the question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I asked how much time the Senator from Pennsylvania \nused?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 19 minutes left.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just as a matter of inquiry, were taken out of the time \nof the debate. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Taken out of the Republican time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. OK. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from \nPennsylvania's comments with great interest. I will mention very \nbriefly in defense of the administration, although they can make the \ncase quite well for themselves that if the Appropriations Committee had \nfinished their business on time we would not be in this particular \ndilemma. Only four appropriations bills were actually completed on time \nfor the fiscal year. So with all respect to our friend on the other \nside, if the appropriators had placed, particularly the HEW \nappropriations, first rather than last, I do not think we would be \nhaving these kinds of problems in the areas of negotiation between the \nPresident and the Congress.\n  Second, the basic program which the President has been fighting for \nin this negotiation is almost identical to what the Republicans \nsupported last year. With all respect to the comments we have just \nheard, the fact is if the classes reach the goals, the 15 percent set-\naside for funding for smaller class sizes can be used to enhance the \nteacher training. If the school had already achieved the lower class \nsize of 18, it would be used for special needs or other kinds of \nprofessional purposes.\n  So it is difficult for me to understand the frustration of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania when the Republican leaders all effectively \nendorse what the President talked about last year. If their position is \nnot sustained, there are going to be 30,000 teachers who are teaching \nin first, second, and third grades who are going to get pink slips. I \ndon't think the problem in education is having fewer schoolteachers \nteach in the early grades but to have more.\n  I want to make clear I am not a part of those negotiations this year, \nbut I was last year. I know what the particular issue is. With all \nrespect to those who are watching C-SPAN II, I want them to know the \nPresident is fighting for smaller class sizes as well as for better \ntrained teachers. We have seen Senator Murray make that presentation \nand make it effectively time and again. I think it is something that \nparents support, teachers understand, and children have benefited from. \nNo one makes that case more eloquently than the Senator from the State \nof Washington. But I certainly hope the President will continue that \ncommitment. We have scarce Federal resources. They are targeted in \nareas of particular need. That is the purpose of these negotiations. I \nhope we can conclude a successful negotiation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On your time, yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just for an observation. He might want to answer it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the truth of the matter is if schools \nwant the new teachers, under the proposal of the distinguished chairman \nwho just took to the floor to explain the obstinacy of the President, \nthey can have the money for teachers. That is what he is saying. It is \nup to them. If they want all the money that comes from this \nappropriation used for teachers, they can have it. If they say, we \ndon't need them, we don't want them, he is saying there is a second \npriority.\n  Frankly, I think that is excellent policy with reference to the \nschools of our country. I believe the Senator from Pennsylvania makes a \ngood point. For the President to continue to say we are not going to \nget this bill unless we do it exactly his way leaves us with no \nalternative. We have some prerogatives, too. The fact is, if you read \nthe Constitution, he doesn't appropriate; the Congress does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S14342]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to respond, we have a need for 2 \nmillion teachers. We have scarce Federal resources. If the States or \nlocal communities want to do whatever the Senator from New Mexico says, \nall well and good. But we are talking about scarce Federal resources \nthat are targeted in ways that have been proven effective in enhancing \nacademic achievement and accomplishment.\n  I am again surprised. The Republicans were taking credit for this \nlast year. I was in the negotiations. Mr. Goodling and Mr. Gingrich--as \nwe were waiting to find out whether the powers that be, the Speaker, \nwas going to endorse this, when we were waiting and having \nnegotiations--went out and announced it and took credit for it. They \ntook credit for this proposal of the President.\n  I find it a little difficult to understand this kind of frustration \nthat is being demonstrated here. But we will come back to this and \nSenator Murray can address these issues at a later time. I certainly \nhope the President will not flinch in his commitment to getting smaller \nclass sizes and better trained teachers and after school programs. That \nis what this President has been fighting for. I hope he will not yield \nat this time in these final negotiations, after we have only had four \nappropriations that have met the deadline. Before we get all excited \nabout these negotiations, if our appropriators had completed this work \nin time, we would not be here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have? I will be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Good. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, briefly, I ask my colleague, is it not \ntrue this appropriation for education was the last of the bills \nconsidered by the Appropriations Committee? Is it not true that we \nwaited until the very last day to even bring up this issue of \neducation, the highest priority for American families? Now we find \nourselves trying to adjourn, stuck on an issue that could have been \nresolved months ago had we made education as high a priority on Capitol \nHill as it is in family rooms across America.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. The Senator from \nIllinois, the Senator from California, and I know the Senator from \nWashington as well, had hoped--and I believe I can speak for our \nDemocratic leader--this would be the No. 1 appropriation and not the \nlast one. If we had this as the No. 1 appropriation on the issue of \neducation, we would not have these little statements we have heard this \nmorning. But it is the last one. That is not by accident; that is by \nchoice of the Republican leadership.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  In a few moments, we will be voting on the minimum wage issue that is \nbefore the Senate. I want to review what the record has been over the \nlast 2 years.\n  In September of 1998, we brought up the minimum wage issue, and were \nunable to bring that to a vote on the basis of the merits. The \nRepublican leadership said no.\n  In March of 1999, we tried to bring up this issue. Again, we were \ndenied an opportunity to vote on it.\n  In April of 1999, we brought it up again as an amendment on Y2K. We \nwere denied an opportunity to have a full debate.\n  In July of 1999, we brought it up again, and again we were turned \ndown.\n  Now we have the minimum wage legislation before us, and in a cynical \nmove, the Republican leadership said: Even if you get the passage of \nthe minimum wage, it ``ain't'' going to go any further; the President \nisn't going to see it; it is going to end.\n  It is a sham. Their effort is basically a sham. That is the position \nin which we find ourselves today.\n  We know Americans are working longer and harder. The working poor are \nworking longer and harder than at any time in the history of our \ncountry. We know that over the last 10 years, women are working 3 weeks \nlonger a year in order to earn the minimum wage and men are averaging \n50 hours a week. These are some of the hardest working men and women in \nthe country.\n  At the height of the minimum wage in the late 1960s, it had the \npurchasing power that $7.49 would have today. If we are not able to \nraise the minimum wage this year and next, its value will be at an all-\ntime low--in a time of extraordinary prosperity in this country. That \nis fundamentally wrong.\n  A vote for the Republican amendment will not help working families. \nIt is, in fact, an insult to low-wage workers. It robs them of over \n$1,200 as compared to the Democratic proposal, and it drastically \nundermines the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act \nwhich has been the law for over 60 years.\n  The Republican proposal jeopardizes the overtime pay of 73 million \nAmericans. The Republicans did not water down their own pay increase of \n$4,600. They are now watering down the increase in the minimum wage, \nand they are watering down overtime. On the one hand, they are giving \nan inadequate increase in the minimum wage and taking it back by \ncutting back on overtime. That is a sham. That is a cynical attempt to \ntry to win support for working families from those who are trying to do \njustice for those individuals.\n  We can ask, What difference does an increase in the minimum wage \nmake?\n  Cathi Zeman, 52 years old, works at a Rite Aid in Canseburg, PA. She \nearns $5.68 an hour. She is the primary earner in the family because \nher husband has a heart condition and is only able to work \nsporadically. What difference would an increase in the minimum wage \nmean to Cathi and her family? It would cover 6 months of utility bills \nfor Cathi's family.\n  Kimberly Frazier, a full-time child care aide from Philadelphia \ntestified her pay of $5.20 an hour barely covers her rent, utilities, \nand clothes for her children. Our proposal would mean over 4 months of \ngroceries for Kimberly and her kids.\n  The stories of these families remind us that it is long past time to \nraise the minimum wage by $1 over 2 years. We cannot delay it. We \ncannot stretch it out. We cannot use it to cut overtime. And we cannot \nuse it as an excuse to give bloated tax breaks to the rich.\n  Members of Congress did not blink in giving themselves a $4,600 pay \nraise. Yet they deny a modest increase for those workers at the bottom \nof the economic ladder. I do not know how Members who voted for their \nown pay increase but I do not know how Members who vote against our \nminimum wage proposal will be able to face their constituents and \nexplain their actions.\n  It is hypocritical and irresponsible to deny a fair pay raise to the \ncountry's lowest paid workers. Above all, raising the minimum wage $1 \nover 2 years and protecting overtime pay is about fairness and dignity. \nIt is about fairness and dignity for men and women who are working 50 \nhours a week, 52 weeks of the year trying to provide for their children \nand their families.\n  This is a women's issue because a great majority of the minimum-wage \nworkers are women. It is a children's issue because the majority of \nthese women have children. It is a civil rights issue because the \nmajority of individuals who make the minimum wage are men and women of \ncolor. And it is a fairness issue. At a time of extraordinary \nprosperity this country ought to be willing to grant an increase to the \nhardest working Americans in the nation--the day-care workers, the \nteachers aides. They deserve this increase. Our amendment will provide \nit, and the Republican amendment will not.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for yielding. I say to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts how much I appreciate him pushing this forward and \nhow important it is to all of our States. I bring out an article that \nran in the paper yesterday and today about the status of children in my \nhome State of California, by far the largest State. I want my friend to \nrespond to these numbers because they really say it.\n  This is what it says:\n\n       Despite a booming economy that has seen a tide of \n     prosperity wash over California in\n\n[[Page S14343]]\n\n     recent years, nearly 1 in 4 children under 18 in the Golden \n     State lives in poverty. . . .\n       Although the annual ``California Report Card 1999'' laments \n     that so many children live in poverty, it paints an \n     especially bleak portrait of a child's first four years of \n     life.\n\n  Lois Salisbury, president of Children Now, says:\n\n       Among all of California's children, our littlest ones . . . \n     face the most stressful conditions of all. . . .\n       At a time when a child's sense of self and security is \n     influenced most powerfully, California deals them a \n     [terrible] hand.\n\n  I say to my friend, this issue he is raising is so critical. We all \nsay how much we care about the children. Every one of us has made that \nspeech. Today the rubber meets the road. If you care about children, \nyou have to make sure their parents can support them.\n  My last point is, and I will yield for the answer, I wonder if my \nfriend has seen the New York Times editorial that says:\n\n       The Senate will vote today on a Republican-sponsored \n     amendment to raise the minimum wage and they say sadly the \n     Republicans are not content to do this good deed and go home. \n     They have loaded the amendment with tax cuts that are \n     fiscally damaging and cynically focused on wealthy workers. \n     Almost all of the Republican tax cuts go to the wealthy.\n\n  One of the economists who looked at this said:\n\n       It would encourage the reduction of contributions made by \n     employers to the pensions of the lowest paid workers.\n\n  Can my friend comment on the importance of this proposal to children \nand also this cynical proposal that our colleagues on the other side \nare presenting?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has raised an enormously important point. \nAmericans who are working in poverty, which is at the highest level in \n20 years, are working longer and harder than ever. The men work 50 \nhours a week or more on average and the women work an average of 3 \nweeks more a year. They have less time--22 hours less--to spend with \ntheir children than they did 10 years ago. That is why this is a \nchildren's issue, as the Senator has pointed out.\n  On the issue the difference between the Republican and the Democratic \nproposals, the Republicans say that their proposal makes some \ndifference for those individuals who are going to get an increase in \nthe minimum wage over 3 years.\n  This is a raw deal for them. On the one hand, they give them an \nincrease in the minimum wage, and on the other hand they take back the \novertime for 73 million Americans. It is a cynical sham, and it is a \ncynical sham because the majority leader has said even if it passes, it \nwill never go out of this Chamber. That is the attitude toward hard-\nworking men and women who are trying to play by the rules and get along \nat a time when they have the lowest purchasing power in the history of \nthe minimum wage and we have the most extraordinary prosperity. And \nthen they insult these workers even further by adding a $75 billion tax \nbreak over 10 years. And then we just heard about the difficulty we are \nhaving in conference about $1 billion on education because they say we \ncannot afford to do things, but the same side is suggesting a $75 \nbillion tax break. Where are they getting their money? So it is a \ncynical play.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota off our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer my enthusiastic support for the \npackage of tax proposals introduced by Senator Domenici. I'm \nenthusiastic, in part, because it contains a provision that is very \nimportant to me--above-the-line deductibility of health insurance for \nindividuals.\n  Over 40 million American workers didn't have health insurance in \n1997. The number has increased in the last two years to 44 million. \nThis is disturbing, but I believe there is something Congress can do to \nhelp without resorting to a national health care system.\n  Mr. President, when employers purchase a health plan for their \nemployees, he or she can fully deduct the costs of providing that \ninsurance, effectively lowering the actual costs of providing coverage.\n  However, when an employee purchases an individual policy on their \nown, they must do so with after tax-dollars. They don't have the \nability or the advantage offered to employers to reduce the actual \ncosts of the policy by deducting premiums from their taxes every year. \nTherefore, they often wind up without any health coverage at all.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Health Care Access Act, which \nwould have ended this discrimination within the Tax Code and make \nhealth care available for many more Americans by allowing the full \ndeduction of health insurance for those without access to employer-\nsubsidized health coverage.\n  We have a tax code that discriminates against some, while favoring \nothers. Clearly, this results in fewer people being covered.\n  The amendment before us today takes a slightly different approach, \nbut its goal is the same--to level the tax-playing field. By allowing \nindividuals without access to employer-sponsored health insurance, or \nthose whose employers do not cover more than 50 percent of the cost of \ncoverage, to deduct those costs regardless of whether they itemize or \nnot, we can address a growing segment of our uninsured population by \ndoing this.\n  Under this amendment, from 2002 to 2004, eligible employees can \ndeduct 25 percent of costs, 35 percent in 2005, 65 percent in 2006, and \n100 percent after that.\n  If there are no changes in the health care system and no significant \ndownturn of the economy, we can expect the number of uninsured to reach \n53 million over the next ten years. This translates into 25 percent of \nnon-elderly Americans without coverage.\n  Forty-three percent of the uninsured are in families with incomes \nabove 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Twenty-eight percent of \nthe uninsured work for small firms and 18 percent of all uninsured are \nbetween the ages of 18 and 24.\n  The question that comes to mind is, if we're experiencing record \ngrowth in our economy and the unemployment rate is declining, why is \nthe number of uninsured continuing to rise? The answer is costs.\n  In the event a small business can offer a health plan to its \nemployees, many times it is at a higher cost to the employee than it \nwould be if the employee were to have a job at a larger firm. In this \ninstance, employees have to decide if they believe their health status \nis such that they can go without health insurance, or if they should \nspend after-tax dollars to pay for a larger portion of their health \ninsurance. Here is where we have the difficulty.\n  Individuals employed by small businesses which can't afford to pay \nmore than 50 percent of the monthly premiums for their employees should \nbe able to have the same tax advantage as the employer in paying for \ntheir health insurance. Under our plan today, they will. In fact, \nbecause the tax deduction is what we call ``above-the-line,'' meaning \nif would be available to everyone--even if they don't itemize their \ntaxes--we attack the most significant barrier to health coverage again, \nwhich is its costs, and move closer to eliminating all barriers to \nhealth coverage.\n  In other words, get more Americans covered by allowing them the \ndeductibility of the costs.\n  I am also pleased that this amendment includes many other important \ncomponents such as pension reform and small business tax relief.\n  We are talking about tax relief for small businesses, not the \nwealthiest as you hear from the other side of the aisle, but tax relief \npinpointed at the hard-working Americans in this country who are also \njob providers.\n  Retirement income security is crucial for millions of American \nworkers. This amendment reforms and enhances current pension laws to \nensure workers will achieve income security upon retirement. It repeals \nthe unnecessary temporary FUTA surtax, which has become a burden to \nmany small businesses. The amendment allows millions of self-employed \nAmericans to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance costs. This \nis a critical provision because 61 percent of the uninsured in this \ncountry are from a family headed\n\n[[Page S14344]]\n\nby an entrepreneur or a small business employee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the Senator 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. In wrapping up, the amendment increases small business \nexpensing to $30,000. This change alone means an extra $3,850 in tax \nsavings for each small business in new equipment next year. This \namendment also allows small business to increase the meal and \nentertainment expense tax deduction. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit \nhas helped millions of Americans leave welfare programs and become \nproductive workers in our economy. This amendment makes the WOTC \npermanent, so small businesses and former welfare recipients will \ncontinue to benefit from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.\n  It seems unfair to me that in a time of prosperity we hear our \ncolleagues on the other side talking about tax increases. Again, in \ntheir plan, they would impose new, even higher taxes. They talk about \nminimum wage; they are taxing and taxing and taxing those people as \nthey enter the job market. What we need is a plan that will reduce \ntaxes, not increase taxes.\n  America's small business is the key to our economic growth and \nprosperity. The health care, pension reform and tax relief measures \nincluded in this amendment will help small business continue to work \nfor America and will allow millions of Americans to realize the \nAmerican Dream.\n  Again, that is why I rise today to enthusiastically offer my support \nfor the tax package proposed by Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does each side have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls 11 \nminutes 40 seconds; the Senator from Massachusetts controls 13 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would you like, I ask Senator Nickles?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Four or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague from New \nMexico for the work that he has done in providing a more realistic \nsubstitute. But the first vote we are going to have today is voting on \na motion to table the Kennedy amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Kennedy amendment for a lot of different reasons, one of \nwhich is that it dramatically increases the minimum wage--about 20 \npercent over the next 13\\1/2\\ months. That is a big hit for a lot of \nsmall businesses. I am afraid it will prevent a lot of people, low-\nincome people, who want to get their first jobs--they may not be able \nto get them. Estimates by some of the economists, CBO, and others, are \nthat it could be 100,000 people; it could be 500,000 people that lose \ntheir jobs. It is a big hit.\n  There are a lot of other reasons to oppose the Kennedy amendment. How \nmany of our colleagues know it has a $29 billion tax increase, that it \nextends Superfund taxes? We do not reauthorize the Superfund Program, \nbut we extend the taxes. Many of us agree we need to extend the taxes \nwhen we reauthorize the program, but not before and that is in there \nanyway.\n  There is a tax increase on business. I received a letter from all the \nbusiness groups opposing it. It is practically an IRS entitlement \nprogram, so they can go after anything they want.\n  It deals with ``Noneconomic attributes,'' whatever that means, it is \na $10 billion tax increase. It may sound good and some people say that \nit is just to close loopholes. But it is to give IRS carte blanche to \ngo after anything and everything they want. We reformed IRS and curbed \ntheir appetite somewhat, and regardless of those efforts this would be \nsaying: Hey, IRS, go after anybody and everybody.\n  There is also a provision in the Democrat proposal that hits hospice \norganizations right between the eyes.\n  I have put letters from outside organizations addressing this very \nissue on Members' desks so they may see it for themselves. I ask \nunanimous consent to print in the Record three letters from various \nhospice organizations.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           National Association for Home Care,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association for Home Care (NAHC) \n     represents home health agencies and hospices nationwide. \n     While generally speaking, NAHC is supportive of efforts to \n     maintain a reasonable minimum wage, a proposed amendment to \n     S. 625 creates serious concerns for hospices across the \n     country.\n       The proposed amendment would create a civil monetary \n     penalty for false certification of eligibility for hospice \n     care or partial hospitalization services. This proposal would \n     impose a civil monetary penalty of the greater of $5,000 or \n     three times the amount of payments under Medicare when a \n     physician knowingly executes a false certification claiming \n     that an individual Medicare beneficiary meets hospice \n     coverage standards. On its face, this provision is addressed \n     only to those physicians that intentionally and purposefully \n     execute false certifications. However, the impact of a \n     comparable provision on the access to home health services, \n     as added to the law as Section 232 of the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, should caution \n     Congress in expanding the provision to apply to hospice \n     services.\n       Immediately after the physician community became aware of \n     the 1996 amendment, physicians expressed to home health \n     agencies across the country great hesitancy to remain \n     involved in certifying the homebound status of prospective \n     home health patients. The vagueness of the homebound criteria \n     and the stepped up antifraud efforts of the Health Care \n     Financing Administration brought a chilling effect to \n     physicians. As a result, home health agencies reported that \n     physicians became less involved with homecare patients rather \n     than increasing their involvement as had been recommended by \n     the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of \n     Health and Human Services.\n       We believe that a comparable physician reaction will occur \n     if this provision of law is extended to hospice services. A \n     recent study reported in the Journal of the American Medical \n     Association indicates that many eligible people may be denied \n     Medicare hospice benefits because the life expectancy of \n     patients with a chronic illness is nearly impossible to \n     predict with accuracy. Medicare requires that the patient's \n     physician and the hospice medical director certify that the \n     patient has no more than six months to live in order to \n     secure entitlement to the Medicare hospice benefit. The \n     foreseeable result of the proposed amendment would be to \n     further discourage physicians from utilizing hospice services \n     for terminally ill patients. The existing scientific and \n     clinical difficulties in accurately predicting the life \n     expectancy of a patient combined with the threat of \n     additional civil monetary penalties will adversely affect \n     access to necessary hospice services. The experiences with \n     home health services indicate that physicians distance \n     themselves from the affected benefit. While the standard of \n     applicability relates to a knowing and intentional false \n     certification, physicians will react out of fear of \n     inappropriate enforcement actions.\n       There are already numerous antifraud provisions within \n     federal law that apply to the exact circumstance subject to \n     the proposed civil monetary penalties. These existing laws \n     include even more serious penalties such as the potential for \n     imprisonment for any false claim.\n       We would encourage the Senate to oppose this provision, \n     generally, and in particular, because it is contained in a \n     non-germane legislative effort to increase the federal \n     minimum wage. There is no evidence that physicians engage in \n     any widespread abuse of the Medicare hospice benefit. To the \n     contrary, evidence is growing that hospice services are \n     underutilized as an alternative to more expensive care.\n       Thank you for all of your efforts to protect senior \n     citizens in our country.\n           Sincerely,\n     Val J. Halamandaris.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Hospice Association of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Hospice Association of \n     America (HAA), a national association representing our member \n     hospice programs, thousands of hospice professionals and \n     volunteers, and those faced with terminal illness and their \n     families, I am requesting your support to reject a proposed \n     amendment to S. 625 that would apply civil monetary penalties \n     for false certification of eligibility for hospice care.\n       It is often difficult to make the determination that a \n     patient is terminally ill (life expectancy of six months or \n     less if the terminal illness run its normal course), because \n     the course of terminal is different for each patient and is \n     not predictable. In some rare cases patients have been \n     admitted to hospice care and have improved so as to be \n     discharged from the program. The determination regarding the \n     terminal status of a patient is not an exact science and \n     should not be judged harshly in retrospect.\n       In a recent edition of JAMA, The Journal of American \n     Medical Association, researchers reported that the \n     recommended clinical prediction criteria are not effective in \n     a population with a survival prognosis of six\n\n[[Page S14345]]\n\n     months or less. According to Medicare survival data, only 15 \n     percent of patients receiving Medicare hospice survive longer \n     than six months and the median survival of Medicare patients \n     enrolled in hospices is under 40 days. This information \n     demonstrates what has been well known by those working in the \n     hospice community, the science of prognostication is in its \n     infancy and physicians must use the tools that are available, \n     medial guidelines and local medical review policies developed \n     by the Health Care Financing Administration, as well as their \n     best medical judgment.\n       Physicians can not be punished for possible overestimation \n     of a terminally ill patient's life expectancy. The only ones \n     to be punished will be the patients in need of hospice \n     services whose physicians will be denied from enrolling \n     appropriate patients, thus denying access to this \n     compassionate, humane, patient and family centered care at \n     the end-of-their lives.\n       Please reject the proposed amendment to S. 625.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Karen Woods,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Federation of\n\n\n                                      American Health Systems,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Assistant Majority Leader: The Federation of American \n     Health Systems, representing 1700 privately-owned and managed \n     community hospitals has generally not taken a position on the \n     minimum wage bill. However, we find it necessary to object to \n     an amendment that will be offered today during consideration \n     of the bill.\n       Specifically, we are concerned with an amendment that will \n     apparently address ``partial hospitalization'' issues. While \n     the Federation supports the goal of improving the integrity \n     of the Medicare program by addressing concerns with partial \n     hospitalization, we oppose its attachment to non-Medicare \n     legislation. Clearly, any amendment that reduces Medicare \n     trust fund spending should either be used to enhance the \n     solvency of the trust fund, or for other Medicare trust fund \n     purposes.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our position.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Scully,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. From the Hospice Association of America:\n\n       . . . . I am requesting your support to reject a proposed \n     amendment to S. 1625 that would apply civil monetary \n     penalties for false certification of eligibility for hospice \n     care.\n\n  I have a letter from the Federation of American Health Systems urging \nopposition to the Kennedy amendment. I have a letter from the National \nAssociation for Home Care, also in opposition. It says:\n\n       We would encourage the Senate to oppose this provision, \n     generally, and in particular, because it is contained in a \n     nongermane legislative effort to increase the minimum wage.\n       The foreseeable result of the proposed amendment would be \n     to further discourage physicians from utilizing hospice \n     services for terminally ill patients.\n\n  Do we want to do that? I don't think so. Certainly we shouldn't do it \nin this legislation. Let's have hearings to find out more about this. \nLet's do it in Medicare reform. Let's do it when we have a chance to \nknow exactly what we are doing because this is strongly opposed by \nhospice organizations.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose it for all the above reasons. I \nurge them to vote yes to table the Kennedy amendment. We will move to \ntable it at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy \namendment that we will be voting on shortly. It is important to note \nthat 59 percent of the over 11 million workers who would receive a pay \nincrease as a result of this minimum wage are women--women, by and \nlarge, with children; women who, because the minimum wage is so low \ntoday, are working two, three, four jobs. Those losing out in the \ncountry today because of the lack of a minimum wage increase are our \nchildren. They are being left home alone. They aren't getting the \nattention they deserve. They are not getting the support they deserve. \nA vote for the Kennedy amendment is a vote for our children.\n  While I have the floor, I understand the Senator from Pennsylvania \ncame to the floor this morning to question the President's \nconstitutional authority to insist on reducing class size. I remind our \ncolleagues, reducing class size is something we as Democrats have \nfought for, stood behind, and we stand behind the President in the \nfinal budget negotiations. This is not about constitutional authority. \nIt is about making sure young kids in first, second, and third grade \nget from a good teacher the attention they need in order to read and \nwrite and do arithmetic. That is a bipartisan agreement we all agreed \nupon a year ago, $1.2 billion to help our local schools reduce class \nsize.\n  To renege on that commitment 1 year later and to have language which \ntakes that money and gives it to whatever else school districts want to \nuse it for sounds good except we lose out. A block grant will not \nguarantee that one child will learn to read. A block grant will not \nguarantee that a child who needs attention will have it on the day he \nor she needs it. A block grant will not assure that our children get \nthe attention they deserve and learn the skills they need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thirty seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what we as Democrats are going to stand \nstrong for is a commitment we made a year ago to assure that every \nchild in first, second, and third grade gets the attention they \ndeserve. If our Republican colleagues want to add additional money to \nthe budget for block grants, for needs in our schools that we agree are \nimportant, we are more than happy to talk to them about it. But we \nbelieve the commitment we made a year ago is a promise that should be \nkept.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 10 \nminutes 34 seconds. The Senator from New Mexico controls 8 minutes 23 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  I again thank the Senators from California and Washington for \nillustrating in very powerful terms what this issue is all about. It is \nabout working women and families.\n  With all respect to my friend from Oklahoma, when we had an increase \nin the minimum wage a few years ago, the Republicans fought it. They \nsaid that it would harm the economy and adversely impact small \nbusiness. In the measure I have introduced we have tried to provide \nsome relief for small businesses and we have paid for it. Now we can't \ndo that because we have some kind of offsets. Therefore, we can't do \nit.\n  The fact is, the Republicans are opposed to any increase in the \nminimum wage. That is the fact. They have been opposed to it even at a \ntime of extraordinary prosperity. This minimum wage affects real people \nin a very important way, and there is no group in our society it \naffects more powerfully than women and children. They are the great \nmajority of the earners of the minimum wage, and increasingly so.\n\n  These days parents are spending less and less time with their \nfamilies. In the last 10 years, parents were able to spend 22 hours a \nweek less with their families. Read the Family and Work Institute's \nreport of interviews with small children who are in minimum-wage \nfamilies. They are universal in what they say. They all say: We wish \nour mother--or our father--would be less fatigued. We wish they had \nmore time to spend with us. We are tired of seeing our parents come \nhome exhausted when they are working one or two minimum-wage jobs.\n  That is what this is about. It is about the men and women at the \nbottom rung of the economic ladder. Are they real? Of course they are \nreal. I have read the stories. We know who they are. They are out there \ntoday, this morning, as teacher's aides in our schools. These teacher's \naides are working with young children, our future, and yet they don't \nearn enough to make ends meet.\n  They are there in the day-care centers. We know that day-care center \nworkers are often at the bottom of the pay scale, earning the minimum \nwage. As you can see from this graph the purchasing power of the \nminimum wage\n\n[[Page S14346]]\n\nhas declined since the last increase. As their wages lose purchasing \npower, turnover in low paying jobs like child care attendants and those \nwho are working in nursing homes, increases. When people are forced to \nleave these jobs, there is a deterioration in quality of the service \nday care centers and nursing homes can offer.\n  This is about the most important element of our society. It is about \nfairness. It is about work. We hear all of these speeches on the other \nside of the aisle about the importance of work. We are honoring work. \nWe are talking about men and women with dignity who have a sense of \npride in what they do and are trying to do better and are trying to \nlook out after their families. They are being given the back of the \nhand by the Republicans.\n  Their proposal is a sham. It is a raw deal for these workers. On the \none hand, they are dribbling out an increase in the minimum wage; on \nthe other hand, they are taking away overtime for 73 million Americans, \nand in the meantime, they are giving tax breaks to the wealthiest \nindividuals in our society. That is a sham. Beyond that, they say the \nminimum wage, if we are even fortunate enough to get it to pass the \nSenate, will never go to the President because the Republican \nleadership has made a commitment to whoever it might be that it will \nnever go there. That is what we are up against.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts \nthat I can yell as loud as he. But today I won't do that because I \nbelieve we have a great bill and a great position.\n  The Republicans do support the minimum wage. In fact, they are going \nto vote for the minimum wage that I propose. That is, instead of a \ndollar coming in two installments, it will come in three, of 35 cents, \n35 cents, and 30 cents. Frankly, there will be an overwhelming vote in \nfavor of that.\n  In addition, we took the opportunity to give small business and some \nother absolutely necessary situations that need it tax relief. We chose \nin this bill to do that. Those have been explained fairly well. I will \ntake a minute at the end of my remarks to explain them one more time.\n  I suggest that the Democrats are living in an era that has passed.\n  If they were here on the floor in the 1930s, they would have a case. \nThey would have a case that the minimum wage is going to affect poor \nfamilies supporting their children. That was the issue in the 1930s. \nBut I suggest the best research today says that day is gone in terms of \nwho is impacted by the minimum wage. It is more likely to impact a \nteenager than it is the head of a household. The fact is, 55 percent of \nthe minimum wage applies to people between the ages of 16 and 24. The \noverwhelming number of those are teenagers in part-time jobs, working \nin McDonald's-type restaurants across America. They need these jobs. \nThey don't even stay in the minimum-wage position very long, according \nto the research we have seen. If they work well and choose to follow \nthe rules and the orders and do an excellent job, they are raised above \nthe minimum wage rather quickly.\n  To put it another way, to show that the arguments about who benefits \nfrom the minimum wage are passe 1930 arguments, two-thirds of all \nminimum-wage people are part-time employees. The fact is, the argument \nthat these are women heads of households is absolutely dispelled by \nreality. The best we can find out is that 8 percent of the minimum-wage \nemployees in America today are women heads of households, not the \nnumbers or the tenor and tone of the argument about the slap of the \nhand we are giving to those who work in America. Quite the contrary.\n  Our minimum wage reflects a sufficient increase to match up with \ninflation, and we permit many people an opportunity to get into the job \nmarket. In fact, we make permanent one of the best taxes we have, which \nis now there on an interim basis. It says if you hire minimum-wage \nworkers out of the welfare system, and you want to take a chance \nbecause they aren't capable of doing the jobs and you need to train \nthem, you get a credit for that. That is a very good part of the Tax \nCode. We make that permanent so it costs something and it uses up some \nof our tax money.\n  As to the argument of how big this tax cut is, it is 12.5 percent of \nthe total tax package that the Republicans offered, which passed here \nand the President vetoed. It tries something very new and exciting. It \nsays to Americans who want to buy their own insurance--because their \nemployers don't furnish it--for the first time, they are going to be \npermitted to deduct the entirety of their health insurance. Heretofore, \nthey were punished if they tried to buy it, penalized because they \ndidn't get to deduct it while everybody else did. We also made \npermanent the allowance that the self-employed can take the insurance \ndeduction. We raise that to 100 percent. Everybody knows that is good. \nEverybody knows that helps with the problem of the uninsured in \nAmerica, and that is good.\n  So, for all the talk, the Republicans have come forward with a very \ngood bill. I am very pleased that I suggested to the Republicans the \nbasics of this bill, that we ought to do it in three installments. Some \nwanted to make it longer. Actually, I think this is exactly the right \nlength of time. Add to that the kind of tax relief we have provided \nversus the tax increases on that side, and it seems to me there is no \nchoice.\n  While everybody is clamoring to do something about the estate tax \nbecause it is a very onerous tax, as if to try to punish people, in a \nminimum-wage bill they raise death taxes and inheritance taxes. I don't \ncare what kind of American they impose it on. We don't have to do that \nwhen we are reforming that system because it is somewhat confiscatory. \nI could go on, but if anybody has any doubt, the gross tax increase \nunder the Democrat package is $12.5 billion over 5 years, and a $28.9 \nbillion tax increase over 10 years. What in the world are we increasing \ntaxes for at this point? To pay for a minimum-wage bill? Of course not. \nIt is because they want other tax relief and they choose to raise taxes \nto give the benefit to someone else. There is sufficient surplus. This \nis a very small tax cut in our package--12.5 percent of what we \nperceived was adequate and what we could do about 4 months ago with the \nsurpluses we have. The President proposed $250 billion, $300 billion in \ntax relief. In this bill, they raise taxes rather than take advantage \nof what we know is the right thing; that is, to reduce taxes in these \neconomic times.\n  I reserve my remaining time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 6 minutes \n49 seconds. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute 51 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from New Mexico said he wasn't going to yell. \nHe got a little close to it. But when I hear the yells on that side of \nthe aisle, it is usually related to their passion for helping the \nwealthiest among us.\n  The Senator from New Mexico says that the Democrats are living in the \npast because we want to increase the minimum wage. Well, I have news \nfor the Senator from New Mexico. Compassion for the poorest in our \nsociety, those at the bottom rung of the ladder, that is a timeless \nvalue; that is a moral value; that is a religious value; that is a \nvalue we ought to be proud to have around here. That is not living in \nthe past. Come to Los Angeles, I say to my friend from New Mexico, or \nlook around your big cities. What you will notice is that the people \nwho are living on the minimum wage are adults. We know that to be the \nfact. A majority of minimum-wage workers are adults--70 percent of \nthem.\n  In the Democratic proposal, out of those who will benefit from this \nmodest increase, 60 percent of them are women. So if you want to say \nthat we are living in the past, you can say it all you want. But it \nisn't true.\n  We saw in September a very chilling story in the L.A. Times about the \nworking poor in Southern California. The National Low-Income Housing \nCoalition shows that given the high cost of a two-bedroom apartment in \nL.A., a minimum-wage earner must work 112 hours per week in order to \nmake ends meet.\n\n[[Page S14347]]\n\n  In San Francisco, it is even worse. A person would have to work 174 \nhours at minimum wage in order to pay their bills. According to a \nrecent study of the Nation's food banks, 40 percent of all households \nseeking emergency food aid had at least one member who was working. \nThat is up from 23 percent in 1994.\n  Low-paying jobs, I say to my friend from New Mexico, are the most \nfrequently cited cause of hunger today, according to this well-\ndocumented L.A. Times story.\n  The L.A. Times, by the way, is now owned by Republicans. So this \nisn't a question of yesterday, I say to my friend. It is a question of \nliving today. They have made the same arguments every time we raised \nthe minimum wage. The last time they said it would bring the economy \ndown. We have never seen such a strong economy. If the people at the \nbottom rung are left behind, it is morally wrong and it is economically \nwrong. It makes no sense. Those are the folks who go out and spend what \nthey earn and they definitely stimulate the economy.\n  So for anybody to say you are living in the past if you support a \nminimum-wage increase, they don't know what is going on today. I say \nthat from my heart. I have respect for the Senator from New Mexico, but \nI think it is insulting to say one lives in the past for wanting to \nfight for those at the bottom rung of the economic ladder--those women \nand those children who are living in poverty.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute 51 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, to make a couple of quick points, I was \nterribly saddened to see as part of another bill that we have a further \nreduction in child care provisions, which is a major blow again to \nworking families out there. We all know that quality child care makes a \ndifference for these children. In the midst of all of this, we are \nobviously told you have to come up with some offsets to pay for the \nprovisions in this bill, which we do.\n  Offsets always attract opposition from one quarter or another. But \nthese are modest offsets to pay for the provisions in the bill. What is \ngoing to happen later today we are going to vote on $75 billion in tax \ncuts and 56 percent of them go to the top 20 percent of income earners, \nand there are no offsets--none.\n  One of the great contradictions is, we are being accused of not \nliking the offsets, the pays, from some of the provisions and \nsimultaneously we ask our Members to vote for a provision in the bill \nor vote for the whole bill, including a $75 billion tax cut over 10 \nyears with no offsets.\n  Let me underscore, as this millennium date of 50 days away \napproaches, those at the bottom of the economic rung--working people, \nthe majority who receive the minimum wage and are working full time; \nthey are women, they are Hispanic, they are black--deserve to get a \nfair shake out of this Senate. In a few minutes, we will have an \nopportunity to give them that fair shake by providing an increase in \nthe minimum wage, allowing them to enjoy the prosperity of the booming \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is important to understand exactly \nwhat the situation is for our working poor. The number of full-time, \nyear-round workers living in poverty is at a 20-year high: 12.6 percent \nof the workforce, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of the last 3 \ndays. That is the fact. People are working harder, and they are living \nin poverty. These are people who value work.\n  Second, the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that, of those who will \nbenefit from a minimum wage increase, 70 percent are adults over age \n20, and about 30 percent will be teenagers.\n  If Senators come to Boston and talk to the young people going to the \nUniversity of Massachusetts, they will find 85 percent of their parents \nnever went to college and 85 percent of them are working 25 hours a \nweek or more. That is true in Boston, in Holyoke, in New Bedford, and \nFall River, and cities across the country. I don't know what Members \nhave against working young people who are trying to pay for their \neducation. We have 6 million working in the workforce, and we have 2 \nmillion working at the minimum wage. Why are we complaining about that?\n  The Republican proposal is a Thanksgiving turkey with three right \nwings. It has a watered-down increase in the minimum wage, it has a \npoison pill for overtime work, and it has juicy tax provisions for the \nrich. This Republican turkey is stuffed with tax breaks, and it does \nnot deserve to be passed. Vote for the real increase in the minimum \nwage; vote for the Daschle increase.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the most prosperous nation in the world, \nour minimum wage should be a living wage, and it is not. When a father \nor mother works full-time, 40 hours a week, year-round, they should be \nable to lift their family out of poverty. $5.15 an hour will not do \nthat. A full time minimum wage job should provide a minimum standard of \nliving in addition to giving workers the dignity that comes with a \npaycheck. The current minimum wage does not pay a fair wage.\n  I support the legislation introduced by Representative David Bonior \nin the House and Senator Ted Kennedy in the Senate which increases the \nminimum wage. This legislation, the Fair Minimum Wage Act, will provide \na 50 cent increase to the minimum wage on January 1, 2000, and a second \n50 cent increase on January 1, 2001. This would raise the minimum wage \nto $6.15 per hour by the year 2001.\n  The minimum wage increase passed in 1996 prevented the minimum wage \nfrom falling to its lowest inflation adjusted level in 40 years. The \nproposed minimum wage increase to $6.15 in 2001 would get the minimum \nwage back to the inflation adjusted level it was in 1982.\n  In this era of economic growth, raising the minimum wage is a matter \nof fundamental fairness. We must look around and realize that we have \nthe strongest economy in a generation. However, even with our strong \neconomy, the benefits of prosperity have not flowed to low-wage \nworkers. A full time minimum wage laborer working forty hours a week \nfor 52 weeks earns $10,712 per year--more than $3,000 below the poverty \nlevel for a family of three. The poverty level for a family of three is \n$13,880.\n  Some people are saying that it is not time for a minimum wage \nincrease, that we just raised the minimum wage in 1996 and in 1997. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since the last minimum \nwage increase of 1996-97, the national unemployment rate has fallen to \n4.1%. Not only that, the unemployment rate has dropped in Michigan, it \nis now 3.4%--lower than the national rate. It is only right that we \nhelp these minimum wage earners when the economy is booming.\n  Retail jobs are often cited as the industry hit hardest by an \nincrease in the minimum wage. However, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, 38,900 new retail jobs have been added in Michigan since \nthe last minimum wage increase. Moreover, in Michigan, since September \nof 1996, 206,000 new jobs have been created. The opponents claimed that \nthe 1996 minimum wage increase would devastate the economy, yet \nclearly, this has not been the case.\n  According to the United States Department of Labor, 60% of minimum \nwage earners are women; nearly three-fourths are adults; more than half \nwork full time. Under the Fair Minimum Wage Act, approximately 243,000 \nMichiganders would get a raise. These hardworking Americans deserve a \nfair deal.\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act will increase the real value of the minimum \nwage in 2001 to the purchasing level it was in 1982. It will generate \n$2,000 in potential income for minimum wage workers. This $2,000 will \nmake an enormous impact on minimum wage workers and their families.\n  Opponents of the minimum wage have said that the minimum wage hurts \nlow income workers. This is not the case. In 1998, seventeen \neconomists, including a Nobel Prize winner, a former president of the \nAmerican Economics Assn. and a former Secretary of Labor, wrote to \nPresident Clinton, supporting an increase in the minimum wage. These \nexperts determined that\n\n[[Page S14348]]\n\nthe 1996 and 1997 increases had a beneficial effect, not only on those \nwhose earnings were increased, but also on the economy as a whole. In \naddition to directly impacting workers, billions in added consumer \ndemand helped fuel our expanding economy in those years.\n  With a prosperous economy, it is only fair that we also reward those \nwho are at the low end of the pay scale spectrum. These people do not \nalways have the leverage to negotiate a fair salary. It is necessary \nthat we act to ensure that they receive a livable wage.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an increase \nin the Federal minimum wage. I strongly believe that the time has come \nto raise the minimum wage again and that we should raise the minimum \nwage by a $1.00 an hour increase over the next 2 years.\n  The minimum wage is not the only way--or even the best way--to give \nfolks in need a helping hand to get out of poverty. But I do believe \nthat it should at least keep pace with inflation. Unfortunately, that \nis not happening. Today's minimum wage is 19 percent below the 1979 \nlevel. To give you a better idea of what this means for working \nfamilies, consider that a minimum wage employee working full time earns \nabout $10,700 a year--more than $3,000 below the $13,880 poverty line \nfor a family of three. Workers deserve better. At a time when our \neconomy is booming, we should not allow this trend to continue. \nInstead, we must continue to raise the minimum wage to keep pace with \nthe rising cost of life's basic needs\n  My home State of Vermont recently raised the minimum wage to $5.75 an \nhour in response to its awareness of the cost of living. Let's follow \nits lead, a dollar-an-hour increase in the Federal minimum wage will \nput $2,000 a year in the pockets of working families at or near the \npoverty line. And given that 2 years has passed since the last \nincrease, small businesses have had the time to adjust. Although this \nmoney will not solve all the problems of the working poor, it will go a \nlong way toward helping minimum wage workers obtain basic needs for \nthemselves and their families.\n  In addition to raising the minimum wage, there are many other things \nthat Congress can and should do to assist low wage workers and their \nfamilies. We must continue to search out and support targeted solutions \nsuch as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC provides some 20 \nmillion low-income households with a refundable tax credit. Last year, \nthe EITC enabled a worker earning minimum wage, who was either a single \nparent or the sole wage earning parent of dependent children, to \nreceive up to $ 3,816 in additional income.\n  Along with measures that will raise take home pay, I know that we can \ndo more to assist low-income families with their basic needs. Over the \npast few years, an organization in Vermont called the Peace and Justice \nCenter has examined how low wage workers and their families were faring \nin my home State. The Vermont Wage Gap Study showed that while we are \nenjoying one of the most extraordinary economic booms in the history of \nour country, thousands of workers in my home State are having great \ndifficulty making ends meet. The study found that the cost of meeting \nbasic needs is more than many of Vermont's low income workers are \nearning.\n  For example, the Vermont Job Gap Study indicated that child care and \nhealth care are among working families largest expenses. Over the past \nfew years, I have been pushing for national child care legislation to \nassist these working families with their child care needs. On the \nhealth care side, we were able to enact the Children's' Health \nInsurance Program which is helping to improve children's health for \nworking families who cannot afford health coverage for their children. \nIn addition, we should help low income workers in obtaining health \ninsurance. I am currently working on a proposal that would provide \nuninsured and under-insured workers with the money they need to buy \nhealth insurance.\n  But the predominant factor influencing an individual's ability to \nsupport his or her family is not to be found in the minimum wage or the \ntax code. Study after study has found it is education. Simply put, you \nearn what you learn. I urge my colleagues to work with me on continuing \nto pass legislation aimed at improving our educational systems, and job \ntraining programs. It is my hope that these efforts will improve the \nskills and employability of our workforce and will enable low-wage \nworkers to obtain better paying jobs.\n  I would like to add that I think it is entirely appropriate that an \nincrease in the minimum wage be accompanied by tax breaks for those who \nwill have to shoulder higher wage costs, especially small employers. \nAnd I strongly favor several of the tax breaks in this amendment. In \nparticular, I support acceleration of deductibility of health insurance \ncosts for the self-employed; increasing the amount of equipment \npurchases that small businesses can deduct each year; and providing tax \ncredits to employers who provide on-site child care. At the same time, \nsome of the tax provisions bear little relationship to the impact of a \nminimum wage hike on small businesses. In addition, I am concerned that \nwe have not had adequate time to explore the implications and effects \nof all of the tax provisions. My vote in support of this amendment \nshould not be read as an endorsement of each and every tax provision, \nbut rather reflects my fundamental belief that the time has come for a \nminimum wage increase.\n  Lastly, I would comment on the language in Senator Kennedy's \namendment increasing disclosure to participants of cash balance pension \nplans and prohibiting so-called benefit ``wear-aways''. This language \nis being offered in response to the conversion of hundreds of \ntraditional defined benefit pension plans into cash balance or other \nhybrid arrangements. I believe that legitimate concerns have been \nraised that notices about the plan changes that were sent to \nparticipants have been insufficient. In fact, until recently many \nworkers have been unaware that their plan was amended to significantly \nreduce the rate at which they are earning benefits. While pension law \nonly requires employers to pay what an employee has actually earned \nunder the plan, when these changes are made toward the middle of a \nworker's career, the effect can be devastating.\n  This legislation will help workers better understand what the changes \nin their plan mean for their retirement plans. It requires plan \nsponsors to give participants notice of the conversions in a more \ntimely fashion, in plain English and on an individualized basis. In the \nwords of my colleague Senator Moynihan, this disclosure requirement \nhelps to make cash balance conversions transparent for the plan \nparticipants. I feel this change is warranted and urgently needed.\n  But this amendment does more. It also prohibits an unfortunate \npension practice called the benefit ``wear-away''. When some plans are \nconverted, workers with long-years of service may not earn any benefits \nfor a number of years. I believe this practice is unfair. There is no \nreason why an individual with 20 years of service should not earn any \nbenefits while a younger worker earns benefits immediately. The \nlanguage in this amendment will effectively prohibit wear-aways.\n  As we conclude the first session of the 106th Congress, I hold \nsteadfast in my belief that Congress must do everything in its power to \nhelp working families. The time has come to raise the minimum wage and \ngive the workers who are depending on it a better shot at self-\nsufficiency. I believe that a $1.00 increase over the next 2 years will \ncertainly help. However, I also believe that a slower increase is \nbetter than none at all. Therefore if we do not have the votes in the \nSenate to pass a 2-year increase, I will also support a 3-year \nincrease.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nKennedy's amendment to raise the Federal minimum wage. I am proud to be \nan original co-sponsor of the legislation upon which this amendment is \nbased to raise the minimum wage 50 cents a year over the next two \nyears, bringing it to $6.15 per hour by the year 2001.\n  For more than half a century, Congress has acted to guarantee minimum \nstandards of decency for working Americans. The objective of a Federal \nminimum wage is to make work pay well enough to keep families out of \npoverty and off Government assistance.\n\n[[Page S14349]]\n\n Any individual who works hard and plays by the rules should be assured \na living standard for his or her family that can keep them out of \npoverty.\n  If nothing is done during the year 2000, the real value of the \nminimum wage will be just $4.90 in 1998 dollars--about what it was \nbefore Congress last acted to increase the minimum wage in 1996. The \nproposed increase would restore the wage floor slightly above its 1983 \nlevel, still leaving it 13% below its 1979 peak. No one asserts that \nraising the minimum wage will correct every economic injustice, but it \nwill certainly make a significant difference to those on the low end of \nthe economic scale. We have the opportunity to enact what is in my view \na modest increase to help curb the erosion of the value of the minimum \nwage in terms of real dollars, and it is an opportunity which we should \nnot let pass us by.\n  Currently, a full-time minimum wage worker earns just $10,712--$3,000 \nbelow the poverty level for a family of three. In 1998, about 4.4 \nmillion wage and salary workers, paid hourly rates, earned at and below \nthe minimum wage--about 1.6 million at the minimum rate and 2.8 million \nbelow the minimum. A dollar increase in the minimum wage would provide \na minimum wage worker with an additional $2,080 in income per year, \nhelping to bring that family of three closer to the most basic standard \nof living. This extra income will help a family pay their bills and \nquite possibly even allow them to afford something above and beyond the \nbare essentials.\n  According to the Department of Labor, 70 percent of workers who will \nbenefit from an increase in the minimum wage are adults, 46 percent \nwork full time, 60 percent are women and 40 percent are the sole \nbreadwinners in their families. Mr. President, these are not the part-\ntime workers and suburban teenagers many opponents of the minimum wage \nincrease would have you believe.\n  After 30 years of spiralling deficits, we now have budget surpluses \nprojected, unemployment is at a 25-year low, and inflation is at a 30-\nyear low. However, despite this period of economic prosperity, the \ndisparity between the very rich in this country and the very poor \ncontinues to grow. According to the Economic Policy Institute, \nprojections for 1997 indicate that the share of the wealth held by the \ntop 1 percent of households grew by almost 2 percent since 1989. Over \nthat same period, the share of the wealth held by families in the \nmiddle fifth of the population fell by half a percent. In light of \nthese estimates, consider that the Department of Labor predicts that 57 \npercent of the gains from an increase in the minimum wage will go to \nfamilies in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale.\n  It is both reasonable and responsible for Congress to enact measures \nwhich provide a standard that allows decent, hard-working Americans a \nfloor upon which they can stand. We did it back in 1996 when we \napproved, by a bipartisan vote of 74-24, a 90 cent increase in the \nminimum wage bringing it to its current level of $5.15 per hour, and it \nis appropriate to do it here again. With the economy strong, we have a \nresponsibility to reinforce this basic economic floor for millions of \nAmerican workers to prevent them from sliding further into the \nbasement.\n  This is, and always has been, an issue of equity and fairness for \nworking men and women in this country. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I support the Minimum Wage Proposal \noffered by Senator Kennedy because it is fair and responsible. It \nprovides a minimum wage increase to 228,000 Arkansans and 11 million \nworkers nationwide, most of whom are women. It provides important tax \nrelief directly to small businesses to help defray costs of a wage \nhike. And, perhaps most importantly, it pays for the tax cuts by: \noffsetting tax adjustments on large estates valued at $17 million and \nabove, which the Senate voted overwhelming to do in 1997; extending the \ntax imposed on corporate income for Superfund, which I hope will \nencourage Superfund reform, and closing corporate tax shelters, which \nCongress has been trying to do since Ronald Reagan was in the White \nHouse.\n  A $1 increase in the minimum wage over 2 years is needed to restore \nthe purchasing power or real value of the minimum wage, which has been \ngreatly diminished over the last 20 years by inflation. In the United \nStates, 59% of workers who will gain from a wage increase are women; \n70% are adults age 20 and over, and 40% are the sole breadwinners for \ntheir families. The bottom line--this proposal will generate $2,000 in \nadditional income each year for full-time minimum wage workers. As a \nmother of two young children who balances the check book every month \nand shops at the supermarket each week, I honestly don't know how a \nsingle parent who makes $5.15 an hour can feed their family and provide \nother basic necessities for their children.\n  I am also very supportive of the tax relief provisions in this \namendment which will help those who will be most affected by a minimum \nwage increase--small business owners and family farmers. This common \nsense package will expand access to health insurance by letting self-\nemployed individuals deduct 100 percent of their health insurance \ncosts, a proposal I have supported for many years. I believe providing \n100 percent deductibility now to small business owners and independent \nfarmers is more urgent today than ever as our country experiences one \nof the worst farm crises in recent memory. Furthermore, I have never \nunderstood why we deny a benefit to sole proprietors that is currently \navailable to many large corporations.\n  This package also includes another priority of mine--estate tax \nrelief for family owned-farms and small business. Too often those who \ninherit a business or family farm from a relative must liquidate all or \na portion of the property just to pay the estate tax which is owed.\n  Another provision will help business owners provide child care \nassistance to their employees by allowing a 25% tax credit for \nqualified costs. In addition, this amendment will encourage investment \nin economically depressed areas like the Delta region in Arkansas and \nstrengthen retirement security for workers by reducing small \nbusinesses' cost of setting up employee pension plans.\n  Finally, I am hopeful that extending the tax imposed on corporate \nincome for Superfund will be an added incentive to roll up our sleeves \nand pass meaningful Superfund reform legislation. I have worked on this \nissue since I came to Congress in 1993. I and millions of Americans are \nstill waiting for Congress to fulfill its responsibility. I am sorry \nthat our former colleague Senator Chafee, who was very passionate about \nthis issue, died before Congress addressed Superfund reform.\n  But before I yield the floor, I want to emphasize an important aspect \nof this plan that should not go unnoticed--it is paid for and does not \nthreaten our government's ability to meet future obligations to Social \nSecurity and Medicare beneficiaries. Republicans and Democrats have \nknocked themselves out over the last year trying to blame each other \nfor spending the Social Security trust fund, so I fail to understand \nhow we can consider a proposal which costs $75 billion over ten years \nwith virtually no means to pay for it. That is irresponsible and I \ncan't support it.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment is a common sense \nproposal that is good for both employers and employees and I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will stand with me in supporting \nthis legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, since 1938 we have had a minimum standard \nwe accept as the lowest possible wage in our society. Today we are \nengaged in debate about the need to raise that standard. The modest \nproposal before us seeks to raise the minimum wage by $1.00 over the \nnext two years. Even then--even if we succeed in doing what is so \nobvious, so reasonable, and so fair--Mr. President the real value of \nthe lowest acceptable wage will only reach what it was in 1982, over 17 \nyears ago. We're not really talking about an increase here, we're \ntalking about trying to keep pace, about making work pay, about \nrestoring minimum wage workers to the purchasing power they had nearly \ntwo decades ago.\n  Mr. President, opponents of a minimum-wage increase argue that it \nincreases unemployment rates for entry-level workers, thereby hurting \nthe very\n\n[[Page S14350]]\n\npeople it is meant to help. But this is not a radical proposal--as some \nRepublicans claim--that will cause a dramatic spike in the unemployment \nrates and cripple small business. Numerous empirical studies, Mr. \nPresident, have found that recent hikes in the minimum wage have had \nlittle or no effect on job levels. A 1999 Levy Institute survey of \nsmall businesses revealed that more than three-quarters of the firms \nsurveyed said their employment practices would not be affected by an \nincrease in the minimum wage to $6.00. A September New York Times \neditorial reported that ``. . . a modest hike is not likely to cause \nhigher unemployment, even among low-skilled workers. Indeed, jobless \nrates fell after the 90-cent minimum-wage hike of 1996-7.''\n  We have not in the past nor are we now advancing a radical proposal \nthat will reverberate dangerously throughout our economy. We are merely \nconsidering a moderate increase in our Nation's wage floor, one that \nwill bring us just back to where we were nearly 18 years ago.\n  And while the increase is a modest one, it is crucial to today's \nworking families. A $1.00 increase in the minimum wage will affect 11.4 \nmillion workers. Full-time workers will make an additional $2,000 each \nyear. Many minimum wage jobs do not provide pensions or health care. An \nadditional $2,000 each year might mean the difference between being \nsick and getting treatment, the difference between a sickly child and a \nthriving one. An additional $2,000 each year might mean the difference \nbetween being hungry and being fed.\n  Currently, a full-time minimum wage worker earns $10,712 per year--an \nincome well below the poverty line for a family of three or four. \nIncreasing the minimum wage will bring workers wages up to $12,800 per \nyear, an income still below the poverty line for a family of three. So \nwhile we refer to the minimum wage as the lowest wage acceptable in our \nsociety, we must acknowledge that even after we pass this modest \nincrease, a full-time minimum wage worker cannot safely raise a family \non his/her earnings.\n  Right now we are facing the greatest wage inequality since the Great \nDepression. Income inequality between the Nation's top earners and \nthose at the bottom has been widening since the early 1970s. The strong \neconomy and these generally prosperous times cause us to overlook the \nstruggles faced by hard-working families. The growing wage gap between \nthe rich and poor threatens our social fabric and the stability of our \nNation. It is our job in the Congress to ensure that stability is \nmaintained--that hard-working individuals are paid a fair wage--that \nworking families can afford the basic necessities of life--that we are \nthe kind of country that values work--and which values the \ncontributions of each working American. It is time we meet that \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport efforts to increase the federal minimum wage by adopting the \namendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, the \nFair Minimum Wage Act of 1999. This important amendment will provide \nAmerican laborers with a 50-cent increase to the minimum wage on \nJanuary 1, 2000, and a second 50-cent increase on January 1, 2001. This \nmodest increase, which would raise the minimum wage to $6.15 per hour, \nwill help more than 11 million lower income Americans.\n  Our country's economy is growing. Its economic vitality and the \nchanges wrought by welfare reform have resulted in a better life for \nmany working people--unless those workers are minimum wage workers, \nanchored to the bottom of the wage scale.\n  The truth is, even though the economy is roaring, wages at the bottom \nare stagnant, and hard-working people are still living in poverty. \nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in the mid-\n1990s, there were 89,000 working poor families with children in \nWisconsin. Seventy-four percent of those families had at least one \nworking parent. And sixty-nine percent of these families had at least \none working parent and still required some form of public assistance. \nIn this time of a booming economy and low unemployment, these \nstatistics are very troubling. Mr. President, the majority of the poor \npeople of our country are working--the problem is that many of them are \nholding down low-paying jobs with stagnant wages that do not allow them \nto finally break free from poverty.\n  Despite successes in the welfare to work initiative, a 1998 U.S. \nConference of Mayors study, entitled ``A Status Report on Hunger and \nHomelessness in American Cities,'' indicates that seventy-eight percent \nof the 30 major U.S. cities surveyed reported an increased demand for \nemergency food assistance. Thirty-seven percent of those people seeking \nfood at soup kitchens and shelters in 1998 were employed. City \nofficials surveyed listed low-paying jobs as the top cause of hunger in \ntheir cities. It is an undeniable disgrace that, in many cases, minimum \nwage workers cannot afford to feed themselves or their families.\n  Mr. President, no hard working American should have to worry about \naffording groceries, shoes for their kids, or medicines. The people \nthis amendment will help are not people who spend their money \nfrivolously. These are the families who scrimp and save to provide \ntheir children with the necessities of life: a decent place to live, \nenough to eat, clothes on their back, a decent education, and some hope \nfor a better future.\n  The study, ``The State of Working Wisconsin--1998,'' by the Center on \nWisconsin Strategy, contains some troubling news regarding wages. The \nWisconsin median hourly wage is still eight-point-four percent below \nits 1979 level. Since 1979, Wisconsin's median wage has declined fifty \npercent faster than the five-point-three percent national decline over \nthe same period. These numbers are, sadly, not unique to Wisconsin. \nThis is the situation all over the country.\n  And this is the situation that the Kennedy amendment will help to \naddress. According to the Economic Policy Institute, more than 205,000 \nworkers in my home state of Wisconsin, or fifteen-point-one percent of \nWisconsin's workforce, will benefit from the modest increase in this \namendment. Those are real people, Mr. President. Real people who \ndeserve this modest raise in pay for the work they do to support their \nfamilies and to keep the American economy moving.\n  Opponents of this increase argue that it will hurt the economy. The \nBureau of Labor Statistics reports that the 1996 and 1997 raises in the \nminimum wage had a positive impact on the economy. Unemployment has \ndropped to four-point-one percent, the lowest mark in three decades. \nNine-point-one million new jobs have been created. And there is no \nreason to believe that this proposed increase will not have the same \nresult. In fact, history shows that minimum wage increases have not had \na negative impact on unemployment.\n  This modest increase of 50 cents per year is really not a hike at all \nafter inflation--over the next two years it will simply restore the \nreal value of the minimum wage to its 1982 level. So by the time the \nsecond installment of this proposed increase would go into effect, the \nbuying power of workers scraping by on the minimum wage will be only \nwhat is was when Ronald Reagan was a new president. Meanwhile, wages at \nthe high levels have been climbing steadily while the real value of the \nminimum wage has eroded.\n  I urge my colleagues to begin to restore some respect for the dignity \nof work to the federal minimum wage. The lowest paid workers in \nAmerica's labor force deserve a chance to earn a decent living and we \nneed to give them the tools. I urge every Senator to support the \nKennedy amendment. It is a vote to reward work and to support every \nAmerican worker.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, there are a few brief observations that \nwould serve us well as we engage in this debate over minimum wage. \nThrough the years, members on both sides of this issue have been able \nto come together successfully, to effect minimum wage increases.\n  I believe we will be able to come together again, to advance a \nproposal that is good for individuals, as well as for economic growth \nand job creation. And I believe that in this effort it would be good to \nhave such a common sense proposal follow the model of our actions in \n1996.\n  As my colleagues know, three years ago we successfully enacted the \nSmall\n\n[[Page S14351]]\n\nBusiness Tax Act, which provided reasonable tax relief for businesses \nmost affected by the costs incurred with the minimum wage increase. The \ncurrent minimum wage of $5.15--which took effect on September 1, 1997--\nwas established in that act. Minimum wage agreements prior to 1997 \nfollowed a similar pattern of consensus building.\n  This year, as we again consider raising the minimum wage, there are a \nnumber of tax issues involved. The minimum wage amendment proposed by \nSenator Domenici includes a package of tax measures that were \npreviously approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The Finance \nCommittee has jurisdiction over these matters, and as these proposal \nhad been previously vetted within our committee, I agreed to allow them \nto come straight to the floor.\n  On the other hand, I am concerned with the revenue offsets included \nin the minimum wage amendment proposed by Senator Kennedy. Many of \nthese provisions are controversial proposals which have been rejected \nby this Congress. And we need to be very careful as we proceed \nconsidering them.\n  What is important is that we progress on this important issue--that \nif we are unable to agree on a compromise in this session as we are so \nclose to adjournment, we will be able to successfully conclude this \nmatter soon after our return next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator from Massachusetts has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute 51 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Kennedy for a good debate. It was \npretty exciting for so early in the morning. The Senator is pretty \nenergetic even at 9 o'clock.\n  However, let me close by saying our amendment saves small business \nand gives them an opportunity to grow and prosper and energize this \neconomy; at the same time, it gives every opportunity for the young \npeople in our country to get into jobs wherein they break into the \nmarketplace, that first-level job, and get those kinds of jobs in \nsufficient numbers to be helpful for whatever they are doing. There are \neven high school students doing this. They are 50 percent of the \nminimum-wage people in this country.\n  I have nothing against them. I have eight children; six of them \nworked in restaurants before they went to college and saved enough \nmoney because I didn't have enough money to put them through, having \nthat many children. I understand that. They worked hard. They got \npromoted.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth that we are trying to hurt \nyoung people, whatever their status. We want them and their employers \nto continue to have a mutual opportunity--mutual for the small business \nto energize the economy and mutual for job opportunity at the first \nlevel of employment in the American system.\n  If Members are speaking of women heads of households, they are not \ntalking about the minimum wage today; they are talking about the \nminimum wage 30 years ago. Eight percent of the minimum-wage earners in \nAmerica today are women with full-time jobs--not 30, 40, or 50; 8 \npercent.\n  Clearly, we are trying to give everybody an opportunity to get better \ntraining and move ahead in job opportunities in the United States.\n  I move to table the Kennedy amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2751.

Senators please take their conversations off \nthe floor. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Republican \namendment. I believe it is a watered-down, slowed-down, pennies-to-the-\npoor approach.\n  Why raise the minimum wage? We are in the greatest prosperity that \nthe United States of America has ever seen. We have the opportunity to \nraise the standard of living for the poor. I believe what we need to \ndo, now that we have moved hundreds of thousands of people from \nwelfare, is to make work worth it.\n  Who are the people we are talking about? We are talking about the \nworking poor who raise our children, who care for our elderly, many \nworking two or three jobs to hold the family together.\n  I believe we need to make a commitment to the working poor, as we \ncross into the new century, that if you live in the United States of \nAmerica and you work, you should not be poor.\n  The amendment the Senator from Massachusetts proposed was modest. It \nwas spread over a 2-year period. It would take us into 2001. Why should \na day-care worker make less than someone who works 40 hours a week at a \nbank job? We need to make sure that in this country, in order to \nsustain the efforts we have made in improving the standard of living \nfor people, if you work, you will not be poor.\n  I yield such time as I might have.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthis important amendment. Without touching Social Security, it would \nprovide significant assistance to millions of Americans struggling \neconomically even during this time of sustained growth.\n  I believe this amendment demonstrates my party's continuing \ncommitment to fostering economic growth and helping those in need. And \nwe should not forget that, despite recent economic good times, there \nare many Americans who remain in economic need.\n  African-American youths continue to suffer from an unemployment rate\n\n[[Page S14352]]\n\nthree times that of white youths. Hispanic youths suffer from an \nunemployment rate ten points higher than that of whites. And 8 million \nAmerican families continue to live in poverty.\n  We can do better. We can do better.\n  I believe this amendment constitutes an important step forward in our \ndrive to unleash the entrepreneurial energies of the American people; \nenergies that can lift individuals out of poverty as they push \ncommunities to higher levels of prosperity.\n  This amendment contains an important provision of the Renewal \nAlliance package I have been working toward since coming to the United \nStates Senate. It also contains a number of other provisions that I \nbelieve represent the responsible way to raise the minimum wage: by \nensuring that businesses do not find themselves saddled with costs that \nlead them to lay off minimum wage workers, exactly those proponents of \na minimum wage hike are trying to assist.\n  This amendment addresses three major areas of concern to Americans \nstriving to work their way into our vast middle class: work \nopportunity, investment, and health insurance.\n  First, as to work opportunity. In my view opportunity is the key to \nprogress. I have sought to increase this opportunity through the \nRenewal Alliance, a bipartisan group of Senators seeking targeted tax \nbenefits to spur economic growth in our nation's distressed urban and \nrural communities. This amendment contains key provisions of the \nRenewal Alliance program.\n  Most important is a provision to permanently extend the Work \nOpportunity Tax Credit. A credit of up to $2,400 for wages paid would \nprovide businesses with extra funds for investment in growth and \nemployee training. As a result, many Americans currently without bright \nfutures will receive experience and training--the keys, in my view, to \neconomic success.\n  Also critical to providing increased work opportunity are provisions \nin this amendment that encourage greater investment, and greater \ninvestment in small businesses in particular.\n  Mr. President, 99 percent of American employers are small businesses. \nSmall businesses employ more than half our private work force, and they \nhave consistently been the engine of our economic growth, whether in \ntraditional industries or on the cutting edge of high technology.\n  Further, Mr. President, it is often small business owners who are \nwilling to take a chance on someone in need--someone without \nexperience, someone who has fallen on hard times.\n  If they are to employ more Americans who are in need, Mr. President, \nour small businesses must have access to more investment capital. This \namendment would addresses our continuing shortage of investment, \nthereby spurring small business growth and hiring.\n  First, it would increase the maximum dollar amount small businesses \ncan deduct for investment in business property. By increasing this \namount to $30,000, beginning in 2001, the amendment would provide an \nadditional $3,850 in annual tax savings for small businesses investing \nin new equipment.\n  Second, the amendment would provide more than 50 provisions \nencouraging investment in pensions. They would expand coverage, enhance \nfairness for women, increase portability, strengthen security and \nreduce regulatory burdens.\n  Finally, this amendment would addresses inequities in our tax \nstructure that keep an estimated 44 million Americans from affording \nhealth insurance. 44 million is a distressing number. Equally \ndistressing is the fact that fully 81 percent of uninsured Americans \nhave jobs.\n  Too many Americans, including the self-employed, the unemployed, and \nemployees of small companies that do not provide health insurance, \ncan't afford coverage. Why not? Because, under our tax code, they must \npay taxes first, and buy insurance with whatever they have left over--\nif anything.\n  Paying with after-tax dollars can make health insurance twice as \nexpensive--too expensive for millions of working Americans.\n  We must address this inequity in our tax code. This amendment would \ndo just that.\n  First, it would enable self-employed Americans to deduct the full \ncost of health insurance. Finally, entrepreneurs would get the same tax \nbenefits as larger companies.\n  Second, this amendment would provide an above-the-line deduction for \nindividuals whose employers do not subsidize more than 50% of the cost \nof health coverage. Thus all workers, not just those who itemize, would \nbe better able to afford health care costs.\n  Taken together, these provisions would provide significantly greater \neconomic opportunity for all Americans. They would safeguard our \neconomic growth and spur further investment in American workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this important amendment their full \nsupport.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to point out a concern I have \nwith a seemingly innocuous, seemingly beneficial, provision contained \nin the Domenici amendment to S. 625, the ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of \n1999''--Section   68. Modification of Exclusion for Employer Provided \nTransit Passes. The goal of the provision--to expand the use of the \nFederal transit benefit, a ``qualified transportation fringe'' in the \nvernacular--is admirable, but I fear that the way in which the \nprovision pursues that goal may, in fact, unintentionally undermine the \ntransit benefit.\n  The employer-provided Federal transit benefit has evolved since its \ncreation within the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 as a $15 per month \n``de minimis'' benefit. After fourteen years of gradual change, last \nyear's Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) codified \nthe benefit as a ``pre-tax'' benefit of up to $65 per month. The cap \nwill increase to $100 in 2002. The ``pre-tax'' aspect was a major \nreform because it provided an economic incentive--payroll tax savings--\nfor employers to offer the program. Companies would save money by \noffering a benefit of great utility to their workers while \nsimultaneously removing automobiles from our choked and congested urban \nstreets and highways. It is effective public policy. (As an aside, I \nshould note that a similar pre-tax benefit of $175 per month exists for \nparking, and so despite all we know about air pollution and the \nintractable problems of automobile congestion, Congress continues to \nencourage people to drive. Discouraging perhaps, but we're closing the \ngap. If one doesn't have thirty years to devote to social policy, one \nshould not get involved!)\n  Quite consciously, and conscientiously, Congress established a bias \nin the statute toward the use of vouchers--which employers can \ndistribute to employees--over bona fide cash reimbursement \narrangements. We permitted employers to use cash reimbursement \narrangements only when a voucher program was not readily available. We \nreasoned that because the vouchers could only be used for transit, we \nwould eliminate the need for employees to prove that they were using \nthe tax benefit for the intended purpose. Furthermore, by stipulating \nthat voucher programs are the clear preference of Congress, we are \ncompelling transit authorities to offer better services--monthly \nfarecards, unlimited ride passes, smartcards, et al.--to the multitudes \nof working Americans who must presently endure all manner of \nfrustrations and indignities during their daily work commute.\n  While the new law has only been in effect for little more than a \nyear, the program is catching on in our large metropolitan areas and \nshould continue to expand. We have been alerted, however, to a \nlegitimate concern of large multistate employers. Several of these \ncompanies have noted that establishing voucher programs can be arduous \nand unwieldy when the companies must craft separate programs in various \njurisdictions with different transportation authorities. These \ndifficulties, coupled with an expertise in administering cash \nreimbursement programs, have convinced the companies that bona fide \ncash reimbursement programs are more practical. Fair enough.\n  We should, therefore, make it easier for such companies to offer the \nbenefit through cash reimbursement arrangements. While I am committed \nto that end, I have serious reservations about the repeal of the \nvoucher preference contained in the Domenici amendment.\n  My main objection is that the U.S. Treasury is currently developing \nsubstantiation regulations for the administration of this benefit \nthrough cash reimbursement arrangements. These\n\n[[Page S14353]]\n\nregulations will provide companies with a clear understanding of their \nobligations in the verification of their employees' transit usage, an \nunderstanding which does not exist today. Until these regulations are \npromulgated, voucher programs offer the only true mechanism of \nverification, as vouchers, unlike cash, are useless unless enjoyed for \ntheir intended purpose. The Congress should not take an action that \nmight rapidly increase the use of a tax benefit without the existence \nof accompanying safeguards to ensue the program's integrity.\n  I will work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee, with my \nrevered Chairman, and any Senator interested in this issue, to improve \nthe ease with which companies can offer this important benefit to their \nemployees. It is, after all, in our national interest. But I must \nstrongly oppose efforts to repeal the voucher preference until the \nTreasury establishes a regulatory framework for cash reimbursement. We \nhave been told to expect the regulations by mid-January. We anxiously \nawait their arrival.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Republican bill does the following: \nIt raises the minimum wage $1 in three installments instead of two. It \ngives great opportunity to small businesspeople and others who have \nbeen denied relief under the Tax Code of this country.\n  Let me explain so everybody will understand the basic ones we try to \nhelp in this bill. One, we help workers pay for health care. For the \nfirst time in history, workers in the United States, many who work for \nsmall businesses, can buy their own health insurance and deduct every \npenny of it. Heretofore, they could not do that. We have a 100 percent \nself-employed health insurance deduction. That should have been the \ncase 10 years ago. We finally have it in this bill.\n  We made permanent the work opportunity tax credit, which is to help \nemployers, mostly small businesses, hire those who cannot get jobs, and \nthey get a credit for it. We made that permanent. That is good for \nAmerica since we have reduced the number of welfare recipients in \nAmerica by 48 percent; and we need to make permanent the incentive to \nhire them.\n  We have reduced the Federal unemployment surtax. As I said, we have \nmade permanent that work opportunity tax credit I just told you about.\n  In addition, there is no question that the Democrats decided to raise \ntaxes to pay for their wage increases. So they raise taxes almost $13 \nbillion in the first 5 years, which is not necessary with the kind of \nsurpluses that we have. We have used merely 12.5 percent of the tax \ncuts we had proposed 5 months ago. So 12.5 percent of them are in this \nbill.\n  This is the right thing to do.\n  Let me close by telling you, 55 percent of the minimum wage earners \nin America are young people; two-thirds are part-time workers; and 8 \npercent are women who are heads of households working full time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the remaining 30 seconds.\n  Mr. President, first, this is a watered-down increase in the minimum \nwage that does not deserve to pass. It is a sham.\n  Second, this legislation assaults the whole formula on overtime. It \nthreatens overtime for 73 million Americans.\n  And third, it provides $75 billion in tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals that is not paid for.\n  It does not deserve the support of the Senate. I hope it will be \ndefeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2547. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nHollings) is absent because of a death in the family.\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 357 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Hollings\n     McCain\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2547) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, to bring Senators up to date on where we \nare, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and I \nhave been working with the distinguished Senators from Iowa and Utah, \nMessrs. Grassley and Hatch, to clear as many amendments as we can agree \nto. Senators Grassley, Hatch, Torricelli, and I have been able to get a \nnumber of these agreed to. We have more than 10 amendments we are ready \nto accept to show we are making progress on this bill.\n  For the benefit of Senators, I will briefly describe these amendments \nwe are prepared to accept. We are prepared to accept the Feingold \namendment No. 2745, an amendment to improve the bill by prohibiting \nretroactive assessments of disposable income. It ensures that farmers \nforced into bankruptcy can continue to carry on their farming \noperations without retroactive assessments against their disposable \nincome.\n  We are prepared to accept Robb amendment No. 1723 which improves the \nbill by clarifying the trustees shall return any payments not \npreviously paid and not yet due and owing to lessors and purchase money \nsecured creditors if a plan is not confirmed.\n  We are prepared to accept Grassley amendment No. 1731, a bipartisan \namendment improving the bill by giving bankruptcy judges the discretion \nto waive the $175 filing fee for chapter 7 cases for debtors whose \nannual income is less than 125 percent of the poverty level. Bankruptcy \nis the only civil proceeding where in forma pauperis filing status is \nnot permitted. This amendment corrects that anomaly. The Grassley \namendment is cosponsored by Senators Torricelli, Specter, Feingold, and \nBiden.\n  Feingold amendment No. 2743 improves the bill by striking the \nrequirement that debtor's attorneys must pay a trustee's attorney fees \nif the debtor is not substantially justified in filing for chapter 7. \nThe current requirement that debtor's attorney must pay a trustee \nattorney's fee often causes a chilling effect of discouraging eligible \ndebtors from filing chapter 7 for fear of paying future fees. Senator \nSpecter is a sponsor of this amendment.\n  We have Hatch amendment No. 1714 improving the bill by adding \nprocedures for the prosecution of materially fraudulent claims in \nbankruptcy schedules.\n  Hatch amendment No. 1715 improves the bill by dismissing bankruptcy \ncases if the debtor commits a crime of violence or a drug trafficking \ncrime.\n\n[[Page S14354]]\n\n  The Kerry amendment No. 1725 modifies the deadlines for small \nbusiness bankruptcy filings. Small businesses need the reasonable time \nlimits of this amendment to reorganize their business.\n  We have the Collins amendment No. 1726, a bipartisan amendment \nimproving the bill by providing bankruptcy rules for family fishermen. \nThe amendment is cosponsored by Senators Kerry of Massachusetts, \nMurray, Stevens, and Kennedy.\n  Johnson amendment No. 2654 improves the bill by paying chapter 7 \ntrustees if a case is dismissed or diverted under the bill's means \ntest.\n  The DeWine amendment No. 1727 improves the bill by clarifying that a \ndebt from a qualified education loan under the Internal Revenue Service \nCode is nondischargable.\n  Grassley amendment No. 2514 improves the bill by clarifying a special \ntax assessment on real property secured debts under bankruptcy laws. \nMany municipal governments, particularly in California, depend on these \nreal estate taxes or assessments for revenues. The distinguished \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  Senators had been coming to the floor Friday and Monday to offer \namendments. Even though we had only half a day of debate yesterday, \nSenators from both sides of the aisle offered amendments to improve the \nbill.\n  So I urge Senators to continue to do that. We could accept a vote or \notherwise dispose of the Democratic and Republican amendments. I have \ndiscussed this with the distinguished Senator from Iowa. Both of us \nwould like, if at all possible, to whittle down the number and be able \nto tell our colleagues at what point we are apt to finish the bill. We \nhave been working. I don't think we have even had quorum calls.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nVermont for his encouragement of all Members that although we have had \nso many amendments filed, it would be determined that every amendment \neither be offered or else dropped from the list. I hope later on this \nafternoon we can finish that process.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 2745, 1723, 1731, 2743, 1714, 1715, 1725, 1726, 2654, \n                           1727, 2514 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. With respect to the individual amendments that the \nSenator from Vermont just gave details of, I ask unanimous consent the \namendments listed be considered en bloc, agreed to en bloc, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  They are amendments Nos. 2745, 1723, 1731, 2743, 1714, 1715, 1725, \n1726, 2654, 1727, 2514.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2745, 1723, 1731, 2743, 1714, 1715, 1725, 1726, \n2654, 1727, 2514) were considered and agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2745\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the retroactive assessment of disposal income)\n\n       At the end of title X, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I thank the managers for offering and \naccepting the bipartisan amendment that would allow courts to waive the \nfiling fee for chapter 7 filers who cannot afford to pay. This is \nsimilar to an amendment that Senator Specter and I successfully offered \non the floor in the last Congress. I am certain we could have repeated \nthat success on this bill, but I did not think it was necessary this \nyear to have a rollcall vote since the House-passed bankruptcy bill \nincludes a similar provision.\n  It is unbelievable to me that bankruptcy is the only Federal civil \nproceeding in which a poor person cannot file in forma pauperis. That \nmeans that in any other federal civil proceeding you can file a case \nwithout paying the filing fee if the court determines that you are \nunable to afford the fee, but in bankruptcy you either pay the filing \nfee or you are denied access to the system.\n  That doesn't make any sense. The bankruptcy system, is by definition \ndesigned to assist those who have fallen on hard times, but because \nthere is no allowance for in forma pauperis filing, the system is \nunavailable to the poorest of the poor. This prohibition against \ndebtors filing in forma pauperis is a clear obstacle to the poor \ngaining access to justice.\n  Currently the filing fee for consumer bankruptcy is $175, and it may \nwell be increased in this bill. That's roughly the weekly take home pay \nof an employee working a 40-hour week at the minimum wage. It is \nunreasonable and unrealistic to expect the indigent--people who barely \nget by from week to week, the very people who truly need the protection \nafforded by the bankruptcy system the most--to save money to raise such \na fee simply to enter the system.\n  Congress has already acknowledged that the bankruptcy system may need \nan in forma pauperis proceeding by enacting a three year pilot program \nin six judical districts across the country. The Federal Judicial \nCenter recently submitted a comprehensive report to Congress analyzing \nthis pilot program in which it found that:\n  A fee waiver application was filed in only 3.4 percent of all chapter \n7 cases, and the large majority of these waivers were granted. Indeed, \nthe U.S. Trustees Office filed objections to less than 1 percent of the \napplications. In other words, only those very few individuals who \nreally needed the fee-waiver applied for it.\n  The fee-waiver program enhanced access to the bankruptcy system for \nindigent single women above and beyond any other group. We cannot \nstrike another blow against single mothers and their children by \ndenying them access to the bankruptcy system because they cannot even \nafford the filing fee.\n  The nature of the debt for those who filed for the fee-waiver \ndiffered from that of other debtors in that their debts related more to \nbasic subsistence--education, health, utility services, and housing. \nMoreover, 63 percent of the housing-related debts of those who filed \nfor the fee-waiver owed their debts to public housing authorities. \nTherefore, these indigent debtors were not filing bankruptcy to escape \npaying for their boats, or their fancy entertainment systems. They were \nfiling bankruptcy merely to subsist.\n  Often times the bankruptcy system was the only thing that stood \nbetween these unfortunate people and homelessness.\n  There was only a minimal increase in the number of filings and there \nwas no indication that debtors filed for chapter 7 rather than chapter \n13 just to obtain the benefit of the fee-waiver program. Simply stated, \nthe debtors did not abuse the system.\n  In sum, this amendment would build upon the strong foundation \nestablished in the pilot program and direct the Judicial Center to \ncreate a nation-wide in forma pauperis program for the bankruptcy \nsystem, thus, establishing some fairness in the bankruptcy filing \nprocess for the most financially strapped debtors.\n  We have made one modification in the amendment to make sure that in \nforma pauperis filing status is only available to truly indigent \npeople, namely those with an annual income of below 125% of the poverty \nlevel. That is the same income qualification required for people to \nreceive free legal assistance from the Legal Service Corporation. \nObviously, we don't intend for the bankruptcy filing fee to be waived \nfor people who aren't really poor. So I was happy to agree to this \nmodification.\n  The expenditure of funds required by this amendment is clearly \njustified. We made the decision long ago in this country that our \njudicial system would be open to everyone--those who can pay, and those \nwho cannot--and we decided that as a nation, we would absorb the cost \nof allowing those who could not pay to receive the same access as those \nwho could. If you are poor, and you cannot afford the fee to file for \ndivorce, we absorb the cost. If someone does you wrong and you cannot \nafford the filing fee to sue, we absorb the cost. Likewise, if you are \nin such financial difficulty that you must file for bankruptcy, and you \ncannot afford the filing fee, now, because of this amendment, we must \nalso absorb the cost.\n  In this bill, where we are giving such advantages to the well-heeled \nlandlords and credit companies, I am pleased that we will take this \nsmall step to ensure that the poorest of the poor are not shut out of \nthis very important part of our system of justice. Again, I thank the \nmanagers for agreeing to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I can get the attention of the floor \nmanager of this bill, I think what I am about to do is all right.

Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Iowa, I know he \nis concerned with the number of amendments and time. We have debated \nthis amendment in the past. It will not be a new debate for our \ncolleagues. I am more than happy to enter into an agreement, if he \nwants, to move the process along. I have three other amendments I have \noffered and laid aside which also can be dealt with quickly. I am more \nthan prepared to enter into a time agreement when the manager wants to \ndiscuss that with me. I will be brief and explain what this amendment \ndoes and why it is an important one. I hope our colleagues will be \nwilling to support it.\n  This amendment is very straightforward and just plain common sense \nand something most Americans have become familiar with already.\n  The amendment requires that when a credit card company issues a \ncredit card to persons under the age of 21, the issuers of those credit \ncards obtain an application from that individual that does one of two \nthings: One, either they have the signature of a parent, guardian, or \nother qualified individual willing to take financial responsibility for \nany debts that may be incurred; or, two, that the applicant provides \ninformation indicating the individual has independent means of repaying \nany credit card debt. One of those two things: Either have a guardian \nor some qualified person cosign to say they will assume the \nresponsibility, or demonstrate the borrower has independent means of \npaying back their debts.\n  Why do I suggest this amendment is important and one we ought to do? \nIt is becoming an alarming problem in the country. One of the most \ntroubling developments in the hotly contested battle between the credit \ncard issuers to sign up new customers has been the aggressive way in \nwhich these companies have targeted people under the age of 21, \nparticularly college students.\n  Solicitations to this age group have become more intense for a \nvariety of reasons. First of all, it is one of the few market segments \nin which there are always some new faces to go after. That certainly is \nunderstandable. Second, it is an age group in which brand loyalty can \nbe established early on. Again, I understand that. In the words of one \nmajor credit card issuer, ``We are in the relationship business. We \nwant to build relationships early on.''\n  Recent press reports have reported that people hold on to their first \ncredit cards for up to 15 years. That makes sense to me. I do not argue \nwith that. That is good business judgment. It is a new crowd coming \nalong, and a company knows they can develop loyalties early on, and \nthey want to establish that relationship as early as they can for those \nindividuals.\n  I do not fault the credit card companies for those arguments or those \nideas from a business perspective. What does worry me is that this \nsolicitation and signing people up without having some information \nwhich indicates these credit cards are going to be paid for is creating \na very serious problem, including significant dropouts from colleges \nbecause of the huge debts these individuals are accumulating.\n  In fact, people under the age of 21 are such a hot target for credit \ncard marketers that the upcoming Card Marketing Conference 98 is \ncalling one of its key sessions ``Targeting teens: You never forget \nyour first card.''\n  Providing fair access to credit is something for which I have fought \nthroughout my tenure in the Senate, and credit cards play a valuable \nrole in pursuing the American dream. Some credit card issuers, however, \nhave, in\n\n[[Page S14359]]\n\nmy view, gone too far in their aggressive solicitations. They \nirresponsibly target the most vulnerable in our society and extend them \nlarge amounts of credit with absolutely no regard to whether or not \nthere is a reasonable expectation of repayment.\n  On my first chart, I bring to my colleagues' attention a recent story \nreported in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle in the State of New \nYork. The article relates to the story of a 3-year-old child who \nrecently received a platinum credit card with a credit card limit of \n$5,000. The credit card issuers are also enticing college students.\n  In the Rochester News, a 3-year-old Rochester toddler was issued a \nplatinum credit card after the mother jokingly returned an application \nsent to the child. The child's mother told the bank that the child's \noccupation was ``preschooler'' and left the income portion of the \napplication a total blank. A few weeks later, the tot received a $5,000 \ncredit card limit.\n  This is how insane the process has become--filling out the \napplication, listing your application as a preschooler, and showing no \nsource of income, and you get $5,000 worth of credit.\n  We know in this day and age of high technology that these companies \ncertainly have the capacity of distinguishing--I hope--between a \npreschooler with no source of income and providing them with $5,000 \nworth of credit.\n  Credit card issuers are also enticing colleges and universities to \npromote their products. Professor Robert Manning of Georgetown \nUniversity told my staff recently that some colleges receive tens of \nthousands of dollars per year for exclusive marketing agreements. Other \ncolleges receive as much as 1 percent of all student charges from the \ncredit card issuer in return for marketing or affinity agreements. Even \nthose colleges that do not enter such agreements are making money.\n  Robert Bugai, president of the College Marketing Intelligence, told \nthe American Banker recently that colleges charge up to $400 per day \nfor each credit card company that sets up a table on their campuses. \nThat can run into tens of thousands of dollars by the end of just one \nsemester.\n  Last February, I went to the main campus of the University of \nConnecticut in my home State to meet with student leaders about this \nissue. Quite honestly, I was surprised at the amount of solicitations \ngoing on in the student union. Frankly, I also was surprised at the \ndegree to which the students themselves were concerned about the \nconstant barrage of offers they were receiving for credit cards.\n  The offers seemed very attractive. One student who was an intern in \nmy office this summer received four solicitations in 2 weeks from \ncredit card companies. One promised ``eight cheap flights while you \nstill have 18 weeks of vacation.'' Another promised a platinum card \nwith what appeared to be a low-interest rate until you read the fine \nprint that it applied only to balance transfers, not to the account \noverall. Only one of the four, Discover card, offered a brochure about \ncredit terms--and I commend them for it--but, in doing so, also offered \na spring break sweepstakes to 18-year-olds.\n  In fact, the Chicago Tribune recently reported the average college \nfreshman receives 50 solicitations during the first few months at \ncollege. The Tribune further reported college students get green-\nlighted--a green light, no yellow light, a green light--for a line of \ncredit that can reach more than $10,000 just on the strength of a \nsignature and a student ID; $10,000 worth of credit at the age of 18 \nwith just your student ID and a signature.\n  Who do you think is going to pay those bills? The parents do. They \nget socked with it in the end. We have to have some restraint, some \ncontrols on this. We have a huge problem with the amount of debt that \nis being accumulated by children or being passed on to their parents \nwithout any requirements at all that they meet some basic minimum \nstandards, either independent sources of income or a cosignature by \nsomeone who can demonstrate the ability to pay.\n  It is a serious public policy question about whether people in this \nage bracket can be presumed--and that is what they are doing--presumed \nto be able to make the sensible financial choices that are being forced \nupon them from this barrage of marketing.\n  While it is very difficult to get reliable information from the \ncredit card issuers about their marketing practices to people under the \nage of 21, the statistics that are available are deeply troubling. Let \nme share some of them with you.\n  Let me put up chart No. 2, if I may.\n  ``Collegiate credit cards increasing.'' This article appeared just a \nfew days ago in the Washington Post here in the Nation's Capital. Let \nme share what the Post talked about. I quote them:\n\n       Alarmed by the trend, hundreds of colleges in recent years \n     have forbidden credit card companies to solicit on their \n     campuses, and Virginia lawmakers are thinking of imposing \n     such a ban at all the State's colleges. Nine other States are \n     considering similar measures.\n\n  The Post goes on to report that:\n\n       An estimated 430 colleges have banned the marketing of \n     credit cards on their campuses.\n\n  The statistics on college credit card debt are truly frightening.\n  Nellie Mae, a major student loan provider in the New England States, \nconducted a recent survey of students who had applied for student \nloans. It termed the results ``alarming.'' The survey found that 27 \npercent of their undergraduate student applicants had four or more \ncredit cards. It found that 14 percent had credit card balances between \n$3,000 and $7,000, while another 10 percent had balances in excess of \n$10,000.\n  Let me repeat those statistics because they are truly alarming. \nTwenty-seven percent of college students already had four credit cards; \n14 percent had credit card balances between $3,000 and $7,000; and 10 \npercent had credit card balances that were greater than $7,000. That is \n24 percent; that is one out of every four who have debt somewhere \nbetween $3,000 and above $7,000--one out of every four college students \nwith that kind of debt while they are trying to pay off student loans \nand other matters. This is incredible in terms of the amount of \nobligations, while still virtually children in many cases.\n  This figure of 24 percent with credit card balances in excess of \n$3,000 is more than double the number from last year when I stood on \nthis floor and offered a similar amendment. The trend lines are \nalarming.\n  My hope with this amendment, which does not ban at all the \nsolicitation among college students--if colleges want to allow them to \ngo and solicit, they can--but the amendment merely says two things: \nEither have a guardian or a qualified person cosign, or show you have \nthe independent means of paying the credit card debt you incur.\n  That is something you would think the credit card companies would \nwant to do themselves. Why do they not want this information? Why are \nthey willing to extend up to $10,000 worth of debt merely on a student \nsignature and an ID? It seems to me that is the height of \nirresponsibility. Then they come around and complain that there is too \nmuch debt in the country and they want to tighten up the bankruptcy \nlaws.\n  Why not tighten up your own process? Why not ask for some basic \ninformation of these young people before watching them build up the \nkind of debt they may spend years trying to pay back? It seems to me \nthat if they are unwilling to impose some restraints on who can incur \nthis kind of debt, we have an obligation to set some minimum standards.\n  Again, it does not ban them from going out to solicit young people to \nbecome credit card holders. If the young person can have their parents \nor a guardian cosign, or if they can demonstrate independent means of \npayment, no problem, they get their credit card. But just on a student \nID, and just on their signature, I think this body ought to be on \nrecord as saying that is what is creating some of the real debt \nproblems in the country. We ought to put a stop to it.\n\n  I mentioned the numbers. Moreover, while there is still evidence that \nstudent debt is skyrocketing, some surveys by credit card issuers \nthemselves show that this same group of consumers is woefully \nuninformed about basic credit card terms and issues.\n  A 1993 American Express/Consumer Federation of America study--done \nonly about 5 or 6 years ago--found that\n\n[[Page S14360]]\n\nonly 22 percent of the more than 2,000 college students surveyed knew \nthat the annual percentage rate is the best indicator of the true cost \nof a loan. Only 30 percent of those surveyed knew that each bank sets \nthe interest rate on their credit cards, so it is possible to shop \naround for the best rate. Only 30 percent knew that the interest rate \nwas charged on new purchases if you carried a balance over from the \nprevious month.\n  Some college administrators, bucking the trend to use credit card \nissuers as a source of income, have become so concerned that they have \nbanned credit card companies from their campuses, as I mentioned, and \neven have gone so far as to ban credit card advertisements from the \ncampus bookstores.\n  Roger Witherspoon, the vice president of student development at John \nJay College of Criminal Justice in New York, banned credit card \nsolicitors, saying indebtedness was causing students to drop out. I \nquote him:\n\n       Middle class parents can bail out their kids when this \n     happens, but lower income parents can't.\n\n  In fact, I argue with the statement. I do not think middle-income \nparents can either. Only the most affluent parents would be able to \nbail out their children from the kind of debts many of them are \nincurring.\n  But he goes on to say:\n\n       Kids only find out later how much it messes up their lives \n     [when this debt occurs].\n\n     If I may, this is chart No. 3, which is from the Consumer \n     Federation of America. This came out last June. The Consumer \n     Federation of America says:\n\n       The average college student who does not pay off his or her \n     balance every month now has an average debt of over $2,000.\n\n  The average college student who does not pay off their balance every \nmonth has a credit card debt of over $2,000.\n\n       One-fifth--\n\n  One out of every five--\n\n     of these students have debts of more than $10,000. A number \n     of colleges are now citing credit card debt as the most \n     significant cause of college disenrollment.\n\n  Here we stand, day after day, week after week, talking about how \nimportant it is to get young people into higher education and to keep \nthem there. This ought to be a matter of bipartisan concern.\n  I know the credit card companies are working overtime on this. But if \none of the major causes of disenrollment in higher education is credit \ncard debt--where one out of every five students in this country has \ndebt in excess of $10,000, and the average student who does not pay \ntheir monthly balance has a $2,000 debt--then something is drastically \nwrong that cries out for some solution.\n  Again, I think banning credit card companies from college campuses, \nthat ought not to be our decision; leave that up to the college \ncampuses. Not allowing them to put their advertisements in bookstores, \nthat ought to be the college's decision, not the Congress'.\n  But I do not think it is too much to say that we ought to require, as \npart of a bankruptcy bill, when we are trying to reduce the amount of \nbankruptcy filings in this country, that you either have to have \nsomeone who will cosign with you, if you are under the age of 18, or \nthat you have an independent demonstration of the ability to pay.\n  I see my good friend from Utah has arrived. We now know that one of \nthe most significant reasons of disenrollment in colleges is credit \ncard debt. My colleague from Utah, who cares so much about higher \neducation, ought to be deeply alarmed. The trend lines are dreadful. It \nis just dreadful what is occurring. Unless we do something to try to \nput some restraints on this, we are going to have this problem continue \nto mount.\n  As I said earlier, this amendment does one of two things: If you are \nunder 21, have a guardian, a parent, a qualified person cosign, or \ndemonstrate you can pay, and then you get your credit card. But to say \nyou get a credit card with a student ID and your signature alone, and \nto be able to mount up this kind of debt, crippling these people from \never being able to get out from underneath their obligations, I think \nis outrageous.\n  The amendment I am proposing does not take any draconian action \nagainst the credit card industry. I agree with those who argue that \nthere are many millions of people under the age of 21, who hold full-\ntime jobs, who are as deserving of credit cards as anyone over the age \nof 21. I also agree that students should continue to have access to \ncredit. They should not try to prohibit the marketing for making credit \ncards available to these people.\n  I also recognize that the period of time from 18 to 21 is an age of \ntransition from adolescence to adulthood. As we do in so many other \nplaces in the Federal law, some extra care is needed to make sure that \nmistakes made from youthful inexperience do not haunt these people for \nthe rest of their lives. All my amendment does is require that a credit \ncard issuer, prior to granting credit, obtain one of two things from \nthe applicant under the age of 21: Either they get a signature from a \nparent, a guardian, a qualified individual, or obtain information that \ndemonstrates that that person between the ages of 18 and 21 has the \ncapability of paying it back.\n  This is a vulnerable period. This is an exciting time in their lives. \nFor many, it is the first time they are away from home. They are living \non their own, independent. All of a sudden, as we know, you get 50 \ncredit card solicitations in the space of one semester; in the case of \nthe intern in my office, offering college sweepstakes, springs breaks, \nall sorts of enticements. You sign up. Before you know it, you have \nincurred $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $6,000 worth of debt. You are 18 or 19 \nyears of age. Then they come after you to pay. They don't give you a \nbreak and say: We will wait until you get through college. We will wait \nuntil you are 25 or 30 to pay it back. They want their money right \naway. They want to get it, immediately, if they can.\n  What happens, as we now find out, is one of the reasons for \ndisenrollment in college--for one out of five students, $10,000 worth \nof debt by the time they are 19 or 20 years of age. By the way, on \n$10,000, the way the annual rates go and so forth, that probably means \nsomething like $30,000 or $40,000 because they can't pay it off all at \nonce. By the time they get out from underneath this rock, it could end \nup being a fortune for them as they start out their lives with dreams \nand aspirations and hopes.\n  Again, I don't object to the credit card companies soliciting, \nadvertising, if that is what they want to do and want to have them on \nboard. But why do you allow an 18-year-old to get this kind of a debt \nwith a student ID and a signature? You don't let that happen with older \npeople. You demand some sort of information about their ability to pay. \nWhy do you say to an 18-year-old that you can be treated so differently \nthan someone who is 25 or 30, where they need demonstrations of ability \nto pay? Why shouldn't we say that if you are going to solicit an 18-\nyear-old, at least show that they can pay it back. They may not be able \nto, but at least require that or have a guardian or an adult sign on.\n  Federal law already says people under the age of 21 shouldn't drink \nalcohol. We made that statement. I know my colleague from Utah was a \nstrong supporter of that. We don't allow you to drink anymore on \ncollege campuses unless you are 21 or older because we were worried \nabout them. We were worried what would happen to them. Isn't this a \nproblem as well, this kind of debt they can incur?\n  The Tax Code makes the presumption that if someone is a full-time \nstudent under the age of 23, they are financially dependent on their \nparents or guardians. The Tax Code makes that presumption. Is it so \nmuch to ask that credit card issuers find out if someone under the age \nof 21 is financially capable of paying back the debt or that their \nparents are willing to assume the financial responsibility or someone \nelse? Again, I know there are a lot of young people who are out working \nfull-time jobs and going to school simultaneously. This isn't a big \nburden --they need to have that credit card--to say to them, look, just \ndemonstrate, through a W-2 form or something, that you can pay back or \nyou have the ability to pay back. That is not a lot to ask. Believe me, \nthe credit card companies can do it on the Internet. They can do it in \na matter of a nanosecond if they want to.\n  Why don't they want to? What is the hesitation? Don't tell me it is \nthe bureaucracy. It is not the bureaucracy. They require it of adults \nwho are older than that. They don't give platinum credit cards out to \npeople who are not\n\n[[Page S14361]]\n\nin college without getting some information about their ability to pay. \nWhy is it in this age group that they are willing to give it to you on \na signature and a student ID? I think we all know the answer why. It is \noutrageous. It is getting worse all the time. I mentioned to you the \nnumbers have almost doubled in a year in terms of the amount of debt \nbeing held. Last year, when I offered the amendment, it was $3,000. Now \nit is at almost $7,000 worth of debt they are incurring.\n\n  I hope our colleagues will be willing to support this modest \namendment. It is not a great deal to ask. As I mentioned, 430 colleges \nhave banned credit cards from soliciting on their campuses. They know \nwhat the problem is. When we have the president of one of the major \ncriminal justice schools in the country talk about what a drastic \nproblem this is having on enrollment, these are serious people. They \nare not anticredit card. They are not antibusiness. They are not \nagainst young people having credit cards. They see what is happening on \ntheir campuses. We ought to pay attention to them and listen to them. \nTo ignore them or to say it doesn't make any difference would be an \noutrage.\n  How can we pass a bankruptcy bill, as we try and cut down on the \nnumber of bankruptcies, and allow this situation to persist where one \nout of every five college students has $10,000 of credit card debt? How \ncan we allow that to persist without setting some minimum standards \nthat these people have to meet before they can incur that kind of debt? \nI suspect the credit card companies will be probably lax in what \nminimum standards they might even permit, but at least it might put the \nbrakes on a little bit, just a little bit.\n  We have also received some strong endorsements of this amendment: the \nAmerican Federation of State County Municipal Employees; the \nCommunication Workers of America, International Brotherhood of \nBoilermakers, Blacksmiths; International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the \nUnion of Needletrades, Industrial & Textile Employees; the United \nAutomobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers; United Food & \nCommercial Workers International, representing millions of working \nfamilies.\n  Why do the unions care about a credit card bill? Because these are \nthe parents of these kids. That is why they care about it. This isn't a \nunion issue. These are the hard-working parents who are working two and \nthree and four jobs to send their kids to college. They turn around and \nsome credit card company mounts up a $10,000 debt on their back. Their \nkids have to drop out, after they have worked 20 or 30 years, saving to \nput their families through school, understanding the value of a higher \neducation. Now the credit card companies say, no, that is too much to \nask of us. You are asking way too much, that we require an 18-year-old \nto have a cosigner of the credit card application or to show that they \nhave the means of paying back the debt. That is why the millions who \nare represented by these unions have offered such strong support of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record at this juncture.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 8, 1999.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Dodd: We support your amendment \n     to the bankruptcy bill (S. 625), that would prohibit credit \n     card issuers from recklessly extending credit to young people \n     who do not have adequate means to repay their debts. \n     Predatory lending by card issuers is one of the most \n     significant reasons why the number of bankruptcies among \n     those under age 25 has grown by 50 percent since 1991.\n       This amendment would prohibit the issuance of credit cards \n     to persons under age 21, unless a parent, spouse, guardian or \n     other individual acts as co-signer, or the minor can \n     demonstrate an independent source of income sufficient to \n     repay. The amendment would not limit the extension of credit \n     to the millions of working young Americans who have an \n     adequate income and are as deserving of credit as anyone over \n     the age of 21.\n       The serious problem of predatory lending by credit card \n     issuers to young people has been well-documented. Credit card \n     issuers aggressively target young people, especially college \n     students. It is nearly impossible for students, including \n     those in high school, to avoid credit card pitches. Students \n     now receive cards at a younger age, with 81 percent of \n     students who have at least one card having received it before \n     college or during their freshman year.\n       The level of revolving debt among young people is rising to \n     alarming levels, with sometimes tragic consequences. Family \n     tensions arise as parents attempt to pay off these \n     obligations. Poor credit ratings hinder young people in the \n     job and real estate markets. Students are forced to drop out \n     of school to pay off their credit card debt.\n       Credit card issuers are well aware that most young people \n     lack basic skills in personal finance. A recent survey (1997) \n     of the financial literacy levels of high school seniors \n     showed that only 10.2% scored a ``C'' or better and that \n     students who use credit cards know no more about them then \n     students who don't.\n       This amendment is consistent with the opinion of the \n     American public. An April, 1999 poll by the Consumer \n     Federation of America/Opinion Research Corporation \n     International found overwhelming support at all age groups \n     for the terms proposed by this amendment. We join them in \n     supporting it.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n         American Federation of State, County & Municipal \n           Employees (AFSCME); Communication Workers of America \n           (CWA); International Brotherhood of Boilermarkes, Iron \n           Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers & Helpers; \n           International Brotherhood of Teamsters; Union of \n           Needletrades, Industrial & Textile Employees (UNITE); \n           United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement \n           Workers of America (UAW); United Food & Commercial \n           Workers International Union (UFCW); United Steelworkers \n           of America (USA).\n\n  Mr. DODD. I hope we can get a strong vote on this amendment. This \nshouldn't take much time. It is very little to ask. The credit card \ncompanies are the ones who have asked for this bill on bankruptcy \nreform. I am sympathetic to the bill because I do think there are far \ntoo many bankruptcies in the country. If we are to try to reduce the \nnumber of bankruptcies, we have to reduce the rationale or the reason \nwhy people are going to the bankruptcy courts in the first place. These \nare not all evil people. These are not all scam artists who are trying \nto game the system. The overwhelming majority of people who go to a \nbankruptcy court have gotten in way over their heads. You can say they \nhave been irresponsible. That may be the case.\n  But I will tell you, for an awful lot of families, they have kids in \ncollege and those adolescent kids became irresponsible. I know of very \nfew who don't get irresponsible in their adolescent years. The danger \ntoday is that they can get deeply in trouble. It isn't just a college \nprank that may get them in trouble. Now you have major credit card \ncompanies dumping 50 solicitations into their mailboxes in their \ndormitories in the first semester in college. With a student I.D. and a \nsignature, they get themselves $10,000 into trouble. Requiring these \ncompanies to at least get some basic information may slow down this \nprocess. It will do a lot to reduce the volume of bankruptcies in this \ncountry, to reduce the ability of an 18- or 19-year-old, with no \nindependent means of paying back their debts, from getting these cards \nin the first place, and saving these families the anguish and heartache \nand the dashed dreams that a young college student has when they go off \nfor the first time. Many of them, by the way, are the first people in \ntheir families ever to go to college. Think how the families feel--the \nexcitement, the thrill of a young person going off to college, from a \nblue collar working family in this country who never had that \nopportunity. All of a sudden they get a deluge of platinum credit cards \nflooding their mailboxes, the kids sign up, and the dreams of a family \ngo down the drain in a matter of weeks.\n  This ought not to be a Democrat or Republican issue, conservative or \nliberal issue. This is a commonsense issue. This is basic common sense, \nwhich says to these companies that, with 18- to 21-year-olds, there has \nto be some cosigner, or some demonstration of an independent means to \npay back. If you turn down this amendment and you turn around and say \nwe ought to stop these bankruptcies, then you make it harder for these \nfamilies to get out of these obligations and straighten out their \nlives. I know an awful lot of good people who have gotten themselves \nbehind the eight ball financially; they are not evil, bad people. \nBecause they get into a little trouble, particularly at 18 or 19 --and \none out of five of them are $10,000 in debt--doesn't mean they ought \nnot to have an opportunity to straighten things out. The best way is \nnot to get into trouble in the first\n\n[[Page S14362]]\n\nplace. The way not to get into trouble in the first place is to put \nsome governor--you know how we do with automobiles with young people, \nwhere the car can't go more than 60 miles an hour, because we know \nthere is a danger of a young person going too fast. Why not put a \ngovernor here on the credit card companies and slow them down. They can \nmake their solicitations, send the solicitations in there, but require \nthat these young people have a cosigner or a demonstration of an \nindependent means to pay. If they can't do that, then you move on to \nsomeone else who can. But don't sign up a young person and put them and \ntheir family into harm's way and pass a bankruptcy bill that doesn't \nallow them to take the bankruptcy act when those debts mount up.\n  So I hope that our colleagues will support this amendment. This will \nbe a good way for us to build strong bipartisan support for this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to rise in opposition to the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd. It would require young adults under the age of 21 to obtain \nparental consent or demonstrate an ``independent means of repaying'' in \norder to get a credit card. This amendment also caps the amount of \ncredit a young adult can get to $1,500.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment is well-intentioned. However, \nif adopted, it would unfairly put young adults between the ages of 18 \nand 21 at a disadvantage by putting serious obstacles in their way, or, \nin some cases, bar them from obtaining credit cards altogether. Young \nadults today, whether they are serving in our Nation's military, or \ngoing to college, or trying to support a young family, do not need \nthese hurdles placed in their path. This amendment would have an \nadverse effect on temporarily unemployed adults over the age of 18 who \nare independent of their parents, the twenty-year-old single mother, \nthe twenty-year-old discharged from the military service, or a twenty-\nyear-old worker between jobs--often the very person most needing the \nextension of credit.\n\n  I understand how difficult times can be for young adults. When I was \n16 years of age, I was a skilled building tradesman. I knew a trade. I \nwent through a formal apprenticeship and became a journeyman. I was \nproud of it. I was capable of supporting my family at that time. I \nworked as a janitor to put myself through college. I believe it is an \ninsult to young adults to put in doubt their ability to get credit.\n  In addition, this amendment does not appear to be well thought out. \nFor example, it makes absolutely no provision for young adults who may \nbe estranged from their parents or whose parents or guardians may be \ndeceased. It is also unclear what new burdens will be placed on lenders \nto verify the authenticity of a parent's or guardian's signature. I \nalso can't resist pointing out that many of the very same folks who \noppose parental consent for abortion are in favor of parental consent \nfor getting a credit card. That seems a little odd to me.\n  I can appreciate that there have been some instances when young \nadults have been extended credit beyond their ability to repay. But it \ndoes not strike me as a reasoned public policy, in an effort to tackle \nthe occasional abuse, to discriminate against the many honest, hard-\nworking, decent young people between the ages of 18 and 21 who rely on \ncredit to make their lives a little bit more livable, or even \nsustainable.\n  I also must point out that individuals under age 18 cannot enter into \nbinding contracts, and therefore any credit inadvertently extended to \nthem is unenforceable.\n  The amendment would undermine a fundamental purpose of bankruptcy \nreform: to make individuals take more responsibility for their personal \nfinances. I believe that the vast majority of young adults between the \nages of 18 and 21 are responsible citizens, and they do not need the \nbig Government to tell them what they can or cannot do in this area. I \noppose treating adults as if they are children; therefore, I have to \noppose this amendment.\n  Let me make a correction. This amendment does not place a cap on the \namount of credit a minor can get. I misspoke and I confused it with an \namendment filed that was identical to this, only it does have the cap. \nSo I will make that clear and make that correction.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for another correction?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. It says parents, guardians, or any other qualified person \ncan cosign. It is not limited to parents. If the parents were deceased \nor the guardians were deceased, a qualified person could cosign. So we \nallow for a broader range of options here.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. I will certainly make that \ncorrection.\n  I still believe we ought to treat them as young adults. We ought to \nrecognize that many people who really qualify for credit cards in these \nage groups ought to be able to get them with or without anybody else's \nconsent. Many of them live up to the obligations that they incur; in \nfact, most of them do. I don't think we should, as a public policy \nmatter, make this particular change that my dear friend from \nConnecticut has suggested. We are sending these young men and women \nover 18 years of age to war. They can vote at 18. They can do almost \nanything. Now we want to take away their right to have a credit card. I \nthink that is bad public policy. I hope our colleagues will defeat this \namendment when it comes up for a vote. With that, I believe we are \nready to recess.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just have one minute in response. As my \nfriend from Utah knows, shortly, we have an amendment that we are going \nto offer together on this bill. I am sorry we don't agree on this. As I \nmentioned earlier, we do set some restrictions. We can send men and \nwomen to war at age 18, but we don't allow them to drink; we set a \nstandard of 21. We did so because of the dangers that we decided \nalcohol posed to young people. The Tax Code says there is a rebuttable \npresumption that at 23-year-old college student has an obligation that \nshifts to parents.\n\n  All I am requiring here is that the credit card companies, when they \nsolicit an 18 or 19 year old, require that they show they have the \nindependent means of paying for it or that they have a guardian or a \nqualified person who will cosign. The same thing would be required of \nsomeone else. One out of five students has $10,000 worth of financial \ndebt and obligation. We are being told now one of the single largest \nreasons for disenrollment in higher education is because of this \nmounting--and it has doubled in the last two years--amount of credit \ncard debt among 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds.\n  It ought not to be a great deal to ask they meet these basic, simple \nrequirements. They can solicit; they can collect. If they can sign them \nup, God bless them, go to it. However, for a student ID and a signature \nto get $10,000 worth of debt for one out of five college students--and \nthe average student has $2,000 worth of debt and was not paying the \nmonthly payments--is too much for the families to be burdened with.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, the Consumers Union, the National Consumer Law Center, the \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the U.S. Student Association, \nall of which support this amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 8, 1999.\n\n    RE: Support for Dodd/Kennedy Amendment #2754 to Bankruptcy Bill\n\n       Dear Senator, The undersigned organizations strongly \n     support this amendment to the bankruptcy bill regarding the \n     extension of credit to young Americans. This common sense \n     proposal would forbid banks and other credit card issuers \n     from granting credit to any person under 21 years-of-age, \n     without the signature of a parent or guardian or proof of an \n     independent means of repaying the debt incurred.\n       This amendment would not result in denials to credit-worthy \n     young people, but it would protect financially \n     unsophisticated young consumers from being enticed into a \n     financial trap. A recent study by the Consumer Federation of \n     America found that previous research has underestimated the \n     extent of credit card debt by college students, as well as \n     the social impact of this debt on students. The study \n     documents the consequences of high levels of indebtedness for \n     many students, including dropping out of college, difficulty \n     finding good jobs, and in\n\n[[Page S14363]]\n\n     particularly tragic circumstances, extreme psychological \n     stress and suicide.\n       Minors are increasingly targeted in credit card marketing \n     campaigns. Direct solicitation of college students has \n     intensified significantly in the past few years as high \n     profitability has encouraged card issuers to take on riskier \n     customers. Cards are available to almost any student with no \n     income, no credit history and no parental signature required. \n     Issuers know that young customers are often ``brand loyal'' \n     to their first card for many years. They also know that many \n     parents will pay off excessive credit card debt accumulated \n     by their children, even though they are under no legal \n     obligation to do so.\n       As a result, approximately 70 percent of undergraduates at \n     four-year colleges possess at least one credit card. \n     Moreover, students are obtaining their first credit card at a \n     young age. Accordingly to the non-profit student loan \n     provider Nellie Mae, 66 percent of college students with at \n     least one card received their first card before college or \n     during their freshman in 1996. By 1998, 81 percent had \n     received their first card by the end of their freshman year.\n       Student credit card debt is larger than previously \n     estimated. The Consumer Federation of America study found \n     that college students who do not pay off their balances every \n     month have an average debt of more then $2,000, with one-\n     fifth of these students carrying debts of more than $10,000. \n     Additional credit card debt is often ``refinanced'' with \n     student loans or with private debt consolidation loans. At \n     some schools, college loan debt averages $20,000 per \n     graduating senior.\n       More than one quarter of all students reported paying late \n     on a credit card at least once in the last two years, \n     according to a 1998 survey by the U.S. Public Interest \n     Research Group. One-quarter of students questioned in the \n     survey also reported using a cash advance to pay their debts. \n     Poor credit records and credit card defaults have lasting \n     consequences, including the classification of the student as \n     a high risk/high rate borrower and decreased access to rental \n     housing, car loans and home mortgage loans.\n       Many colleges and universities not only permit aggressive \n     credit card marketing on campus; they actually benefit \n     financially from this marketing. Credit card issuers pay \n     institutions for sponsorship of school programs, for support \n     of student activities, for rental of on-campus solicitation \n     tables, and for exclusive marketing agreements, such as \n     college ``affinity'' credit cards.\n       Card issuers are well aware that high school and college \n     students don't have basic financial skills. A 1993 survey of \n     college juniors and seniors by the Consumer Federation of \n     America and American Express found:\n       Just 22 percent knew that the APR was the best indicator of \n     the cost of a loan;\n       Just 30 percent knew that interest rates on credit cards \n     are set by the issuing bank, not Visa, MasterCard of the \n     government;\n       Just 30 percent knew that the grace period was not \n     available when a credit card balance is carried from month-\n     to-month.\n       The American people strongly support restricting aggressive \n     lending practices by credit card issuers. A national poll \n     conducted for the Consumer Federation of America in April \n     1999 by Opinion Research Corporation found that 80 percent of \n     those surveyed supported restrictions on the extension of \n     credit cards to people under age 21.\n       Without this reasonable amendment, direct solicitation of \n     college and high school students without the ability to repay \n     will continue unabated.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for his efforts and \ncooperation in working on this important amendment.\n  I am pleased to offer along with Senators Dodd and Gregg, an \namendment to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, that will \nprotect education IRAs and qualified State tuition savings programs in \nbankruptcy. Education IRAs and qualified State tuition savings programs \npermit parents and grandparents to contribute funds for the tuition and \nother higher education expenses of their children and grandchildren. \nUnder current bankruptcy law, creditors may access such accounts to \nsatisfy debts owed by parents and grandparents.\n  The amendment I offer today balances the interest of encouraging \nfamilies to save for college, with the interest of preventing the \npotential abuse of transferring funds into education savings accounts \nprior to an anticipated bankruptcy. Specifically, the amendment \nprovides that contributions to education savings accounts made during \nthe year immediately prior to the bankruptcy filing are not protected \nin bankruptcy and may be accessed by creditors; contributions up to \n$5,000 per beneficiary made in the second year prior to filing, \nhowever, are protected, as are all contributions made more than 2 years \nprior to the bankruptcy\n\n[[Page S14364]]\n\nfiling. To combat potential abuse, debtors must disclose their full \ninterest in such accounts in the statement of financial affairs filed \nwith the bankruptcy court. With respect to education IRAs, there is no \nlimit on the amount that may be excluded from the bankruptcy estate, \nthough the size of education IRAs are effectively limited by the $500 \nannual contribution limit. With respect to qualified State tuition \nsavings programs, the excluded amount is the full, State-established \namount deemed necessary to provide for the qualified education expenses \nof a beneficiary.\n  College savings accounts encourage families to save for college, \nthereby increasing access to higher education. In my home State of \nUtah, 775 children, with account balances nearing $1.2 million, are \nbeneficiaries of such accounts. Nationwide, over one million children \nbenefit from such accounts. Bona fide contributions to such college \nsavings accounts, which are made for the benefit of children, should be \nbeyond the reach of creditors. The ability to use dedicated funds to \npay the educational costs of current and future college students should \nnot be jeopardized by a bankruptcy of their parents or grandparents. \nThe amendment I offer today prevents bona fide educational accounts of \nchildren from being accessed by their parents' or grandparents' \ncreditors, while also protecting this exclusion from being abused as a \nmeans of sheltering assets from the bankruptcy estate.\n  I urge your support of this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent I be able to speak for up to 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I know this will be somewhat confusing to people watching \nthe debate over the last 15 or 20 minutes, but this is an amendment \noffered by my distinguished friend and colleague from Utah of which I \nam a cosponsor. This is a very good amendment. We hope our colleagues \nwill support it.\n  Many parents have put aside money for college education in special \naccounts. This ought not to be the subject of first attack when \ncreditors come after family income.\n  I commend my colleague from Utah for trying to preserve and protect \nthese resources which working families spend years trying to \naccumulate, and then get behind the 8 ball for problems that may not be \nof their own making, and all of a sudden the resources are subject to \nattack. This is a good amendment that will strengthen working families' \nability to educate their children. I commend my colleague from Utah for \noffering it. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding the order for \nrecess, I be permitted to speak for 2 minutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, as part of the \nrequest of the Senator from Missouri, I be allowed to speak for up to \n12 minutes. At the conclusion of the 12 minutes, I will call up an \namendment.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent to be able to address the \nSenate as in morning business for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The problem is, the previous order says 12:30 \nso we can attend policy conferences. That runs me past the time for \nmaking decisions as a part of that conference.\n  Is there a way to reduce the time so we can complete statements by \n12:45?\n  Mr. BOND. I just asked for 2 minutes, and I will make it shorter than \nthat.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the managers have asked Members to offer \namendments. I am trying to offer an amendment. I need 11 minutes in \norder to present the amendment. I am trying to facilitate the progress \non the bill. I thought this would be a good opportunity. It is a total \nof 11 minutes. The conferences don't really begin in earnest until 1 \no'clock anyway.\n  I renew my request to be granted 12 minutes total.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I will certainly try to complete my statement in 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, mere words seem inadequate to honor the \ncourage of some people and so I am humbled to lend my voice to the \nchorus of praise for the Little Rock Nine, who today will receive the \nCongressional Gold Medal, and I will also speak in remembrance of Daisy \nBates, a daughter of Arkansas and a civil rights activist.\n  Receiving the medal today are: Jean Brown Trickery, Carlotta Walls \nLaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Terrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, \nThelma Mothershed Wait, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and Jefferson \nThomas. As teenagers, when they bravely walked through the doors of \nCentral High School in Little Rock, they led our Nation one step closer \nto social justice and equality. While it is still painful to look at \npictures from that time, where white teens sneered at their black \npeers, seeing the harsh face of hatred opened our Nation's eyes and \npropelled the civil rights movement forward.\n  Before the ``Crisis of 1957,'' as some call the events at Central \nHigh, Little Rock was not associated with the pervasive segregation of \nthe Deep South. In fact, Little Rock was considered quite a progressive \nplace and some schools in Arkansas had already integrated following the \nBrown v. Board of Education decision in May of 1954. So, when nine \nstudents sought to integrate Central, few Arkansans envisioned a \nconfrontation with the National Guard at the schools entrance. And I \ndoubt many imagined the long-lasting, profound effects of this \nconfrontation on the entire State. While the country witnessed \ncountless images of this face-off, they were not necessarily aware of \nthe continuing abuse endured by the Little Rock Nine, or the fact that \nCentral High School had to be closed because the atmosphere was so \nhostile.\n  Now, we all know that the high school years aren't easy for any \nteenager. For these men and women, high school was inordinately \ndifficult. In addition to enduring the verbal taunts and even beatings, \nsome had to uproot to other schools in the middle of the school year. \nLuckily for Carlotta, Thelma, Ernest, Jefferson, and the others, a \nwoman named Daisy Bates entered their lives as a ``guardian angel'' of \nsorts.\n  According to Daisy's own accounts and those of the Little Rock Nine, \nthe students would gather each night at the Bates' home to receive \nguidance and strength. It was through the encouragement of Daisy Bates \nand her husband, L.C., that these young men and women were able to face \nthe vicious and hateful actions of those so passionately opposed to \ntheir attendance at Central. Ironically, Daisy Bates passed away last \nThursday. She was laid to rest this morning, the very day the Little \nRock Nine will receive their medals. I know she is with us in spirit--\nacting again as a guardian angel to these brave men and women. This \ngreat woman leaves a legacy to our children, our State and our Nation: \na love of justice, freedom, and the right to be educated. As a result \nof her efforts, the newspaper Mrs. Bates and L.C. published was forced \nto close. She and L.C. were threatened with bombs and guns. They were \nhanged in effigy by segregationists. But Daisy Bates persevered. She \ndid all this, withstood these challenges, because she loved children \nand she loved her country. She had an internal fire, instilled in her \nduring a childhood spent in Huttig, AR. And this strong character shone \nthrough as she willingly took a leadership role to battle the legal and \npolitical inequities of segregation in our state and the nation.\n  Many have called that confrontation at Central High an historic \nmoment, a pivotal moment, a defining moment.\n\n[[Page S14365]]\n\nBut it was more than just one moment. When these nine men and women \nwalked into Central High School, they opened more than a door, they \nopened the flood gates. For them and for the rest of our country, the \nbattle didn't end at the schoolhouse steps. Their struggle lasted for \nyears and, in reality, it still continues. My husband and I are both \nproducts of an integrated public school system in Arkansas. We are \npersonally grateful to the Little Rock Nine for making our school \nexperience rich with diversity. I truly value the lifelong lessons that \nI learned at an early age and I might not have had the wonderful \nprivilege of studying with children of all races were it not for the \nLittle Rock Nine. There is still much work to be done to bring complete \ncivil rights and equality to our Nation.\n  Today, as we pause to remember Daisy Bates and to honor the Little \nRock Nine, I hope we will be renewed and refreshed in or efforts. I'm \nencouraged by the words of Daisy Bates' niece, Sharon Gaston, who said, \n``Just don't let her work be in vain. There's plenty of work for us to \ndo.''I hope my colleagues will join me in extending appreciation and \ncommendation to the Little Rock Nine. And in remembering a matriarch of \nthe civil rights movement, Daisy Gaston Bates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about some \nimportant legislative matters and to announce to my colleagues I cannot \nand will not clear a bill called S. 623, the Dakota Water Resources \nAct, from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It would \nauthorize a half billion dollars to divert additional water from the \nMissouri River system for additional uses, including transfer to the \nCheyenne and Red River systems. We cannot and will not tolerate the \ndiversion of water. This is strongly opposed by the Governor of my \nState, by the State of Minnesota, by Taxpayers for Common Sense, and a \nwhole list of environmental groups including the National Wildlife \nFederation, the Audubon Society, Friends of the Earth and American \nRivers. The Canadian Government opposes it, the Governor of Minnesota \nand the Minnesota DNR oppose it.\n  I understand why the Dakota Senators want to fight for this. It would \nbe a tremendous boon for their States. But I am not going to be \nblackmailed because 52 other unrelated bills are being held up over \nthis matter. There are strong substantive objections to this bill. It \nis not appropriate in this process to try to ram this through, to try \nto steal water from the Missouri River.\n  I serve notice on my colleagues, if they have a problem because their \nbills are being held up in an attempt to blackmail me, it is not going \nto work. We have worked in good faith with the Senators from North \nDakota in the past, helping them with their problems, but I do not \nintend to be blackmailed into allowing diversion of the Missouri River \nwater.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business. If they have a consent agreement \nworked out, then I will hold off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I shan't object.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I said I shan't object.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I noticed Senator Grassley, who worked very \nhard on this bill, is trying to get a consent agreement. I will hold \noff if he is ready to go forward. Otherwise, I will proceed because I \nhave the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Take 5 minutes?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I gather the consent agreement is not \nworked out. I did ask consent for the right to speak up to 10 minutes. \nI gather they can work things out during that period of time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Oregon have 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the Senator from Oregon has \n5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14365-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14365-S14366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SENIOR PRESCRIPTION INSURANCE COVERAGE EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have been coming to the floor for a \nnumber\n\n[[Page S14366]]\n\nof days now in an effort to try to get a focus back on this \nprescription drug issue which seems to involve a lot of finger pointing \nand a lot of partisan bickering. As part of that effort, I have been \nurging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. Just \nas this poster says, the senior can send in a copy of the prescription \ndrug bill, and write to each of us in the Senate here in Washington, \nDC.\n  I have been actually coming to the floor and reading some of these \nbills for a number of weeks. Just in the last couple of days, I heard \nfrom a woman in Portland--she is 84; she has diabetes and a heart \ncondition. She has only Social Security to support herself. She is \nspending over a third of that Social Security check every month on \nprescription drugs. She is now at a point where it is hard to pay the \ntaxes on her home.\n  I heard from another gentleman recently. He has a monthly Social \nSecurity check of $633. The cost of his drugs is $644 a month. He is \nspending more for his prescription drugs each month than he is actually \ngetting in income. So every month this senior is having to choose \nbetween food and fuel and fuel and health care. So as a result of this \neffort to get from seniors copies of their prescription drug bills, we \nare hearing about the kind of suffering that seniors are enduring \naround this country.\n  Senator Olympia Snowe and I have a bipartisan prescription drug bill. \nIt would cover all senior citizens on an ability-to-pay basis. More \nthan 50 Senators of both political parties are now on record as \nsupporting a funding plan for this legislation. I know other Senators \nhave approaches they would like to try. What is important is that we \nget a bipartisan focus on this issue. Every public opinion poll shows \nseniors and families across this country are having difficulty making \nends meet when it comes to the high cost of essential health care \nservices.\n  Our approach is marketplace oriented. There are not price controls. \nIt is not one size fits all. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is called \nSPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It is \ndesigned to deal with the double whammy our seniors are facing on their \nprescriptions. First, Medicare does not cover the drugs they need and, \nsecond, when a senior citizen walks into a drug store, in effect that \nsenior is subsidizing the big buyers, the health maintenance \norganizations, and other health plans that are able to get discounts.\n  So seniors have this double whammy now in front of them when it comes \nto their prescriptions. I hope more will, as these posters indicate, \nsend us copies of their prescription drug bills. I think on the basis \nof these bills that we are getting from seniors across the country--\neach of us in the Senate here in Washington, DC--we can bring about \nbipartisan support to actually respond to the needs of the seniors.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate? The Senator \nis addressing the Senate. May we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nOregon has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we still do not have order. May we have \norder in the Senate? You may have to rap that gavel to be heard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. The Senator from West Virginia \nhas been a great ally of the Nation's older people, and I very much \nappreciate his thoughtfulness. I believe my time is almost up.\n  I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate to read from these \nbills that we are getting from the Nation's senior citizens. We have 54 \nMembers of the Senate already on record as having voted for a specific \nplan to fund a prescription drug benefit for older people. We can do \nthis in a bipartisan way. We have the chairman of the Aging Committee, \nSenator Grassley, who has led our efforts on the committee on so many \nissues.\n  I am going to keep coming back to the floor and read from these \nbills. Again and again, we are hearing from seniors who cannot afford \nimportant drugs such as their diabetes medicines.\n  I will wrap up by saying, when I am asked the question whether our \nNation can afford prescription drug coverage, my response is we cannot \nafford not to cover prescriptions.\n  A lot of these drugs help seniors stay healthy, keep their blood \npressure down, or help to reduce cholesterol. I have cited previously \nan anticoagulant drug. It costs senior citizens about $1,000 a year. \nWith those kinds of medicines, we can help prevent strokes that involve \nexpenses of more than $100,000.\n  I am going to keep coming back to this floor to focus on the needs of \nseniors. We ought to do this in a bipartisan way. That is what is \nbehind the Snowe-Wyden legislation. A lot of our colleagues have other \nideas for addressing this issue.\n  As this poster says, I hope seniors will continue to send copies of \ntheir prescription drug bills to us in the Senate, Washington, DC.\n  I will keep coming to this floor until we can get the bipartisan \naction we need that provides real relief for the Nation's older people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14366-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14366-S14370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, now be recognized to offer his amendment \nNo. 2748, and he be recognized for up to 12 minutes for general debate \non the amendment. I further ask consent that the amendment be laid \naside, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the amendment at 5 \no'clock, with no second-degree amendment in order prior to the vote. I \nfurther ask consent that votes occur on or in relation to the following \ntwo amendments in sequence at 5 o'clock, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the votes, and there be 4 minutes for \nexplanation prior to each vote. Those amendments are No. 2521 offered \nby Senator Durbin and No. 2754 offered by Senator Dodd. I further ask \nconsent that following the sequencing of the amendments, Senator \nSchumer then be recognized to call up an amendment and to speak for up \nto 2 minutes and the amendment then be laid aside.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 5 \no'clock be equally divided in the usual form. I further ask consent \nwhen the Senate resumes consideration of S. 625 tomorrow, I be \nrecognized to call up our amendment No. 2771 on which there will be a \n4-hour time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if I could \nask my friend, the manager of this bill, it is my understanding that \nthe time between now and 5 o'clock would be evenly divided between the \nmajority and minority?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. During that period of time, Senators Dodd and Durbin would \nbe able to speak on those two amendments?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. Also, during that same period of time, it is my \nunderstanding--for example, Senator Schumer wanted to offer amendments \nduring that period of time. He would be allowed to do that?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have it stated here.\n  Mr. REID. After the votes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. After the votes.\n  Mr. REID. We want Senator Schumer to use some of the time of Senator \nDodd and Senator Durbin prior to the 5 o'clock vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. To answer your question with a further question, this \nwould be to call up, spend a little bit of time explaining them, and \nlay them aside?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Further, Mr. President, I ask my friend from Iowa, Senator Feingold, \nI am told, was not expecting a vote tonight.\n  Is that true?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. He was not expecting a vote on his amendment tonight. So \nunless there is some reason the majority believes a vote should go \nforward on that, Senator Feingold would prefer\n\n[[Page S14367]]\n\n not to go forward with the vote tonight. So we would still have the \ntwo votes on the Durbin and Dodd amendments at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We will modify the request accordingly.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, just so I understand it \ncorrectly, the two amendments that have been debated are the Durbin and \nDodd amendments. We have debated those two amendments. This unanimous \nconsent request, Mr. President, if I understand it correctly, would \nallow us some additional time to debate those two amendments between \nnow and 5 o'clock, but the only amendments to be voted on at 5 o'clock \nare the Durbin and Dodd amendments?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. However, if other amendments were to be debated or raised \nfor purposes of debate, and then laid aside, the manager of the bill is \nsuggesting that would be allowable in the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are suggesting for the Schumer amendment, according \nto the agreement, because the other side of the aisle had suggested in \nthe preliminary negotiations that we had on this--negotiations which \nfell through--that it was very necessary to have a lot of time to \ndevote to debate these amendments on which we had not had votes.\n  Mr. DODD. Right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And we had not had debate on them either. So Members on \nthat side of the aisle would be secure that they had an opportunity to \nthoroughly debate their amendments, that is why we reserved this time.\n  Mr. DODD. Further reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to my friend from Connecticut, we also have \na subsequent unanimous consent request that we expect to propose, once \nwe get this done, which would allow the Senator from Connecticut to \noffer an amendment that we talked about earlier today.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, I would like to clarify \nwith either the Senator from Iowa or the ranking minority whip, I would \nbe allowed to offer my amendments in the next hour and a half?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. And would be allowed to debate them, if time permitted, \ngiven how much time the Senators from Connecticut and Illinois took on \ntheir amendments; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It says here you shall have up to 2 minutes on the \namendment, then lay it aside.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, that was contemplating his \noffering them tonight after the 5 o'clock votes. I do not know if we \nare going to be able to use all of our time, which is approximately 75 \nminutes, on these two amendments. It would leave Senator Schumer time \nto offer his amendments and talk under the minority's allotted time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think it would be fair, for the purpose of our \nresponding to the desires of your side to have time for your folks who \nare offering the amendments to have adequate time, that we not let the \nSenator from New York go beyond what we have agreed to, or then I am \ngoing to be subject to criticism at 5 o'clock that somebody on your \nside did not get enough time to offer their amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. That is good. Let's go.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So just clarifying, in other words, if the Senator from \nConnecticut and if the Senator from Illinois have extra time, we could \ndebate the amendments that I would now offer; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. Fine.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, will this mean we will \nhave an opportunity this afternoon for debate by those who would be \nopposed to those amendments?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. We will have equal time on our side for this \nSenator to allocate to you.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Those are the amendments I had asked for, not just one?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. Those are the amendments you spoke to me about \nthis morning, banking amendments?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, another request. After the 5 p.m. votes, \non behalf of the prime sponsor of the pending second-degree amendment, \nNo. 2518, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment in order \nfor the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, to offer a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. If I may interrupt my friend from Iowa, we just received a \nphone call that we are going to have to wait a minute on that. So let's \nget started on the rest of it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK. I will withhold and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2748\n\n (Purpose: To provide for an exception to a limitation on an automatic \nstay under section 362(b) of title 11, United States Code, relating to \n evictions and similar proceedings to provide for the payment of rent \nthat becomes due after the petition of a debtor is filed, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in a few minutes I will offer amendment \nNo. 2748. This amendment concerns section 311 of the bill, which \nprovides a complete exemption from the automatic stay for eviction of \nproceedings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is advised this \nrequires the Senator to offer his amendment first and then begin \ndebate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would be happy to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendments so I may \ncall up amendment No. 2748.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2748.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 108, line 15, strike ``; and'' and insert a \n     semicolon.\n       Beginning on page 108, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through page 109, line 7, and insert the following:\n       ``(23) under subsection (a)(3), of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor involving \n     residential real property--\n       ``(A) on which the debtor resides as a tenant under a \n     rental agreement; and\n       ``(B) with respect to which--\n       ``(i) the debtor fails to make a rent payment that \n     initially becomes due under the rental agreement or \n     applicable State law after the date of filing of the \n     petition, if the lessor files with the court a certification \n     that the debtor has not made a payment for rent and serves a \n     copy of the certification to the debtor; or\n       ``(ii) the debtor's lease has expired according to its \n     terms and the lessor intends to personally occupy that \n     property, if the lessor files with the court a certification \n     of such facts and serves a copy of the certification to the \n     debtor;\n       ``(24) under subsection (a)(3), of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor involving \n     residential real property, if during the 1-year period \n     preceding the filing of the petition, the debtor--\n       ``(A) commenced another case under this title; and\n       ``(B) failed to make a rent payment that initially became \n     due under an applicable rental agreement or State law after \n     the date of filing of the petition for that other case; or\n       ``(25) under subsection (a)(3), of an eviction action based \n     on endangerment of property or the use of an illegal drug, if \n     the lessor files with the court a certification that the \n     debtor has endangered property or used an illegal drug and \n     serves a copy of the certification to the debtor.''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end of the flush material at the end \n     of the subsection the following: ``With respect to the \n     applicability of paragraph (23) or (25) to a debtor with \n     respect to the commencement or continuation of a proceeding \n     described in that paragraph, the exception to the automatic \n     stay shall become effective on the 15th day after the lessor \n     meets the filing and notification requirements under that \n     paragraph, unless the debtor takes such action as may be \n     necessary to address the subject of the certification or the \n     court orders that the exception to the automatic stay shall \n     not become effective or provides for a later date of \n     applicability.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n[[Page S14368]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment would limit the reach of \nsection 311 of the bill, which I believe is far too broad. I think it \nis too harsh a solution for the limited abuse that its sponsors say \nthey are trying to address.\n  Since the Bankruptcy Code was enacted, the automatic stay that \nbecomes effective upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition has always \nprohibited a landlord from evicting a tenant unless the landlord \nobtains permission from the bankruptcy court--what is called ``relief \nfrom the stay.'' The stay serves several purposes. In chapter 13, a \ntenant has a right to assume a lease and to cure a default by paying \nthe accumulated back rent. In chapter 7, the stay was intended to \nprovide the debtor a short ``breathing spell.'' Breathing room is \nespecially helpful to debtors who want to remain in their homes. In \nmany cases, when a chapter 7 debtor is relieved of other debts, he or \nshe can use this brief period to catch up on the rent and avoid \neviction.\n  The right to avoid eviction by filing bankruptcy is obviously of \ngreat importance to tenants who at the very point when they have \nundertaken the difficult and draining bankruptcy experience would \notherwise suffer the additional hardships of moving and having to find \nnew housing. And then you have tenants in rent-controlled or rent-\nstabilized apartments, who lose valuable property rights if they are \nevicted. Of course, an eviction would normally doom any hope of the \ntenant completing a chapter 13 repayment plan or getting much benefit \nfrom the fresh start bankruptcy is intended to provide.\n  I understand that the applicability of the automatic stay to eviction \nproceedings has come under attack because of abuses. This is primarily \ndue to the practice of debtors in a few cities, especially Los Angeles, \nof filing bankruptcy cases, sometimes repeatedly, solely for the \npurpose of delaying eviction and, in effect, ``living rent free.'' \nthese debtors are often aided by nonattorney bankruptcy petition \npreparers and file pro se. I have seen the advertisements by some of \nthese unscrupulous individuals, and I deplore this kind of abuse as \nmuch as anyone does.\n  But to address this limited problem of abuse, what S. 625 does is \ntotally eliminate the automatic stay for tenants.\n  In fact, the bill contains an even more sweeping provision than the \nlanguage adopted in the conference report last year and contained in \nthe House bill this year.\n  The problem of abusive bankruptcy filings by tenants in a few \njurisdictions can be addressed by more limited, carefully targeted \nprovisions. First, we can cut a whole area of abuse by simply lifting \nthe stay in cases where there are repeat bankruptcy filings. My \namendment includes that. These abuses inspired this amendment and they \nalso point to its underlying goal: to eliminate the possibility that \ndebtors can use the bankruptcy law to live ``recent free'' after they \nfile. I agree that we should not let tenants take advantage of the \nbankruptcy laws to live ``rent free.'' But if a debtor is able to put \ntogether enough money to pay rent during the pendency of the \nbankruptcy, that goal is satisfied. Certainly, the landlord is not \nlosing anything financially by allowing the tenant to stay.\n\n  If the landlord again begins collecting rent on the apartment after a \nbankruptcy filing, it is in the same position as it would be if it \nevicted the debtor and began collecting rent from a new tenant. So \nunder my amendment, relief from the automatic stay is only available if \nthe debtor fails to pay rent that comes due after the bankruptcy \nfiling.\n  I also believe that it is important to keep the bankruptcy court \ninvolved and aware of the lifting of the stay as it is under current \nlaw when a landlord applies for relief from the stay. There does seems \nto be good reason, however, to provide expedited relief from the stay \nif the debtor does not pay rent while the proceeding is pending.\n  So my amendment creates a simple and straightforward process. Once a \ndebtor misses a rent payment after filing for bankruptcy, the landlord \ncan immediately file a certification with the court that the payment \nhas not been received. It must also serve a copy of the certification \non the debtor, to make sure that the debtor is aware that the landlord \nintends to seek to have the stay lifted. After that certification is \nfiled and served, the debtor has 15 days to cure the default. The \nexemption from the stay will become effective 15 days after the \ncertification is filed and served, unless the court orders otherwise. \nAnd one reason for the court to order otherwise is that the rent has \nbeen paid.\n  This certification and expedited exemption process also applies to \nevictions based on property damage or illegal drug use. By giving \ndiscretion to the court to delay or stop the eviction proceeding from \ngoing forward, the amendment protects against these provisions being \nabused by landlords. We don't want landlords alleging property damage \nfor the most minor scratches on the wall in order to take advantage of \nthese expedited procedures.\n  The expedited procedures also apply to one other situation, which the \nSenator from Alabama raised during our consideration of this amendment \nin the Judiciary Committee. The Senator from Alabama sketched out a \nhypothetical situation where a landlord who has rented his or her own \nhouse or apartment to someone wants to move back in after the \nexpiration of the lease. Under the amendment that I offered in \ncommittee, the landlord could theoretically be prevented from moving \nback in to his or her own house if the tenant files for bankruptcy and \nkeeps paying rent.\n\n  I think the Senator from Alabama raised a good point in committee, so \nI have addressed it in this amendment. Again, the underlying goal is to \nallow tenants the benefits of the automatic stay as long as landlords \nare no worse off. In the usual case of a landlord who would simply rent \nto someone else after an eviction, renewed and continuous payment of \nrent after the bankruptcy filing protects the financial interests of \nthe landlord. But in the case sketched out by the Senator from Alabama, \nlandlords have other rights, namely the right to reoccupy their own \nhomes, that we need to protect as well.\n  So my amendment contains an additional circumstance in which a \nlandlord can seek expedited relief from the stay--when the lease has \nexpired according to its terms and the landlord intends to occupy the \nproperty after the eviction. Once again, the landlord must simply \ncertify that these circumstances exist and 15 days later, the stay is \nlifted, unless the tenant demonstrates to the court that the \ncertification is erroneous.\n  It should be remembered that this amendment does not effect the \nlandlord's ability to seek relief from the stay under the procedures \nprovided by current law. Expedited procedures are available for \nnonpayment of rent after filing for bankruptcy, for evictions based on \nproperty damage or drug use, or when a lease has expired and the \nlandlord wishes to reoccupy the property. For all other types of \nevictions, the landlord may continue to pursue remedies under current \nlaw.\n  As in so many parts of our debate on this bill, the main issue is \nbalance. To the extent there are abuses they should be addressed, but \nthe solutions should be narrowly targeted so that they do not eliminate \nthe rights of honest debtors who need the fresh start that bankruptcy \nis designed to provide. In this case, I truly believe that the solution \nis S. 625 for the problem that landlords say they are concerned about \ngoes too far. I am not comfortable with provisions that would kick \npeople out of their apartments even if they can pay rent during the \ntime that they are trying to get their financial house in order. To me \nthat is not constructive, it is punitive. It is not really helping \nlandlords, it is just punishing people who may be trying their very \nbest to keep their heads above water. Shame on us, if we can't see \nthat.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this modest and balanced amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2748 be \nlaid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in response to the remarks of the \nSenator from Wisconsin, I will not be able to support this amendment, \nalthough I do believe he has put some parts in it that\n\n[[Page S14369]]\n\nmake it superior to what had originally been offered in this regard.\n  I will share with Members some of the reasons I believe we need to \nreject this amendment and why this is a classic problem with the \ncurrent bankruptcy law that we need to fix. We haven't had a major \nreform of bankruptcy law since 1978. It is time for us to look at it to \nsee how it is working out in the real world. Are there abusers? Are \nthere loopholes, with clever lawyers zealously representing their \nclients able to utilize some of these loopholes and situations to abuse \nthe fair workings of the bankruptcy court?\n  Remember, a bankruptcy reform bill sets the law for an entire court. \nThat is the court that handles bankruptcy.\n  Senator Grassley's bill, with this amendment involving landlord/\ntenant that I helped sponsor, simply clarifies existing law. It simply \nmakes real and more effectual the existing law. The amendment offered \nby Mr. Feingold changes the current law; it moves us in a direction \nthat will enhance and encourage litigation and delay and undermine the \nrule of law as we ought to see it in the country. There are some good \nlawyers out there practicing bankruptcy law. That is all they do. They \nknow how to work the system and work it well.\n  Under current law, if a landlord files an eviction against a tenant \nbefore the bankruptcy petition is filed by the tenant, that eviction \ncan continue. If an eviction is filed by a landlord based on the fact \nthat his lease has terminated--he has a 1-year lease; we are now in \nmonth 14, he files to evict the tenant; he can't just go and throw him \nout physically--he files a lawsuit in State court to evict the tenant, \nhe will prevail in bankruptcy court. That is not the kind of action the \nbankruptcy court will permanently stay.\n  What is the problem? Why are we having a problem? The problem is that \nwhen a person files for bankruptcy, all litigation is stayed; there is \nan automatic stay. So if you file for bankruptcy in Federal court, any \nlawsuits filed against you in the State court system for collection of \nyour debts, including landlord/tenant, are automatically stayed. So \nwhat happens is, the landlord has to hire an attorney, send him down to \nFederal bankruptcy court, at great expense to himself, to file a motion \nand ask for a hearing to lift the stay and to say to that bankruptcy \njudge: Judge, we don't need you to stay this eviction case because the \nperson is clearly in violation of his lease; he hasn't paid his rent, \nand/or the lease is terminated. It is time for him to be removed from \nhis premises. He has to argue that.\n  Uniformly, the courts will rule in his favor, and he can then take \nthe matter to State court. In State court, the tenant has all the \nrights and privileges he has always had to defend himself against \neviction. He gets a hearing in court. He just doesn't get a double \nhearing in Federal court and State court.\n  This is a great cost to the landlords who have to go through this \nprocess. It also deals with landlords who have just a few apartment \ncomplexes or maybe just one and maybe the lease is coming up and they \ndon't want to just occupy the premises themselves. Maybe they have \nalready executed a lease with another tenant to take over this \napartment. All of a sudden they find the tenant won't leave under his \nlease. Then he files a petition in bankruptcy. The court stays the \nefforts to evict and months go by. That is the kind of problem we are \nhaving.\n\n  How does this abuse occur? We have seen advertisements and pulled \nthem from phone books and newspapers. Here is one: ``Seven months free \nrent.'' It goes on to talk about how you can file bankruptcy--it has 7 \ncalendar months here--and not be evicted for up to 7 months, even \nthough your lease may have already expired. You have a 12-month lease, \nand that means you can stay there 19 months by the time you can get \naround to getting somebody removed from the premises, when you may have \nalready agreed with your son, daughter, or some other possible tenant, \nthat they can take over the property at a given time.\n  The Feingold amendment, as I understand it, would protect the \nlandlord who wanted to move in himself but not from leasing it to \nsomebody else or letting a family member take over the property.\n  Here is another one to a tenant organization, a flier that was passed \nout: ``We have more moves, when it comes to preventing your eviction, \nthan Magic Johnson. Call us,'' the law firm says, ``and we will take \ncare of you.'' ``Need more time to move? Stop this eviction from 1 to 6 \nmonths.''\n  And there are others we have seen here, quite a number of those kinds \nof activities. So I say to you that this is not just an imagined \nproblem; it is very real. And still attorneys are advertising around \nthe country, and they are disrupting legitimate landlord-tenant \nsituations. It is an abuse.\n  Eventually, under the current law, when they go to bankruptcy court \nand ask that the stay be lifted so they can continue with their \neviction, they always win--but they always lose. They win on the law \neventually, but they lose because they have been delayed in taking \ncontrol of their own property and because they have had to pay an \nextensive legal fee. This is the kind of thing that is driving people \nmad who are dealing with bankruptcy on a regular basis. They are coming \nto us in Congress and saying: Jeff, these things are not healthy; they \nare frustrating, and they are hurting our ability to commercially \noperate in an effective way.\n  So how often does it happen? I would like to read a report from the \nLos Angeles County Sheriff's Office--just in one county in America. \nThis is what the L.A. County Sheriff's Office said. They estimate that \n3,886 residents--3,886--filed for bankruptcy in 1996 alone--in 1 year, \nin that county--to prevent the execution of a valid court-ordered \neviction notice. Think about that. You can even have won your eviction \ncase in court, and an order has been issued to have this person \nevicted, his or her lease is up, and this stay in bankruptcy stops \nthat.\n  It goes on to say that 7 percent of the eviction cases handled by the \nLos Angeles County sheriff's department are stayed as a result of \nbankruptcy filings. Losses are estimated at nearly $6 million per year. \nThey advertise in many of the publications ``Live Rent Free.'' That is \nreally what has been happening. ``More moves than Magic Johnson'' to \nprevent a legitimate execution of an eviction order.\n  Remember, we are not saying a landlord can just go remove somebody. \nEvery State has protection for renters. They have to go to court and \nget a valid eviction order. Many times, they are entitled to other \ndelays before they can be evicted. So I think that is significant.\n  Another matter that I think is important is the quote from a judge in \nthe Central District of California who is concerned about these cases. \nHe sees them very frequently. Judge Zurzolo in the Central District of \nCalifornia had this to say about bankruptcy and efforts to delay \neviction. This is a quote from his opinion in court:\n\n       The bankruptcy courts are flooded with chapter 7 and \n     chapter 13 bankruptcy cases filed solely for the purpose of \n     delaying unlawful detainer eviction. Inevitably and swiftly \n     following the filing of these bankruptcy cases is the filing \n     of motions for relief of stay by the landlords. They have \n     hired a lawyer and they have to file a motion for relief of \n     stay. These landlords are temporarily thwarted by this abuse \n     of the bankruptcy court system.\n\n  This judge calls it an abuse of the system. These relief from stay \nmotions are rarely contested and never lost. That is, the lawyer who \nfiled the bankruptcy rarely even contests them, and never are they \nruled against the landlord. It is never ruled against the landlord, but \nthey are filed and delay has already occurred. He says this:\n\n       Bankruptcy courts in our district hear dozens of these stay \n     motions weekly, none of which involve any justiciable \n     conflicts of fact and law.\n\n  So it is pretty clear. We have a national problem that ought to be \nfixed. We can fix it.\n  What does the current legislation, the bankruptcy reform bill, say \nabout it? It simply says that the automatic stay is not available when \nan eviction proceeding has already started prior to the filing of a \nbankruptcy. In other words, if the eviction has started before, you \ndon't get that stay. If an eviction proceeding is based on the fact \nthat the lease is already terminated, you don't get a stay. Otherwise, \nyou would have the same stay. This will stop a lot of wasted effort, a \nlot of unnecessary costs, a lot of frustration for tenants and those \nkinds of problems.\n\n[[Page S14370]]\n\n  I believe this law is good public policy--the way it is written in \nthe Grassley bankruptcy bill--because a bankruptcy court only has \ncontrol over the assets of the person filing bankruptcy. A lease that \nhas already expired, by its very definition, is not an asset. A lease \nthat has clearly been terminated because of nonpayment of rent is not \nan asset of the person who is filing bankruptcy. Therefore, the \nbankruptcy court does not have legal power to control an asset that is \nnot theirs; it is the landlord's. So that is why the courts always rule \nin favor of the landlord in these cases. The landlord may have another \ntenant who would want to take over, and that tenant's life may be \ndisrupted if the landlord can't deliver the premises.\n  In conclusion, the changes suggested in the Feingold amendment alter \ncurrent law substantially. They allow the tenant to stay in the \npremises on which the lease has expired and for which they have been in \ndefault for lack of payment, or other reasons. This is unacceptable, \nand it is not sound law. You ought not to have a law that says you can \nstay in the premises when the lease has expired, for Heaven's sake. \nThis would be the Federal bankruptcy court overruling State law that \nsays when your lease expires, you are out. If we can't have honesty in \nthe effectuation of contracts in America, we are in sad shape. I \nbelieve this is a poor amendment and it should not be approved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, 4 days ago, on November 5, the Senate \nForeign Relations East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee conducted \nits hearing on the Moseley-Braun nomination. Since it was a \nsubcommittee meeting and a hearing, I viewed it on television. I have a \nlong practice of giving chairmen and ranking members of our \nsubcommittees free rein in conducting their respective hearings. So I \nviewed the hearing on television, as I say, and it was a sight to \nbehold.\n  In fact, what it was was a political rally, lacking only a band and \nthe distribution of free hot dogs, soda pop, and balloons. Last night, \nthe full committee met briefly, almost informally, just outside the \nChamber here, and reported the nomination to the Senate, with one \ndissent. I will let you guess whose dissent that was.\n  Before I proceed further, I express the sincere hope that the \nnominee, when confirmed to serve as U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, \nwill serve diligently, effectively, and honestly. She will be \nrepresenting the United States, the country of all Americans. For the \nsake of our country, I pray there will be no further reports of \nirregularity involving her conduct. In short, I wish her well.\n  Before the book is closed on the scores of reports regarding the \nnominee's often puzzling service as a U.S. Senator, I decided a few \nfootnotes were in order. Many citizens from many States all over this \ncountry--principally, however, from the Chicago area--have contacted me \nduring the past few weeks. There have been expressions of puzzlement \nthat the President of the United States decided to reverse the clearly \nexpressed judgment of the people of Illinois in the 1998 election. \nSeveral speculated over the weekend that the Senate was about to rubber \nstamp the President's nomination to serve as U.S. Ambassador to New \nZealand. After all, the Illinois voters have made the judgment that \nserious charges of ethical misconduct by Senator Moseley-Braun \ndisqualified her from further representing them in the Senate. Now they \nsay the same Senate is preparing to declare she is qualified to \nrepresent all Americans abroad.\n  I think it important, therefore, that the people of Illinois --\nindeed, all Americans--be assured before the Senate proceeds that what \nthey are witnessing is by no means an absolution of Ms. Moseley-Braun. \nWhat the American people are witnessing is a successful coverup of \nserious ethical wrongdoing. I am not going to dwell this afternoon on \neach of the many serious charges that have been raised, such as the \ncontinuing mystery of who really paid for her numerous visits to \nNigerian dictator Sani Abacha or where Ms. Moseley-Braun's fiance, \nKosie Matthews, got the $47,000 downpayment on the Chicago condo. For \nthe record, Mr. Matthews was also her campaign manager and is now \nconveniently a missing man. Nobody knows where he is.\n  Whatever happened to the $249,000 the Federal Election Commission \ncannot account for her in her campaign? Or who was it exactly who paid \nfor several thousand dollars in airfare, luxury hotel bills, and \njewelry purchases during her 1992 trip to Las Vegas or the $10,000 in \njewelry she purchased on her 1992 trip to Aspen, CO?\n  In most cases, the Foreign Relations Committee and its legal officer \nwere unable to get to the bottom of these and other matters because Ms. \nMoseley-Braun has been hiding behind Mr. Matthews. Mr. Matthews, a \nSouth African native, has skipped the country and is nowhere to be \nfound.\n  My purpose today is not to go through the laundry list of Ms. \nMoseley-Braun's well-known ethical lapses but, rather, to focus on the \nClinton administration's culpability in all of this affair. Ms. \nMoseley-Braun was suspected of serious tax crime by the Internal \nRevenue Service following her 1992 campaign. According to a report in \nthe New Republic magazine, she had:\n\n     . . . a $6 million-plus war chest for her general election \n     campaign, only $1 million of which was spent on TV \n     advertising. Moreover, her campaign wound up $544,000 in \n     debt.\n\n  Where did this money go? The IRS wanted to find out, but the IRS' \nefforts to investigate allegations that Moseley-Braun had diverted an \nestimated $280,000 of those campaign funds for personal use and failed \nto report it as personal income, those allegations were blocked every \nstep of the way by the Clinton Justice Department.\n\n  In 1995, the Clinton Justice Department twice refused routine \nrequests by the IRS Criminal Tax Division to convene a grand jury to \ninvestigate the charges against Ms. Moseley-Braun. The IRS had credible \nevidence that, among other things, she had spent some $70,000 in \ncampaign funds on designer clothes, $25,000 on two jeeps, $18,000 on \njewelry, $12,000 on stereo equipment, and some $64,000 on luxury \nvacations in Europe, Hawaii, and Africa.\n  Without a grand jury, Government investigators were denied the \nsubpoena power to get at the key documents they had to have to prove \ntheir case. The Clinton Justice Department refused repeated requests to \nconvene a grand jury.\n  Refusing such a request is highly unusual, according to numerous \nformer IRS and Justice Department officials who made clear that the \nJustice Department's routine in such matters was to impanel grand \njuries so the IRS could continue gathering evidence. One former \nofficial with the Criminal Tax Division of the Justice Department, a \nMr. John Bray, called it virtually unheard of to deny such a request. A \nformer head of the Criminal Tax Division, Cono Namorato, commented:\n\n       They [that is to say, the IRS] don't need to show much. . . \n     . By and large, if it is requested, it is approved.\n\n  Another described the relationship between the Justice Department and \nthe IRS this way:\n\n       The Justice Department basically sees the IRS as their \n     client, and as their attorney they should do as requested.\n\n  But in Moseley-Braun's case, this routine request from the client was \ndenied, not once but twice.\n  Then the Foreign Relations Committee requested all of the documents \nfrom both IRS and the Department of Justice on this matter. Contrary to \ndeclarations by Ms. Moseley-Braun, the documents do not absolve her of \nwrongdoing. What the documents prove is that these serious allegations \nof ethical misconduct were never properly examined because the \ninvestigation was blocked by political appointees at the Justice \nDepartment, no doubt on instructions from the White House. \nInterestingly enough, the official at the Justice Department who made \nthe decision, Loretta Argrett, was a Moseley-Braun supporter who had \nmade a modest contribution to the Moseley-Braun\n\n[[Page S14371]]\n\n1992 campaign and who had a picture of Ms. Moseley-Braun on her office \nwall. Senator Moseley-Braun even presided over Ms. Argrett's \nconfirmation in 1993.\n  It is noteworthy that the White House had to spend more than a week \ndigging around in the bowels of the Justice Department to find the \ndocuments requested by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is \ncompelling evidence in and of itself because it demonstrates that the \nadministration failed to properly examine the charges against this \nnominee when the charges were presented by the IRS in 1995. Again, the \nadministration demonstrably failed even to review the charges in 1999 \nbefore sending her nomination up to the Senate.\n  It occurs to me that perhaps that was not unintentional. Perhaps the \nfolks in the administration knew exactly what they were doing. Perhaps \nthey hoped the spectacle of a public dispute between Jesse Helms and \nCarol Moseley-Braun would serve the base political interests of the \nClinton administration.\n  Well, Mr. President, I am not going to give them the spectacle they \nhave been hoping to provoke. It may be that history, in a strange way, \nis now repeating itself. It is of interest to me that back in 1943, the \nthen United States Senator Josiah William Bailey of North Carolina \nstrongly opposed a proposal that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nnominate FDR's press secretary, a former Raleigh newspaper editor named \nJonathan Daniels, as nominee to go--where? To New Zealand as United \nStates Ambassador. Jonathan Daniels was a son of Josephus Daniels who \nhad founded the Raleigh News and Observer many years earlier. Josephus \nonce served as Secretary of the Navy and had chosen Franklin D. \nRoosevelt to be his assistant. Later on Josephus Daniels served as \nAmbassador to Mexico, nominated by President Roosevelt.\n  Jonathan Daniels repeatedly pleaded with FDR to nominate him to be \nAmbassador to ``somewhere'' so that he could emulate his father \nJosephus, but FDR told Jonathan Daniels that he would nominate him to \nbe an Ambassador only if Jonathan persuaded Senator Bailey to approve \nthe nomination. The fly in the ointment was that Jonathan Daniels, \nprior to going to Washington as press aide to FDR, had written a series \nof abusive, mean editorials about Senator Bailey. Anyhow, Jonathan \ndecided that he had nothing to lose by going to Senator Bailey's office \nto plead his case. Senator Bailey flatly rejected the idea of Jonathan \nDaniels' going anywhere as Ambassador--and flat-out told Jonathan so. \nTo which Jonathan Daniels played his last card, pleading:\n\n       Well, Senator, I would have thought that you wouldn't mind \n     my being sent to New Zealand--it's on the other side of the \n     world, you know.\n\n  To which U.S. Senator Josiah William Bailey slowly shook his head and \nsaid:\n\n       Yes, and it ain't fur enough.\n\n  Mr. President, you are free to draw your own conclusion. I thank you, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer an amendment \non the bankruptcy bill, but in light of the statement that was just \nentered into the record by Senator Helms, in reference to my former \ncolleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, I am constrained to respond.\n  Let me say at the outset, I fully support President Clinton's \ndecision to nominate Senator Carol Moseley-Braun to continue to serve \nthis Nation as our Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. I was happy to \nappear before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee last Friday and to \nintroduce her. I believe she received a fair hearing that day, and \nthose of us who were there came away with the impression that, when her \nname is called to be appointed Ambassador, she will receive a strong \nbipartisan vote of the Senate. But I have to say some of the \nsuggestions that have been made in the previous statement at least need \nto be cleared up for the record.\n  Running for the Senate subjects you to all sorts of inquiry and \ninvestigation, not only by your opponent, who will look at you in the \nharshest terms, but by the press and any other inquiring mind. Those of \nus who subject ourselves to that process understand it is going to be \ntough. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has done that repeatedly throughout \nher career, running for offices at the legislative level, the county \nlevel, and twice as a statewide candidate in Illinois. Not surprisingly \nduring that period of time there have been many charges that have been \nthrown at her. Many of those charges were just repeated today on the \nfloor of the Senate. I might remind my colleagues in the Senate, they \nare just that. They are charges; they are not proven.\n  I might also say to my colleagues in the Senate, those who view this \nbody as somehow a closed club that takes care of its own ought to take \na look at what happened with this nomination, because what Senator \nCarol Moseley-Braun was subjected to during the course of this process \nis a standard which, frankly, may exceed a standard imposed on any \nother person who comes up for an ambassadorship to a post such as New \nZealand. In other words, she was subjected to more rigorous examination \nand questioning than virtually any person off the street nominated by \nthe President.\n  It may surprise some people to think a former United States Senator \nwould go through that process, but I am happy to report, as the Senate \nForeign Affairs Committee learned last Friday, after Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun went through an extensive background check at the request \nof the White House, after her campaign records were reviewed in detail, \nafter all the charges put in the Record on this floor were \ninvestigated, after the Internal Revenue Service and Department of \nJustice and FBI were called in and asked point blank if she was guilty \nof wrongdoing, they all concluded there was no proof of wrongdoing, and \nthey recommended her name to the President, who then submitted it to \nthe Senate.\n  Now we are in a position where many of those same charges, with no \nbasis in fact, have been repeated again on the Senate floor. That is \ntruly unfortunate. Let me address two of them. No. 1, as a Senator \nserving in this body, she visited Nigeria and a leader there of whom \nthe United States did not approve.\n  I will have to tell you I did not approve of that leader either, but \nno one has ever questioned the right of any Senator or any Member of \nthe House to decide to take foreign travel and visit a foreign leader \nwithout the approval of the State Department. I think, frankly, that is \nall well and good. When the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, \nSenator Helms, chose to visit General Pinochet in Chile, that was his \nright. Many people in the United States might question it, but I do not \nquestion his decision to do that. That is something for him to defend \nto the voters of North Carolina.\n\n  When my Governor in the State of Illinois decided 2 weeks ago to \nvisit with the dictator leader in Cuba, Fidel Castro, again it was his \nright. In fact, I supported his visit. I thought it was important.\n  So to bring up this red herring of a visit to Nigeria while she \nserved in the Senate is to hold Carol Moseley-Braun to a different \nstandard than we hold our own colleagues and other leaders across the \nNation. I don't think that is fair.\n  Second, on the talk about campaign finances and whether she misspent \nthem, the record of the committee tells the story. When an auditor came \nfrom the FEC and looked at detailed records from the Carol Moseley-\nBraun campaign in 1992 and went through the $8 million in expenditures \nin that campaign, they were able to identify $311 unaccounted for.\n  Mr. President, I make a great effort to try to have a full \naccounting, as required by law. I am sure every Senator does. But $311 \nout of $8 million? To make of that some sort of a disgrace or scandal \nis to exaggerate it beyond recognition. Those are the charges flung \nagain at Senator Carol Moseley-Braun on the Senate floor.\n  That is a sad occurrence and one which I wish had not occurred. \nFrankly, I hope the Members of the Senate, before we adjourn today, \nhave a chance to vote on giving our colleague a chance to serve because \nwe are not only sending an able representative to represent the United \nStates with one of our great allies, New Zealand, we are sending to New \nZealand evidence the American dream is still alive because\n\n[[Page S14372]]\n\nCarol Moseley-Braun--and I will readily concede she is not only my \nformer colleague but my friend--and her public life are a testament to \nwhat America stands for. Born in a segregated hospital facility in \nChicago, her mother, a medical technician in the same place, her father \na Chicago policeman, she worked her way through college to not only \nearn a degree but earn a law degree from the University of Chicago, to \nserve for 5 years as an assistant U.S. attorney and prosecutor, to \nbecome the first African American woman to ever serve as a member of \nthe leadership in the Illinois General Assembly, to become the first \nAfrican American woman ever elected countywide in Cook County, and the \nfirst African American woman in this century to be elected to the \nSenate.\n\n  Time and time again, every step of her life has crushed down another \nbarrier so that those who follow her will have a better opportunity.\n  Now she joins some four other African American women who serve as our \nAmbassadors should the Senate decide to give her that chance. As she \njourneys to New Zealand--and I hope she will soon--she will bring with \nher not only a wealth of public service but a story about how the \nAmerican dream can be realized if you believe in yourself and if you \nbelieve that equality is more than just a word--it is a principle which \nguides this great country.\n  I stand in strong support of Carol Moseley-Braun. I believe she will \nbe an excellent Ambassador, and I believe the vote that comes out of \nthis Chamber will be strong and bipartisan and put to rest, once and \nfor all, many of the charges and rumors which have been swirling around \nher nomination over the past several weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague, the Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator's 15 minutes are coming within the \nframework of our voting at 5 o'clock.\n\n[[Page S14373]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Illinois for their courtesy and the Senator from Nevada \nfor his diligent work in seeing we all get some time.\n  I am offering an amendment, along with the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Santorum, to do something very basic to the bankruptcy bill, and \nthat is to make credit card disclosure easier to find, easier to read, \nand easier to understand. I offer this amendment to achieve a goal I \nshare with the sponsors of this bill--seeing fewer American consumers \ndeclare bankruptcy.\n  I believe, however, that real bankruptcy reform must address one of \nthe root causes of consumer indebtedness, and that is, abusive consumer \ncredit industry practices. Having saturated the middle market, credit \ncard companies, of course, search ever harder for new users. Their \nsearch for new customers leads inevitably to those who have the least \nability to repay and are most likely to wind up mired in debt.\n  The Federal Reserve reports that credit card solicitations \nskyrocketed to a shocking $3.5 billion in 1998, a 15-percent increase \nfrom the previous year. That represents an average of 13 solicitations \nper year--more than one a month for every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States. That is 12 a year for every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States.\n  To reach these new customers, the credit card companies are in a race \nto the bottom oftentimes to come up with misleading marketing gimmicks \nand hidden fees.\n  The whole purpose of this bill is to say that those who get deeply \ninto debt should have to repay their debts, even if they are poor. I \nunderstand that. I do not agree with certain provisions of it, but I \nunderstand it. We can all agree that we ought to have full and broad \ndisclosure before someone signs up for a credit card so they do not get \nmired in that debt. That is not a Democratic or Republican principle, \nit is an Adam Smith free market principle: full information.\n  I am hopeful this bipartisan Schumer-Santorum amendment will meet the \napproval of this body and improve the bill.\n  Let me show my colleagues what is happening. Credit card accounts \nhave become more complicated than ever. Look at this credit card \nsolicitation. It is blown up significantly from its actual size. Count \nthe number of rates applicable to the account. There is a teaser rate, \n3.9 percent on introductory purchases and balance transfers. That is \nthe only thing that jumps out at you. An unknowing consumer, someone \nnot really trained in legalese, would think that is the annual rate, \nbut it is not. Here are the other rates mired in this very complicated \nlanguage: a 9.9 percent long-term rate on purchases and balance \ntransfers; 19.99 percent on cash advances; 9.99 penalty rate, 19 and 22 \npercent penalty rates on balances in the long run.\n  My colleagues, that is not disclosure; that is an advance math \nproblem on a college entrance exam. I have had a deep and abiding \ninterest in credit card disclosure.\n  In 1988, as a House Member, I authored the Fair Credit and Charge \nCard Disclosure Act. The act required that certain information about a \ncredit card account be disclosed: the annual percentage rate, the \nannual fee, the minimum finance charge, the method of computing the \nbalance for purchases.\n  The act required that this amendment be disclosed in a table, the so-\ncalled Schumer box. By putting the information in the table and \nmandating the table be prominently disclosed, the hope was consumers \nwould be able to understand what the costs of credit truly were. But \ninstead of clarity, they got obfuscation. Because of how the Federal \nReserve has interpreted the table, disclosure provisions to the Fair \nCredit and Charge Card Disclosure Act, the result has not been \ndisclosure, but a hide-the-rate shell game.\n\n  Again look at this chart. The only number that stands out is 3.9 \npercent, and on the solicitation in big white letters on the front is \n3.9 percent. If you were looking at this, you would think you are \ngetting a 3.9-percent credit card; 3.9 is the only number in big \nletters. If you read all the little fine print on the inside, you will \nsee the rate is 10 percent, 19 percent, even 22 percent.\n  We must correct this. We have seen the disclosure box can be stashed \naway in places far from prominent--the back page or accompanying scrap \nof paper. We see the disclosure box can appear in font sizes so small \nit is virtually unreadable. The disclosure box that appears on these is \nblown up significantly. In the actual solicitation, the letters are so \nsmall that even with my 48-year-old eyes, and getting older every \nminute, I cannot read them.\n  Finally, we have seen the box disclosure rate of information has \nturned out to be a mess. The so-called Schumer box, of which I was \nproud when it first passed, has not helped the consumer as much as \nintended. The amendment that Senator Santorum and I are offering will \nrestructure the existing disclosure box in the following way:\n  First, it will create a large, readable, 24-point font table solely \nfor the long-term annual percentage rate for purchases. This is the old \ncard, where all you see is the introductory rate in big letters. This \nis the new rate, and it is easily seen, 9.99 percent, which would be \nthe annual rate. If there is a teaser rate, a so-called introductory \noffer rate that is very low, that could be on the credit card, but you \ndo not need a college education or calculus to see the annual rate. It \nis very important.\n  Second, beneath the table disclosing the long-term annual percentage \nrate for purchases, it would mandate another table in standard 12-point \nfont that discloses such items as the grace period for repayment, \nannual fees, minimum finance charges, transaction fees, and other items \nthat are not required to appear in any disclosure box under current \nlaw--cash advance fees, late fees, and over-the-credit limit fees.\n  Finally, beneath this second table there would be full disclosure on \nall rates applicable to the credit card account. The poster shows the \ndifference. This one looks as if you have a 3.9-percent rate; this one, \nthe annual rate. Again, we are not limiting the consumer. We are simply \nproviding information. This is good old Adam Smith American \ncompetition, and companies will compete for people based on who has the \nbest rates.\n  It is fair to say consumers will be better off under my amendment, in \nterms of understanding the true costs of credit.\n  Senator Santorum and I believe that disclosure is the way to go, not \nputting a cap on, not putting limits on, but simply disclosure--but \nreal disclosure--so that people could understand this.\n  It will fit on an 8\\1/2\\ by 11 sheet. We do not want the credit card \ncompanies to be able to say that it is difficult to put this together. \nAll this information, including the large ``9.9 percent,'' is on an \neasily understandable sheet.\n  It is a shame we have to resort to putting font sizes into \nlegislation, but if you look at the old ``Schumer box,'' with all the \nlegalese, you will know that we need it.\n  Armed with better information, consumers will avoid some of the \nfinancial missteps that can send them into bankruptcy. That is a goal \nwe all share.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment proposed by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, and myself. I urge that we \ncould come together, in a bipartisan way, on an amendment that makes \ngood sense, that improves the legislation. And then if someone falls \ninto bankruptcy--which we hope does not happen--at the very least it \nwould mean they knew what they were getting into.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left on the 15 minutes that \nhave been yielded to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. President, I reserve that 6 minutes to wait for the Senator from \nPennsylvania to come speak and for me to conclude.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand that the Senator from Illinois has yielded \n4 minutes to me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2754\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I add my support for the amendment that \nhas been offered by the Senator from\n\n[[Page S14374]]\n\nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, to address the explosion of credit card debt \nbecause students on college campuses are offered credit cards. The \namendment, as has been outlined, prohibits credit card companies from \ngiving an individual under the age of 21 a credit card unless the young \nperson has income sufficient to repay the debt or a parent or a \nguardian, or other family member over the age of 21, to share the \nliability for the credit card.\n  The point has been made, but I think it needs to be underlined, that \nwhen you get right behind this whole issue, what is happening is that \nthe credit card companies are making these credit cards so available to \nyoung people who are attending college that the credit cards are \neffectively irresistible. The amount of debt that is being run up by \nthese students is escalating into significant figures. What inevitably \nhappens is that the parents are required, by one reason or another, to \nassume the debt obligation. That is the background, really, on why \nthese efforts are being made by the credit card companies.\n  What isn't so evident is the kind of turmoil, anxiety, and depression \nthat surrounds this whole atmosphere of student debt. What we found, in \nthe course of the hearings on the Judiciary Committee, in a number of \nthe different presentations that were made while considering the \nbankruptcy legislation, is that it isn't only the financial obligations \nthat were assumed, but that many of the young people, who had stellar \nacademic records, who were outstanding students in all forms of \nbehavior, who were actually seduced by these credit card obligations \nand responsibilities, when they found they were unable to free \nthemselves from these kinds of obligations, went into severe depression \nand into adverse behavior, where the students had tensions in their \nrelationships with their parents, assuming an entirely different \nchapter in their development. And this is something that is happening \nwith increasing frequency across this country.\n\n  The kind of recommendations that the Senator from Connecticut has \noutlined in the amendment is a very modest and reasonable way of \naddressing the excesses of this particular phenomenon taking place. \nThis is the place to be able to do it.\n  I welcome the chance to join with Senator Dodd in urging that this \nparticular amendment be adopted. It makes a great deal of sense in \nterms of the young students in this country. It makes a great deal of \nsense in terms of their parents, most of whom are hard working, decent \nparents who get caught up in these obligations, assuming the debts of \ntheir children. It puts an extraordinary burden on them as well.\n  This is a winner for the students and for their parents and for more \nsensible and responsible bankruptcy legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2659 And 2661, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2659, regarding credit counseling, and amendment No. \n2661, regarding prescreening for debtors between 100 and 150 percent of \nmedian income, and to immediately set them aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2659 and 2661, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2659\n\n   (Purpose: To modify certain provisions relating to pre-bankruptcy \n                         financial counseling)\n\n       On page 18, line 5 insert ``(including a briefing conducted \n     by telephone or on the Internet)'' after ``briefing''.\n       On page 19, line 15, strike ``petition'' and insert \n     ``petition without court approval.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2661\n\n (Purpose: To establish parameters for presuming that the filing of a \n    case under chapter 7 of title 11, United States Code, does not \n                  constitute an abuse of that chapter)\n\n       On page 7, between line 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     ``unless the conditions described in clause (iA) apply with \n     respect to the debtor.\n       ``(iA) the product of the debtor's current monthly income \n     multiplied by 12--\n       ``(I)(aa) exceeds 100 percent, but does not exceed 150 \n     percent of the national or applicable State median household \n     income reported for a household of equal size, whichever is \n     greater; or\n       ``(bb) in the case of a household of 1 person, exceeds 100 \n     percent but does not exceed 150 percent of the national or \n     applicable State median household income reported for 1 \n     earner, whichever is greater; and\n       ``(II) the product of the debtor's current monthly income \n     (reduced by the amounts determined under clause (ii) (except \n     for the amount calculated under the other necessary expenses \n     standard issued by the Internal Revenue Service and clauses \n     (iii) and (iv) multiplied by 60 is less than the greater of--\n       ``(aa) 25 percent of the debtor's nonpriority unsecured \n     claims in the case; or\n       ``(bb) $15,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are set \naside.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining on the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 30 seconds for that side; 11 \nminutes for Senator Grassley.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2521\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Shortly the Members of the Senate will have a chance to \nvote on an amendment to which I hope they will give consideration. It \nis an amendment which addresses a segment of the credit industry which \nrepresents the bottom feeders. These are the people who prey on the \nvulnerable in society. These are the people who try to ensnare \nvulnerable, frail, elderly, and sick people into literally signing over \nthe only thing they own on Earth--their homes.\n  You have seen the cases. You have read about them in the papers and \nseen the exposes on television. They find a widow living alone in her \nhome. They come in and want to sell her some siding or a new roof or \nnew furnace. The next thing you know, she has a second mortgage on her \nhome. The terms of the mortgage are outrageous. She finds herself \nlosing the only thing she has left on Earth--her home. These are so-\ncalled ``equity predators.''\n  I salute the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, who is the manager of \nthis bill on the Republican side, because he had a hearing in March of \n1998 of the Special Committee on Aging of the Senate that was dedicated \nexclusively to this outrage in the credit industry, that these people \nwould come in and prey on so many vulnerable people.\n  Let me quote Senator Grassley. I do not know if I have his \npermission, but I did give him notice that I would read this from the \nhearing. He said:\n\n       Before we begin, I want to quote a victim--a quote that in \n     my mind sums up what we are all talking about here today. She \n     said the following: ``They did what a man with a gun in a \n     dark alley could not do. They stole my house.''\n\n  That is what is happening, time and again, when these unscrupulous \ncreditors and lenders prey on the elderly and people who are less \neducated and end up taking something away from them that they have \nsaved for their entire lives.\n  What does my amendment do? My amendment says that if this plays out, \nif they end up ensnaring some poor person into their trap, so that they \nstand to lose their home, and ultimately that person has to go bankrupt \nbecause of this unscrupulous lender, when they go to bankruptcy court, \nthat same equity creditor cannot take away their home. If that person \ndid not follow the law that requires full disclosure and fair treatment \nof people who are loaned money, they cannot come to bankruptcy court \nand end up with the deed to the home of an elderly widow. I think that \nis simple justice. It was a question before this Senate today as to \nwhether or not, when we talk about abuses by those filing for \nbankruptcy, we will be equally outraged by abuses by creditors such as \nthese predatory lenders who use our legal system and our bankruptcy \ncourt to literally push through processes that take away from people \nthings they have saved for their entire life. They are serial credit \npredators. They prey on the elderly, the less educated, the frail, and \nthe vulnerable. They are the bottom feeders in the credit industry. My \namendment will give my colleagues in the Senate a chance to tell them \nonce and for all, stop this devious conspiracy to go after the elderly \nin America.\n\n  How many people are affected by this? So many that in the State of \nCalifornia they have set up a special\n\n[[Page S14375]]\n\nfraud unit to go after these predatory lenders.\n  I am sad to report that as I stand here today, many reputable lenders \nare opposing my amendment. What does that say about them? If they are \nopposing my amendment to go after the bad guys, how does that reflect \non the good guys in this business? I don't think it tells a very good \nstory.\n  The groups supporting my amendment include the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, the Consumers Union, National Consumer Law Center, the U.S. \nPublic Interest Research Group, the UAW, and others who have decided, \nas I have, that we should put an end to this once and for all, as is \nstated in their letter in support of my amendment: As consumers who \nreceive these loans are commonly forced into bankruptcy, it is \nessential to create a bankruptcy remedy that protects debtors and other \nhonest creditors from the predators who seek to enforce these loans.\n  Let me give a couple examples of these loans. Lillie Coleman is a \nresident of New City in Illinois, 68 years old, living on a pension. In \ncomes a person who says: I'll tell you what I will do, Ms. Coleman. I \nknow you own a house. I will consolidate all your debts, and I will \nlend you $5,000 for home improvement. The next thing you know, she has \nsigned a $65,000 mortgage on the home she owned and had worked for for \na lifetime. The next thing you know, they are holding these closings \nwithout inviting her. They are not giving her the papers to sign. They \nhave broker's fees that were never disclosed to her. They find out that \nchecks that were supposed to go to her creditors aren't going to \ncreditors. They are finding out basically that there is money missing.\n  There sits Ms. Coleman with a second mortgage on her home and the \nprospect of losing her home in her retirement at the age of 68. Those \nare the people we are talking about. Those are the folks knocking on \nthe doors, ringing the telephone off the hook night and day, sending \nall these luring mailings to people saying: You can just sign the back \nof this little check, and the next thing you know, there will be money \nin your hand.\n  The next thing you know, there is a new mortgage on your home. And if \nyou miss a payment or if you don't understand the terms, you could lose \nit.\n  It didn't just happen in Illinois. It happens all over the place. In \nfact, it has happened in Utah, two or three cases of balloon payments. \nDo you know what a balloon payment is? You make the regular monthly \npayments; everything is going along fine. There is a small clause in \nthe contract that says: At one point in time you had better come up \nwith $49,000 or you lose your home. That is a balloon payment. Many \nborrowers don't know the details, particularly if they are folks who \nare elderly. They don't see well. They may not hear well. They think \nthey are doing the right thing. They, of course, have the legal \ncapacity to sign a contract. The next thing you know, they end up with \ntheir home on the line. They may end up in bankruptcy court.\n\n  What I am saying with this amendment is, we are not going to give \nthem a chance to use the bankruptcy courts of America as a fishing \nexpedition for the well-earned assets of American families.\n  This amendment was part of the bankruptcy bill we passed last year \n97-1. If there is anybody sitting on the floor saying this idea is way \ntoo radical, they voted for it last year. They voted for it last year \n97-1. It is something that should be part of this bill.\n  If you are outraged by the lawyers who are ripping off the system, as \nI see my friend, the Senator from Alabama, on the floor, who brings \nthis up regularly, if you are outraged by those who go to bankruptcy \ncourt who shouldn't be there, share your outrage when it comes to these \npredatory lenders. Join me in passing an amendment that tells them once \nand for all, you can't use our legal system to continue this deceptive \nscheme.\n  We have found in the course of researching this matter that there are \nseveral different approaches these predatory lenders use. They engage \nin practices where they lend somebody money far beyond their ability to \nrepay. They know going in, with a borrower of limited savings and \nequity in a home, that they can put that borrower on the spot where, in \na short period of time, they are going to default.\n  We know as well that they try to make an arrangement saying: I will \ntell you what, we will put the siding on the home. We will make the \ndirect payments to the home contractor, and don't you worry about it. \nThe next thing you know, they have signed the mortgage, the home \ncontractor is not paid, and the poor widow finds herself being \nassaulted in every direction by those who expect to be paid and finds \nherself in bankruptcy court.\n  They impose illegal fees, such as prepayment penalties or increased \ninterest rates at default. They impose balloon payments due in less \nthan 5 years. We have a group of people who are gaming the system at \nthe expense of the most vulnerable people in America.\n  This amendment does not add any additional requirements to current \nlaw. It says that those who want to lend money have to themselves obey \nthe law. If you want to stand for law and order when it comes to \nsomebody coming into bankruptcy court, a debtor who can no longer pay \ntheir debts, if you want to establish new and higher standards for them \nso that they don't rip off the system, for goodness' sake, show some \nheart when it comes to those who are in bankruptcy court through no \nfault of their own. They are elderly people who signed onto the \ncontract, and the next thing you know the only thing they own on Earth \nis at risk.\n  I have considered this amendment. I have read the transcripts of \nhearings, particularly the one from Senator Grassley's Committee on \nAging. I have read some testimony there that I think says it all. But \nSenator Grassley's own words really put this in context. In March of \n1988, he said as follows:\n\n       What exactly are we talking about when we say that equity \n     predators target folks who are equity-rich and cash-poor? \n     These folks are our mothers and our fathers, our aunts and \n     our uncles, and all people who live on fixed incomes. These \n     are people who oftentimes exist from check to check and \n     dollar to dollar, and who have put their blood, sweat and \n     tears into buying a piece of the American dream, and that \n     is their own home.\n\n  Senator Collins of Maine at the same hearing noted, I think \naccurately, that we need higher legal standards for those who provide \nfinancial services to senior citizens. Let me remind the Senate, I \ndon't impose a higher legal standard here. I only say that those who \nwant to take advantage of the bankruptcy court have to come in with \nclean hands. If they have been guilty of misuse of the law, dereliction \nof duty, or violation of the law, they should not be allowed to \nrecover.\n  Senator Larry Craig, a Republican of Idaho, said at the same hearing: \nThere are many loopholes found in existing protection laws which can \nand are easily exploited by these creditors. Statements by Senator Enzi \nand so many of my colleagues attest to the fact that they know that in \nevery State in the Union these smoothies are at work.\n  The question today before the Senate is what we will do about it. \nThese low-life lenders who give the Merchant of Venice credit standards \na good name are the people who will be protected if the Durbin \namendment is defeated.\n  I hope if we are going to hold to a high standard those seeking \nrelief in bankruptcy court, that we start with those who have been \nshown time and time again to have taken advantage of the system.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the Democratic side has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we have before us this afternoon is a \nperfect example of what can happen when a bankruptcy bill is on the \nfloor, and Members are offering amendments that have nothing to do with \nbankruptcy law but everything to do with banking.\n  We have two amendments before us, and I have a short period of time, \nso I'll make my points briefly.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Durbin basically attempts to enforce \nthe truth-in-lending law--which has many remedies under current banking \nlaw, including damages, including class action suits--through a new \nmechanism, the bankruptcy courts.\n\n[[Page S14376]]\n\n  What is the practical import of all this, and why is this opposed by \nvirtually everybody who is involved in mortgage lending?\n  Basically, it is a violation of truth in lending to lend money to \nsomeone who is not capable of paying it back. So, if we change the \nlaw--if we change permanent banking law as part of this bankruptcy \nbill--to say that if a borrower can prove that someone violated the \nTruth in Lending Act, then he doesn't have to pay back his mortgage \nloan when he's in bankruptcy, what is going to happen?\n  What is going to happen is that everybody in bankruptcy who has a \nmortgage loan is going to file a lawsuit claiming, Well, obviously, I \nam bankrupt, so the lender should have known I could not pay this loan \nback; therefore, under the Durbin amendment, I should not have to pay \nit back.\n  This is an absurd amendment that would undercut truth in lending, \nwhich has more enforcement powers than most other lending laws in \nAmerica, by literally creating a situation where every deadbeat would \nfile a lawsuit saying: I have gone bankrupt because I have spent my \nmoney. I have not paid my bills, and because I have gone bankrupt, it \nis the bank's fault; therefore, I should be able to default on my \nmortgage. Which would mean that every honest person in America who pays \ntheir bills, who sacrifices and saves their money and pays off their \nmortgage, will end up paying a higher rate of interest.\n  So I hope our colleagues will roundly defeat this amendment. It has \nabsolutely nothing to do with bankruptcy law, and everything to do with \nbanking law, and it should not even be considered.\n  The second amendment I want to mention is paternalism at its worst, \nand that is the amendment of my dear friend, Senator Dodd, which would \nrequire students between the ages of 18 and 21 to get parental consent \nin order to be issued a credit card.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that college students who are 18 and \nolder are adults under Federal law for purposes of credit. This \namendment would therefore be a violation of the Federal Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act, which prohibits the use of age on a discriminatory \nbasis against anyone over 18 years of age.\n  The second point I want to make is that this concern about the danger \nof students having credit cards is based on a myth. Fifty-nine percent \nof all college students in America pay their balance in full at the end \nof the month. But only 40 percent of the general population pays their \nbalance in full. Eighty-six percent of students pay their credit cards \nwith their own money, not with their parents' money. The plain truth is \nthat college students are better credit card risks than the general \npopulation. It is obvious that if you are dealing with people who are \nhighly motivated, highly disciplined, successful college students, you \nwant them to become your customer because they are going to go out and \nmake a lot of money and become very profitable customers. The idea that \nwe would be engaged in this sort of paternalism, which would require \nevery student in America, even though it is against the law for the \nbank to discriminate against them if they are over 18--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will yield the Senator 1 more minute, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania 2 minutes, and the Senator from Alabama 3 \nminutes. That will be the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas may continue for \nanother minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the idea that we in the U.S. Congress are \ngoing to pass a law that takes adults, under our Federal credit \nstatutes, and force them to go back to their parents in order to get a \ncredit card, when the credit behavior of students is superior to the \ngeneral population, is simply an outrage. Our Democrat colleagues \ncannot get it right. When we debated the banking bill, they were \nconcerned that banks wouldn't lend money to people who are needy. But \nwhen we are debating the bankruptcy bill, it is the bank's fault for \nlending too much money to people who are needy. They can't quite get it \nstraight. I guess it varies depending on which bill are considering. \nBoth of these amendments should be roundly defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nhis amendment dealing with disclosure--as the Senator from New York \ntalked about in his remarks--on credit card solicitations, as to what \nthe real interest rate is that is going to be involved and all the \nother information that is necessary for consumers to make intelligent \ndecisions as to whether to contract with a credit card company.\n  All of us get solicitations--I do every day--in the mail offering \noutrageously low rates of interest. I have looked through them and it \nis very difficult, even for somebody who is somewhat sophisticated in \nlooking at this information, to find what the true interest rate is and \nthe true terms of the credit card for which you may be signing up.\n  What the amendment of the Senator from New York does is put it in an \nobvious place, in clear and bold type, in a box, in a format that \npeople are used to using, as a result of his legislation from a few \nyears ago with respect to credit card statements. This would make it \napplicable to applications and to solicitations. I think it is a \nconstructive amendment, a disclosure-oriented amendment. It is not \nsomething I think is unduly burdensome and it can be helpful to \neverybody, not just seniors and the others who may have difficulty \nreading the small print and understanding very complex legal documents \nbut also the average consumer who wants to be able to make intelligent \ndecisions. And what we are looking at in this bill is the failures as a \nresult of credit card overpayments, as a result of decreased savings \nrates. This is the kind of commonsense type of thing we ought to be \nsupporting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know some young people get in trouble \nby overspending their credit cards. A lot of adults get in trouble for \nthat. The fact is, I don't believe we, as part of an effort to reform \nthe bankruptcy court, need to be, at this moment, offering amendments; \nthat ought to be done in the Banking Committee. There have been \ncomplaints about the fact that credit card solicitations are mailed out \nto people. Let me say this: We have had a banking bill in which Members \nhave been outraged that banks won't loan to high-risk people, and they \nare complaining about not making enough loans. It is odd, striking, and \nshocking to me that poor people are being told they ought not to be \neven offered credit cards. Some say they are being mailed credit cards. \nNot so. It is a Federal law, a crime, and it is prohibited to mail \ncredit cards unrequested to somebody. What they are receiving is offers \nof credit cards. They have to fill out forms and show their income and \nall that, and they may or may not get it once they fill it out. But to \nsay you can't even offer a person below the poverty level a credit card \nis amazing to me. Credit cards are good for poor people.\n  If somebody has a credit card and his tire blows up and he needs a \nset of tires for his car and doesn't have $200 cash, what is he going \nto do, park it until he can save up the money? With a credit card, he \ncan do that and pay it off as he can. Credit cards are valuable things \nfor poor people, for heaven's sake.\n  For young people, we have this vision that an 18-year-old at college \nwho is being funded by mama runs up a big debt on his credit card. The \ntruth is, a lot of people are not doing that. A lot of people who are \n18, 19, and 20 years old will be affected by this legislation, and they \nmay be married, out on their own, going to college during the night, \nand working during the day. They have to get mama and daddy to sign on \nbefore they can even get the credit card they may need to help them \nthrough the unexpected expenses that may occur for them.\n\n  The suggestion that somehow poor people are being oppressed by being \noffered credit cards is beyond my comprehension. In fact, one of the \ngood things that is occurring is that we are seeing some competition \nnow. Rates are coming down. People have alternatives. They can cancel a \ncard and get a better card.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \nDurbin amendment No. 2521.\n\n[[Page S14377]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is the Durbin amendment the first vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, \nSenator Durbin and whoever wants to close on that side have 2 minutes, \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no unanimous consent agreement to \nthat effect.\n  Mr. REID. Based on what we have done in the past, Senators have been \nexpecting that. I ask unanimous consent that on this amendment and the \nother, there be 4 minutes evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, does that also apply to the \nDodd amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was also an agreement on the Dodd \namendment.\n  The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2521\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment was enacted by the Senate \nas part of the bankruptcy bill last year. The bill received a vote of \n97-1. It imposes no new legal duties on creditors or lenders but says \nthey must follow the law if they want to take advantage of the law.\n  We are talking about equity creditors, lenders who prey on people who \nare disabled, elderly, vulnerable, and less educated. Folks on a fixed \nincome with a home end up with a new mortgage because they wanted \nsiding on their home or a new roof and several months or years later \nfind out they are about to lose the last thing they have on Earth--\ntheir home--because of unscrupulous practices by these creditors.\n  The bottom line is this: If we are going to have rules in this \nsociety for borrowers, we should also have rules for creditors. The \nrules are called the law. If they do not follow the law, they can be \nthrown out of bankruptcy court if they are a borrower. If they do not \nfollow the law and the Durbin amendment passes, they will be thrown out \nof the court because they have been guilty of unscrupulous credit \npractices, taking advantage of the elderly.\n  All the Senators on the floor who have lamented the scandalous \nbehavior of these creditors in the past have a chance now to vote for \nan amendment to tell them once and for all that their low-life tactics \nare unacceptable in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have a truth-in-lending law. It is \nvigorously enforced with many remedies, including damages in class \naction lawsuits.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment would make bankruptcy courts, which have \nno jurisdiction over truth in lending whatsoever, an enforcement \nmechanism of the truth-in-lending law. This produces an absurd \nsituation. Under truth in lending, the lender has an obligation to make \nsome assessment about the borrower's ability to pay. Under this \namendment, everyone who is in default or in bankruptcy will be able to \nargue that the bank should have known that the lender could not pay the \nloan back and therefore the mortgage should be forgiven.\n  The net result is that hard-working, frugal people who save money and \npay their debts would end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars, \nbillions of dollars, in additional interest costs to cover people who \nwould file lawsuits claiming, ``Well, I went broke and it's the bank's \nfault, and therefore I shouldn't have to pay my mortgage.''\n  This amendment should be defeated. Giving one court, which has no \njurisdiction over the pertinent law, the ability to enforce that law, \nwhich rightly belongs in another court, is, I think, a gross violation \nof logic and the basic structure of the legal system. This is a bad \namendment that will produce an even worse situation where honest people \nwho pay their debts will end up paying higher interest rates for people \nwho don't pay their debts.\n  I move to table the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next two \nvotes be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2754\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 4 \nminutes equally divided prior to the vote on or in relation to the Dodd \namendment No. 2754.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Dodd and I have proposed an \namendment to address the explosion of credit card debt offered to \nstudents on college campuses.\n  The amendment prohibits a credit card company from giving an \nindividual under the age of 21 a credit card unless the young person \nhas income\n\n[[Page S14378]]\n\nsufficient to repay the debt or a parent, guardian, or other family \nmember over the age of 21 shares liability for the credit card. Credit \ncard applications and solicitations must disclose this information to \npotential consumers.\n  This amendment is particularly appropriate during debate on \nbankruptcy reform legislation. We know that credit card debt may not be \nthe sole factor leading to bankruptcy, but for many individuals it is a \nsignificant contributing factor.\n  Congress should be particularly concerned that since 1991, there has \nbeen a 50-percent increase in bankruptcy filings by those under the age \nof 25. In many cases, these are young men and women who are just \nestablishing their independence--and just starting to build a credit \nhistory. Poor financial decisions, especially credit card mismanagement \ncan have long-term implications.\n  We know the siren song of the credit card industry is loud and clear. \nIn 1998, credit card issuers sent out 3.45 billion credit card \nsolicitations to people of all ages, including college students and \nothers who may not have the ability to repay their debts. In fact, \nFirst USA recently issued a credit card to 3-year old Alessandra \nScalise. Alessandra's mother said she accurately completed and mailed \nin the preapproved credit card application as a joke. There was no \nSocial Security number or income listed and Alessandra's occupation was \nlisted as ``preschooler.'' Apparently, this didn't make a difference to \nFirst USA. Alessandra received a Platinum Visa with a $5,000 credit \nlimit.\n  This incident may be attributable to ``human error'' but there are \nnumerous examples of irresponsible lending practices by credit card \nissuers--especially when they lend to students who don't have the \ncapacity to repay their debts.\n  For example, one Discover platinum card issuer's terms of \nqualification require a minimum household income of $15,000 unless you \nare a full-time student. Discover explains that an individual either \nhas to have a $15,000 minimum income or needs to prove that they are a \nfull-time student. Student applications are rejected only if they have \na bad credit history--a prior bankruptcy filing, for example--or if \ntheir student status can not be confirmed.\n  During a February 1998 Banking Subcommittee hearing, Senator Sarbanes \nasked credit card issuers how they determined student income. Bruce \nHammonds, senior vice chairman and chief operating officer of MBNA \nCorporation responded if a student has a loan, ``that means they do not \nhave to pay tuition in most cases and we are looking at that tuition \npayment. Then we would not count the tuition payment against them with \ntheir income and expense analysis.'' In other words, the company \nignores the reality of tuition and views a student loan as ``free'' \nmoney--an income stream that can be used to repay credit care debt.\n  Not surprisingly, credit card companies have unleashed a well-\norganized and pervasive campaign to attract student consumers. Credit \nis available to almost any college student--no income, no credit \nhistory, and no parental signature required. The National Bankruptcy \nReview Commission received an advertisement for a 2-day workshop for \ncreditors entitled, ``Competing in the Sub Prime Credit Card Market,'' \nincluding a presentation entitled, ``Targeting College Students: Real \nLife 101,'' with tips on how to ``target the money makers of \ntomorrow.''\n  Students are targeted by the industry the moment they step on to a \ncollege campus. Applications are placed in their book bags at the \nstudent store, and tempting gifts and bonuses and low teaser rates are \nused to entice them to send in the application. The American Express \nCard for College Students has a teaser rate of 7.75 percent for the \nfirst 90 days, then it more than doubles to 15.65 percent. Perks \ninclude Continental Airlines travel vouchers. The Citibank College Card \nfor Students initial rate is 8.9 percent for 9 months and then it \nskyrockets to 17.15 percent. The incentive? Eight American Airlines \ntravel coupons.\n\n  Brian is a student at the University of Minnesota. He said,\n\n       They gave me a free T-shirt and a water bottle to apply for \n     their credit cards. My clever plan? To sucker them out of \n     their prizes and cut up the cards. $4,000 later . . . I \n     stopped spending . . . In my glory days, I was like King \n     Midas, pointing to things and turning them into my own . . . \n     For me, the worst temptation was food . . . While listening \n     to tunes on your new stereo and munching take out food, the \n     monthly payment seems easy to pay, especially when you can \n     get a cash advance to cover it.\n\n  The ads are tempting, too. One ad directly targeting students reads: \n``Free from parental rule at last. Now all you need is money. Cha-\nChing! Get 3 percent cash back on everything you buy.''\n  The Internet is the new frontier for credit card advertising to \nstudents. When a student clicks on ``www.studentcreditcard.com'' he or \nshe finds a treasure trove of shopping offers and discounts, as well as \nthe assurance of 3 percent cash back. Students are told that, ``It's \ntotally simple. Spend $200 on an item with your card and you have an \nextra six bucks in your pocket. Spend another $400, that's $12. It adds \nup fast when you use The Associates Student Credit Card for all your \npurchases.''\n  The web site includes some information on establishing a good credit \nrecord, but nothing compared to the bonuses and incentives for student \nconsumers.\n  Not surprisingly, college students respond to solicitation by credit \ncard companies. A recent study by Nellie Mae found that 60 percent of \nundergraduates have credit cards and 21 percent have 4 or more cards. \nThe median credit card debt among students is $1,200 and 9 percent of \nstudents have debt between $3,000 and $7,000. Five percent of students \nhave credit card debt exceeding $7,000.\n  Other studies replicate similar findings. A June 1998 national survey \nby the Education Resources Institute--``Credit Risk or Credit \nWorthy''--found that 55 percent of students obtained their first card \nduring their first year of college and a significant proportion \nreceived their first credit card while still in high school.\n  The study argues that many students use credit cards reasonably, but \nthe facts and statistics are disturbing. Fifty-two percent of students \nsay that one of the most important reasons to have a credit card is to \n``build a credit history'' and 45 percent say it's to use in an \nemergency, but the survey shows that 77 percent of all student credit \ncard purchases were for ``routine personal expenses''--a category that \nmay include a wide-range of items.\n  While attending Villanova, Meghan charged $15,000 on her credit \ncards. When she and her friends first applied for the cards they \ndecided to keep them for emergencies, only. But, according to Meghan, \nthey would ``end up buying things . . . or taking cash advances just to \nlive on.'' Meghan planned to get a job to pay off her debt, but that \ndidn't happen. Instead, her mother paid-off the balance on the card--\ntwice.\n  What's particularly troubling is that many students who use their \ncredit cards when they ``run out of checks'' or are ``on Spring Break'' \ndon't realize the financial implications of credit. In a September 1999 \narticle, Joan Bodnar, senior editor of Kiplinger's Personal Finance \nMagazine wrote, ``Kids tend to equate credit cards with free money--in \na recent survey of college students, fewer than half of those \ninterviewed knew the interest rate on their cards.''\n  Similarly, a 1993 American Express/Consumer Federation of America \nstudy of college students revealed that college juniors and seniors \nonly have a ``fair'' understanding of financial services products, and \nfew appear to understand an annual percentage rate. A similar study of \nhigh school seniors reveals that they have a ``poor'' understanding of \nsuch products.\n  The result? College students with no income and good intentions often \nfind themselves in debt with no way out. For example, of the 20 percent \nof students who report an average balance greater than $1,000, half of \nthose students have four or more credit cards and only 18 percent pay \noff their outstanding balances every month. In addition, 48 percent of \nthese students have other debt and nearly one-third have charged \ntuition and fees.\n\n  The economic and emotional consequences of credit card debt can be \ndevastating--even deadly--for many students. Tricia Johnson received a \ndesperate call from her daughter, Mitzi, a student in her first year at \nthe University of Central Oklahoma. Mitzi had lost her part-time job \nand was\n\n[[Page S14379]]\n\nafraid she could not pay her debts. Mrs. Johnson tried to comfort her \ndistraught daughter. But, later that night, Mitzi committed suicide. \nShe had accumulated $2,500 in credit card debt, but her weekly income \nrarely exceeded $65. When the police found Mitzi, credit cards were \nspread across her bed.\n  Janie O'Donnell--the mother of Sean Moyer, a National Merit Scholar \nattending the University of Oklahoma--had the same devastating \nexperience. In 1998, Sean told his mother he had no idea how to get out \nof his financial mess, and he did not see much of a future for himself. \nSean had moved home to save money and pay off the $10,000 he owed Visa \nand Master Card. A week later, he committed suicide.\n  A study by the University of Minnesota in 1996, suggests that credit \ncard debt by students often goes hand in hand with stress and \ndepression. Two-thirds of students who said they were taking medication \nfor depression had more than $1,000 in credit card debt. The study also \nfound that as credit card debt increased, the student's grade point \naverage went down. In 1998, a University of Indiana administrator said, \n``we lose more students to credit card debt than to academic failure.''\n  Tennessee legislators were disturbed by a study that revealed a large \nnumber of Tennessee bankruptcy filers to be surprisingly young, and \nthey are taking action. Several bills were introduced, and the state \nSenate passed legislation that gives students an opportunity to remove \ntheir name from solicitation lists.\n  It's time for Congress to take action as well. The purpose of the \namendment before the Senate is to ensure responsible lending by credit \ncard companies to students. In fact some credit card issuers are \nadhering to self-imposed restrictions that are more narrow than the \nDodd/Kennedy amendment. For example, Dorinda Simpson, CEO of American \nPartners Federal Credit Union testified that when issuing student \ncredit cards, they set a $500 credit limit and require a co-signor ``so \nparents know up front what we are loaning to that college student.''\n  This amendment doesn't go that far. It requires credit card companies \nto either establish that a student has the income to repay the debt or \nhave a co-signor.\n  The requirements aren't overly burdensome. They won't disadvantage \n20-year-olds in the military--they have an income. They won't \ndisadvantage a student with deceased parents--another person may co-\nsign or the student may have income. They won't disadvantage a 19 year-\nold, non-college student who is between jobs--that person may have \nunemployment compensation or another form of income.\n  And, finally, this amendment is not a form of lending discrimination. \nWhen similarly situated individuals aren't treated equally, that's \ndiscrimination. When underwriting standards are based on perception \ninstead of facts, that's discrimination. But, requiring credit card \nissuers to stop preying on college students they know don't have a \nmeans to repay debt--that is ensuring responsible behavior.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, the amendment that I have \noffered, along with Senator Kennedy, does the following: It says for \npersons between the ages of 18 and 21, you must either prove you have \nthe ability to pay or to have a parent, guardian or some qualified \nperson cosign your credit card application. The reason for this \nprovision is because there is an alarming increase.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order. Will \nSenators having conversations please take them into the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  There is an alarming increase in the number of young people who are \nbeing swamped with credit card applications where with merely their \nsignature and the showing of a student ID they can receive credit of up \nto $10,000. In fact, today, the average college student, who does not \npay their monthly balance, has a credit card obligation of $2,000. And \none-fifth of those have credit card obligations of $10,000 or more. We \nare being told now that one of the largest reasons for disenrollment in \nhigher education is because of credit card debt.\n  My amendment merely says that between the ages of 18 and 21, you must \neither prove you have the ability to repay or you must have a \ncosignature by a parent, guardian, or other qualified individual with \nthe means to repay. It is not outrageous to ask credit card companies \nto require this kind of information. Students are receiving, on the \naverage, 50 credit card applications in their first semester of \ncollege.\n  We set the age of 21 for legal consumption of alcohol in this \ncountry. The IRS has a presumption of age 23, if you are in college, in \nterms of student obligations in loans.\n  By merely requesting that the credit card companies ask for this \nbasic information, we can slow down this alarming increase in the \nnumber of young people who are incurring tremendous debts. Many of \nthese kids are dropping out of school as a result of these debts.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment to stop this \nalarming trend of too many young people, while at too young an age, \nincurring unreasonable credit card debts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  I must say before the Senator speaks, the Senate is not in order. \nWill the Senate please come to order.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment unfairly discriminates \nagainst young adults, and I think it should be opposed. Adults between \nthe ages of 18 and 21 can defend our country in the military. Yet under \nthis amendment, they will not be able to even get a credit card without \novercoming regulatory obstacles in their way.\n  Many young adults, some of whom are students and are supporting young \nfamilies, need access to credit cards to make their lives just a little \nbit easier. So I oppose this paternalistic amendment.\n  I remember what it was like to work in a low-paying job as a janitor. \nI can appreciate the benefits that being able to obtain credit will \nprovide to hard-working young adults.\n  Keep in mind, many in this group oppose parental consent for \nabortion, and you are going to impose parental consent on young adults \nwho may be working, who may have families, who may be in the military, \nwho may be as responsible as anybody else. It just plain isn't right. I \ndo not think we should vote for that.\n  So I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2754. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I take this time with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Frist from Tennessee, and our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Bob Kerrey, who served with me on the National \nBipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, to offer what I think \nis the first ever comprehensive Medicare reform bill to be introduced \nsince the advent of Medicare back in 1965.\n  We introduced a bill today. It is available for consideration by our \ncolleagues. I hope this legislative effort becomes the marker for \nfuture discussions and debate on the question of what we do with \nMedicare. We introduced the bill today because we think it is \nabsolutely essential that the Congress in this session take up the \nquestion of how to reform the Medicare Program that is currently \nserving 40 million Americans.\n  We did it essentially for two reasons. First of all, the program that \nthe seniors now benefit from is not nearly as good as it should be nor \nnearly as good as it can be. Medicare today is noted more for what it \ndoes not cover than for what it actually covers. As an example, it does \nnot cover prescription drugs; it does not cover eyeglasses; it does not \ncover hearing aids--three examples of things our seniors need and need \nvery desperately.\n  So in addition to not covering these items, it does not cover a \nnumber of other expenses, including about 47 percent of the expenses \nfor seniors who are not covered by Medicare insurance. They have to go \nout and buy supplemental insurance. So the program is not nearly as \ngood as it should be, nor as good as we could make it.\n  The second reason we have introduced it is because, as bad as the \nprogram is, it is going broke. By the year 2020, one-half of all the \nrevenues to fund the Medicare program are going to have to come out of \ngeneral revenues. It was never intended to come out of general \nrevenues. It was supposed to be paid from the payroll tax. But, by \n2020, over half the costs of the program are going to have to come from \ngeneral revenues. In addition, by the year 2015, the program is going \nto be insolvent. It is going to be broke. There is not going to be \nenough money to pay for the benefits the seniors currently get.\n  For those two reasons, we have built on what the Medicare Commission \nrecommended, expanded on it, and improved upon it, to present to our \ncolleagues the first ever comprehensive Medicare reform bill.\n  Basically, building on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, we \nare saying about the plan that I, as a Senator, have, and what all of \nour colleagues and all the House Members and the other 10 million \nFederal employees have, is if it is good enough for them, it should \nalso be good enough for our Nation's seniors.\n  What we have suggested is we pattern a new Medicare program based on \nthe Federal employees plan. We would create a Medicare board, which \nwould be appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, for 7-\nyear terms. They would guarantee all the plans being submitted to serve \nour seniors would ensure quality standards. They would negotiate the \npremiums. They would approve the benefits package. They would make sure \nthere are safeguards against adverse selection of only healthy seniors. \nThey would provide information to our seniors.\n  This Medicare board would call upon the existing health care \nfinancing authority and all private groups such as insurance \ncompanies--whether it is an Aetna or a Blue Cross--all of these who \nwant the privilege of serving the Medicare beneficiaries would have to \ncompete for the right to do so. They do not do that today.\n  We would say to all these people who want to serve Medicare \nbeneficiaries, they have to offer at least as much as what Medicare \npays for today, at least as much but hopefully a lot more. We would \nrequire every group that wants to sell health insurance to Medicare \nbeneficiaries to have to compete for the right to do so, compete on the \nprice they request seniors to pay, and compete on the quality of \nservice they make available to seniors.\n  In addition, every one of these plans would have to offer a high \noption plan which would contain a prescription drug plan. Prescription \ndrugs today are as important as a hospital bed was in 1965, and maybe \neven more so because prescription drugs keep people out of hospitals. \nThey keep people out of nursing homes. They make their lives better and \nthe quality of their lives better than it would be, were they not \ngetting prescription drugs.\n  So every one of these single plans would have to offer a high option \nplan and they would have to make that a prescription drug plan with an \nactuarial value of at least $800 per year, which would be indexed to \nthe increase of costs of prescription drugs annually.\n  They would also have a stop-loss guarantee which simply means no \nsenior would ever have to pay more than $2,000 out of their pocket.\n  We think, in essence, what this plan would do is bring about \nsubstantive, real reform to a 1965 model program which simply is not \nworking as we move to the 21st century. We cannot continue to tinker \naround the edges. We need complete, total reform of the Medicare \nprogram. If we do that, then we can start talking about adding other \nbenefits such as prescription drugs, which I think are very important \nand I strongly support. But you cannot add prescription drugs to a \nbroken program. You have to fundamentally restructure it and reform it; \nbring about real competition where all these plans will compete for the \nright to serve.\n\n  That is what I have as a Senator. That is what 9 million other \nFederal employees have. I think we would see substantial savings \nbrought about by companies having to compete for who can offer the best \npackage at the best price. If they want to stay in a current fee-for-\nservice plan offered by Medicare, they can stay right where they are. \nThey don't have to make a change. But if they see one of these other \nplans offer them a better deal, they should take that better deal.\n  We hope our colleagues take a look at what we have offered. We think \nit is where we are ultimately going to end up. My colleagues, Senators \nKerrey and Frist, have done a terrific job. We think this is where we \nshould go as a nation.\n\n[[Page S14381]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have joined Senators Breaux and Kerrey \nhere this evening to introduce a bill to comprehensively reform \nMedicare. The obvious question is, why is it necessary to reform \nMedicare? The very simple answer is that our seniors need and deserve \nbetter health care than what the current Medicare program can provide. \nThe problem facing Medicare today is that, although we are in 1999, we \nare still relying on an antiquated system based on a 1965 model of \nhealth care. Medicare today is an inflexible system, it is an \nincomplete system, and it is a system that is going bankrupt. The \nrigidity of Medicare today limits access to new treatments and medical \ntechnologies, whether it is transplantation or treatment for \nhypertension.\n  The benefit package, in particular, is severely outdated, as \nevidenced by a lack of outpatient prescription drug coverage. I can \ntell you as a physician, that in order to deliver quality health care \nto our seniors, prescription drug coverage is imperative.\n  Most seniors today do not realize the Federal Government only pays 53 \npercent, or about half, of their overall health care costs. Our \nnation's seniors deserve better.\n  Right now, Medicare is micromanaged by Congress through 130,000 pages \nof regulations, 4 times the number of pages for the IRS code. Right now \nthere are over 10,000 different prices in 3,000 different counties \nwhich are managed by the Health Care Financing Administration and \nCongress.\n  With 77 million baby boomers entering the Medicare program in 2010, \nwe can expect a doubling of our eligible Medicare beneficiaries over \nthe next 30 years. Medicare, in it's current form, is not prepared for \nand cannot endure these immense demographic changes. The program is \nalready due to be insolvent by the year 2015.\n  This bill incorporates three main concepts. The first is health care \nsecurity for our seniors. The second is choice, to meet beneficiaries' \nindividual health care needs, as Senator Breaux just outlined. The \nthird is the establishment of a comprehensive, health care system that \noffers an integrated set of benefits.\n  We model this proposal on the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram. As the Senator from Louisiana just said, that is the way we in \nCongress get our health care. In addition, 9 million others get their \nhealth care through the FEHBP model. We have a long history, almost 40 \nyears of experience with this model. All federal employees, including \nmyself and my family, receive a description of benefits and choices, \nwhich outlines all the plans available in a geographic area, including \nthe cost and quality of each plan. It is all right here in this \nbooklet. This is what we as Members of Congress have today and it is \nwhat our seniors deserve.\n  This bill guarantees all current Medicare benefits, which is critical \nin maintaining health care security. Regardless of what plan a \nbeneficiary chooses, HCFA-sponsored or private, all benefits in \nMedicare are guaranteed in a system based on choice and competition.\n  For the first time in Medicare, not only are outpatient prescription \ndrugs offered to all beneficiaries, but all Medicare beneficiaries \nreceive a discount for drug benefits. Full coverage is offered for \nbeneficiaries below 135 percent of poverty. For beneficiaries between \n135 percent and 150 percent of poverty there will be a discount based \non a sliding scale, ranging from 50 percent to 25 percent. For all \nother beneficiaries who are above 150 percent of poverty, a 25-percent \ndiscount is offered.\n  This bill protects beneficiaries against high out-of-pocket costs. \nMost seniors do not realize today that if they get sick, there is no \nlimit on what they will pay for care. We, for the first time, through \nenrollment in a high-option plan, limit out-of-pocket expenditures to \n$2,000 for core Medicare benefits.\n  This bill also offers low-income and rural protections. In our \nlegislation, we specifically address the lack of private plans in \ncertain areas, such as rural areas. In these underserved or rural \nareas, we make sure that affordable health care is available for \nseniors. We guarantee both the current Medicare benefits and \nprescription drug benefits.\n  We include beneficiary outreach and education efforts coordinated at \nthe federal, state and local levels, to ensure timely, accurate, and \nunderstandable information, outlining affordable health care options, \nis available for all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In summary, the bill we have introduced today promotes high-quality, \ncomprehensive, integrated health care for our seniors that meets their \nindividual needs. It assists all beneficiaries, especially those with \nlow incomes, in obtaining comprehensive benefits, including \nprescription drug coverage. It increases the flexibility of the \nMedicare program to capture innovations in medicine. Whether it is new \ntechnologies, new breakthroughs in medicines, or new drugs, it is \nimportant seniors have access to these services, something they don't \nhave today. This bill also ends congressional micromanagement. We have \nbeen struggling all week with fixes to a Balanced Budget Act from 2 \nyears ago, trying to figure out how to correct the problems we created \nby micromanaging Medicare on the Senate floor. This just does not make \nsense. As I said, there are over 130,000 pages of regulations that we \nare trying to oversee here in Congress. Finally, we adopt a stable, \ncompetitive system based on the proven FEHBP model. This bill is based \non competition, choice, health care security, and the need for \ncomprehensive and integrated benefits, including prescription drugs.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support this legislation as it is a \ncritical focal point and sets the stage for future discussions as we \naddress Medicare reform and modernization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I join the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee and the distinguished Senator from Louisiana in introducing \nthis legislation. I want to emphasize something both Senators \nemphasized in an earlier press conference, and that is, the goal of \nthis legislation has three parts: No. 1 is security, securing Medicare \nfor beneficiaries today and beneficiaries in the future. It is a \nterribly important program, and the roughly 40 million Americans who \ncurrently benefit from this program need to know the law guarantees \ntheir benefits. This proposal actually secures their benefits even more \nthan existing law.\n  Some people will attack this proposal, but we have been very careful \nin drafting this legislation to accommodate the beneficiaries' concerns \nthat their benefits under a competitive model might be lower. This \nlegislation says their benefits cannot be less than what is currently \navailable under existing law, and there is, I say to those who are \nconcerned about rural communities, as I know the distinguished occupant \nof the Chair is, there is a provision in here that says if competition \ndoes not bring alternative plans, plans other than the fee-for-service \noffering of the Health Care Finance Administration, that the cost to \nthe beneficiaries cannot exceed 12 percent of the national weighted \naverage. That would make it very likely that in rural areas there will \nbe no penalty; indeed, it is likely to be they will be paying less than \nthey do under the current law.\n  The second is that it is comprehensive and it offers comprehensive \nchoice. There is a very important part of this legislation that, almost \nall by itself, is going to increase the satisfaction of citizens as \nthey examine Medicare. That is, we establish a public board that has \nsignificant power not just over HCFA but over the plans that are \noffered in the marketplace.\n  Right now, HCFA writes the rules for competing plans; obviously, a \nconflict of interest. We do not want to decrease the ability of HCFA to \noffer plans. We have written this so HCFA can offer its fee-for-service \nplan and be competitive, but we want this board to set the rules and \nconditions under which competitive plans come into the marketplace, \nalthough we have written in the legislation guarantees, as I indicated \nearlier, to make certain the program is secure.\n  A public board is much more likely to give the public satisfaction \nthan the current environment. All of us understand it is exceptionally \ndifficult both to evaluate what is right and what is wrong when we are \nfaced with a request from a provider or from a beneficiary, and it is \neven more difficult to\n\n[[Page S14382]]\n\nget HCFA to change its rules mostly on account of HCFA knowing that if \nit changes a rule, for example, in Nebraska, it is going to be changing \nrules for all other 49 States as well and could add significant costs \nto the program. So HCFA ends up being very inflexible, I argue not \nthrough any fault of its own but through the fault of the way the law \nis written.\n  The second objective of this legislation is that we provide \ncomprehensive choice in a new legal environment, where the citizens \nwill have more opportunity to make their case to a public board and the \npublic board will have much greater expertise in making decisions about \nhow to create a competitive environment that will enable HCFA to \ncompete as well as private sector companies to come on line and offer \nmore choice at lower cost to beneficiaries.\n  The third thing is we say that a prescription benefit should and must \nbe considered in a comprehensive solution with Medicare reform. We \ncannot separate it. You cannot take a prescription benefit for a \nMedicare beneficiary and separate it and create an entirely new program \nwithout considering the need for comprehensive change in the program. \nIt is much more likely that we will satisfy concerns of taxpayers that \nwe not end up with a program that has an open-ended cost to it and much \nmore likely, especially with the structural change of the board, that \nthe rules will be written so the marketplace cannot only develop \naffordable products, but develop creative products that we are apt to \nsee increasingly being asked for by our health care delivery system.\n\n  I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I hope we \nare able to get a markup in the Senate Finance Committee next year. I \nhope this becomes the basis for bipartisan reform. All too often this \nis a subject matter that lends itself to demagoging on both sides. \nMediscare has become a verb and a form of political art. Hopefully, as \na consequence of it beginning in a bipartisan fashion, it will end up \nin a bipartisan fashion, and the rhetoric will be much more tame and \nmuch more honest as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14382-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would also like to take a minute to talk \nabout a companion program to Medicare, and that is Social Security.\n  A Social Security beneficiary will say Social Security and Medicare \nare in the same program, indeed, in the same act, in the same law. As \nfar as the beneficiary is concerned, one program serves the needs of \nthe other.\n  The General Accounting Office today released a public report which \nevaluates five plans that have been presented to the people, five plans \nthat the people should look to and evaluate to answer the question: Is \nthis a plan I support?\n  Let me list what those plans are. The first plan is the status quo, \nwhat I call in a nonpejorative fashion the do-nothing plan; the do-\nnothing plan calls for maintaining current law, waiting until manana, \nand fixing the program 10 years, 20 years from now. GAO evaluates the \ndo-nothing plan, which, by the way, has 500 cosponsors at the moment in \nthe House and the Senate. The GAO evaluated the plan that Senator \nGregg, myself, Senator Grassley, Senator Breaux, and three others in \nthe Senate have introduced. The bill number is S. 1383. The House \ncompanion bill to S. 1383 is H.R. 1793, a companion bill which has nine \ncosponsors. The GAO evaluated that bill as well.\n  The GAO also evaluated S. 1831. That is the President's reform plan. \nIt has been introduced in the Senate. The GAO also evaluated the \nArcher-Shaw proposal, though Chairman Archer and Representative Shaw \nhave yet to introduce their reform plan in the form of a bill. They \nevaluated the details of the Archer-Shaw proposal that were provided to \nthem. And finally, GAO evaluated Representative Kasich's proposal. I do \nnot know what its number is or how many people are on it, but it is a \nspecific piece of legislation that has been introduced.\n\n  The GAO has done a very useful service, in my view, for a couple of \nreasons.\n  Reason No. 1 is that GAO finally identifies the status quo as a plan. \nIn other words, you cannot not be for something. If you are not on a \nbill, you are supporting the status quo, you are supporting existing \nlaw. There are serious consequences to supporting existing law.\n  The GAO evaluated all five of these plans.\n  Secondly, GAO outlined for the first time the eight financial and \nbudgetary criteria by which these five proposals ought to be judged by \nthe American public. In the report, they ask:\n  First, does it reduce pressure of Social Security spending on the \nbudget?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERREY. How much time did I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator had 5 minutes under a unanimous \nconsent agreement to proceed.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, there were eight other questions on the \nfinancial side.\n  Question No. 2: Does it reduce the national debt?\n  Question No. 3: Does it reduce the cost of Social Security as a \npercent of GDP?\n  Question No. 4: Does it increase national savings?\n  Question 5: Does it solve the 75-year actuarial solvency problem? In \nother words, can it keep the promise to all 270 million beneficiaries \nboth eligible today and out into the future?\n  Question No. 6: Does it create new, undisclosed contingent \nliabilities?\n  Question No. 7: Does it increase payroll taxes or place an obligation \non general revenues?\n  And question No. 8: Are there safety valves to accommodate future \ngrowth in the program?\n  These are the key financial questions. The GAO has laid out an \nevaluation of the five dominant plans that have been offered by Members \nof Congress to the public.\n  In addition, GAO attempts to do an analysis of the administration and \nimplementation issues in each plan.\n  Finally, GAO attempts to evaluate whether or not equity--generational \nequity--and progressivity have been taken into account in each plan. \nEquity and progressivity are always important. Social Security is a \nvery progressive program to beneficiaries.\n  I hope that this GAO report gets a little bit of air time and a \nlittle bit of consideration by Members. I hope that particular \nattention will be paid to the do-nothing, status quo plan.\n  There are consequences to the do-nothing plan. The current status quo \nplan dramatically increases debt and interest costs in the future. This \nlarge debt will have a major impact on the tax burdens and interest \nrates of future workers. GAO comments very unfavorably when it measures \nthe status quo approach against its eight financial criteria. There are \nvery negative consequences for both current beneficiaries and future \nbeneficiaries and the American taxpayers for doing nothing.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a closer look at this GAO report--and to \nreally understand the cost tradeoffs between different approaches to \nSocial Security reform. The battle cry all year long has been to save \nSocial Security first. We created an elaborate lockbox mechanism so we \ncould do it. My hope is that next year, with the assistance of GAO and \nthis report, we will see an increasing number of Members who are \nenthusiastic about putting their names on specific legislation to \nreform Social Security.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator Landrieu, Senator Kennedy, and others who may be interested \nin joining in this particular effort.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment which I would hope would be \nadopted. I am sorry in a sense it is not being accepted because it goes \nto the very heart of what many of us have talked about and tried to \naccomplish over the years, since bankruptcy laws were first modernized \nand adopted almost a century ago in 1903. This amendment deals with \nfamilies, with spouses, with child support issues, and where they come \nin the context of priorities when it comes to discharging \nresponsibilities under the bankruptcy act.\n  It is no great secret that in 1998, we learned that as much as $43 \nbillion in child support payments remained uncollected in the United \nStates. It is a staggering sum of money and makes a huge difference to \nchildren growing up under adverse circumstances as they are. When you \nexclude the ability to receive the financial support necessary to make \nends meet, the problem becomes even more pronounced.\n  I raise that because last year this body voted on important \nlegislation that would provide needed reform to our bankruptcy laws, \nwhile at the same time ensuring that children and families would remain \nunhindered in their efforts to collect domestic support from bankrupt \ndebtors.\n  Since 1903, our Nation's bankruptcy code has been guided by the firm \nprinciple that women and children must be first in the distribution \nline of available assets during bankruptcy proceedings. For almost a \ncentury, debt owed to children and families has been nondischargeable. \nThus, if a head of household fails financially, whatever remaining \nassets he has could be used to spare his spouse or ex-spouse and his \nchildren from impoverishment. We do this because those who are most \nvulnerable in our society deserve the most protection.\n  With this principle in mind, this body recently added another \nprotection for domestic support obligations in bankruptcy. The \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 made children and families a priority \nunsecured creditors. This enabled women and children to receive \npayments on their claims before other creditors.\n  Today's bill, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, would fundamentally \nalter this delicate balance achieved after almost a century of \njurisprudence. We are altering the bankruptcy landscape for the benefit \nof the credit card industry without understanding what the consequences \nfor families will be.\n  Women and children will be disproportionately affected by this \nlegislation, unless it is amended. Whether as debtors filing for \nbankruptcy themselves or as creditors, three quarters of a million \nwomen will be affected this year by the bankruptcy system, and it is \nestimated that as many as 1 million women will be affected in the \ncoming year.\n  I recognize the precipitous rise in bankruptcies in the last few \nyears. It is a problem that needs to be dealt with. I agree with those \nof my colleagues who think the law needs to be reformed and tightened \nup. I also agree with Henry Hyde, Chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, that it is possible to enact legislation that is highly \nfavorable to the credit card companies and tightens the laws without \ndepriving debtors and their families of reasonably necessary living \nexpenses.\n  As the legislation is currently drafted, the credit card industry is \nprotected. Unfortunately, families are not, in my view. Maybe that is \nwhy all the major family and children advocacy groups presently oppose \nthis bill. Yet with the adoption of the amendment that Senator Landrieu \nand I have offered, we think we can bring substantial support to this \nbill.\n  I have serious concerns about the bill, as it is presently drafted, \nbecause of its potential harm to children and to families. This bill \npresents obstacles to families both before, during, and after \nbankruptcy that leave the alarming potential for family support income \nto be dissipated and misdirected to credit card companies rather than \nto the families who need that help.\n  First, I am greatly concerned about the means test, which requires \nthe trustee in bankruptcy to review all individual Chapter 7 cases for \nability to pay debts under a rigid IRS formula devised originally for \ndelinquent taxpayers, now to be applied in bankruptcy proceedings. \nThese standards neither take into account differences in the cost of \nliving from region to region nor do they ascribe rational expenses to \nindividual families. As such, the use of these standards will deprive \nchildren and families of reasonably necessary living expenses.\n  Additionally, because the means test increases the potential for \ndismissing chapter 7 cases, this bill channels many debtors into 5-year \nchapter 13 repayment plans, even though we know for a fact two-thirds \nof such plans fail today. What will families live on during this time?\n  I am also concerned about the provisions of the legislation that make \ncertain credit card debt nondischargeable. While the recent family \nsupport provisions added to the legislation are positive improvements, \nthey have not cured the problems caused by other provisions of the bill \nwhich give greater collection rights to credit card lenders and fewer, \nin my view, to families and children.\n  This bill elevates credit card debt to a presumed nondischargeable \nstatus. If a debtor purchases items or services on credit from a single \ncreditor within 90 days of bankruptcy and such items exceed $250 in \nvalue, these items would be presumed luxuries. This chart to my right \nexplains it.\n  Under current law, food, medicine, and clothing equal necessities. \nUnder present law, if the amount is less than $1,075 per creditor and \nincurred within 60 days of the bankruptcy petition, then they are \nprotected.\n  Under the law as presently drafted, without amendment, food, \nmedicine, and clothing are considered luxuries, if the amount is \ngreater than $250 and incurred within 90 days of the bankruptcy \npetition. So if you have $251 of food, medicine, and clothing expense \nand it is incurred within the last 90 days, then you have to go to \ncourt and spend the money to prove these are not luxuries: food, \nmedicine, and clothing.\n  This point is one I find stunning in its potential implications. Let \nme emphasize, under current law, food, medicine, and clothing are \nconsidered necessities. If the amount is in excess or less than $1,075 \nand incurred within 60 days, there is a presumption those are \nnecessities. That is considered, by today's dollars, enough to \naccommodate a family.\n  Here we are now saying food, medicine, and clothing, if it is in \nexcess of $250 within 90 days, that is a luxury. So $251, you have to \ngo to court. If you are a debtor and you are a woman with a family you \nare raising on your own, you go to bankruptcy court. You have to come \nup with the money now to prove because it is a rebuttable presumption \nthat you have to overcome if it is $251. By the very factor that you \nare in bankruptcy court, how many resources are you going to have to \nhire a lawyer to go in and prove that $251 were necessities and not \nluxuries. If you are a creditor in this situation, a family, then \nobviously the problem is also difficult.\n  If you go to a Kmart and buy clothes for your children, necessities \nthey may need, that is considered a luxury if it is $251. A judgment \ncould be entered by default, and then the debt survives. If you are a \nsingle woman as a creditor, then you must wait until your ex-husband \ntries or does not try to defend a similar purchase. And if he is \nunsuccessful, there will be less money for him to pay child support. So \non either side of the equation, if you are a\n\n[[Page S14389]]\n\nwoman raising children on your own, either as a debtor or a creditor, \nthis places tremendous burdens on the family.\n  If this stays in the bill as is, this is a huge blow to average \nfamilies. There is no consideration of region of the country. I don't \ncare where you live in the United States. Imagine some parts of the \ncountry where $251 in 90 days, that is 3 months, if you have three \nchildren, $251 is a luxury? You have to go to court and hire a lawyer \nto prove it wasn't a luxury. We are reforming the bankruptcy laws to \ntry to protect people and families from hardships they can incur? I \ndon't understand this.\n  If this is sustained in the bill, I urge the President to veto this \nlegislation regardless of what else is here. This would be a huge blow \nto families to allow this to persist in the legislation.\n  The bill's proponents will tell us that this is really not the case. \nChild support is still the No. 1 priority. The reality is that this \nchange will place kids and families first in line for nothing, since \nsuch assets are available to support families in less than 1 percent of \nthe cases.\n  In addition, this change may not place families above lenders if the \nlenders say their claims are secured by the debtor's property. For the \nfirst time, we have allowed these heretofore unsecured creditors to get \ninto the bankruptcy courthouse. Currently, children and family support \nrecipients, taxes, student loans were nondischargeable debts. For the \nfirst time in a century the proposed legislation would bring into this \nunique category these other creditors, i.e. credit card companies, who \nwill make the competition for scarce assets that much fiercer.\n  These creditors have historically been unsecured because they have \nreceived the benefit of high interest. Now they are becoming \neffectively secured creditors. Most household finance groups secure \nitems of property with agreements. So if you have a television set, the \nhousehold finance company will have a security interest in the TV \nobligation, and the company is a secured creditor. The same thing \noccurs with reaffirmation agreements, and indeed the bill increases the \npotential for these agreements. Creditors can ask debtors to reaffirm \ndebts of have their property--often of little value--repossessed. These \nitems may be of little value to creditors, but of tremendous value to \nfamilies, enabling them to continue to survive with the bare \nnecessities. And they too will be elevated into the same sort of status \nthat we have had for children and families, which I think, again, goes \nbeyond anything I think we intended.\n  With those concerns in mind, the amendment Senator Landrieu and I and \nSenator Kennedy have offered tries to address these concerns in the \nbill. Let me address each of the provisions very quickly and turn to my \ncolleague from Louisiana for any further comment she would like to make \non this amendment.\n  First of all, this amendment would modify the means test to provide \ngreater flexibility and reasonableness when calculating the ability to \npay. Allowable expenses would include family support, expenses \nassociated with adoption of a child, child care, medical expenses, \ncaring for elderly members of the family, education expenses, and other \nsuch critical areas that have been identified as those most families \nmust make. Such expenses should be considered not ignored by the \nbankruptcy courts.\n  Second, my amendment will ensure that support payments and other \nfunds intended for the current needs of children do not become the \nproperty of the bankruptcy estate with the corollary potential of being \ndistributed to creditors. Money for kids should go to kids, not to \ncreditors.\n  This amendment will also adopt the House definition of household \ngoods, which enables debtors to keep, during bankruptcy, personal \nproperty normally found in and around the home, excluding automobiles. \nThis will ensure that in a bankruptcy children and families are able to \nkeep, without fear of repossession, certain household goods that \ntypically have no resale value, such as toys, swing sets, VCRs, and \nother items used by parents to help raise their children.\n  Finally, this amendment will ensure that debtors are not forced into \nbankruptcy court to seek to prove that food, diapers, school uniforms, \ntoys, and the like are not luxury goods. It would do this by providing \nthat items purchased with a credit card would be nondischargeable only \nif they were purchased within 70 days, not 90 days, of bankruptcy, have \na value of $400 or more per item, and require the creditor to prove at \na hearing that the items were not reasonably necessary for the \nmaintenance and support of the debtor and her dependents--shifting the \nburden, if you will.\n  Mr. President, I hope that these efforts will win broad support here \nas we try to again go back to what we have sustained for almost a \ncentury, recognizing the modern world we live in and the needs of \nfamilies trying to see their way through the difficult period of a \nbankruptcy, which we are going to make far more difficult now for \npeople to take under this law.\n  I am not opposed at all to the idea of trying to restrain \nthe proliferation of bankruptcy in the country. But as we are doing \nthat, let's not do so in such a way that it places an undue hardship \nand burden on families trying to make ends meet and trying to keep \nthemselves together. Let's go back to the notion that, since 1903, the \nbankruptcy code has protected families.\n\n  When it comes to families, and women in particular, who could be so \nadversely affected by changing the means test here, placing the legal \nburdens on a family to go out and hire a lawyer to prove that $251 in \ngoods over 90 days for a family is not a luxury item--nobody needs to \nbe educated here about who has greater power. Credit card companies \nhave teams of lawyers; they hire them on a permanent basis. But if you \nare some family out there who has gone through the agony of a \nbankruptcy, how many lawyers will take on the cases for $251 and try to \nprove that some items weren't luxury items? How many lawyers want to \ntake on those cases? How long can you stay in court? How many motions \ncan you argue back and forth? Such families are truly at a \ndisadvantage. I am not talking about the poorest families in America; I \nam talking about middle income, hard-working families that find \nthemselves in the dreadful position of all of a sudden having to \nreadjust their lives because they have been hit by a financial \ndisaster.\n  I also know there are people out there who abuse the system, who are \nscam artists, who game the system and use the bankruptcy laws to take \nadvantage of a situation. I know they exist. I am as angry as anybody \nelse that there are people like that out there. But I also happen to \nbelieve that the overwhelming majority of people are not scam artists; \nthey are good people, honest people, and they are trying to keep their \nfamilies together.\n  I noted last night that during this wonderful economic time we have \nbeen having, the top 20 percent of income earners have enjoyed a 115 \npercent increase in earning power. The middle 20 percent has had a 9 \npercent increase. The bottom 20 percent has had an 8 percent decline in \nearning power. While we all rave about the great economy, for middle \nincome families and less than middle income families the times have \nstill been tough.\n  These are not evil people. The fact that they end up in a financial \nmess doesn't mean that their children ought to pay a price for it. If \nyou want to be angry at the parent, don't take it out on a child who \nwas born into a family that may face these kinds of financial crises. \nTo say to them you are not going to be able to have access to basic \nhousehold goods, things like toys, a VCR, and other basic necessities \nof raising a family, I think that goes too far. It is overreaching and \nit is unnecessary and it is harmful, and it hurts people. I don't know \nof anybody in this Chamber who wants to be a party to that.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana and I, \nand others have offered this amendment. Hopefully, we can get broad and \nwide support for it to restore what, for 100 years, was basic policy. \nFamilies and children come first. Those who are the most vulnerable \ndeserve the most protection. We ought to see to it in this bill that \nthat fundamental principle is not changed. Whatever else we are doing \nwith this law, children and families still come first in our minds, and \nwe are not going to allow them to be hurt, intentionally or \nunintentionally, by provisions of this bill, as presently\n\n[[Page S14390]]\n\nwritten, which would do just that. For those reasons, we offer this \namendment for the consideration of the Senate and hope our colleagues \nwill support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Louisiana \nis recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment, \nwhich attempts to enhance a bill that is intended to do some good \nthings to stop fraud and abuse. But this amendment attempts to take \nthat bill and make it work for everyone and continue the tradition of \nprotecting our children and our families, which is so important.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his great leadership and the \nway he has articulated this issue so well. Neither one of us is on the \ncommittee that considered this piece of legislation. I know there were \nmany good Senators from the Republican side and many good Senators from \nthe Democratic side who have come at this with the right intention--to \neliminate fraud and abuse. But I thank him for his leadership because, \nfrankly, without this amendment, this bill falls very short of those \ngood intentions.\n  We, in Louisiana--I know the people in Kansas are like this, too, and \nI know the people in Connecticut are like this--believe in paying our \ndebts. We do not like freeloaders. We do not like people who are \nreckless with their finances, although every now and then sometimes we \nmight be, in small instances or large. We do not like that. It is not a \nvalue we hold. We believe in being fiscally responsible. We believe in \ntaking care of your own. We believe in taking care of our debts.\n  So I certainly want to support a bill that would clamp down on fraud \nand abuse. If it was a poor person who was using fraud and being \nabusive of the system, they would certainly have to follow the same \nrules as a middle-class family or as the wealthiest person in my State. \nI am not asking, and neither is Senator Dodd, for any special privilege \nfor any man or any woman. We do ask for special consideration for \nchildren. They are not the ones who are ``guilty.'' But we ask no \nspecial provision.\n  This bill as it is currently written goes much too far. I also join \nSenator Dodd in asking the President, if this amendment is not \nadopted--and I do not know; it may be I will join him in asking the \nPresident to veto this bill because this would be a terrible blow to \nfamilies, to children, and particularly single parents, many of whom \nare women but not all. There are some fathers who have custody of their \nchildren--one, two, three or four--who would fall under the same \ndraconian terms of this bill.\n  There is no denying, as I said, that there is need for reform of the \ncurrent bankruptcy law and practice. However, it is important the final \nbill accurately reflect the needs of those most affected by bankruptcy. \nThis amendment we offer does just that. It has four parts. I am going \nto speak briefly about only one.\n  Over the past two decades we have witnessed a 400-percent increase in \nthe use of bankruptcy courts in this country. That figure is alarming. \nThat is why we are trying to see what is causing that and trying to \noffer some solutions. The figures show a rising number of those \nclaiming bankruptcy, however, are single women. In fact, single women \ncomprise the fastest growing group to file bankruptcy, surpassing men \nand married couples.\n  In 1999, more than a half-million single women will file for \nbankruptcy, 10 times the number who filed in 1981. Despite the \noverwhelming number of women who find themselves in this untenable \nstate of economic instability, S. 625, as written, does not at all \nreflect the needs of this population of debtors. This amendment simply \nrevises necessary sections of the bill so it is more realistic, more \nflexible, and more reasonable in dealing with women and their children, \nsingle women and their children--sometimes one child, sometimes two, \nsometimes three, and in a few cases more than that.\n  Our amendment does not ask that women with children be treated any \ndifferently under the law. It simply ensures the standards which apply \nto all debtors be sensitive to the very different situations which \ncause a person to file for bankruptcy. So, in our zest to curb the \nabuse of some, the rights and needs of others should not be ignored.\n  S. 625, as currently written, makes it significantly easier for \ncredit card debt to be considered nondischargeable, which is necessary \nin ending fraud and abuse. However, I think this bill inadvertently \nputs the claim of credit card companies at a distinct advantage over \nsingle mothers or single fathers who are trying to claim their child \nsupport. In most cases that is going to be a single mother.\n\n  I concede the language clearly is written in the bill that states \nwomen and children are the ``first in priority.'' The practical \nreality, as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, as it is \ncurrently drafted, is they are first in line for nothing. Given their \ncircumstances of bankruptcy and their lack of resources, how would they \never find the money to hire a lawyer or get the professional services \nthey need to compete in this legal, cumbersome, complicated, time-\nconsuming, and actually spirit-breaking system we are attempting to \ncreate here.\n  Let me demonstrate with an example. I think if people can see an \nexample they might understand this. For the purposes of this argument, \nlet's take Doris, who is a divorced mother of three children ranging in \nage from 3 to 13 years old. She works at a job earning more than \nminimum wage but not much. Her ex-husband is 5 months behind in child \nsupport--not atypical, given the millions and billions of dollars that \nare owed. If this bill passes, this is what will happen.\n  In September of this year, she goes to Kmart where she purchases \nfood, clothing, and other essential items for her family totaling $260. \nI go to Kmart and Wal-Mart. That is not an unreasonable bill. It is \nhard to support a family with food and clothing and essentials for much \nless than that. Actually, I spend more than that in a month. But she \nspends only $260, trying to be frugal.\n  In November, she comes to grips with the reality that her income will \nnot get her through the winter. She files for bankruptcy. Under the \nbill this Senate is about ready to pass, she is going to have to hire a \nlawyer and go to court to prove that her Kmart purchases were necessary \nfor her family and were not made in an attempt to defraud the system.\n  I could not under any circumstances vote for a bill that would ask \nany of my constituents who live in Louisiana, or any who live in \nConnecticut or any place, to hire a lawyer to go to court to claim that \nthe orange juice, milk, diapers, cookies, some snacks for school, maybe \npart of a school uniform, is a luxury item. When they come knocking at \nmy door, saying, Senator, why does the law say this, I am going to say \nwe made a terrible mistake. But I didn't make the mistake because we \nwere on the floor trying to explain this to people. Hopefully, they are \nlistening.\n  Our amendment makes a simple change to this process. Rather than \nputting the burden on proving the necessity of the purchase on a single \nmother who has no money, a lot of heartache, a lot of children to take \ncare of, it just puts the onus on the credit card companies to prove \nthese purchases were unnecessary. As the Senator has pointed out, they \nalready have lawyers; they are a credit card company. They have \naccountants and lawyers to see, perhaps, if something does look amiss. \nPerhaps if the charges are quite large, they most certainly should be \nable to pull them into court and make sure the judge would take the \nproper action.\n  Credit card companies, as I said, have these investigators to check \nfraud. The people in my State of Louisiana, in that situation, I \npromise you, they do not.\n  Under our system of justice, a person is innocent until proven \nguilty. Under S. 625, as it stands right now, a woman is guilty of \nfraud unless she can prove her innocence. This is not what we want to \ndo. I am positive this is not what this President of the United States \nwants to support. It is unacceptable. If our amendment does not get on \nthis bill, I am going to vote against it. There may be some other \namendments that we need to put on, but this clearly is one.\n\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership in this piece of legislation \nand will only add this to this discussion: One of the wonderful things \nI like about being a Senator is I learn something new\n\n[[Page S14391]]\n\nevery day. I guess my colleagues here feel that way, and I hope the \nstaff does, because it is one of the most interesting things about this \njob.\n  I got, today, the gross monthly income schedule for the IRS. I have \nnever had to file for bankruptcy. I don't think I have ever owed any \ntaxes where I had to go according to this schedule. So this would be \nthe first time I will have seen something like this. I am not a lawyer.\n  I want to say how surprised I am that our Government would have a \nschedule that basically says if you make $830 or less a month, and you \nowe taxes to the Federal Government, that you get to eat $170 worth of \nfood. But if you are wealthy and you owe taxes to the Government, you \nget to eat $456 worth of food every month.\n  If you have children, if you have one child who happens to be in \ndiapers, you get to buy $71 a month at the store. But if you are \nwealthy and you have a child--not wealthy but you make $5,000 a month, \nwhich would be fairly wealthy--and have one child, you get to buy \nalmost $350 worth of diapers and apparel or services at the store.\n  My husband and I have a 2-year-old. I spend more than $40 a month on \ndiapers alone--diapers. I don't want anyone in my State to have to hire \na lawyer to prove that the expenses they have on their credit card to \npurchase food or clothing or diapers or milk or formula for their \nchildren is not a luxury.\n  I urge Members who might not have ever looked at this schedule that \nindicates, when you owe taxes, how much you get to keep--it has no \nmention of children, no educational expenses. I guess the IRS just \nassumes children should stop going to school while their parents pay \nback their taxes.\n  This is the same schedule I think the Senator from Connecticut has \npointed out. I wish I had it blown up because I think people in America \nwould have a hard time believing this.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will.\n  Mr. DODD. This is a question for my colleague. The relevance of this \nis that under the bill as presently written, this is the schedule. This \nis not interesting subject matter because it is an IRS schedule for tax \npurposes. This is what has been adopted as part of the bankruptcy \nbill. So this is your schedule, this is what you know you are going to \nbe limited to; is that correct?\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Correct. That is my understanding. Under the current \nbill, we are adopting an IRS schedule that, in my opinion--and I \nimagine a majority of people in Louisiana will feel that way--this is \nan inappropriate schedule for that purpose. It most certainly is an \ninappropriate schedule for bankruptcy since nowhere on the schedule \ndoes it even mention the word ``child'' or children's needs. It does \nnot mention medicine. It does not mention some of the essential things, \nas the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will further yield, nor does it mention any \ngeography distinction. This is a standard price whether you live in \nLouisiana, Connecticut, California, New York City, Washington, DC--this \nis the same schedule for every person, regardless of where they live in \nthe country; is that correct?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is correct. As we know, the cost-of-living \nescalates and is very different from place to place and region to \nregion. This chart is quite deficient.\n  After this debate, I will be looking at ways the IRS should improve \ntheir own schedule.\n  For the purposes of this debate, we most certainly do not want to \ntake a schedule that is flawed for the purposes of collecting taxes and \nthen apply it to a bankruptcy which is an equally difficult situation \nin which our families find themselves.\n  In conclusion, I realize there is fraud and abuse, and I will be the \nfirst one to step up and vote for a bill that will clamp down on it. No \none deserves special privileges, whether they are poor, middle income \nor wealthy. This bill, as written, goes too far, and we will be sorry \nif we do not adopt some amendments to fix it and make it more fair. Let \nus fight hard for our families. Many of them are having a tough time \nalready. Let's not have the children pay the price for us trying to \nexpedite a bill that does not work for them or for their parents. I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Louisiana may want to do this. It is \nworthwhile. I ask unanimous consent that the IRS schedule be printed in \nthe Record so our colleagues have the benefit of looking at the \nrigidity of this schedule and the paucity of information and items one \nwould normally, reasonably conclude a family might need in order to \nsustain itself during a period of bankruptcy, such as we suggested.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be

\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DODD. Lastly, as I mentioned, virtually all the advocacy groups \ninvolved with children and families are in support of this amendment. \nThere is a letter that comes from many of them, including the YWCA, \nWomen Work, Women Employed, Older Women's League, Equal Rights \nAdvocates, who issued a nice letter in support of this.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights also has a letter in \nsupport of this amendment, along with several other amendments. It \nspecifically mentioned this amendment. I ask unanimous consent both of \nthese letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 5, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned women's and children's \n     organizations write to urge you to support Senator Dodd's \n     amendment to S. 625, the ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999,'' \n     to protect income dedicated to the support of children and \n     families.\n       S. 625 puts economically vulnerable women and children--\n     those who are forced into bankruptcy, and those who are owed \n     support by men who file for bankruptcy--at greater risk. By \n     increasing the rights of many creditors, including credit \n     card companies, finance companies, auto lenders and others, \n     the bill would set up a competition for scarce resources \n     between parents and children owed child support and \n     commercial creditors both during and after bankruptcy. And \n     single parent facing financial crises--often caused by \n     divorce, nonpayment of support, loss of a job, uninsured \n     medical expenses, or domestic violence--would find it harder \n     to regain their economic stability through the bankruptcy \n     process. The bill would make it harder for these parents to \n     meet the filing requirements; harder, once in bankruptcy, to \n     save their homes, cars, and essential household items; and \n     harder to meet their children's needs after bankruptcy \n     because many more debts would survive.\n       Senator Dodd's amendment would address several of the \n     problems the bill would create for women and their families.\n       The means test provision would reduce some of the harsh and \n     arbitrary barriers to accessing the bankruptcy process that \n     are part of S. 625. S. 625 requires that a rigid means test, \n     devised by the IRS for use with delinquent taxpayers, be \n     applied to individuals and families that file for bankruptcy \n     under Chapter 7 liquidation. The test is used to determine \n     whether the debtor can repay some debt and will be forced \n     into a Chapter 13 repayment plan. The Dodd amendment would \n     make the test more reasonable as applied to families with \n     children by including more family expenditures as allowable \n     expenses, including costs of child care and the care of \n     elderly and disabled family members, health care expenses; \n     spousal and child support payments; expenses associated with \n     adoption; and expenses for children's toys, among others.\n       The provision on household goods and property of the estate \n     would provide more protection for essential household goods \n     and income intended for the support of children during \n     bankruptcy. In S. 625, only a very limited and specific list \n     of household goods are protected from repossession or threat \n     of repossession: one radio, one television, one VCR per \n     household. Tape players and CD players are not on the list. A \n     personal computer is protected, but only if it is used \n     primarily for minor children; older children who use a \n     computer for research and parents who do some work at home \n     are out of luck. Senator Dodd's amendment, like the household \n     goods provision in the House-passed bill, would allow each \n     situation to be judged on a case-by-case basis, and would \n     allow debtors to keep tangible property normally found in and \n     around a residence.\n       The provision concerning property of the bankruptcy estate \n     (assets that may be distributed to creditors during the \n     bankruptcy) would ensure that child support payments, and \n     Earned Income Tax Credit refunds available to low-income \n     working families, are not subject to the claims of creditors.\n       The nondischargeability provision of Senator Dodd's \n     amendment would reduce the competition between credit card \n     companies, and women and children owed support, after \n     bankruptcy. Under current law, child support and alimony are \n     among the few debts that are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. \n     S. 625 would elevate many credit card debts to \n     nondischargeable status. This would increase the competition \n     between credit card companies and women and children owed \n     support after bankruptcy, and make it harder for hard-pressed \n     families with children to get a ``fresh start'' through the \n     bankruptcy process. S. 625 provides that if a person, within \n     90 days of bankruptcy, purchases items on a single credit \n     card that total $250, they are presumed to be \n     nondischargeable. S. 625 does give the debtor the right to \n     show that the charges were for necessities, not for luxuries. \n     But debtors will have to bear the burden and expense of going \n     into court to prove that the $251 spent over three months for \n     food, and clothing, and school supplies, were not luxuries.\n       Senator Dodd's nondischargeability provision would provide \n     that credit card purchases would be nondischargeable only if: \n     they are for $400 or more per item or service; they were made \n     within 70 days of filing; and the creditor proves at a \n     hearing that the items are not reasonably necessary for the \n     maintenance and support of the debtor.\n       This amendment would not address all of the problems with \n     S. 625. But it would ameliorate some of the harshest effects \n     of the legislation on women and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n         National Women's Law Center, National Partnership for \n           Women & Families, ACES, Association for Children for \n           Enforcement of Support, American Association of \n           University Women, Business and Professional Women/USA, \n           Center for the Advancement of Public Policy, Coalition \n           of Labor Union Women (CLUW), Equal Rights Advocates, \n           Feminist Majority, National Association of Commissions \n           for Women, National Center for Youth Law, National \n           Organization for Women, Northwest Women's Law Center, \n           NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, Older Women's \n           League (OWL), Women Employed, Women Work!, YWCA of the \n           USA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 1999.\n     Re: The ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999''.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil rights (LCCR), a coalition of 180 national \n     organizations representing people of color, women children, \n     organized labor, persons with disabilities, older Americans, \n     major religious groups, gays and lesbians and civil liberties \n     and human rights groups, we urge you to oppose S. 625, the \n     ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999.''\n       As you know, bankruptcy reform has not been, per se, an \n     issue of traditional concern to the LCCR. However, S. 625 \n     poses significant concerns for the civil rights of all \n     working persons in the United States.\n       While the LCCR does not support the comprehensive \n     legislation of S. 625, we do support three amendments to the \n     bill. First, we support the ``Children and Families \n     amendment,'' which will be offered jointly by Senators Dodd, \n     Landrieu and Kennedy. Second, we support the ``Predatory \n     Leading Amendment,'' which Senator Durbin will offer. Third, \n     we support the Minimum Wage Amendment which will be offered \n     by Senator Kennedy. Each of these amendments is important to \n     balanced and effective bankruptcy reform; and we strongly \n     urge you to support them.\n       The ``Children and Families Amendment'' is designed to \n     ensure that child and espousal support payments and earned \n     income tax credits are not property of the bankruptcy estate. \n     The legislation will replace the current definition of \n     household goods with the House of Representative's definition \n     to allow debtors to keep personal property found in and \n     around the residence. Finally, the amendment will modify the \n     means test to allow more flexibility when there are special \n     expenses related to the care and support of children.\n       The ``Predatory Lending Amendment'' is designed to \n     discourage abusive lending practices. The Durbin amendment \n     targets lenders\n\n[[Page S14393]]\n\n     that violate current Truth in Lending Act standards. The \n     amendment simply says if an individual violates current law \n     they lose their claim in bankruptcy.\n       The Mimimum Wage Amendment is especially important and we \n     strongly urge you to support it. It will help over 12 million \n     Americans--mostly adult workers trying to support their \n     families. By increasing the earnings of workers who are paid \n     hourly from $5.15 to $5.65 an hour in 1999 and to $6.15 in \n     2000, we will be making it easier for these working families \n     to provide the essentials for their children. Given that \n     bankruptcy is particularly hard on low wage workers, this \n     modest increase in the minimum wage is an especially fair \n     element to any bankruptcy reform measure.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       As a general matter, every economic discrimination suffered \n     by disadvantaged groups in our society is reflected in the \n     bankruptcy courts. Last year nearly 1.4 million families \n     filed for bankruptcy, a record number. Most of the families \n     that used the bankruptcy system were those middle class \n     Americans who are most vulnerable economically:\n\n\n                   Single parents and their children\n\n       In 1997, about 300,000 bankruptcy cases involved child \n     support and alimony orders.\\1\\ For about half, women were \n     creditors seeking payments from their ex-husbands following a \n     divorce. In addition, nearly 400,000 women heads-of-\n     households filed for bankruptcy to stabilize their economic \n     conditions. Many dealt with debts incurred during marriage, \n     including debts their ex-husbands had been ordered to pay but \n     for which the wives remained legally responsible when their \n     ex-husbands did not pay. Without bankruptcy, these women \n     would have been forced to choose between spending their now-\n     reduced family incomes on rent, groceries and utilities or on \n     past-due credit card bills.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Endnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       For women, the cumulative effects of lower wages, reduced \n     access to health insurance, the devastating economic \n     consequences of divorce, and the disproportionate financial \n     strain of rearing children alone is reflected in why women \n     heads of households find themselves in bankruptcy \n     courthouses.\n\n\n                            Older Americans\n\n       About 280,000 Americans aged 50 and older filed for \n     bankruptcy during 1997.\\2\\ Older Americans are more \n     vulnerable to the consequences of a job loss; someone pushed \n     out of a job at age 54 has a very hard time coming back \n     economically. Medical coverage is limited just as their \n     medical needs increase. Among Americans older than 65, about \n     a third explained that medical bills not covered by medicare \n     has pushed them to economic collapse. Altogether, more than \n     two-thirds of older Americans attributed their financial \n     problems to uninsured medical bills and job losses.\n\n\n           African American and Hispanic American Homeowners\n\n       About 650,000 homeowners filed for bankruptcy last year \n     trying to save their homes.\\3\\ For all homeowners, bankruptcy \n     gave them a chance to stabilize economically and focus their \n     incomes on paying their mortgages to save their homes. \n     However, the economic struggle for Hispanic American and \n     African American homeowners is harder than for any other \n     group. While 68% of whites own their own homes, only 44% of \n     African Americans and Hispanic Americans own their own homes. \n     Both African American and Hispanic American families are \n     likely to commit a larger fraction of their take-home pay for \n     their mortgages, and their homes represent virtually all of \n     their family wealth. It is no surprise, then, that African \n     American and Hispanic American homeowners are six hundred \n     percent more likely to seek bankruptcy protection when a \n     period of unemployment or uninsured medical loss puts them at \n     risk for losing their homes.\n       Industry consultants estimate that credit card companies \n     could cut their bankruptcy losses by more than 50% if they \n     would institute mimimal credit screening.\\4\\ Instead, the \n     credit issuers have spent a reported $40 million last year on \n     lobbyists and lawyers to urge Congress to become the \n     collection agent for their bad loans--even as their profits \n     reach into the billions of dollars.\n       We strongly believe that the underlying provisions of S. \n     625 would disproportionately affect working families and the \n     constituencies that comprise the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights.

I ask \nunanimous consent that prior to a vote on this amendment the proponents \nand opponents will have at least a couple of minutes on either side to \nexplain this amendment to our colleagues, since it is a bit \ncomplicated. There are pieces to it. Two minutes may not be enough; \nmaybe 3 minutes on a side to explain what is in this amendment prior to \nthe vote, whenever that occurs, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I know other colleagues want to be heard. I thank the \nindulgence of my colleagues on the floor for listening to this debate.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, one of the provisions of the bill before \nthe Senate today would ``amend the Federal Reserve Act to broaden the \nrange of discount window loans which may be used as collateral for \nFederal Reserve notes.'' This legislation was considered by the House \nBanking Committee and has been referred to the Senate Banking \nCommittee. It is now being offered as an amendment to the bankruptcy \nbill to expedite its enactment prior to the adjournment of the \nCongress.\n  The currency collateral legislation would expand the field of assets \nthat the Federal Reserve may use to collateralize Federal Reserve \nnotes. All currency in circulation must be backed by specific assets, \nbut much of the collateral that the Federal Reserve accepts for \ndiscount window loans is ineligible under current law for use to back \nthe currency. The changes put in place by this legislation will allow \nthe Federal Reserve to apply all eligible discount loan assets to \ncollateralize the currency.\n  This legislation poses some risks unless adequate safeguards are in \nplace. The Federal Reserve applies a discount to each type of asset \nused as collateral. Broadening the scope of eligible assets makes it \neven more imperative that strict and aggressive discounting be applied \nto any assets used to back U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve should \ndiscount aggressively these assets through an objective and clearly \ndefined process that leaves no room for doubt that our currency is \nfully backed by reliable assets. At the most basic level, when valuing \nthese assets this should be our general rule: when in doubt, discount.\n  Failure to discount collateral assets aggressively would do more than \nthreaten the safety and soundness of the Federal Reserve's balance \nsheet; it would threaten the U.S. economy and all economies that rely \non a stable dollar. Many countries around the world recently have \nlearned a painful lesson on the value of a sound currency.\n  We must remember that any country can engage in monetary \nmismanagement, and most have at some point in time. The United States \nmust avoid that path. With a currency that is considered a stable \nmedium by U.S. citizens and a store of value by both domestic and \nforeign investors, the Federal Reserve must hold sound money paramount \nas it implements this important change in currency collateral \nrequirements. It has taken nearly two decades to rebuild the reputation \nof the dollar after the inflation of the Carter years. Today, ``sound \nas a dollar'' has meaning here and all over the world. We must do \nnothing to undermine it.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise to clarify my two votes today on \namendments to the bankruptcy reform legislation to increase the minimum \nwage by $1.00, from $5.15 to $6.15 per hour. Let me begin by saying \nthat I preferred the approach taken by Senator Kennedy's amendment to \nincrease the minimum wage in two increments over the next fourteen \nmonths.\n\n[[Page S14394]]\n\n  As my colleagues are aware, an increase in the minimum wage is needed \nfor our Nation's workers. At our current minimum wage of $5.15 per \nhour, many of our workers are unable to support themselves and their \nfamilies. In response to this need, I voted against a motion to table \nthe Kennedy amendment because I believe workers should receive the \nincrease over fourteen months, as opposed to the twenty-nine months \nproposed in the Domenici amendment. I also preferred the Kennedy \napproach because the business tax incentives offered in the amendment \nwere fully paid for. On the other hand, the Domenici amendment provided \n$75 billion in business tax incentives to be funded by projected budget \nsurpluses which may, or may not, materialize. Nevertheless, to its \ncredit, the Domenici amendment offered provisions related to health \ninsurance deductibility, and the permanent extension of the Work \nOpportunity Tax Credit--two important legislative items.\n  It is no secret that our economy is strong. Inflation is low and the \neconomic arguments against raising the minimum wage are attempts not \nparticularly persuasive. In fact, a recent editorial in the Providence \nJournal stated that ``. . . higher wages often mean greater loyalty and \neffort on the part of employees. Thus, whatever the increment of a \nhigher minimum wage, that cost could be more than offset by higher \nrevenue and profits from increased productivity and reduced turnover, \nhiring, and training costs. . . . Congress ought to do it.''\n  However, when the Kennedy amendment was tabled, I thought it was \nimportant to have, at the very least, some version of a minimum wage \npackage approved by the Senate. Thus, I then voted in favor of the \nDomenici amendment. Although it is not an ideal package, I am hopeful \nthat an agreement can be reached on a sensible, bipartisan approach to \nraising the minimum wage once the House passes its own version of the \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues find that common ground, which in the \nend, will help our economy and our working families. We ought to do it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment I will offer requires the \nFederal Reserve to submit a report to the Senate and House Banking \nCommittees concerning: (1) whether the location of the residence of an \napplicant for a credit card is considered by a financial institution in \ndetermining whether the applicant should be granted such card; and (2) \nthe purposes for which such location is taken into consideration by \nsuch institution.\n  Mr. President, an individual's credit worthiness should be judged on \nhis or her own credit history and not on where that individual happens \nto live. The stereotyping of consumers based on where they live is a \nsocial evil with very negative social consequences. The Congress has \nbeen instrumental in formulating legislation that seeks equal credit \nopportunity for all. If creditworthy persons can be rejected on account \nof his or her place of residence, our work is incomplete. Credit \napplicants should be considered on the basis of their individualized \ncreditworthiness and not on the basis of place of residence.\n  Mr. President, this amendment requires that the Federal Reserve \nreport be submitted not later than six months after the date of \nenactment of this act. I understand that the committee has no \nobligation to this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nmy amendment be printed following my remarks. The amendment is as \nfollows:\n\n\n                              section 415\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I want to discuss a measure that \nwill deal with a problem with the pension limits in section 415 of the \nTax Code as they relate to multiemployer pension plans. This is a \nproblem I have been trying to fix for years.\n  Section 415, as it currently stands, deprives working people of the \npensions they deserve. In 1996, Congress addressed part of the problem \nby relieving public employees from the limits of section 415. It is \nonly proper that Congress does the same for private workers covered by \nmultiemployer plans.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How does the current language of section 415 deprive \nworkers of the pensions they earn?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is a good question. It is a difficult issue that \npoints to the complexity of the current Tax Code. Section 415 \nnegatively impacts employees who have had various employers. Currently, \nthe pension level is set at the employee's highest consecutive 3-year \naverage salary. With fluctuations in industry, often times employees \nhave up and down years rather than steady increases in their wages. \nThis is especially true for those in the construction industries and \nother sectors that fluctuate with the local economic conditions. \nFluctuations in work and income from year-to-year can skew the 3-year \nsalary average for the employee, resulting in a lower pension when the \nworker retires.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senior Senator from Alaska have any examples \nof how section 415 negatively impacts workers in multiemployer plans?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Budget Committee chairman for asking about \nsection 415's real impact. An example of section 415's impact \nillustrates how unfairly the current law treats working people in \nmultiemployer plans. Take, for instance, a woman who held two jobs \nbefore retiring. Upon leaving her first job she had accrued a monthly \nretirement benefit of $474 per month. In her second job she was \nemployed for 15 years by a local union and her highest annual salary \nwas $15,600. When she retires she applies for pension benefits from the \ntwo plans by which she was covered. She had earned a monthly benefit of \n$1,000 from the one plan and combined this with the monthly benefit of \n$474 from the second plan for a total monthly income of $1,474 or \n$17,688 per year. She looked forward to receiving this full amount \nthroughout her retirement. However, the benefits had to be reduced by \n$202 per month, or about $2,400 per year to match her highest annual \nsalary of $15,600. The so-called ``compensation based limit'' of \nsection 415 of the Tax Code did not to take into account disparate \nbenefits, but intended only to address people with a single employer \nlikely to receive steady increases in salary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does this affect all retirees with pension plans?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. Section 415 treats public employees differently from \nworkers in multiemployer plans. If she had been a public employee \ncovered by a public plan, her pension would not be cut. This is because \npublic pensions plans are not restricted by the compensation-based \nlimit language of section 415. This robs employees in multiemployer \nplans of the money they have earned simply because they were not public \nemployees.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How does the current treatment of section 415 comport \nwith recent efforts to increase pension education and to encourage \npeople to save for retirement?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We do look for ways to encourage people to save for \nretirement and we try to educate people of the fact that relying on \nSocial Security alone will not be enough. Yet the law may penalize many \nprivate sector employees in multiemployer plans by arbitrarily limiting \nthe amount of pension benefits they can receive. It is wrong, and it \nshould be fixed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How would the proposed changes to section 415 impact \nthe treasury?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last year that \nthe changes adopted by the Senate on July 30th and included in my \nproposal would result in a tax expenditure of $4 million in the first \nyear, $26 million over 5 years and $69 million over 10 years. It is a \nmodest price to pay to ensure that people who have worked all their \nlife can get the retirement benefits they are entitled to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is not a new issue, is it?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. It is an issue I have been involved with since the \nmid-1980's. Since that time we have seen thousands of working people in \nmultiemployer plans retire with benefits below what they actually \nearned. I cosponsored S. 1209 with Senator Murkoswki in this session to \naddress the problems of section 415. The provisions of that bill were \naccepted by the Senate Finance Committee and were included in section \n346 of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 passed by the Senate. That \nprovision would have:\n  (1) Eliminated the application of the 100 percent of compensation \ndefined benefit plan limit for multiemployer plans;\n  (2) Not allowed multiemployer plans to be aggregated with other plans\n\n[[Page S14395]]\n\nmaintained by an employer contributing to the multiemployer plan in \napplying the limits on contributions and benefits except in applying \nthe define benefit plan dollar limitation;\n  (3) Applied the special rules for defined benefit plans of \ngovernmental employers to multiemployer plans, thus eliminating the \nhigh-three-year average limitation; and\n  (4) Increased reductions of the dollar limit prior to age 62 for \ndefined benefit plans of governmental employers and tax-exempt \norganizations, qualified Merchant Marine plans and multiemployer plans \nfrom $75,000 to 80 percent of the defined benefit dollar limit.\n  In addition, measures to relieve the inequity of applying the three \nyear high average had been passed three times prior to the passage of \nthe Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 by the Senate, most recently in the \n1997 Taxpayer Relief Act.\n  The provisions contained in the Domenici Amendment to the bankruptcy \nbill would:\n  (1) Increase the limit for defined benefit plans from $90,000 to \n$160,000;\n  (2) Increase the limit to be adjusted before the Social Security \nretirement age from $90,000 to $160,000; and\n  (3) Increase contribution limits from $30,000 to $40,000.\n  While these proposals are important to ensuring retirees get the \nbenefits they deserve, they do not go far enough to create parity \nbetween retirees in multiemployer plans and retirees in public plans.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Note that the Senate Finance Committee approved most of \nthe provisions outlined by Senator Stevens and later all of the \nprovisions in his proposal were included in the Senate version of the \nTaxpayer Refund Act of 1999 that passed the Senate on July 30th. The \nproblems for working people in multiemployer plans associated with \nsection 415 concern me and I understand the Budget Chairman will join \nme in working to secure the provisions described by Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. The assistant majority leader is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the distinguished budget chairman and the \nassistant majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14395-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, it was recently reported that Department \nof Justice anti-trust chief Joel Klein attended a party to celebrate \nJames Glassman's new book ``Dow 36,000.'' During the party, Mr. Klein, \nwho is prohibited from buying and selling stocks while he serves in his \ncurrent post, was overheard saying to the author, ``Wow. Dow 36,000--I \nhope it'll wait until I get out of office.'' Mr. Glassman reportedly \nresponded that Mr. Klein was already doing his part to keep the Dow \ndown.\n  Mr. President, I am here to report that not even Joel Klein and the \nDepartment of Justice can shake the confidence of investors all across \nthis great land who responded to Judge Jackson's Findings of Fact with \na mild yawn. Apparently, investors understand that punishing trail \nblazing companies that have brought dramatic and positive change to \nconsumers never has been, and never should be, the American way.\n  Despite the Government's attempts to turn the public against \nMicrosoft, Microsoft continues to be one of the most respected \ncompanies in America. A majority of Americans believe Microsoft is \nright and the Government is wrong in this current lawsuit. In fact, a \nGallup poll conducted over the weekend suggested that 67 percent of \nAmericans still have a positive view of Microsoft despite the efforts \nof the Federal Government.\n  Judge Jackson made clear early in the case that he shared the \nadministration's desire to punish Microsoft for being too successful. \nHis Findings of Fact do not remotely reflect the phenomenal competition \nand innovation that is taking place in the high-tech industry every \nday. Reading the Findings, it is clear that even this judge could not \ndocument tangible consumer harm. Judge Jackson's thesis is that \nMicrosoft is a tough competitor and that that toughness must stifle \ninnovation and must harm consumers. But the judge could document no \ntangible harm * * * and this is why he will be reversed.\n  When you look at the world around us, whether in the workplace, at \nhome, in schools, you see first-hand how 25 years of innovation in the \nhigh-tech industry has empowered and enriched people from all walks of \nlife.\n  Every family and every community in America has benefited from the \ninformation revolution fueled by Microsoft. Sitting on the desktop in \nevery office, school and hospital is a machine that brings power \ndirectly to people. Ten years ago only governments and large \ninstitutions had the power that so much information and knowledge \nbrings. Today, because of competition among software and Internet \nbusinesses, that power runs to people and to families in cities and \ntowns everywhere.\n  While the trial was going on, the high-tech industry has changed \ndramatically and reinvented itself a dozen times. Competition is alive \nand well and consumers are reaping the benefits.\n  Do the following numbers sound like they come from an industry that \nis stifled by monopolistic practices?\n  In 1990, there were 24,000 software companies. Today there are \n57,000. And this growth shows signs of accelerating even further.\n  The high-tech industry accounts for 8.4 percent of America's GNP and \none-third of our economic growth.\n  This year, the software industry alone will add almost $20 billion in \nexports to America's balance of trade.\n  It is particularly amazing that Judge Jackson found that barriers to \nentry into the market are too high. Apparently Linus Torvalds didn't \nget that memo. The 21-year-old student at the University of Helsinki \nrecently disseminated into cyberspace the code for a computer operating \nsystem he had written. This experiment has evolved into the Linux \noperating system, which now has over 15 million users and is supported \nby such industry heavyweights as IBM, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, \nGateway, Compaq, and Sun Microsystems.\n  Also fascinating is the fact that the co-founder of Netscape, Marc \nAndreessen, created the technology for the Netscape web browser when he \nwas a student at the University of Illinois. Four years later, the \ncompany he founded sold for $10 billion. Clearly, anyone with a great \nnew idea can compete in this fast-paced competitive economy.\n  Although Microsoft is at the center of this fantastic growth that has \nhelped the economy and brought incredible technological advances to \nconsumers, its position as a market leader is not secure. It remains \ntrue that anyone, from any background, can by hard work and \ndetermination, take on the most successful corporation of the 20th \ncentury. As the explosive growth of Linux shows, Microsoft, too, must \nbe allowed to compete, or be relegated to the slow lane of the \ninformation superhighway.\n\n  The competitive environment in high-tech has never been stronger. \nEvery day new alliances change the face of the industry. America Online \nhas transformed itself into a web, software, and hardware dynamo by \npurchasing Netscape, forming an alliance with Sun Microsystems, and \ninvesting heavily in Gateway. It is competitors like this who are \npositioned to ensure that vigorous competition, which is a boon to \nconsumers, will lead the way into the 21st century.\n  Should the Federal Government intervene, our entire economy will \nsuffer. By picking winners and losers, stifling innovation and \nattempting to regulate through litigation, the Federal Government can \ndo immeasurable harm to an industry it admits it doesn't even \nunderstand. Need I remind you that these are the same people who have \nbrought you models of efficiency such as the IRS?\n  Regardless of the exponential growth and vigorous competition in the \nhigh-tech industry, Judge Jackson seems convinced that consumers have \nbeen harmed by Microsoft. This he believes despite the testimony of the \ngovernment's own witness, MIT professor\n\n[[Page S14396]]\n\nFranklin Fisher, who when asked whether consumers have been harmed by \nMicrosoft, responded, ``On balance, I'd think the answer is no.''\n  Nevertheless, I was stunned when listening to Joel Klein proclaim \nthat the Findings were great news for consumers. When is it good news \nfor consumers to learn that the Federal Government is now running the \nhigh-tech industry? When Bill Gates, Scott McNealy (Sun CEO), or the \nhead of a new high-tech start-up want to integrate new products or \nfeatures into their software they will first have to get clearance from \nthe de facto CEO of high tech, Joel Klein.\n  Speaking of the Associate Attorney General, if you were watching CNN \nlast Friday evening without the volume on, you would have thought from \nthe looks on their faces that Janet Reno and Joel Klein had just won \nthe POWERBALL lottery or been given $10 million dollars by Ed McMahon. \nMr. President, I repeat--this decision is not good news for consumers. \nThe findings represent a terrible precedent, not only for Microsoft, \nbut for high-tech companies in Silicon Valley, Austin, TX and the \nDulles corridor in Virginia. The message is: if you get big, or too \nsuccessful--you will be punished. The Department of Justice is keeping \nan eye on you--be careful or you may be next. The capital of the high-\ntech world isn't in Silicon Valley or Washington State, it's \nconveniently located within our Department of Justice on Pennsylvania \nAvenue.\n  But, Mr. President, I have been a frequent critic of the Department \nof Justice's attacks against Microsoft and the high tech industry for a \nlong time now. I will continue to ask questions--I will continue to \ndefend the ability of high-tech companies that wish to compete without \nthe threat of government intervention. I will continue to be deeply \nconcerned about how the Department of Justice's action on Friday will \njeopardize America's standing as a global leader in the field of \ntechnology. The Department of Justice has now invited Microsoft's \nforeign competitors to use their governments to limit Microsoft's \nsuccess. Joel Klein has just tilted the balance of power in favor of \nhigh tech companies abroad, in effect saying to Microsoft: Slow down \nand let the rest of the world catch up.\n\n  But I am sure many of these same questions and concerns will be \nraised by Microsoft's own employees next week when they host Vice \nPresident Gore on the Redmond campus.\n  To conclude, I repeat: This case should be dropped because antitrust \nlaws exist to protect consumers--people who buy goods and services. \nAntitrust laws were not created to protect Microsoft's competitors, but \nthat is what this Justice Department is doing. It is using the power of \nthe Federal Government to punish Microsoft for being too successful in \ncomparison to its competitors.\n  In the end, I believe, higher Federal courts will throw this case \nout. The truth and the correct legal analysis will prevail--Microsoft \nhas not harmed consumers and, thus has not violated our antitrust laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14396-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14396-S14397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, two major debates are taking place in the \nCongress and in the White House at the present time, two major debates \nrelating to education.\n  Tomorrow we are likely to take up an amendment to establish the \nTeacher Empowerment Act. And tomorrow we will almost certainly deal, \nfinally, with the appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human \nServices, an appropriations bill that includes billions of dollars for \npublic education in the United States of America.\n  There is a profound difference between the President of the United \nStates and what I believe is a majority of the Members of both Houses \nof Congress over how that money on education should be spent. This \nmorning's Washington Post summarizes that argument in quotations from \nour majority leader, Senator Lott, and the President of the United \nStates.\n  Senator Lott said:\n\n       The big issue is, who controls it? Will Washington \n     bureaucrats assert and control where this money is used, or \n     will there be some discretion at the local level, based on \n     what local needs are, whether it's books or computers or \n     training for teachers, or for teachers themselves?\n\n  The President of the United States, according to the Washington Post:\n\n       . . . told reporters that the federal money for new \n     teachers does not belong to states and local school \n     districts. ``It's not their money,'' he said.\n\n  What arrogance. The money does not belong to President Bill Clinton. \nThis is money that comes out of the pockets of the American people \nacross the United States, money they want to be used on the most \neffective possible education for their children.\n  The American people believe very firmly that decisions relating to \nthe education of their children can be made more effectively and more \nsensitively at home by elected school board members, by \nsuperintendents, by principals, by teachers, and by parents than they \ncan be by bureaucracies in the Department of Education in Washington, \nDC, or even by that national superintendent of public instruction, the \nPresident of the United States.\n  In fact, during the course of this debate over whether or not we \nshould grant more authority to local school districts and to teachers \nand parents, a number of studies have come out on the question of \nwhether the primary need in education in the United States is more \nteachers.\n  One of them comes from my own State from the Joint Legislative Audit \nand Review Committee, the ``K-12 Finance and Student Performance \nStudy.'' That study, just a little bit earlier this year, stated:\n\n       An analysis of 60 well-designed studies found that \n     increased teacher education, teacher experience, and teacher \n     salaries all had a greater impact on student test scores per \n     dollar spent than did lowering the student-teacher ratio. \n     According to one researcher, ``Teachers who know a lot about \n     teaching and learning and who work in settings that allow \n     them to know their students well are the critical elements of \n     successful learning.'' Given limited funds to invest, this \n     research suggests considering efforts to improve teacher \n     access to high quality professional development. A recent \n     national survey of teachers found that many do not feel well \n     prepared to face future teaching challenges, including \n     increasing technological changes and greater diversity in \n     the classroom.\n       The legislature's approach to funding K-12 education is \n     consistent with the JLARC [Joint Legislative Audit and Review \n     Committee] and national research. The legislature has \n     provided additional funding for teacher salaries, staff \n     development, and smaller classes, with more funding going to \n     support teachers and less for reducing the student-teacher \n     ratio.\n\n  In fact, the chart accompanying this study shows that increasing \nteacher salaries is 4 times more cost efficient than reducing class \nsize, increasing teacher experience is 4.5 times more cost efficient \nthan reducing class size, and increasing teacher education is 5.5 times \nmore cost efficient than reducing class size. Given this information, \nit is clear that the President of the United States is putting politics \nahead of academic achievement for our children.\n  There is another interesting statement on this subject written in \nApril of this year by Andy Rotherham at the Progressive Policy \nInstitute, an arm of the Democratic Leadership Council. He now, \nincidentally, works for the President. But he wrote in April:\n\n       . . . President Clinton's $1.2 billion class-size reduction \n     initiative, passed in 1998, illustrates Washington's \n     obsession with means at the expense of results and also the \n     triumph of symbolism over sound policy. The goal of raising \n     student achievement is reasonable and essential; however, \n     mandating localities do it by reducing class sizes precludes \n     local decision-making and unnecessarily involves Washington \n     in local affairs.\n       During the debate on the Clinton class-size proposal, it \n     was correctly pointed out that research indicates that \n     teacher quality is a more important variable in student \n     achievement than class size. In fact, this crucial finding \n     was even buried in the U.S. Department of Education's own \n     literature on the issue.\n\n  Finally, another quite liberal organization, the Education Trust, \nagrees that we cannot afford to make schools hire unqualified teachers. \nKati Haycock, executive director of the Education Trust, said \nyesterday:\n\n       The last thing American children need--especially low-\n     income children--is more under-qualified teachers. If the \n     White House hopes to ensure that the Class Size Reduction \n     program will boost student achievement, it should accept the \n     Congressional Republicans' proposal that would allow only \n     fully qualified teachers to be hired with these funds.\n       Teacher quality matters, and it matters a lot. Highly \n     qualified teachers can help all students make significant \n     achievement gains, while ineffective teachers can do great\n\n[[Page S14397]]\n\n     and lasting damage to students. The difference between an \n     effective teacher and an ineffective teacher can be as much \n     as a full grade level's worth of academic achievement in a \n     single year. That--for many students--can make the difference \n     between an assignment to the ``honors/college prep track'' \n     and an assignment to the remedial track. And that assignment \n     can be the difference between entry into a selective college \n     and a lifetime at McDonald's.\n       Yes, small classes matter, but good teaching matters more. \n     Our kids can have it all--smaller classes and better \n     teachers. But first, the adults in Washington need to put \n     aside the partisan bickering and remember what really \n     matters--the best interests of American students.\n\n  This is exactly what we are trying to do. It is what we are trying to \ndo in this last great appropriations bill: Saying yes, more teachers is \na very important priority, but school districts ought to be able to \ndecide that perhaps teacher training is even more important than that, \nor perhaps there is another higher education priority in their schools, \nin their communities, in their States.\n  Tomorrow, when we debate whether or not to add to this bill the \nTeacher Empowerment Act, we will be doing exactly the same thing, \nsaying we in this body in Washington, DC, do not know all the answers, \nthat there is not one answer for 17,000 school districts across the \ncountry; and we ought to trust the people who are spending their lives \neducating our children.\n  This is a vitally important debate, and one that the children can \nonly win if we grant flexibility to those who are providing them with \nthat education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14397-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATOR LUGAR'S 9,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the Senate that \ntoday the senior Senator from Indiana cast his 9,000th vote as a Member \nof this body.\n  Throughout his career, Senator Lugar has compiled a 98 percent voting \nattendance record. He did not miss a single vote during the entire \n105th Congress. Along with our colleagues from Maryland, Senator \nSarbanes, and Utah, Senator Hatch, Senator Lugar stands next in line to \njoin the Senate's 10,000 vote club. A mark reached by only 21 Senators \nin history.\n  Many of you know of Senator Lugar's passion for long-distance \nrunning. On occasion, a vote has been called while he was on one of his \nlate afternoon runs on the Mall. Senators are not surprised when they \nencounter their colleague from Indiana in running shoes after double-\ntiming back to the Senate Chamber for the vote. Casting 9,000 Senate \nvotes is a fitting accomplishment for a long-distance runner who \nalready stands as the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Indiana's \nhistory.\n  I am honored to have the opportunity to work with Senator Lugar and \npleased to recognize him on this historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14397-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14397-S14398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a moment about another \nsubject. I do not want to interfere with this important debate, but I \nthink the subject I want to speak about is important in its own right. \nI want to put my colleagues and the public on notice about what is \nhappening.\n  Probably we have all received more telephone calls and more letters \non the so-called Satellite Home Viewer Act than any issue we have dealt \nwith in this Congress. This is an issue that flows from the fact that \npeople who have satellite dishes, especially people who live in the \ncountry, want to have access to their nearest television station. It is \nsomething we all understand. For those of us who live in the country, \nit is something we want.\n  The House of Representatives adopted a very good bill that would \nallow negotiations between satellites and local television stations \nwith a goal of bringing the local television station into every living \nroom and den in America. This would be a great boon to people who have \nsatellite dishes in rural areas.\n  That bill was adopted in the House 422 to 1 on April 27. On May 20, \nthe Senate unanimously adopted a similar bill. These bills are very \nstrongly supported. We are all getting hundreds of telephone calls in \nsupport of them. They do what each caller wants, and that is make it \npossible for people, especially in rural areas, who have satellite \ndishes to get the news and the weather from the local station, however \nfar away that may be.\n  The problem is, for some unexplainable reason--at least unexplainable \nto logic--in the conference, rather than adopting the House bill or the \nSenate bill or something in between, the conferees apparently decided \nthat not every problem in the world was solved, and therefore in an \neffort to try to solve problems which were not part of either bill, \nthey decided to put the American taxpayer on the hook for a $1.25 \nbillion loan guarantee.\n  I want to make it clear. This loan guarantee was not part of the \nSenate bill for which we voted unanimously. It was not part of the \nHouse bill that passed 422 to 1. It was produced out of whole cloth in \nconference when the basic idea was there are additional problems that \nmight be dealt with, so as a result, we want to simply add $1.25 \nbillion.\n  When you approach the people who added it, you get the idea this is \nsomehow for small business. But when you read their bill, one of the \nloans can be as large as $625 million. The two obvious beneficiaries \nare two companies, one of which saw its equity value go up 4\\1/2\\ times \nthe rate of the growth of the Dow Industrial Index over the last 12 \nmonths; the other one saw its equity value go up 49 times as fast as \nDow did in the last 12 months.\n  You might wonder why these two extraordinarily successful businesses \nwith an explosion in their equity value, as measured by the value of \ncommon stock, suddenly need the taxpayer to come forth and sign a loan \nguarantee of $1.25 billion to get to the bottom line. I am for the \nsatellite bill. I voted for it in the Senate. I would like to see it \npassed. I think it is an important piece of legislation. But I am \nadamantly opposed to Members of the House and the Senate simply \ndeciding to put the taxpayer on the hook for $1.25 billion, with a \nprovision that was in neither the House bill or Senate bill, a \nprovision that cannot be justified by any logic whatsoever.\n  I want to make it clear if that bill comes to the floor of the Senate \nand it has that loan guarantee in there obligating the American \ntaxpayer for $1.25 billion, money that was not in the House bill, was \nnot in the Senate bill, I intend to object to its consideration, and it \nwill not become law in this millennium.\n  I cannot speak beyond this thousand years. But I can assure you that \nunder the rules of the Senate, it will not become law before the turn \nof the new millennium, if then.\n  One of the authors of this provision, referring to me, said:\n  I don't think anybody would want to have the reputation of having \ncost millions of Americans the loss of their network signal, so I don't \nanticipate problems on either floor.\n\n  My response to our colleague in the House is: Anticipate problems on \nthe floor of the Senate. And if anyone is endangering the ability of \nAmericans to get the local television signal, it is not me; it is those \nwho have added a $1.25 billion loan guarantee in this bill.\n  I know there are going to be a lot of people calling my office and \nothers. Here is my message: If you are for the satellite bill, if you \nwant to be able to get your local television station, don't bother \ncalling me. Call the people who want to add to a conference report this \n$1.25 billion giveaway which was not voted on in either House of \nCongress, and say to them: Quit trying to give my money away and give \nme my local television signal.\n  I am not going to let this bill be adopted this year with that $1.25 \nbillion giveaway in it. It is not too late. The conferees can come to \ntheir senses and take this provision out. It was not in either bill. It \nshould not have been there to begin with. We can have the satellite \nbill passed by the end of tomorrow's business. But if it is not taken \nout, it is not going to be adopted. I wanted to come over and make that \nclear so everybody would know exactly where we are. If you want this \nbill, insist the $1.25 billion giveaway be taken out of it. We have the \nability and we should make it possible for people in the country to get \nthe adjacent cities' TV stations. I am for that. I am a direct \nbeneficiary of it. Many of the people I care about are.\n\n[[Page S14398]]\n\n  But the idea we are talking about giving away $1.25 billion in loan \nguarantees to some of the most well-off companies in America as a rider \non this bill is the kind of outrageous legislative action that has to \nbe stopped. If they think because the underlying bill is so popular \nthat everybody is just going to turn the other way and let this $1.25 \nbillion giveaway occur, they are wrong. I do not intend to do that. It \nis not going to pass the Senate unless they take it out.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14398-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORGAN DONATION REGULATORY RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to address a potential \ncrisis in our nation's system of organ donation. Last year, the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed regulations that \nwould have had devastating effects on community-based transplant \nprograms by prohibiting states from offering organs to their own \nsickest residents before making them available nationwide. In response \nto the overwhelming concerns of patients and health care professionals \nnationwide, Congress delayed the implementation of the regulations and \ncommissioned a study by the Institute of Medicine to examine the impact \nof the regulations on the nation's current system.\n  The study drew several conclusions which demonstrate how the current \nsystem is effective and why the proposed regulations are misguided. For \nexample, the study found that the current system of organ \ntransplantation is reasonably equitable and effective for the sickest \npatients. It also found that the proposed regulations would increase \nthe overall cost of transplantation in the U.S. Perhaps most important, \nthe study found that the current system does not discriminate because \nof race or any other factors and that the waiting list for an organ \ntransplant are treated fairly.\n  These conclusions support the long-held concerns of the organ \ntransplant community that the regulations, which would direct the \nUnited Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to develop a system which \nremoves geography as a factor in organ donation, may actually increase \nwaiting times in states, like New Jersey, with efficient systems.\n  These unintended consequences will be felt most greatly among \npatients with disadvantaged backgrounds. In New Jersey, we are \nextremely fortunate to have a system that is fair and efficient. New \nJersey's unique system of certificate of need and charity care ensures \nthat the most critical patients get organs first regardless of \ninsurance. A national organ donation system will force the smaller \ntransplant centers that serve the uninsured and underinsured to close \nas the vast majority of organs go to the handful of the nation's \nlargest transplant centers with the longest waiting lists. Without \naccess to smaller programs, many patients will be faced with the \nhardship of registering with out-of-state programs that may turn them \naway due to lack of insurance. Those who are accepted will be forced to \ntravel out of state at great medical risk and financial hardship.\n  In light of these concerns, the conferees of the FY 2000 Labor, \nHealth, and Human Services, and Education bill included language \nextending the moratorium on the regulations for a period of three \nmonths. While this is a very positive step, I am concerned that this \nmoratorium would not provide sufficient time for Congress to consider \nthis issue as part of the debate on the reauthorization of the National \nOrgan Transplant Act.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Sessions, Hutchinson, \nWarner, Mack, Shelby, Nickles, Inhofe, Thurmond, Ashcroft, McConnell, \nRoberts, Kohl, Feingold, Cleland, Hollings, Breaux, Graham, Collins, \nGrams, Lautenberg, Enzi, Murskowski, Gorton, Landrieu, Robb, and \nLincoln to introduce the Organ Donation Regulatory Relief Act of 1999.\n  This bipartisan legislation will delay the Secretary's ability to \nissue regulations regarding the nation's organ donation system until \nCongress considers the complex issues surrounding organ procurement and \nallocation as part of the reauthorization of the National Organ \nTransplant Act.\n  For the past 15 years, the national organ procurement and allocation \nsystem has existed without federal regulation. During this time, each \nState has developed a unique system to meet their individual needs. \nMany states, such as New Jersey, have focused on serving uninsured and \nunderprivileged populations. Clearly improvements can be made to \nincrease the efficiency and effectiveness of organ donation nationwide. \nThe legislation will ensure Congress has ample time to consider these \nimportant issues prior to allowing the implementation of far-reaching \nregulations that will revamp the system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14398-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FOREST FIRES IN EASTERN MONTANA\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, when a hurricane engulfs the Eastern \nseaboard or an earthquake shatters the lives of Californians, we reach \nout with compassion to those people who are affected. America's hearts \nand minds always turn to those who are adversely impacted by these \nevents.\n  I bring to your attention a devastating natural disaster that \nrecently struck the Eastern portion of my home State, Montana. On \nHalloween night, it seems as if Mother Nature played a frightening \ntrick on many rural Montanans. A storm below out of the Rocky Mountains \nand onto the plains of the short grass prairie with winds in excess of \n70 miles per hour.\n  These violent winds stoked several prairie fires. The wild fires \nimmediately became uncontrolled infernos as they are driven along by \nthe gusts, in some cases the wall of flames spanning many miles.\n  The tiny town of Outlook, MT, was evacuated in the face of this \nunmanageable fire. Unfortunately, the town itself was laid to waste in \nthe wake of the flames. Thankfully, due to the early evacuation and \nquick response of the authorities, no lives were lost.\n  Two hundred and fifty miles south of Outlook another town was facing \nthe same fate. The rural community of Ekalaka was also under evacuation \norders. A different fire of the same magnitude was moving toward town \nas it was swept ahead of the horrific winds. This fire spared the \ncommunity but still left ruin in its wake. It is estimated that ten to \ntwenty sections of good winter grazing land has been destroyed along \nwith miles of fences and corrals. That is between 6,400 and 12,800 \nacres that producers will not be able to use for winter feed. The \nincreased costs of buying hay to feed livestock will put a great burden \non ranchers already experiencing financial hardship within their \nindustry.\n  Not only were these two communities impacted, there were several \nother communities in Eastern Montana that sustained damage due to \nfires. I offer my sincere gratitude to all of those who worked so \ndiligently to fight these fires and save property and lives.\n  We now have Montanans facing the onset of winter, homeless, without \nthe security of their places of business, and agricultural producers, \nwithout feed for their livestock. Just as we unite together for those \nwho are struck by other natural disasters, I hope that you will join \nwith me in support of these Montanans, who lost not only their homes \nbut their livelihoods.\n  Entire communities have been adversely affected by this unforeseen \nemergency and I will be watching closely to see that these folks \nreceive the aid needed to rebuild their lives. Montanans have suffered \ngreat losses no less devastating than the hurricanes on the East Coast \nand they too deserve a helping hand in their time of need.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to each and every individual whose \nlives are in disarray due to this sudden tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14398-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14398-S14400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COST ESTIMATE ON EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1712, the Export \n     Administration Act of 1999.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Mark \n     Hadley (for federal costs), Hester Grippando (for \n     governmental receipts), Shelley Finlayson (for the state and \n     local impact), and Patrice Gordon (for the private-sector \n     impact).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barry B. Anderson\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 1712--Export Administration Act of 1999\n       Summary: The bill would replace the expired Export \n     Administration Act (EAA), thereby updating the system for \n     applying export controls on American business for national \n     security or foreign policy purposes. Since the expiration of \n     the EAA in 1994, the President has extended export controls \n     pursuant to his authority under the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act. The Bureau of Export Administration \n     (BXA) in the Department of Commerce administers export \n     controls. The bill also would prohibit participation in \n     boycotts imposed by a foreign country against a country that \n     is friendly to the United States, and would preempt state \n     laws pertaining to participation in such a boycott.\n       CBO estimates that funding the Department of Commerce to \n     carry out the bill would cost $255 million over the 2000-2004 \n     period if funding is maintained at the 1999 level or $280 \n     million if funding is increased each year for anticipated \n     inflation. Because the bill would increase penalties for \n     violations of export controls, CBO estimates governmental \n     receipts would increase by $18 million over the 2000-2004 \n     period. CBO estimates that half that amount would be spent \n     from the Crime Victims Fund, and BXA would pay informants \n     about $500,000 a year. Because the bill would affect direct \n     spending and receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) \n     excludes from the application of that act any legislative \n     provisions that are necessary for the national security. CBO \n     has determined that several provisions of S. 1712 fall within \n     that exclusion. One section of the bill that does not fall \n     within that exclusion contains an intergovernmental mandate \n     as defined in UMRA, but CBO estimates that the costs of this \n     mandate would not be significant and would not exceed the \n     threshold established in that act ($50 million in 1996, \n     adjusted annually for inflation). Provisions of the bill that \n     are not excluded from the application of UMRA also contain \n     private-sector mandates. CBO estimates that the direct \n     costs of those mandates would be below the threshold \n     established in UMRA ($100 million in 1996, adjusted \n     annually for inflation).\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of the bill is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 370 \n     (commerce and housing credit).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n \n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 1999   2000   2001   2002   2003   2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 CHANGE IN REVENUES AND DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Revenues............      0      0      0      6      6      6\nEstimated Budget Authority....      0      0      0      1      4      4\nEstimated Outlays.............      0      0      0      1      4      4\n \n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEAA Spending Under Current Law\n by the Bureau of Export\n Administration:\n  Budget Authority \\1\\........     44      0      0      0      0      0\n  Estimated Outlays...........     43      6      2      0      0      0\nProposed Changes:\n  Estimated Authorization           0     59     56     57     59     61\n   Level \\2\\..................\n  Estimated Outlays...........      0     50     53     57     59     61\nEAA Spending H.R. 973 by the\n Bureau of Export\n Administration:\n  Estimated Authorization          44     59     56     57     59     61\n   Level \\1\\..................\n  Estimated Outlays...........     43     56     55     57     59     61\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1999 level is the amount appropriated for that year. BXA has not\n  yet received a full-year appropriation for 2000.\n\\2\\ The estimated authorization levels include annual adjustments to\n  cover anticipated inflation, resulting in an estimated cost of $280\n  million over the next five years. Alternatively, if funding is not\n  increased to cover anticipated inflation, the cost would be $255\n  million over the 2000-2004 period.\n\n       Basis of estimate: S. 1712 would authorize the BXA to \n     control the export of certain items from the United States \n     for national security or foreign policy purposes. Generally, \n     export controls would not apply to products that are mass-\n     market items or available from foreign sources at a \n     comparable price and quality. Under the bill, exporters who \n     are executing existing contracts that involve items which are \n     prohibited from being exported for foreign policy reasons \n     would be allowed to fulfill such contracts. CBO estimates \n     that provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1999 \n     would increase revenues by about $6 million a year beginning \n     in fiscal year 2002 and direct spending by about $1 million \n     in 2002 and $4 million a year thereafter. In addition, we \n     estimate that implementing the bill would cost $280 million \n     over the 2000-2004 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts.\n     Revenues\n       Since the expiration of the EAA in 1994, criminal and civil \n     penalties for violating export control laws have been \n     collected under the Economic Emergency Powers Act. The bill \n     would transfer the authority to levy fines back to the EAA \n     and would significantly raise the maximum criminal fines that \n     could be imposed--up to $10 million for corporations or $1 \n     million for individuals--for violation of export controls. \n     Under the bill, civil penalties of up to $1 million could \n     also be imposed for violations of the law. On average, about \n     two years elapse between the initial investigation of \n     violations of export control law and the collection of a \n     penalty. Fines are based on the law in force at the start of \n     an investigation. CBO does not expect penalties under the new \n     law to be collected until fiscal year 2002. Based on \n     information from the Department of Commerce, CBO estimates \n     that enacting the bill would increase receipts from penalties \n     by $6 million a year beginning in 2002.\n     Direct spending\n       Collections of criminal fines are recorded in the budget as \n     government receipts (i.e., revenues), which are deposited in \n     the Crime Victims Fund and spent in subsequent years. We \n     estimate half of the increase in governmental receipts \n     attributable to this bill ($3 million a year), would be for \n     criminal fines. Thus, the additional direct spending for this \n     provision of the bill also would be about $3 million a year \n     beginning in 2003, because spending from the Crime Victims \n     Fund lags behind collections by about a year.\n       Under current law, BXA pays informants negligible amounts \n     each year for leads on possible violations of export control \n     law. The bill would allow BXA to pay informants the lesser of \n     $250,000 or 25 percent of the value of fines recovered under \n     the act as a result of the information provided. This \n     provision would greatly expand the authority to pay \n     informants. Based on information from BXA, CBO estimates \n     that the bureau would pay informants about $500,000 a \n     year, starting in 2002.\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       BXA is responsible for implementing the EAA. Based on \n     information from the Department of Commerce, CBO estimates \n     that BXA's budget for this work was about $44 million in \n     1999, and about $45 million would be needed in 2000 to \n     continue this work. S. 1712 would authorize the appropriation \n     of such sums as may be necessary to continue this work, to \n     hire 20 employees to establish a best practices program for \n     exporters, to hire 10 overseas investigators, and to procure \n     a computer system for export licensing and enforcement. Based \n     on information from BXA, CBO estimates that implementing a \n     best practices program for exporters would cost about $4 \n     million a year, stationing overseas investigators would cost \n     about $5 million a year, and procuring the computer system \n     would cost about $5 million in 2000. Any such spending would \n     be subject to appropriation of the necessary amounts. \n     Assuming historical spending patterns and allowing for cost \n     increases to cover anticipated inflation, CBO estimates that \n     implementing the bill would cost $280 million over the 2000-\n     2004 period.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets pay-as-you-go procedures \n     for legislation affecting direct spending or receipts. The \n     net changes in outlays and governmental receipts that are \n     subject to pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in the \n     following table. For the purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go \n     procedures, only the effects in the budget year and the \n     succeeding four years are counted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n                                           ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             2000   2001   2002   2003   2004   2005   2006   2007   2008   2009\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays........................      0      0      1      4      4      4      4      4      4      4\nChanges in receipts.......................      0      0      6      6      6      6      6      6      6      6\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments: \n     Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes from \n     the application of that act legislative provisions that are \n     necessary for the national security. CBO has determined that \n     several provisions of S. 1712 fall within that exclusion. One \n     section of the bill that does not fall within that exclusion \n     contains an intergovernmental mandate as defined in UMRA. \n     That section would preempt a state or local government's \n     ability to participate in, comply with, implement, or furnish \n     information regarding restrictive trade practices or boycotts \n     fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other \n     countries. Because state and local governments would not be \n     required to take any\n\n[[Page S14400]]\n\n     action, however, CBO estimates that the cost of this \n     preemption would be insignificant.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: Section 4 of UMRA \n     excludes from the application of that act legislative \n     provisions that are necessary for the national security. CBO \n     has determined that several provisions of S. 1712 fall within \n     that exclusion. Provisions of the bill that do not fall \n     within that exclusion contain private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA.\n       By replacing the expired Export Administration Act, the \n     bill would impose private-sector mandates on exporters of \n     items controlled for foreign policy purposes. (At the same \n     time the bill would put into place certain new procedural \n     disciplines on the President in the implementation of such \n     controls.) In addition, S. 1712 would impose a mandate by \n     prohibiting anyone, with respect to that person's activities \n     in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, \n     from participating in boycotts imposed by a foreign country \n     against a country that is on good terms with the United \n     States.\n       The bill also would make changes in the system of foreign \n     policy export controls that would lower costs to the private \n     sector of complying with requirements under that system. In \n     particular, S. 1712 would restrict the use of foreign policy \n     export controls on agricultural commodities, medicine, or \n     medical supplies. According to information provided by \n     several government and industry sources, the nonexcluded \n     provisions of the bill would largely either codify current \n     policies with respect to export controls or make reforms that \n     could reduce requirements on exporters of controlled (and de-\n     controlled) items. Thus, CBO expects that the direct costs of \n     complying with private-sector mandates in the bill would fall \n     well below the statutory threshold established in UMRA ($100 \n     million in 1996, adjusted annually for inflation).\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Mark Hadley.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I met with Alan \nStepakoff, the father of six-year old Joshua, who was among five \nvictims--three children ages 5 and 6; one 16-year old teenager and a \n68-year old adult--gunned down at a Los Angeles Jewish community center \nlast August by Buford Furrow, Jr., a white supremacist. Fortunately, \nthe son and the four other victims survived the shooting and are on \ntheir way to recovery. Unfortunately, within minutes of this tragic \nshooting, the Nation learned that the same assailant had murdered in \ncold blood U.S. Postal Service carrier Joseph Ileto, a Filipino \nAmerican, on account of his race.\n  This episode is but one of a growing list of hate crimes targeting \nplaces once believed to be safe havens--including schools, synagogues, \nchurches, community centers. This incident is a grim reminder of how \nhate can provoke violence against the young and innocent. Unless we \naddress this hatred and violence in our communities immediately and \nunequivocally, the list of such horrific events will certainly grow.\n  We have before us legislation that would address this growing blight \non our society: the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. This important \nlegislation was introduced by my colleague Senator Kennedy and adopted \nby the Senate as part of Fiscal Year 2000 Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations Act.\n  Unfortunately, the measure was stripped from the first Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill presented to the President. I urge \nmy colleagues to insist on this provision's inclusion in the next such \nbill.\n  This legislation is urgently needed to compensate for two limitations \nin the current law. First, even in the most blatant cases of racial, \nethnic, or religious violence, no federal jurisdiction exists unless \nthe victim was targeted while exercising one of six federally protected \nactivities--attending a public school or college; participating in a \nservice or program sponsored by a state or local government; applying \nfor or engaging in employment; serving as juror in a state court; \ntraveling or using a facility of interstate commerce; and enjoying the \ngoods or services of certain places of public accommodation.\n  These limitations have led to acquittals in several of the cases in \nwhich the Department of Justice has determined a need to assert federal \njurisdiction and has limited the ability of federal law enforcement \nofficials to work with state and local officials in the investigation \nand prosecution of many incidents of brutal, hate-motivated violence.\n  A second limitation in current law is that it provides no coverage \nwhatsoever for violent hate crimes committed because of bias based on \nthe victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. As a result, \nfederal authorities cannot prosecute individuals who commit violent \ncrimes against others based on these characteristics. This is \nespecially disturbing given the fact that according to the FBI, crimes \nagainst gays, lesbians and bisexuals ranked third in reported hate \ncrimes in 1998, registering 1,260 or 15.6 percent of all reported \nincidents. Unfortunately, there are those who would stop short of \nsupporting this important legislation because it extends protections to \nthose targeted on account of their sexual orientation.\n  The hate crimes legislation introduced this year would remedy would \nexpand the legislation I authored in 1994, which provided a bifurcated \ntrial and enhanced penalties for felonies spawned by hate that took \nplace either on federal land or in pursuance of a federally protected \nright (such as voting or attending a public school).\n  The Hate Crimes Protection Act broadens federal jurisdiction to cover \nall violent crimes motivated by racial or religious hatred, regardless \nof whether the victim was exercising a federally protected right. It \nwould also include sexual orientation, gender and disability to the \nlist of protected categories within current federal hate crime law, \nprovided there is a sufficient connection with interstate commerce.\n  At the same time, federal involvement would only come into play if \nthe Attorney General certifies that federal prosecution is necessary to \nsecure substantial justice. In recent years, the existing federal hate \ncrimes law has been used only in carefully selected cases where the \nstate criminal justice system did not achieve a just result.\n  For many years I have been deeply concerned about hate crimes and the \nimmeasurable impact they have on victims, their families and our \ncommunities. As I have previously mentioned, in 1993 I sponsored the \nHate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act, which was signed into law in \n1994 as a part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n1994. Today, I believe the Hate Crimes legislation will build on this \neffort by modifying the current laws to allow the federal government to \nprovide the vital assistance to states in investigating of crimes of \nthis magnitude.\n\n  Sadly, hate crimes are becoming too commonplace in America. According \nto the U.S. Department of Justice, in 1998, 7,775 hate crime incidents \nwere reported in the United States and 9,722 victims. Of that total, \n4,321 or 58 percent of the crimes were committed on account of the \nvictim's race. More than 3,660 victims of anti-Black crimes; 1,003 \nvictims of anti-White crimes, 620 victims of anti-Hispanic crimes; and \n372 victims of anti-Asian/Pacific Islander crimes.\n  In that same year, 1,390 or roughly 16.0 percent of the victims were \ntargeted because of their religious affiliation. The number of anti-\nJewish incidents is second only to those against blacks and far exceeds \noffenses against all other religious groups combined. Moreover, while \nby most accounts anti-Semitism in America has declined dramatically \nover the years, the level of violence is escalating.\n  Civil rights groups as well as federal and State authorities agree \nthat in the last five years, reported hate crimes have increased \nannually, from 5,932 in 1994 to 7,755 in 1998. As of 1998, four States \nstill do not collect hate crime data. Yet, even if all States were \nreporting these incidents, it would be difficult to gauge the true \nextent of the hate crime problem in this country because bias-motivated \ncrimes typically are under reported by both law enforcement agencies \nand victims.\n  And while these crimes have become more numerous, they have also \nbecome more violent. Monitoring groups have observed a shift from \nracially-motivated property crimes, such as spray painting, defacement \nand graffiti, to personal crimes such as assault, threat and \nharassment. On a national scale, according to FBI statistics, almost 7 \nout of 10 hate crimes are directed against people. Nonhate crimes, by\n\n[[Page S14401]]\n\ncontrast, are directed against people only 11 percent of the time.\n  This legislation is long overdue. Looking back on this year alone, \none might recall the litany of news stories describing a murderous \nrampage at a school in Littleton, Colorado; or the drive-by shooting \nattacks on Jews, an African-American, and Asian-Americans in Chicago, \nIllinois; or the two pipe-bomb explosions at the predominantly African \nAmerican Florida A University; the brutal murders of two gay men in \nCalifornia; or the torching of synagogues in California; all despicable \nacts of virulent hatred.\n  We should work to give our citizens protection from those who would \ndo them harm simply based upon their race, religion, gender, \ndisability, or sexual orientation. Enactment of the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act would send a message to our nation and the world that \nthe singling out of an individual based on any of these characteristics \nwill not go unnoticed or unpunished.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to enact this important \nlegislation prior the end of this session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14401-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14401-S14402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUPERFUND TAX RENEWAL\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I stand again in opposition to a proposal \nfrom my Democratic colleagues that attempts to renew the expired \nSuperfund tax for the sole purpose of raising revenue to meet budgetary \ntargets. We are once again faced with a policy which advances spending \nfor social programs on the backs of small business owners and \nmunicipalities without any attempt to reform the current program.\n  I am puzzled at this current proposal for several reasons. First, it \nis estimated that the Superfund Trust Fund has maintained a surplus of \n$1.5 billion. In addition, appropriation committees in the House and \nSenate have allotted $700 million in general revenue to supplement \nfunding for the program through Fiscal Year 2000. According to an \nanalysis conducted by the Business Roundtable, it is estimated that the \nSuperfund Trust Fund will have sufficient funding through 2002 without \nthe need for further taxes.\n  Even without the imposition of taxes, contributions to the Superfund \nTrust Fund are plentiful. In 70 percent of all sites responsible \nparties paid cleanup costs in addition to reimbursing the EPA for its \noversight expenditures. These payments, and the collection of all \nrelated costs to the EPA, are applied to the Trust Fund. In the \nremaining 30 percent of cases, the responsible parties pay the EPA to \nscrub the contaminated site in addition to paying for oversight costs. \nAccording to the Chemical Manufacturers Association, only 3 out of 150 \nsites required sole payment from general revenues because the parties \ninvolved either abandoned the site or were bankrupt.\n  The premise behind the initial creation of the Superfund program was \nto facilitate a rapid cleanup of hazardous waste sites nationwide, with \nthe responsible parties largely funding the site cleanup. This is a \nrelatively simple and logical concept known as the ``polluter pays'' \nprinciple.\n  Secondly, the EPA has admitted that the Superfund program is drawing \nto a close. Under such conditions, there is no compelling reason to \nreinstate a tax to fund a program which is not only flawed, but is \nbeing phased out.\n  I ask my colleagues to heed the advise of numerous business and \ntaxpayer organizations that oppose the reinstatement of the superfund \ntax in the absence of overall reform. I ask unanimous consent that the \nletters from the following organizations be printed in the Record:\n  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Petroleum Institute, The Business \nRoundtable, American Insurance Association, and Americans for Tax \nReform.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Americans For Tax Reform,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Bill Archer,\n     Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman: I am writing to support your publicly-stated \n     opposition to the imposition of any new taxes related to \n     potential Superfund reform legislation pending in the House \n     of Representatives. At a time when the non-Social Security \n     budget surplus is projected to grow as high as $1 trillion, \n     Congress should not be raising taxes to pay for more \n     government spending.\n       Furthermore, the Corporate Environmental Income Tax (CEIT) \n     that expired in 1995 is a direct tax on corporate income. \n     Thus, if any one of the 209 of Members of the House \n     Republican Conference who signed the Americans for Tax Reform \n     pledge not to raise new personal or corporate income taxes \n     were to vote for them, they would be in direct violation of \n     their signed pledge.\n       The House of Representatives has correctly rejected \n     President Clinton's proposal for new taxes on at least three \n     different occasions, most frequently by passing the Sense of \n     Congress that Congress should not raise taxes to pay for more \n     government spending. We hope that this steadfast opposition \n     to any new tax increases continues in the debate over reform \n     of the Superfund program.\n       In summary, no new taxes means no new taxes, and we support \n     your position not to raise any taxes to pay for more \n     spending.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Grover G. Norquist.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Business Roundtable,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1999.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: The Business Roundtable is opposed to \n     renewal of the Superfund taxes for purposes of raising \n     revenue to meet budgetary targets. By law the Superfund Trust \n     Fund was intended to be dedicated to cleaning up sties on the \n     National Priorities List (NPL) and not for other budgetary \n     purposes. The Superfund is funded both by Superfund taxes, \n     but also from recovery of cleanup costs from responsible \n     parties. Members of The Business Roundtable fall \n     significantly in both categories.\n       We strongly believe that the taxes, which expired in 1995, \n     should not be renewed for the following reasons:\n       1. The Superfund Trust Fund has an estimated surplus of \n     $1.5 billion. In addition, both the House and Senate \n     appropriations committees have allotted $700 million in \n     General Revenues to supplement funding for the Superfund \n     program through fiscal year 2000. Under our analysis, we \n     estimate Superfund will have sufficient funding through the \n     year 2002 without renewal of the taxes.\n       2. Under the Superfund law's liability scheme, responsible \n     parties largely fund site cleanup regardless of the \n     imposition of taxes. The preponderance of funding for \n     Superfund is driven by the law's liability scheme, not from \n     taxes. Most ``deep pocket,'' responsible parties contribute \n     well in excess of their actual fair share of responsibility. \n     Where EPA spends money from the Trust Fund for cleanup, these \n     expenditures are also in large measure recovered from \n     responsible parties.\n       3. The Business Roundtable continues to support the \n     principle that Superfund taxes be tied to comprehensive \n     Superfund reform, including Natural Resource Damages. Both \n     the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the \n     House Commerce Committee have reported reform bills. \n     ``Regular order'' would suggest that any future federal \n     funding of superfund be tied to an assessment of the impact \n     of these reforms on the future of the program. Taxes should \n     not be renewed absent comprehensive reform, and the current \n     bills need to be evaluated against this criterion. In \n     particular we would note that at this point the legislation \n     is silent on Natural Resource Damages, which we believe must \n     be reformed.\n       4. Finally, both House and Senate Appropriations for EPA \n     include directives for a study of the costs to cleanup the \n     remaining sites on the NPL and bring the Superfund program to \n     successful closure. We support such an analysis to determine \n     what the actual cost estimates are for Superfund. Under an \n     earlier Roundtable analysis we concluded that it would be \n     feasible to finance the current program at a rate of about 20 \n     to 30 new sites per year (historical average) with an \n     endowment representing approximately four years worth of \n     funding (historical tax rates). There is no compelling reason \n     to reinstate the taxes at their full rate for five years to \n     fund a program which is phasing down. Nor should funding be \n     renewed absent completion of the analysis directed by both \n     House and Senate committees.\n       We urge you to resist any efforts to reinstate Superfund \n     taxes for budgetary purposes, absent the Congressionally \n     directed evaluation of future program costs and reform \n     legislation, which includes Natural Resource Damages.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert N. Burt,\n         Chairman, The Business Roundtable Environmental Task \n           Force, Chairman and CEO, FMC Corporation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   American Insurance Association.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard A. Gephardt,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker, Mr. Leader, Mr. Gephardt, and Mr. \n     Daschle: In recent days proposals have been made to reinstate \n     the expired Superfund taxes to provide revenue offsets for \n     non-Superfund spending--such as the tax extenders bill now \n     under consideration--without enacting meaningful Superfund \n     reform. In addition, as this session of Congress\n\n[[Page S14402]]\n\n     draws to a close, there may be separate attempts to attach to \n     unrelated legislation Superfund liability carveouts that \n     shift cleanup costs to parties who remain liable at Superfund \n     sites. We are writing to express our continued strong \n     opposition to both of these proposals.\n       No Superfund Taxes Without Meaningful Superfund Reform.\n       Reinstatement of the expired Superfund taxes prior to \n     enactment of meaningful Superfund reform would effectively \n     prevent legislative reform of the Superfund program. That's \n     because under the ``pay-go'' rules of the Federal budget \n     laws, any Superfund reauthorization bill that includes \n     mandatory spending provisions must also include provisions to \n     reinstate the expired Superfund taxes or provide equivalent \n     offsetting revenues ``within the four corners of the bill'' \n     to keep it deficit neutral. Thus, if the Superfund taxes were \n     to be enacted prior to consideration of a Superfund reform \n     bill, Superfund reform could not be enacted without finding a \n     new source of revenue, essentially an impossible task.\n       The taxes should not be prematurely reinstated, especially \n     now that legislative reform of the Superfund program is \n     within our reach. On August 5th the House Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Committee voted 69-2 to report H.R. 1300, the \n     Recycle America's Land Act, introduced by Subcommittee \n     Chairman Sherry Boehlert. That bill now has some 138 \n     cosponsors, divided nearly equally between Democrats and \n     Republicans. The House Commerce Committee is expected to mark \n     up a similar bill, Mr. Greenwood's H.R. 2580, in the next few \n     days.\n       In the meantime, the Superfund program does not need \n     reinstatement of the taxes to continue operating at full \n     speed. The current surplus in the Superfund Trust Fund, \n     combined with continued appropriations at the most recent \n     level, mean the program will be fully funded through at least \n     FY 2002. In fact, even with enactment of legislative reform, \n     reinstatement of the taxes at the full levels that existed \n     prior to their expiration in 1995 is not necessary. As the \n     Boehlert bill, H.R. 1300, recognizes, any new funding for \n     Superfund should be carefully tailored to reflect the \n     declining needs of the cleanup program, which EPA has \n     acknowledged is winding down.\n       No Cost-shifting for Liability Exemptions.\n       We are also concerned that there may be attempts this year \n     (just as there were last year) to provide liability relief \n     for certain parties by inserting amendments into \n     appropriations bills or other legislation. While we do not \n     oppose properly-crafted liability exemptions for small \n     business, municipalities, recyclers, or others, we do oppose \n     exemptions that shift their shares of cleanup costs to the \n     remaining Superfund parties. Under the Boehlert bill, H.R. \n     1300, these costs would be part of the orphan share paid by \n     the Trust Fund. This is the original purpose for which \n     Congress created the Trust Fund.\n       There is certainly no justification for shifting these \n     orphan shares to the other parties. In fact, in recent years \n     even EPA has consigned much more of these orphan shares to \n     the Trust Fund. Shifting costs to other parties is not only \n     unfair, it is one of the main causes of litigation and the \n     attendant cleanup delay at Superfund sites.\n       In sum, we urge you to oppose reinstatement of the expired \n     Superfund taxes without enactment of meaningful Superfund \n     reform. We also urge you to oppose Superfund liability \n     exemptions which shift cleanup costs to other liable parties.\n       If we can provide assistance or further information on \n     these or other related matters, please do not hesitate to \n     call on us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert E. Vagley,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                                 American Petroleum Institute,\n\n                                                  October 8, 1999.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard A. Gephardt,\n     House Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker, Senator Lott, Mr. Gephardt, and Senator \n     Daschle: We are writing to express our concern about possible \n     efforts to reinstate the expired Superfund taxes. Proposals \n     to reinstate the taxes solely as a means of raising revenue \n     without enacting comprehensive reform of the Superfund \n     program are very disturbing to us. Raising taxes on industry \n     runs directly counter to congressional efforts to reduce \n     taxes. Furthermore, the Superfund taxes do not need to be \n     reinstated to keep the program going. Under the most recent \n     appropriations and funding mechanisms, the trust fund will \n     remain solvent for many years as the program begins to wind \n     down. Even by EPA's own admission the Superfund program is \n     drawing to a close.\n       The Superfund program was created to address a broad \n     problem--paying for the cleanup of ``orphan'' waste disposal \n     sites (those that were either abandoned or whose owners were \n     bankrupt). A wide range of individuals, businesses and \n     government entities have contributed to Superfund sites, \n     therefore general revenues should pay for the program's \n     administrative costs and the clean-up of sites where the \n     responsible parties cannot be found.\n       In 1995, the Superfund taxes expired. EPA officials claim \n     that using general revenues rather than industry-specific \n     taxes to pay for Superfund would ``constitute paying for \n     polluters' clean-ups on the `backs' of the American \n     taxpayers.'' That is simply not true. Private sector \n     responsible parties (the so-called ``polluters'') have always \n     paid the majority of cleanup costs associated with the \n     program. In addition, all responsible parties continue to pay \n     their share of Superfund clean-up costs, even though the \n     dedicated taxes have expired. Under CERCLA's strict joint and \n     several liability standard, persons identified as \n     contributing wastes to a Superfund site are paying their \n     share (in addition to the shares of other contributors) of \n     the clean-up costs.\n       Even without industry tax revenues, Superfund will have \n     sufficient funding from general revenues, fines, penalties, \n     and profits on investments to support the program into Fiscal \n     Year 2002. For fiscal year 2000, the Appropriations \n     Committees have chosen to fund between $700 and $725 million \n     of the Superfund program from general revenues. In fact, \n     Congress can fund the entire program from general revenues, \n     according to the General Accounting Office and the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       Simply stated the Superfund taxes should not be \n     reinstated--instead, general revenues should continue to be \n     used to pay for the program. Reinstating industry-specific \n     taxes is not consistent with Congress' intent for the \n     program, that is, whenever possible, polluters should pay for \n     the costs of cleaning up the sites they helped contaminate. \n     The debate over Superfund should not be about reinstating the \n     taxes. It should be about winding down the program as it \n     completes its original mission and devolving the day-to-day \n     operation of the program to the states.\n           Sincerely,\n     Red Cavaney,\n       American Petroleum Institute.\n     Thomas J. Donahue,\n       Chamber of Commerce of the US.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, now is not the time to consider tax \nincreases to pay for government spending, especially at the same time \nwe are experiencing a non-Social Security surplus, projected to grow as \nhigh as $1 trillion over 10 years, and at a time when American citizens \nare paying taxes at the highest peacetime rate in history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14402-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14402-S14403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SAFEGUARDING OUR SECURITY\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, there are few matters of more \nimportance to the nation than the safeguarding of our security. Every \nday, tens of thousands of men and women wear the American uniform \nproudly in all the world's time zones while guarding against threats to \nAmerican citizens and our interests. Perhaps there is no more perilous \nenvironment in which our servicemen and women operate than beneath the \noceans. Because of the secrecy demanded by the myriad missions, Navy \nsubmariners have come to be known as the silent service. Often \nreluctant to speak on their own behalf, I commend to my colleagues \nattention the following article which is of great importance, not only \nto our nation's undersea warriors, but to the nation's security.\n  The commentary in Defense News touches upon an important opportunity. \nIt is the chance to secure more useful life from four Ohio-class \nsubmarines slated for retirement. The article suggests the possibility \nof converting them from their strategic nuclear duties into tactical \nTomahawk shooters able to provide our overseas warfighting commanders \nadditional striking capability.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Defense News, Mar. 29, 1999]\n\n        Converted Submarines Could Bolster U.S. Power Projection\n\n                           (By Ernest Blazar)\n\n       Power projection can be a difficult concept to understand \n     in the abstract. It is a nation's ability to make its \n     military might felt beyond its borders--as diplomacy's \n     coercive underpinning, deterrence or in actual combat.\n       American power projection has taken many forms in years \n     past; the man-o-war, expeditionary Marines, the dreadnaughts \n     of the Great White Fleet, the aircraft carrier, the Army's \n     82nd Airborne division and the Air Force's expeditionary \n     wings. Different crises have demanded different kinds of U.S. \n     power projection at different times.\n       In recent years, however, U.S. power projection at the \n     lethal end of the spectrum combat has increasingly relied \n     upon a single tool. Since its 1991 Persian Gulf war debut, \n     the Tomahawk cruise missile has become the weapon of choice \n     when crises demand swift and accurate U.S. military response.\n\n[[Page S14403]]\n\n       They have cleared safe lanes for U.S. warplanes through \n     enemy air defenses. Tomahawks have hit terrorists. And they \n     have destroyed sites thought to hold mass destruction \n     weapons. Over 700 have been used in six different strikes \n     since 1991.\n       As Tomahawks' use grows so do the strains upon their launch \n     platforms in the shrinking 300-ship fleet. So some in the \n     Navy and Congress are seeking new ways to quickly boost the \n     number of Tomahawk missiles--the power projection tool of \n     choice--available to overseas U.S. commanders.\n       Attention has now fallen upon four Ohio-class submarines to \n     be retired in 2003 and 2004. A now overdue Navy study to \n     Congress reveals how these Cold War-era submarines, that once \n     aimed nuclear-tipped missiles at the Soviet Union, can easily \n     be converted to carry hundreds of Tomahawk missiles.\n       Doing so would give the U.S. Central Command in the Persian \n     Gulf, for example, one such submarine year-round, thereby \n     almost doubling the in-theater inventory of Tomahawks. That \n     would take the pressure off other Navy ships needed \n     elsewhere, increase deterrence and strengthen U.S. combat \n     power should strikes be necessary.\n       The Navy's imminent report has found that the four Ohio-\n     class subs could be fitted with Tomahawks and Navy Sea, Air \n     and Land (SEAL) commando gear for $500 million each. \n     According to New Jersey Senator Robert G. Torricelli, ``It's \n     an inexpensive way of adding a new dimension to U.S. \n     warfighting capabilities.''\n       All but two of the 24 strategic missiles tubes aboard the \n     Ohio-class boats could be refitted to accept a canister \n     holding six or seven Tomahawk missiles each, yielding a \n     maximum of 154 cruise missiles. If some SEALs are aboard, \n     along with their special gear, only 98-140 Tomahawks could be \n     loaded--still more than any other Navy ship carries.\n       The full warload--all 154 Tomahawks--can be ``ripple-\n     fired'' from the submerged submarine in less than six \n     minutes. That is key because it allows the submarine to \n     quickly, quietly and safely remove itself from the launch \n     site after firing all its missiles.\n       A submarine-launched strike of that size offers two main \n     advantages. First, by virtue of its stealth, a submarine can \n     launch a surprise attack from within an enemy's early-warning \n     perimeter. With no advance warning, large numbers of enemy \n     targets can be hit before they are hidden, dispersed or \n     emptied. There is no build-up of U.S. forces to warn an enemy \n     of a pending attack. Second, submarines are less vulnerable \n     to attack and counter-attack than are surface ships. If \n     embarked SEALs are the best weapon for a mission, the \n     converted Ohio-class boats can house 102 such men for short \n     durations and 66 SEALs nearly indefinitely. This allows for a \n     sustained special operations campaign, rather than solitary \n     strikes, from a stealthy, invulnerable platform.\n       SEALs can also use the submarine's silos that once held \n     nuclear-tipped strategic missiles to store their unique gear. \n     There is ample room for a hyperbaric chamber to recompress \n     divers if needed and a warming chamber which helps SEALs \n     recover from prolonged exposure to cold water. The converted \n     Ohio-class boats could also serve as `mother-ships' to \n     special underwater SEAL delivery craft like the Advanced \n     Swimmer Delivery Vehicle minisub.\n\n\n                               Innocuous\n\n       Even though the four converted Ohio-class boats would no \n     longer carry nuclear-tipped missiles, strategic arms control \n     treaty limits would still apply to these boats. This means \n     the ships' missile tubes, now filled with tactical missiles \n     and Navy SEALs, would still be counted against ceilings that \n     cap the number of U.S. and Russian strategic weapons. The \n     Navy's study to Congress has found that, while complex, this \n     issue can be accommodated as has been done before for other \n     strategic missile submarines converted to special, tactical \n     duties.\n       The nation has a rare opportunity to swiftly and cheaply \n     boost its ability to project power. The conversion of these \n     four Ohio-class boats will complement, not compete with, \n     other Navy ships and Air Force expeditionary warplanes \n     deployed to overseas hot-spots. This chance to get new, \n     useful life out of old Cold War-era systems on the cheap is \n     the innovative and right thing to do for the Navy and the \n     nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14403-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN H. CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in memory and \ntribute to Senator John H. Chafee, who was for me not just a colleague \nand friend, but a mentor on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nfor the eleven years I have been in the Senate. Nearly every single \nenvironmental statute bears the strong stamp of his commitment and \nleadership; Superfund, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water \nAct, barrier beach legislation, transportation laws, the Oil Pollution \nProtection Act. The list goes on and on.\n  When John Chafee first announced that he was not going to run for \nreelection, a lot of us who care about the environment realized what a \ngreat loss John Chafee's retirement would be. Now his sudden death \nreminds us all too quickly that he was an irreplaceable friend of the \nenvironment. He was a very sturdy, forthright, faithful leader at a \ntime when the number of legislators in his great party who consider \nthemselves environmental stewards grew smaller. This trend has been \ncontrary to the proud environmental tradition of the Republican party \nthat goes back to the days of Teddy Roosevelt and contrary to what I \nfind to be the opinion of Republicans in Connecticut who are quite \nenthusiastically supportive of environmental protection. Senator Chafee \nheld high the banner of that tradition.\n  He always considered himself a centrist and I know that what he meant \nby that was not that he was neutral, but that he was committed to \nbringing different groups and factions within Congress and outside \ntogether to get things done. One of my first and best experiences as a \nSenator was in 1990 when we were considering the Clean Air Act \nAmendments. Senator George Mitchell, then Majority Leader, pulled a \ngroup of us together with representatives of the Bush Administration in \nhis conference room. John Chafee was there day after day, and night \nafter night, throughout long, tedious negotiations. But in the end, he \nhelped put the pieces together for us to adopt a bill signed by \nPresident Bush that has clearly made our nation's air healthier and \ncleaner.\n  He was also a leader in the effort to protect against global climate \nchange, urging the President to adopt an international framework to \naddress the issue as early as 1988, and supporting the efforts to \nachieve the signing and ratification of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. We went to Kyoto, Japan for the critical \nmeetings there to forge further agreements to fulfill the objectives of \nthe Framework Convention agreement. In that difficult setting John sent \na message to the countries of the world which were being quite critical \nof the United States' position, that there was bipartisan support in \nCongress for taking action to address global warming. He and I then \nworked together with Senator Mack to sponsor what we thought was a \nmodest proposal in this Congress to begin to give companies that reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions the promise of credit if and when we adopt a \nmandatory system for controlling that kind of air pollution. I remember \nlaughing with John that we must be on the right path because our \nproposal was opposed by both sides of the debate.\n  John Chafee was the quintessential New Englander; he was a \nstraightforward, very honest, very civil man. He also was a great \noutdoorsman. I think that some of the work he was proudest of involved \nhis efforts to protect natural resources. He played a critical role in \nexpanding our National Wildlife Refuge System and worked hard to \nconserve wetlands. He instituted several reforms to tax policy to \nencourage the preservation of open space. He was a great advocate right \nup to his death for full and permanent funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, which is so important to preserving open spaces in \nour states.\n  John Chafee was a good man and a superb chairman. Always respectful \nto those who came before our Committee, he wanted to get things done. \nWhen it came to the environment, he really did get things done. I'll \nmiss him. We'll all miss him. The Lord's good earth will miss him, \nbecause he was indeed a good friend. My wife Hadassah joins me in \nextending condolences to Ginny Chafee and the entire family. We all do \ntruly share in their loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14403-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14403-S14405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to make additional remarks \non a provision contained in the Manager's Amendment to the Trade and \nDevelopment Act of 1999 adopted last week by voice vote. The manager's \nincluded a Sense of the Senate on Tariff Inversions that has raised \nsome concerns with several of my colleagues. I would like to engage \nthem in a discussion of the issue on the floor of the United States \nSenate.\n  There is a company in my state, The Warren Corporation, that \nspecializes in the manufacture of high quality woolen and worsted \napparel fabric. This company has been producing luxurious\n\n[[Page S14404]]\n\nfabrics for decades and recently invested heavily in the U.S. to become \na fully integrated textile mill with a diverse set of manufacturing \noperations. I mention Warren today because this proud contributor to \nthe New England textile heritage could be adversely affected by a \ntariff provision recently adopted by voice vote in the Manager's \nAmendment to the Trade and Development Act of 1999. I would like to \ncall on some of my esteemed colleagues who I am sure have similar \nconcerns in their states. Senator Helms, is it not true that you have \nthousands of workers in the textile industry that could be adversely \naffected by this legislation.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President in responding to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut, it is certainly true that North Carolina is the \nlargest of the nation's textile and apparel states in terms of \nemployment. In fact, North Carolina employs over 200,000 workers in \nthis industry, many of which are directly involved in wool fabric \nproduction. For that reason, I share his deep interest in this wool \nfabric issue. I want to make it clear that any such legislation would \ninstitute a unilateral tariff reduction on the part of the U.S. I do \nnot believe that it is wise policy for the U.S. to simply reduce \nimportant tariffs and gain nothing in return. These same fabric makers \nare essentially precluded from shipping their products to many key \nmarkets overseas. My point is simply, if we want to consider reducing \nthese duties, it would be better done as part of the upcoming World \nTrade Organization talks later this month in Seattle. At the very \nleast, in that forum we would have the ability to gain some reciprocal \nmarket access to our manufacturers.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to also express my concern in regard \nto this wool fabric issue. Like my colleague from Connecticut, I have \ngreat respect for the workers and employers in the textile sector in my \nstate. In particular the Warren corporation was mentioned. Eleven years \nago, this company invested over $40 million in an abandoned textile \nfactory in Stafford Springs, Connecticut. For several years they \noperated at a loss as they fought for market share here in the U.S. \nHowever, they understood that if they produced a quality product at \nreasonable price, they would succeed. Today they are one of the most \nrespected suppliers of fine grade wool fabrics in the world, and they \nare providing nearly 300 jobs in a depressed area of my state. This is \nthe type of investment and the type of jobs that we want to attract to \nour region. As a result, we in Congress need to be very careful about \nproposals that would cut the legs out from under a company such as \nWarren. Instead of unilaterally cutting their tariffs, we should be \nsearching for ways to further encourage such investment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I too have an interest in this matter, \nbut from a different angle. The U.S. fabric industry consumes virtually \nall the wool fiber produced in the United States. My home state is a \nsignificant producer of wool. If we approve legislation that damages \nfabric makers, it will have a direct and adverse impact on wool \ngrowers. The growers in my state are already suffering from surging \nimports of lamb meat. In addition, the price of their wool has been \nseverely depressed due to the fact that wool from Australia and New \nZealand is routinely dumped on the world market. As a result, I am on \nthe record as strongly opposing any legislation that cuts U.S. wool \nfabric duties. It is critical that in the discussions of this issue \nmembers from the wool producing regions are fully informed and \ninvolved. We simply cannot accept a move that would take steps to \nappease suit makers without fully understanding and considering the \nimpact of such legislation all the way down the chain--from fabric \nmakers to wool growers.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to fully support the remarks of my \ncolleague from Colorado. The wool fiber industry in my state is \ncritical to our overall state economy,\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. And Senator Thomas, am I correct in noting that 23 \ndistinguished members of this body submitted a letter to the Chairman \nof the Finance Committee earlier this year expressing concern over \nlegislation that would threaten domestic textile producers?\n  Mr. THOMAS. That is correct. I was one of 23 signatories of a letter \ndated April 16, 1999, that provides several reasons why unilateral \ntariff reductions should be avoided. First, wool fabric similar to the \nforeign imported product, subject to tariffs, is already available from \ndomestic producers. Second, this is not the appropriate time to address \naccelerated tariff reductions as wool fabric tariffs are currently \nbeing reduced at the multilateral level. U.S. producers and textile \ncompanies have made investments and based business decisions on trade \nnegotiations that were reached under the North American Free Trade \nAgreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). If we are to \nconsider additional tariff reductions, those discussions should occur \nduring trade negotiations, instead of being legislated on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. U.S. manufacturers are the only customers domestic \nwool growers have; virtually no wool is exported. Wyoming is the second \nlargest wool producing state and because of already depressed wool \nprices, our growers can not break even, let alone turn a profit. \nAccelerating wool fabric tariff cuts, at this time, will only further \ndecrease fiber prices and sales, consequently putting U.S. wool growers \nand textile workers at risk. I thank my colleague, Senator Lieberman, \nfor his work on this crucial issue.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for his kind words. \nOn November 3, I presented legislative background on the wool tariff \nprovision to reflect the concerns of my constituents about any revision \nto tariff reduction and phase-out schedules that would unfairly alter \ntheir competitive posture and force layoffs. Specifically, I noted that \nthe language in the provision as originally proposed dinting the \ninclusion of the wool fabric industry was purposely deleted in the \nversion that passed in the Manager's Amendment, underscoring the \nSenate's clear intent that this provision is not directed at this \nsector.\n  Second, the provision specifically requires that full account be \ntaken of ``conditions'' in the various ``producing industry in the \nUnited States,'' indicating that whatever further action Congress may \nwant to consider in the future on this issue, or that the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative may raise in future negotiations, must assure fairness \nand equitable treatment to those currently producing in the United \nStates. Furthermore, the language specifically states that special \nattention and equity is to be provided to ``those currently facing \ntariff phase-outs negotaited under prior trade agreements.'' Since my \nconstituents in the wool fabrication sector specifically fall into \nexactly that posture, property relying on phase-out schedules \nnegotiated in prior trade agreements, this protection and assurance is \ndirected at their concerns, which, in turn, is why their industry \nsector was dropped from application of this provision.\n  Senator Helms, is it not true that Senators Moynihan and Roth \nprovided assurances that I would be given full notice of any \nconsideration of this issue in conference and that it will be resolved \nin a manner satisfactory to me in representative of my constituents \nconcerns?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is my understanding of your verbal agreement with the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we have reiterated our concerns \nconcerning the wool tariff provision with the hope that the leadership \nwill find a way to support the views of nearly one quarter of the \nSenate. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from \nApril 16, 1999, from 23 Senators opposed by any changes in wood tariffs \naddressed to Senator Roth.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1999.\n     Hon. William Roth\n     Chairman, Finance Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We write to express strong opposition to \n     S. 218, which is designed to reduce some and eliminate other \n     existing U.S. tariffs on certain types of wool fabric. This \n     bill is virtually identical to legislation introduced last \n     Congress, which drew widespread, adverse reaction from U.S. \n     producers of wool fiber, top, yarns, and fabrics, as well as \n     many in Congress.\n       Our continued opposition to this legislation is based on a \n     number of factors:\n       The fabric types covered by S. 218 are readily available \n     from U.S. producers.\n\n[[Page S14405]]\n\n       Wool fabric tariffs are already in the process of being \n     reduced, and as such there is no need for these additional, \n     unilateral cuts. In 1995 the WTO/Uruguay Round instituted a \n     phased 30% tariff reduction and import quota elimination for \n     the same products covered by S. 218.\n       Based on the trade laws and tariffs in place as a result of \n     the Uruguay Round/WTO and the NAFTA, hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in investments were made by the domestic wool fabric \n     industry to try to help ensure their survival. Changing the \n     rules of the game now by making additional, unforeseen tariff \n     cuts will undermine the integrity of these trade rules/\n     agreements and destroy these investments.\n       In preparation for the new WTO Round, the U.S. is \n     participating in multilateral trade talks this year. Rather \n     than sanctioning additional, unilateral U.S. tariff cuts, \n     Congress should instead instruct the Administration to focus \n     on improving foreign market access for U.S. produced wool \n     fabric and other textile products during these talks. We \n     believe that even those in Congress who may favor tariff \n     cuts, would understand that doing so outside the WTO \n     negotiating context is not in the best interests of the \n     United States, since there would be no possibility of using \n     these or any other cuts as a bargaining tool to get trade \n     concession in return.\n       These proposed cuts would have an extremely severe impact \n     on the approximately 90,000 U.S. workers whose livelihoods \n     are directly tied to the production of wool textiles.\n       The unilateral giveaway of U.S. wool fabric tariffs \n     mandated under S. 218 comes at a time when imports are \n     already at record levels. Adding to the current import crisis \n     in this sector is the fact that many Asian suppliers are \n     exporting these fabrics well below 1997 prices as a result of \n     the economic crisis in that region.\n       The flood of low cost imports has forced U.S. companies to \n     lay-off over 1,600 wool yarn and fabric workers in January \n     1999, alone. This is the continuation of a devastating trend \n     whereby nearly one-third of all U.S. wool yarn and fabric \n     jobs have been lost in recent years. Certainly, passage of S. \n     218 will result in the loss of thousands of additional jobs.\n       U.S. woolgrowers produce fine wools that go into the \n     fabrics covered by S. 218. U.S. wool, top, yarn, & fabric \n     manufacturers are the only customers U.S. woolgrowers have; \n     virtually no wool is exported. Due to surging wool textile \n     and apparel imports, U.S. wool fiber sales and prices have \n     been extremely depressed. Wool fabric tariff cuts will leave \n     woolgrowers with an even more diminished customer base for \n     their wool fiber, at a time when the lamb meat portion of \n     their business is also being severely harmed by increased \n     lamb meat imports.\n       For these reasons, we believe that you should oppose S. \n     218. Specifically, we encourage you to block the inclusion of \n     this legislation as part of any trade bill or other \n     legislation that your committee may approve in the 106th \n     Congress. Thank you for your consideration of our views on \n     this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Larry E.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for \nmore equitable policies relating to overtime pay for Federal employees, \nlimitations on premium pay, and the accumulation and use of credit \nhours; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n      EQUITABLE OVERTIME PAY FOR FEDERAL SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski, to introduce legislation to \npay overtime to federal managers and supervisors more equitably.\n  I'm proud of our federal workers. Despite seemingly constant \nassaults, our nations's civil servants have persevered to provide \ngovernment that is working better and more efficiently than ever. We've \nseen a streamlined federal government that's continually asked to \nimprove services to its customers--the American people. But with \nsmaller staffs and the push to increase the federal government's \nproductivity, workloads continue to grow. As federal employees' duties \ngrow, the need to work more overtime hours increases as well. Managers, \nsupervisors and other FLSA-exempt employees within the federal \ngovernment can receive overtime, but the current overtime cap presents \ntwo problems to these employees: they earn less working on overtime \nthan they do for the work they perform during the week and they earn \nless while working overtime than the employees they supervise. Who \nthen, can blame prospective candidates for supervisory or management \npositions for declining promotions when remaining in their current, \nnon-supervisory position can mean more money for their families? If the \nfederal government is to continue to recruit and retain a top-notch \nworkforce, then the present overtime cap is one issue that we need to \naddress.\n  Our legislation will ensure that supervisors and managers neither \nmake less working overtime than they would during regular work hours \nnor make less working overtime than those they supervise. This bill \nincreases the overtime cap from GS-10 step 1 to GS-12 step 1, the first \nadjustment in the overtime cap since 1966. Our bill doesn't mandate \nthat overtime be paid; overtime pay will be implemented as it is \ncurrently, based on personnel decisions made by individual agencies.\n  We should encourage incentives to attract bright and capable workers \nto join the management ranks of the federal government, and this bill \nis one such incentive. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nensure its consideration and favorable recommendation as quickly as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire):\n  S. 1886. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to permit the Governor of \na State to waive the oxygen content requirement for reformulated \ngasoline, to encourage development of voluntary standards to prevent \nand control release of methyl tertiary butyl ether from underground \nstorage tanks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n          oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Clean Air \nSubcommittee, in introducing a bill, S. 1886, to allow the governor of \na state to waive the oxygenate content requirement for reformulated or \nclean-burning gasoline. The bill also requires U.S. EPA to conduct a \nstudy on whether voluntary standards to prevent releases of MTBE from \nunderground tanks are necessary.\n  This is the fifth bill I have introduced in this Congress to address \nthe widespread contamination of drinking water by MTBE in my state. I \ndo this in hopes that this bill will be a straightforward solution to a \nvery serious problem--MTBE detections in ground and surface water in my \nstate and at lest 41 other states.\n  The Clean Air Act requires that cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline \n(RFG) be sold in areas with the worst violations of ozone standards: \nLos Angeles, San Diego, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, \nBaltimore, Houston, Milwaukee, Sacramento. (In addition, some states \nand areas have opted to use reformulated gasoline as way to achieve \nclean air.) Second, the Act prescribes a formula for reformulated \ngasoline, including the requirement that reformulated gasoline contain \n2.0 percent oxygen, by weight.\n  In response to this requirement, refiners have put the oxygenate MTBE \nin over 85 percent of reformulated gasoline now in use. MTBE stands for \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether. The problem is that increasingly, MTBE is \nbeing detected in drinking water. MTBE is a known animal carcinogen and \na possible human carcinogen, according to U.S. EPA. It has a very \nunpleasant odor and taste, as well.\n  The Inhofe-Feinstein bill, S. 1886, would allow governors, \nupon notification to U.S. EPA, to waive the 2.0% oxygenate requirement, \nas long as the gasoline meets the other requirements in the law for \nreformulated gasoline.\n\n  On July 27, the U.S. EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline \nrecommended that the 2 percent oxygenate requirement be ``removed in \norder to provide flexibility to blend adequate fuel supplies in a cost-\neffective manner while quickly reducing usage of MTBE and maintaining \nair quality benefits.'' In addition, the panel agreed that ``the use of \nMTBE should be reduced substantially.'' Importantly, the panel \nrecommended that ``Congress act quickly to clarify federal and state \nauthority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of gasoline additives \nthat pose a threat to drinking water supplies.''\n  This bill, while not totally repealing the 2 percent oxygenate \nrequirement, moves us in that direction. It gives states that choose to \nmeet clean air requirements without oxygenates to do so. It allows \nstates that choose an oxygenate, such as ethanol, to do so. Areas \nrequired to use reformulated gasoline for cleaner air will still be \nrequired to use it. The gasoline will have a different but clean \nformulation. Areas will continue to have to meet clean air standards.\n  MTBE has contaminated groundwater at over 10,000 sites in California, \naccording to the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Of 10,972 groundwater \nsites sampled, 39 percent had MTBE, says the state Department of Health \nServices. Of 765 surface water sources sampled, 287 or 38% had MTBE.\n  Nationally, one EPA-funded study found, of 34 states, MTBE was \npresent more than 20 percent of the time in 27 states. A U.S. \nGeological Survey report had similar findings. An October 1999 \nCongressional Research Service analysis concluded that 41 states have \nhad MTBE detections in water.\n  In California, Governor Davis concluded that MTBE ``poses a \nsignificant risk to California's environment'' and directed that MTBE \nbe phased out in California by December 31, 2002. There is not a \nsufficient supply of ethanol or other oxygenates to fully replace MTBE \nin California, without huge gas price spikes and gasoline supply \ndisruptions. In addition, California can make clean-burning gas without \noxygenates.\n\n[[Page S14409]]\n\nTherefore, California is in the impossible position of having to meet a \nfederal requirement that is (1) contaminating the water and (2) is not \nnecessary to achieve clean air.\n  On April 12, 1999, Governor Davis asked U.S. EPA for a waiver of the \n2% oxygenate requirement. I too wrote U.S. EPA--on May 18, 1999; \nDecember 3, 1998; September 29, 1998; September 28, 1998; September 14, \n1998; November 3, 1997; September 24, 1997; April 22, 1997; and April \n11, 1997. I have met with EPA officials several times and have talked \ndirectly to Administrator Carol Browner. To date, EPA has not granted \nCalifornia a waiver of the two percent. Again, today I call on EPA to \nact. In the meantime, I will continue to urge Congress to act.\n  Time is of the essence. California Governor Davis is phasing out MTBE \nin our state, but the federal law requiring 2 percent oxygenates \nremains, putting our state in an untenable position. Refiners needs a \nlong lead time to retool their facilities and time is growing short.\n  A major University of California study released last year concluded \nthat MTBE provides ``no significant air quality benefit'' but that its \nuse poses ``the potential for regional degradation of water resources, \nespecially ground water. . . .'' Oxygenates, say the experts, are not \nnecessary for reformulated gasoline.\n  California has developed a gasoline formula that provide flexibility \nand provides clean air. Called the ``predictive model,'' it guarantees \nclean-burning RFG gas with oxygenates, with less than 2 percent \noxygenates and with no oxygenates. Several refiners, including Chevron \nand Tosco, are selling MTBE-free gas in California, for example, in the \nLake Tahoe area.\n  Under S. 1886, air standards would still have to be met and gasoline \nwould have to meet all other requirements of the federal reformulated \ngasoline program, for example, the limits on benzene, heavy metals, \nemission of oxides of nitrogen.\n  This is a minimal bill that will give California and other states the \nrelief they need from a unwarranted, unnecessary requirement. It will \nallow states that want oxygenates in their gasoline to use them and \nthose that do not to not use them.\n  The bill does not undo the Clean Air Act. The bill does not degrade \nair quality.\n  Importantly, it can stop the contamination of drinking water in may \nstate by MTBE.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1887. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide for an increase in the minimum wage and protect the rights of \nStates that have adopted State minimum wage laws; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               minimum wage state flexibility act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as I have listened to those Senators who \nsupport an increase in the minimum wage speak today--and I've listened \nclosely--what I've heard them repeatedly say is that the minimum wage \nis not high enough for workers to afford to put food on the table, pay \nrent or take care of their families. This is a vital point for any \nAmerican family, so I've listened carefully to see if anyone who \nsupports an increase could explain why folks in rural states and \ncounties have identical living standards of people residing in New York \nCity or Boston or Los Angeles. Interestingly enough, this question has \nbeen essentially left unanswered. No one who supports an increase has \nbeen able to explain how wages affect workers differently in different \nstates, and why that matters so much when we are talking about \nincreasing the minimum wage. In an effort to ensure that no worker gets \nleft behind and that we are considering all economic scenarios, I feel \ncompelled to stand up here and talk about it--about why the number of \ndollars a worker gets paid has a drastically different impact from one \nstate to another and even from one county to another. We must consider \nhow increasing the minimum wage can make jobs in rural states and \ncounties even more scarce; and, about how a wage hike can add even more \npeople to the welfare rolls.\n  We have heard the old adage that people are entitled to their own \nopinions, but not their own facts. Well, here are the facts. It costs \nover twice as much to live in New York City than it does to live in \nCheyenne, WY. That's a fact. A $25,000 salary in Cheyenne has the same \nbuying power as a $51,000 salary in New York, a $32,000 salary in \nBoston, or a $30,000 salary in Los Angeles. In other words, the average \nWyoming worker can buy more than twice as much for the same wage as a \nworker in Manhattan. Twice as much. To put an even finer point on this \nstaggering disparity, if the average worker in New York City is looking \nto rent an apartment, she would have to spend a whopping $2,730 per \nmonth--that's almost six times as expensive as the average apartment in \nCheyenne. An apartment in Cheyenne only costs $481 on average per \nmonth.\n  What about buying a home? The price difference between urban cities \nand rural towns is just as alarming. In New York, the average home \ncosts $533,000; in Boston, it costs $244,000 and here in Washington, \nDC, it costs $205,000. In Cheyenne, the cost of the average house is \nmuch, much less: $116,000. In other rural towns, it's far below \n$100,000--even $50,000.\n  Let's look at other necessities. In New York, it is 50 percent more \nexpensive to buy groceries than it is in Cheyenne. In Boston, the cost \nof utilities are almost double what they are in Cheyenne. And in Los \nAngeles, medical expenses are a third higher than in Cheyenne. My point \nis this: the cost of living in New York, or Boston, or Los Angeles is \ndrastically higher than it is in rural towns. This is not one person's \nopinion--it's a fact. And so to propose a wage level increase across \nthe board and from coast to coast has an impact on these empirical \ndisparities. It is like saying that rent for every apartment in this \ncountry must not be any higher than an apartment rent in rural towns, \nor that every bag of groceries must not cost any more than what it \ncosts at a small town grocery store. No one would ever propose that, \nwhich is the reason I feel the need to ensure that such economic \ndifferences are, at the very least, debated.\n\n  It is different--supporters of an increase will argue--because the \nincrease just sets a floor, a minimum wage for workers. States like New \nYork, and California, and Massachusetts can tack on to that if they \nwish. But doesn't that just beg the question? If there is a minimum \nwage disparity for workers in those states with higher costs of living, \nthen why are we raising the minimum wage in every state just to \ncompensate for those states where it costs more to live? Why are we \nendangering the economic stability of rural states and counties by not \nconsidering this reality?\n  The raw statistics show that job growth in Wyoming is exactly half of \njob growth nationwide--it's growing, but just not as quick as we would \nlike. Each year, at least 50 percent of Wyoming's college graduates \nleave the state, unable to find work because there aren't enough \nbusinesses to keep pace. What that translates into is this: if the \nminimum wage increase passes, rural areas cold face fewer jobs than \nthey already provide. What every student who has ever taken an \neconomics course knows is that if you increase the price of something \n(in this case, a minimum wage job), you decrease the demand for those \njobs. Indeed, a survey of members of the American Economic Association \nrevealed that 77 percent of economists believe that a minimum wage hike \ncauses job loss. For states that already struggle just to grow small \nbusinesses and increase the number of jobs they produce, such an \noutcome can be detrimental. And for those parents in Wyoming who tell \nme over and over again how tired they are of seeing their kids leave \nthe state to attend college elsewhere--simply because there are not \nenough part-time and full-time entry level jobs to get experience from \nand help pay for their education. One restaurant owner in a small town \ntold me that he would increase the wage, but that would mean 5 less \njobs for bus boys. After the last increase, I also recall college \nstudents complaining because college grants--or work studies--were \nnegatively impacted. What happened was that grant amounts weren't \nincreased, so the minimum wage hike resulted in less hours available \nper student under the grant. Students said that it resulted in a net \nloss for them. It's because of unforeseen situations like these, I am \ncompelled to bring this issue to the table.\n  The legislation I'm proposing today is an attempt to save \nrural states and\n\n[[Page S14410]]\n\ncounties from losing even more precious jobs because ``Inside the \nBeltway'' types think that a minimum wage hike might help workers in \nhigher cost of living states like Massachusetts, California, and New \nYork. This legislation, which I call ``State Flexibility,'' is not a \nperfect solution. What this bill would do is give some discretion back \nto the states to decide whether it wants to remain at the increased \nfederal rate of $6.15 an hour, or whether a wage that's 15 percent \nunder the federal wage works better for the economic growth--and the \nworkers--of that state.\n\n  Here's how the bill would work. First, just so that there is no \nconfusion, it would not prevent any federal minimum wage increases from \napplying nationally. But this legislation would provide state \nlegislators the ability to set the minimum wage for the state, or a \ncounty within the state, at 15 percent under the federal floor. This \nlegislation would also allow a Governor on a ``temporary'' basis to set \nthe minimum wage for a state or a county at 15 percent less than the \nfederal floor for reasons such as high unemployment, slow economic \ngrowth or potential harm to the state's welfare-to-work programs. I \nhave listened carefully to the concerns of one-size-fits-all wage hike \nadvocates, who say that the proposed increase is for workers. I agree, \nwhich is precisely why I'm advocating this approach--to ensure that \nwelfare-to-work moms and dads living in counties with high unemployment \nrates aren't excluded. I am confident that nobody in this Chamber wants \nto leave anyone behind.\n  I've talked quite a bit today about how increasing the minimum wage \nwould affect the small business owner. Having owned a small business in \nWyoming for 27 years, I can speak with some experience about just how \ndetrimental an increase would be on small employers and job growth, and \nhow this legislation would offer some flexibility to rural states and \ncounties. But one area that I've been learning more about is how bad an \nincrease would be on folks who have just recently entered the job \nmarket through welfare-to-work programs. What I've read has startled \nme, and as a former small business owner, the statistics pertaining to \nrural regions of the country make tangible sense to me. So much sense, \nin fact, that I am more convinced than ever that just increasing the \nminimum wage is not as sound a policy as advocates suggest.\n  First. Just as a minimum wage increase would slow job creation in \nrural states and negatively affect people who have been employed in \ntheir field for years, college students looking for jobs, or new \ngraduates, it would also severely impact welfare recipients looking for \nwork. University of Wisconsin economist Peter Brandon has actually \ndetermined that minimum wage hikes actually increase duration on \nwelfare by more than 40 percent.\n  Second. The Educational Testing Service has concluded that fully two-\nthirds of welfare recipients have skills that qualify, at best, for \nentry-level employment, and many fall far below. And what researchers \nat Boston University have shown is that lower-skilled adults are \ndisplaced after a minimum wage hike by teens and students who are \nperceived as having better skills.\n  Third. Undoubtedly due to the above, research from Michigan State \nUniversity shows that minimum wage hikes push as many families into \npoverty (due to job loss, for example), as they pull out of poverty.\n  These daunting statistics sound alarms if we haphazardly push through \na minimum wage hike that has a heck of a good sound bite, but an awful \naftertaste when the dust settles and a number of workers are left \nbehind. This proposal, however, speaks to this point. If a state \nlegislature or a Governor sees a potential for a detrimental impact on \nwelfare to work programs within that state, they can act to keep the \nrate at 15 percent under the federal floor. This is simple, rational \ndiscretion. This legislation instills the same ideals incorporated in \nthe 1996 Welfare Reform Act and the 1998 Workforce Investment Act. \nCongress and the President entrusted states with administering welfare-\nto-work and our nation's job training programs. This bill would \ncomplement those landmark laws by saying that states can adjust the \nmandatory wage--ensuring that no worker gets left behind. We must not \nturn a blind eye when state flexibility matters most.\n  As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and \nTraining, my colleagues can be assured that the problem of economic \ndisparities spurred by the lack of consideration by federal mandates \nwill continue until we take a closer look. It's real and it deserves \nour attention. It is my hope that by discussing this bill, the Senate \nwill begin to exclude the politics from the minimum wage debate and \nstart examining the full spectrum of this issue. I am serious about \naddressing this and I fully intend to debate it during the second \nsession. The media and interest groups have asked that we not \npoliticize the minimum wage. I couldn't agree more, which is why I ask \nyou to carefully consider not leaving anyone behind. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to support the protection of coral reefs and other \nresources in units of the National Park System and other agencies under \nthe administration of the Secretary of the Interior; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          Carol Reef Resource Conservation and Management Act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nenhance our ability to understand and conserve\n\n[[Page S14411]]\n\ncoral reef ecosystems and the ocean life that depends on them.\n  In the past few years, Congress and the administration have \nrecognized the importance of coral reefs to ocean ecologies and grown \nincreasingly concerned about the challenges facing our reefs. 1997 was \nrecognized as ``Year of the Reef,'' and the House passed House \nConcurrent Resolution 8 which recognized the significance of \nmaintaining the health and stability of coral reef ecosystems by \npromoting stewardship for reefs. In 1998 the President signed Executive \nOrder 13089 establishing the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force under joint \nleadership of the Department of Commerce and Department of the \nInterior. The Executive order directs federal agencies to take steps to \nprotect, manage, research and restore coral ecosystems. The bill I am \nintroducing today supplements these actions by establishing a targeted \nnational program for coral reef research, monitoring, and conservation \nfor areas under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. It \nis a companion measure to S. 1253, introduced earlier this year by \nSenator Inouye, that authorizes a coral reef program through the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, the importance of reefs to our economy, culture, and \nto the stability of our shorelines is becoming increasingly apparent as \nwe begin to understand more about the interdependence of reefs and \nhuman activity. Substantial research shows that reefs are under greater \nstress than ever before, both from natural causes and human-induced \ndamage. We need to act now before the decline of reefs becomes \nirreversible.\n  This measure authorizes coral reef research and conservation efforts \nthrough the Department of the Interior. The Department manages over \n2,000 acres of sensitive coral reef habitat and adjacent submerged land \nat 20 national wildlife refuges and 9 units of the National Park System \nin Hawaii, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the territories of \nGuam and American Samoa in the Pacific. Of the 4.2 million acres of \nreefs in the United States, few have been mapped, assessed, or \ncharacterized. There is still much to learn about the location and \nbiology of coral reefs, their susceptibility to disease, and how they \ncan be restored and sustained.\n  This measure establishes a coral reef conservation matching grant \nprogram that will leverage federal monies with non-federal funds raised \nthrough a non-profit foundation. This initiative is consistent with the \nefforts of the President's Coral Reef Task Force established by \nExecutive Order No. 13089, and with the activities of other agencies, \nsuch as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that are \ninvolved in coral reef research, monitoring, restoration and \nconservation.\n  Under my legislation, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to \nprovide grants for coral reef conservation projects in areas under the \nDepartment's jurisdiction, through a merit-based, competitive program. \nGrants will be awarded on a 75 per cent federal and 25 per cent non-\nfederal basis. The Secretary may also enter into an agreement with one \nor more foundations to solicit private funds dedicated to coral \nconservation programs. Up to 80 percent of the funding will be \ndistributed equally between the Atlantic/Caribbean and the Pacific \nOcean, and 20 percent of the funding can be used for emerging \npriorities or threats identified by the Secretary in consultation with \nthe Coral Reef Task Force. Grants may be made to any relevant natural \nresource management authority of a State or territory of the United \nStates, to other government authorities with jurisdiction over coral \nreefs as well as to educational or non-governmental institutions or \norganizations with demonstrated expertise in coral reef conservation. \nPriority will be given to projects that promote reef conservation \nthrough cooperative projects with local communities; that involve non-\ngovernmental organizations, academic or private institutions or local \naffected governments; that enhance public knowledge and awareness of \ncoral reef resources; and that promise sound scientific information on \nthe extent, nature and condition of reef ecosystems.\n\n  Most importantly, this legislation encourages community-based \nconservation efforts that involve local communities, nongovernmental \norganizations, and academic institutions in the protection of reefs. It \nbrings people and communities together to participate in, and learn \nmore about, the conservation of ocean resources--coral reefs and the \nmany species that depend on reef ecosystems. Only by making ordinary \npeople responsible for reef conservation, can we alter the types of \nhuman activity and behavior that are responsible for the adverse \nimpacts on coral reefs that we glimpse today.\n  Mr. President, the people of Hawaii, our Nation's only insular state, \nare perhaps more aware of the subtle and interdependent relationship we \nhave with coral reefs.\n  But all citizens should appreciate that the health of coral reefs is \nemblematic of the health of our oceans--upon which we depend for so \nmany resources, from clean water to food to pharmaceuticals. Coral \nreefs are the rain forests of the ocean--a wild, beautiful, complex \nbountiful resource whose importance to life on earth, much less \nourselves, is only beginning to be understood. But the harsh reality is \nthat we are going to lose our reefs if we do not act soon, before we \nfully understand their role in the great web of marine life.\n  There are simply more people on the globe, in more places in the \nocean, than ever before. Boats, anchors, snorkelers and divers are \nentering the water in increasing numbers. We are removing things from \nthe water at an increasing rate--exotic salt water fish for home \naquariums and pieces of coral for houses and home decor. The amount of \nsediment and pollution runoff onto coral reefs increases with every \nmajor shoreline development. It is vital that we start now, to research \nand preserve our reefs, before human impacts cause irreversible damages \nto a resource whose essential role in nature is only just beginning to \nbe understood.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation, which represents a critical step in helping us understand \nand live sustainably with coral reef ecosystems.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to \nprovide for joint resolutions on the budget, reserve funds for \nemergency spending, strengthened enforcement of budgetary decisions, \nincreased accountability for Federal spending; accrual budgeting for \nFederal insurance programs, mitigation of the bias in the budget \nprocess toward higher spending, modifications in paygo requirements \nwhen there is an on-budget surplus, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions \nthat when one Committee reports, the other Committee have thirty days \nto report or be discharged.\n\n\n            comprehensive budget process reform act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we are now in the final stages of \ncompleting the FY 2000 Appropriation bills. We will soon end the first \nsession of the 106th Congress. Looking back, I must say, we have had \nsome successes, and I am proud of these achievements. However, the \nbiggest failure, in my judgment, is that we have failed to learn the \nlessons from our past two years' experience and we have failed to \nmaintain fiscal discipline due to our seriously flawed budget process.\n  That's why I rise today to introduce legislation that would reform \nthe federal budget process, strengthen fiscal discipline, and restore \ngovernment accountability to ensure that taxpayers are fully \nrepresented in Washington.\n  Mr. President, after last year's abuse of the budget/appropriation \nprocess, many of us realized that the federal budget process became a \nreckless game in which the team roster was limited to a handful of \nWashington politicians and technocrats while the taxpayers were \nrelegated to the sidelines. This not only weakened the nation's fiscal \ndiscipline but also undermined the system of checks and balances \nestablished by the Constitution.\n  At the beginning of the 106th Congress, I argued repeatedly in this \nchamber that the key to a successful Congress was to pursue \ncomprehensive budget process reforms. I introduced legislation to \nachieve these goals. I was pleased that Senate leaders included budget \nprocess reform as one of the top five priorities in the 106th Congress. \nUnfortunately, that commitment has not yet materialized.\n  As a result, this year's appropriation process is almost a play-by-\nplay of 1998. Congress over-used advanced appropriations, and used \ndirected scoring, emergency spending and other budgetary techniques to \ndodge fiscal discipline and significantly increase government spending.\n  Mr. President, our failure can be traced to our seriously flawed \nbudget process. Twenty-five years ago, Congress tried to change its \nbudget practices and get spending under control by passing the \nCongressional Budget Act. Yet, over these 25 years, our national debt \nhas grown from $540 billion to $5.7 trillion.\n  Spending is at an all-time high, and so are taxes. The budget process \nhas become so complicated that most lawmakers have a hard time \nunderstanding it. Of course, that hasn't stopped the proliferation of \nbudget smoke and mirrors to circumvent the intent of the Congress. The \nflawed process allows members to vote to control spending in the budget \nand then turn right around and vote for increased appropriations. The \nprocess encourages spending increases rather than spending control. It \nencourages continued fiscal abuse, waste, and irresponsibility.\n  Clearly, we need to immediately pursue comprehensive reform to ensure \nthe integrity of our budget and appropriations process and avoid \nrepeating the same mistakes we made in the past two years. We must do \nthis early in the year before we begin to face appropriation pressures.\n  This is why I am introducing the Comprehensive Budget Process Reform \nAct. This legislation is the companion bill of HR 853, which was a \nbipartisan effort led by Congressmen Nussle and Cardin. It has been \nreported by the House Budget Committee. There are also a number of good \nbudget reform proposals in the Senate I have earlier supported. Reforms \nintroduced by our Budget Committee Chairman Senator Domenici are \nimportant and I strongly support his leadership in this area. My \nlegislation is complementary to but broader than Senator Domenici's \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, let me highlight my legislation. The legislation will \nforce us to pass a legally-binding federal budget, set aside funds each \nyear in the budget for true emergencies; strengthen the enforcement of \nbudgetary controls; enhance accountability for Federal spending; \ndisplay unfunded liabilities for Federal insurance programs; mitigate \nthe bias toward higher spending, modify Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) \nprocedures to accommodate budget surpluses; and ensure the Social \nSecurity surplus will be protected.\n  The core of the legislation will provide for an annual joint budget \nresolution, rather than a concurrent resolution, thus making it a \nlegally binding budget through a law requiring the President's \nsignature.\n  I believe this is a critical step in reforming the budget process. If \nCongress and the President agree on a Joint Budget Resolution at the \nbeginning of the process, appropriators in Congress would be legally \nbound to stay within those spending limits. It forces confrontation at \nthe earliest stages of the budget process, leaving adequate time for \nlegislating detail and minimizing disputes at the end of the process \nwhich threaten to shutdown the government.\n  The second component of the bill will redefine emergency spending and \ncreate a reserve fund to pay for emergencies. Emergency spending was \ntraditionally used for unanticipated wars and natural disasters that \ntook life and severely damaged property. Because emergency spending \ntoday is effectively exempt from congressional spending controls, \nCongress and the Administration have used this as an opportunity to \nbust the budget for a lot of spending that isn't emergency related at \nall.\n  Last year alone, Congress appropriated $35 billion for so-called \nemergencies. This year again, over $24 billion of emergency spending is \nappropriated. Since 1991, emergency spending has totaled over $145 \nbillion. Most ``emergencies'' were used to fund regular government \nprograms, not unanticipated events. Emergency spending is sought as a \nvehicle to add on even more spending priorities. This has gone too far. \nWe need a better way to budget for emergencies. Most of this spending \ncan be planned within our budget limits. Even natural disasters happen \nregularly--why not budget for them?\n  My legislation will end this abuse of emergency spending. It requires \nboth the President and the Congress to budget up front for emergencies \nby setting aside dollars in an emergency reserve fund. The reserve fund \nwill contain an amount at least equal to the 5-year historical average \nof amounts provided for true emergencies. It includes a clear \ndefinition of ``emergencies.'' My legislation prohibits release of \nfunds from the reserve pending Budget Committee certification that: (1) \nA situation has arisen that requires funding for ``the prevention or \nmitigation of, or response to, loss of life of property, or a threat to \nnational security'', and (2) The situation is ``unanticipated''--with \n``unanticipated'' defined as sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary.\n\n[[Page S14414]]\n\n  In the event that Congress and the President fail to agree on annual \nappropriation measures by October 1, my legislation will allow the \nbudget resolution signed into law earlier in the year to automatically \nkick in. This will effectively prevent any future government shutdowns \ndue to disagreements on spending priorities between Congress and the \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, the 1995 federal government shutdown is still fresh in \nour minds. It was the longest shutdown in history and caused financial \ndamage and inconvenience to millions of Americans when the President \nrefused to support a Balanced Budget Act and tax relief for Americans. \nThe shutdown shook the American people's confidence in their government \nand in their elected officials.\n  Since 1997, I, along with Senator McCain, have been advocating an \nautomatic continuing resolution, or CR, as we call it, to prevent a \ngovernment shutdown. I was able to obtain a commitment from the Senate \nleadership of both parties to pursue this legislation separately in the \nnear future. But no action has followed. If we had an automatic CR, we \nwould not have to go through bitter battles at the end of every fiscal \nyear.\n  The virtue of an automatic CR is that it would allow us to debate \nissues concerning spending policy and the merits of budget priorities \nwhile we continue to keep essential government functions operating. The \nAmerican taxpayer will no longer be held hostage to a government \nshutdown.\n  Mr. President, there will always be plenty of uncertainties involved \nin our budget and appropriations process. The automatic kick-in of the \nbudget resolution in the bill I introduce today will work the same as \nmy automatic CR.\n  Another flaw of the budget process is so-called budget baselines. \nWhen a government program is going to increase by 4.5 percent per year, \nanyone with common sense would think that is a budget increase, not a \nbudget ``cut.'' But under baseline budgeting it could mean ``cut.'' Lee \nIaccoca once stated that if business used baseline budgeting the way \nCongress does, ``they'd throw us in jail.''\n  This is a typical budget gimmick. Any proposed spending levels below \ncurrent baselines are perceived as program reductions, allowing some \npoliticians to claim savings while permitting others to claim \nincreases. Baseline budgeting is biased in favor of more spending. It \nis not honest budgeting but rather very misleading. My legislation \nwould require Congress and the President to use this year's actual \nspending total as the baseline for the next year's budget. If we decide \nto spend more than the current year, we are increasing the budget. If \nwe spend less, we are cutting it. Let's call a spade a spade.\n\n  Mr. President, we have entered an era of budget surplus. It is \nestimated that in the next ten years, our strong economy will generate \nan over $1 trillion non-Social Security surplus. If we don't return \nthis surplus to taxpayers in the form of tax relief and debt reduction, \nthe government will spend it all. However, the current budget process \nlimits our ability to provide tax relief for working Americans.\n  The budget law requires that all tax cuts be offset with tax \nincreases or cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicare. Tax cuts \nmay not be paid for by cutting discretionary spending, such as wasteful \ngovernment programs. This rule, called the PAYGO rule, applies \nregardless of whether there is a surplus or deficit. The PAYGO rule \neffectively limits options with respect to reducing taxes because it \nprecludes using spending cuts in discretionary programs to offset tax \ncuts. Thus there is a built-in bias in favor of higher levels of \nspending and taxation in the current budget process.\n  My legislation would amend Pay-As-You-Go requirements to permit any \nportion of the on-budget surplus, excluding Social Security, to be used \nfor tax cuts.\n  Related to the PAYGO rule reform, my legislation also creates a \nlockbox to lock in every penny that is saved from floor amendments to \nappropriations bills and use it to reduce federal government spending. \nSpending levels in the budget resolution and any caps on discretionary \nspending would be automatically reduced by the amount in the floor \namendment.\n  The bill requires committees to submit a plan for reauthorizing all \nprograms within their jurisdictions in 10 years. It also prohibits the \nCongress from considering a bill that creates a new spending program \nunless it is sunset within 10 years. My legislation also guarantees \nMembers the right to offer amendments subjecting proposed entitlements \nto the enhanced oversight of the appropriations process.\n  Under the current budget process, we have over 20 budget functions, \nand a half dozen different committees with jurisdiction over one budget \nfunction. This has complicated the process greatly. To simplify the \nprocess, my bill collapses the 20 non-enforceable budget functions \ncurrently used into total (aggregate) spending and revenue levels, with \nseparate categories for discretionary and mandatory spending. It is \nsimple, and easy enough for everyone to understand.\n  Mr. President, a number of the Federal insurance programs (excluding \nSocial Security and Medicare) that have a looming impact on the federal \nbudget are not included in our budget process. The liabilities caused \nby these programs could be enormous. Budgeting for these liabilities \nwill give us better control over long-term programs. My legislation \nrequires the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management \nand Budget to report periodically on long-term budgetary trends, to \nhelp make Members aware of the future budgetary implications of \nspending programs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it's vitally important that we save the \nentire Social Security surplus, not for government spending, not for \ntax relief, but exclusively for Social Security.\n  I believe we need an enforcement mechanism to ensure that Congress \nand the President do not touch the Social Security surplus. My \nlegislation requires that if any fiscal year's appropriations end up \nspending the Social Security surplus, a sequestration will be \nautomatically triggered to reduce government spending across the board \nin the amount of the Social Security surplus that was used. Entitlement \nprograms like Social Security and Medicare would not be cut. In \naddition, the bill reaffirms the protected status of Social Security \nunder the current budgetary law.\n  Mr. President, it is true that our short-term fiscal situation has \nimproved greatly due to the continued growth of our economy. However, \nour long-term financial imbalance still poses a major threat to the \nhealth of our future economic security. Without budget process reform, \nwe will find ourselves again and again making the same mistakes which \nresult in bigger government, more spending and more abuse. We need to \nspend more time on oversight and reauthorizing expiring programs rather \nthan on endless budget battle at the end of every fiscal year.\n  President Reagan summed up the real problem of our budget process \nwhen he pointed out ``this budget process does not serve the best \ninterests of the nation, it does not allow sufficient review of \nspending priorities, and it undermines the checks and balances \nestablished by the Constitution.''\n  If the Congress adopts the Comprehensive Budget Process Reform Act, \nit will ensure a budget process that serves the best interests of the \nnation and allow for careful policy and spending deliberation. That's \nwhy I am introducing this legislation today. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. L. CHAFEE:\n  S. 1891. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to improve literacy through family literacy projects; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\n\n              the literacy involves families together act\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I have the enormous honor of \nintroducing legislation to renew and strengthen the Even Start Family \nLiteracy Act. On October 1, 1985, my father stood at this desk, where I \nstand today, and introduced the Even Start Act. He did so because of \nhis profound commitment to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged \nmembers of our society. As I introduce this bill, which attempts to \nbreak the cycle of illiteracy that divides our Nation into haves and \nhave nots, I do so in an effort to continue that commitment to \ndisadvantaged Americans.\n\n[[Page S14415]]\n\n  Last week, an identical bill was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Bill Goodling, chairman of the House Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce. Chairman Goodling introduced the original \nEven Start Act in the House on May 16, 1985. Both versions of the Even \nStart Act were reintroduced in the 100th Congress and became law as \npart of the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary Improvement Act \nAmendments of 1987.\n  There are approximately 40 million Americans who suffer from \nilliteracy. Like a disease, illiteracy often goes undetected. Like a \ndisease, illiteracy too often is passed from generation to generation. \nLike a disease, illiteracy is painful for families to endure. There is \nno certain cure for illiteracy, but by renewing and expanding the Even \nStart Family Literacy Program, we offer tens of thousands of families \nhope for a better future.\n  There are many controversies related to education policy at the \nlocal, state and federal levels. There are heartfelt, passionately held \nopinions about everything from funding levels to particular teaching \ntechniques. Nevertheless, there are a few things on which nearly \neveryone agrees: parents are their children's first and most important \nteachers, and children who are read to early and often do better in \nschool than children who are not.\n  As the father of three young children, reading together is a part of \ndaily life that I take for granted. I suspect that it is difficult for \nmost of the members of this body to imagine what it would be like not \nto have the ability to sit down with your children or grandchildren to \nread a favorite story. But for millions of Americans, reading a bedtime \nstory or helping with a son or daughter's homework assignment is \nimpossible.\n  The Even Start Family Literacy Act brings families together to learn. \nParents who do not have a high school degree or its equivalent are \neligible for this program. They learn the basic educational skills that \nenable them to improve their own situations and, perhaps even more \nimportantly, they learn the skills they need to help their children in \nschool. At the same time, children from birth to age 8 receive \nappropriate educational services.\n\n  The bill I am introducing makes two notable changes in the Even Start \nprogram. First, it enables a child, who also is receiving title I \nservices, to remain in the Even Start program beyond age 8. It also \nrequires Even Start programs to utilize research-based teaching \ntechniques for children. In addition to these improvements, it \nauthorizes the Institute for Literacy to investigate the most effective \nmeans of improving adults' literacy skills, and it increases the \nauthorization level to $500 million so that more families can be \nserved.\n  Currently, there are four Even Start programs in Rhode Island \nreceiving federal funds. Each of these programs serves between 25 and \n40 families. In Newport, the Sullivan School Children's Opportunity \nZone/Family Center has entered into an Even Start partnership with New \nVisions--the local Head Start provider, the Newport Public Library, the \nFlorence Gray Center--which provides housing for low-income families, \nthe Community College of Rhode Island and the Newport Hospital. Half of \nits participants are non-English readers.\n  In Woonsocket, the Fairmont School is the Even Start center, with \npartners from Literacy Volunteers of Northern Rhode Island and \nWoonsocket Head Start, among others. Three cities and towns--Johnston, \nNorth Providence, and Smithfield, have joined together to create the \nTri-Town Community Action Even Start Program. Finally, the Cunningham \nSchool Even Start Program has established a partnership with Pawtucket \nPublic Schools and Libraries, the Pawtucket Day Nursery, and a range of \neducation and social service providers.\n  Each of these programs has utilized existing early childhood and \nadult education services. Together they are striving to address the \nneeds of the whole family.\n  In the 12 years since the Even Start Program first was created, our \nnation has been propelled into the information age. Americans are \nincreasingly dependent on technology for a wide range of needs and \nservices. This new age magnifies our need for a literate society. As we \ncontinue to experience technological advancements, the educationally \ndisadvantaged fall further behind. I believe that the Even Start Family \nLiteracy Act as reauthorized by this bill--the Literacy Involves \nFamilies Together Act--is critically important to our Nation's \nchildren, our Nation's families, and our Nation's future.\n  I see Senator Jeffords on the floor. Before I yield to him, I thank \nhim for his generosity to me and for his leadership in the area of \neducation. Chairman Jeffords has the daunting task of leading the \nSenate's efforts to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. From what I know of Senator Jeffords, this major undertaking \ncouldn't be in more able hands.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we were all deeply saddened just a few \ndays ago at the death of Senator John Chafee. Certainly, that sadness \ncan never diminish completely. But having his son with us today and \nstarting right off by introducing an excellent piece of legislation \ncertainly brings us strong hope for the future.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for \nintroducing the Literacy Involves Families Together Act, the LIFT Act. \nThis legislation reauthorizes one of the most effective education \nprograms, Even Start.\n  The Even Start Act was first introduced in 1985 by Representative \nBill Goodling, chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, \nand our former colleague, Senator John Chafee.\n  When first created, the goal of the Even Start program was to develop \na comprehensive literacy program that improves educational \nopportunities for disadvantaged families by focusing on parenting \neducation, early childhood education, and adult education. Since its \nestablishment a little over a decade ago, Even Start has grown from 76 \nlocal programs serving 2,500 families to an estimated 600 programs \nassisting over 36,000 parents and 48,000 children.\n  The most recent evaluation of the Even Start program illustrated that \nboth the adults and children who participated in the program \nsignificantly improved their reading and basic education skills. The \nevaluation specifically pointed out that the educational gap that \nexisted at the beginning of the school year for first term Even Start \nstudents was reduced by approximately two-thirds when the Even Start \nstudents were tested at the conclusion of the school year.\n  The most recent national survey of reading achievement by fourth \ngraders indicates that forty-four percent of school age children in \nthis nation are reading below a basic level of achievement.\n  Sadly, the statistics are also dismal when analyzing adult literacy \nskills. The most recent National Adult Literacy Survey found a total of \n44 million adults, almost 25 percent of the adult population in the \nUnited States, were at the lowest literacy level. The lowest literacy \nlevel means that 44 million adults in this country have demonstrated \ndifficulty in the reading and writing skills essential for carrying out \ndaily routines. The uniqueness of the Even Start program is that it \nprovides services to the entire family--it enables families to learn \ntogether.\n  I commend my colleague from Rhode Island for making literacy a very \nhigh priority. I am especially pleased that he chose to sponsor the \nreauthorization of the Even Start program which was first introduced to \nthis body by his father.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Rhode Island on the \nLiteracy Involves Families Together Act, the LIFT Act, as a part of the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which the \nSenate will consider early next year and on other education and \nliteracy initiatives that will enable all of our Nation's citizens to \nhave the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in the global \neconomy.\n  I again commend the Senator from Rhode Island for being out here so \nfast and quick with a very important piece of legislation. I share his \nenthusiasm and look forward to working with him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1892. A bill to authorize the acquisition of the Valles Caldera, \nto provide\n\n[[Page S14416]]\n\nfor an effective land and wildlife management program for this resource \nwithin the Department of Agriculture, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  THE VALLES CALDERA PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in Northern New Mexico there is a truly \nunique working ranch on an historic Mexican land grant known as Baca \nLocation No. 1. The ranch is currently owned and managed by the Baca \nLand and Cattle Company, and it comprises most of a collapsed, extinct \nvolcano known as the Valles Caldera. The Valles Caldera is a beautiful \nplace with rolling meadows, crystal-clear streams, roaming elk, and \nvast stands of Ponderosa pines. I am very proud to announce we are \nintroducing legislation today that will authorize the Secretary of \nAgriculture to acquire this property which is a truly unique 95,000 \nacre working ranch in New Mexico.\n  For Senator Bingaman and I, and a few others working on this issue, \nthis is a not-so-instant replay from last year. Last year around this \ntime, Senator Bingaman and I announced that we had reached agreement \nwith the President on a comprehensive plan to acquire the Baca Ranch \nand, at the same time, to provide for disposal of designated surplus \nland from the Federal inventory. Those two concepts, embodied in Titles \nI and II of last year's bill, have survived in this new bill.\n  Title I provides for an innovative trust structure to manage this \nranch, when it is purchased by the Federal Government. Title II \nprovides a process for compensating citizens who await Federal payment \nfor land trapped within vast areas of Federal land, so-called \n``inholders'', and the orderly disposal of Federal land that has \nalready been declared surplus by the Federal Government.\n  As you may recall, Senator Bingaman began this process with his \npurchase bill in 1997. The process of purchasing the Baca Ranch for the \npublic was jump-started last summer when President Clinton and I, \nflying on Air Force One to Washington, reached an agreement on the \nconcept of an innovative trust arrangement to manage the Baca, if it \nwere to become part of Federal land holdings. The President's response \nled to a number of rounds of negotiations between representatives of \nthe Administration and our offices.\n  Finally, after literally thousands of hours of discussion at all \nlevels, agreement was reached, we introduced the bill and a similar one \nwas introduced in the House of Representatives. And, in what I frankly \nadmit was almost miraculous, we were able to persuade Congress to \nprovide $40 million in last year's appropriations process as earnest \nmoney for any Baca Ranch purchase that might be authorized by Congress.\n  Then, unexpected disaster struck. The owners of the Baca Ranch \ndecided not to sell the land after all. I said to many of you then that \nI thought the purchase was dead.\n  However, like Lazarus the Baca Ranch purchase lives again. I must \nthank Senator Bingaman for his leadership in this matter, Congresswoman \nWilson for her extremely effective work behind the scenes in the House \nto promote the purchase, and the new Congressman from Santa Fe, Mr. \nUdall, for his support. And, I must thank the Administration for its \ncommitment.\n  This kind of cooperation has brought us to this day of good news. \nToday, Senator Bingaman and I again introduce a bill to authorize both \nthe purchase of the Baca Ranch by the federal government and the \norderly disposal of surplus lands in order to pay for debts the \ngovernment owes to ``inholders.'' I understand that Representatives \nWilson and Udall will introduce companion legislation in the House.\n  Now, let's talk for a moment about the $l0l million price tag the \nBaca Ranch purchase carries. The $40 million that we won last year from \nthe Appropriations process had been spent. The President didn't ask for \nit in his budget, logically, since he thought the ranch was no longer \nfor sale. And, the Interior Appropriations Subcommittees in the House \nand Senate failed to appropriate the $40 million for the same reason--\nit seemed that the purchase was dead.\n  However, the President recently announced a $101 million purchase \nagreement between the federal government and the Dunigan family, the \ncurrent owners of the Baca Ranch. Quickly, we jumped to action, and in \nOctober, the New Mexico delegation succeeded in restoring the $40 \nmillion originally approved last year for the purchase. As a member of \nthe Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I have been involved \nin talks between congressional negotiators and the White House over \nseveral issues in the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations Bill. Those talks \nhave led to a tentative agreement to provide an additional $61 million, \non top of the $40 million restored in October, for the Baca Ranch \npurchase. If the $101 million appropriation becomes law, its release \nwould be subject to congressional authorization of the land \nacquisition, as well as a review of the ranch appraisal by the \nComptroller General of the United States.\n  This is a terrific development and could very well help in moving \nthis authorizing legislation through Congress next year. The drive to \nbring this beautiful ranch into public ownership has helped gain this \nfunding. As important as the money, however, is retaining the dual \nnature of this legislation. This bill contains two major titles: one to \nauthorize purchase of the Baca Ranch, which draws most of the \nheadlines; and the other to begin a major reform in federal land \nmanagement. The President has signed onto both; we have signed onto \nboth. Both Titles must eventually become law in order for the Baca \nRanch purchase to proceed.\n\n  I have visited the Baca Ranch, and I can tell you that it is one \nbeautiful piece of property. The Valles Caldera is one of the world's \nlargest resurgent lava domes. The depression from a huge volcanic \neruption over a million years ago is more than a half-mile deep and \nfifteen miles across at its widest point. The land was originally \ngranted to the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca under a \nsettlement enacted by Congress in 1860. Since that time, the property \nhas remained virtually intact as a single, large, tract of land.\n  The careful husbandry of the Ranch by the Dunigan family provides a \nmodel for sustainable land development and use. The Ranch's natural \nbeauty and abundant resources, and its proximity to large municipal \npopulations could provide numerous recreational opportunities for \nhiking, fishing, camping, cross-country skiing, and hunting. The Baca \nis a unique working ranch. It is not a wilderness area, and can best be \nprotected for future generations by continuing its operation as a \nworking asset through a unique management structure. This legislation \nprovides that unique management under a trust that may allow for its \neventual operation to become financially self-sustaining.\n  Mr. President, because of the ranch's unique character, I am not \ninterested in having it managed under the usual federal authorities, as \nis typical of the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, or the \nNational Park Service. Under the current state of affairs on our public \nlands, Forest Service and BLM management is constantly hounded by \nlitigation initiated by some of the same groups that wish to bring this \nranch into government ownership. The Valles Caldera National Preserve \nwill serve as a model to explore alternative means of federal \nmanagement and will provide the American people with opportunities to \nenjoy the Valles Caldera and its many resources.\n  The unique nature of the Valles Caldera, and its resources, requires \na unique management program, dedicated to appropriate development and \npreservation under the principle of the highest and best use of the \nRanch in the interest of the public. Title I of this legislation \nprovides the framework necessary to fulfil that objective. It \nauthorizes the acquisition of the Baca Ranch by the Forest Service. At \nthe same time, it establishes a government-owned corporation, called \nthe Valles Caldera Trust, whose sole responsibility is to ensure that \nthe ranch is managed in a manner that will preserve its current unique \ncharacter, and provide enumerable opportunities for the American people \nto enjoy its splendor. Most importantly to me, however, the legislation \nwill allow for the ranch's continued operation as a working asset for \nthe people of north-central New Mexico, without further drawing on the \nthinly-stretched resources of the federal land management agencies.\n\n[[Page S14417]]\n\n  I would like to emphasize that both portions of this bill are \nmilestones in federal land management. This legislation independently \naddresses the acquisition of this unique property for public use and \nenjoyment, while solving current land management problems related to \nsurplus land disposal and the acquisition of inholdings from owners who \ntruly want to sell their land.\n  Currently, approximately one-third of New Mexico's land is in federal \nownership or under federal management. These public lands are an \nimportant resource that require our most thoughtful management. In \norder to better conserve existing national treasures for future use and \nenjoyment, we have devised a good plan to dispose of surplus land \nthrough sale or exchange into private, State, or local government \nownership.\n  In many cases, it is just too costly to keep this unneeded land under \nfederal ownership, and it can be more effectively managed in other \nhands. Title II of this bill, the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation \nAct, calls for the orderly disposition of surplus federal property on a \nstate by state basis, and provides land managers with needed tools to \naddress the problem created by ``inholdings'' within federally managed \nareas. There are currently more than 45 million acres of privately \nowned land trapped within the boundaries of Federal land management \nunits, including national parks, national forests, national monuments, \nnational wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas.\n  In other cases, however, landowners who want out have been waiting \ngenerations for the Federal Government to set aside funding and get \naround to acquiring their property. This legislation directs the \nDepartments of the Interior and Agriculture to reach out to those \nproperty owners who want to sell their land. It also instructs the \nDepartments to establish a priority for the acquisition of these \ninholdings based, in part, on how long the owner has been waiting to \nsell.\n  An issue related to the problem created by inholdings is the \nabundance of public domain land which the Bureau of Land Management has \ndetermined it no longer needs to fulfill its mission. Under the Federal \nLand Policy and Management Act of 1976, the BLM has identified an \nestimated 4 to 6 million acres of public domain lands for disposal.\n  Let me simply clarify that point--the BLM already has authority under \nan existing law, FLPMA, to exchange or sell lands out of Federal \nownership. Through its public process for land use planning, when the \nagency has determined that certain lands would be more useful to the \npublic under private or local governmental control, it is already \nauthorized to dispose of these lands, either by sale or exchange.\n  The sale or exchange of this land would be beneficial to local \ncommunities, adjoining land owners, and federal land mangers, alike.\n  An orderly process for the efficient sale or exchange of land \nidentified for disposal does not currently exist. The Federal Land \nTransaction Facilitation Act addresses this problem by providing that a \nportion of the proceeds generated from the sale of these lands will be \nused to fulfill all legal requirements for the transfer of these lands \nout of Federal ownership. The majority of the proceeds generated would \nbe used to acquire inholdings from those who want to sell their land.\n  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will schedule \nhearings to address the many issues regarding Federal purchase of the \nBaca Ranch in the near future. Congress has tried to resolve the \ndifficult challenges in acquiring this property before, and failed; \ncooperation among the parties may bring success this time around. I \nwant to thank everyone who has helped in this 18-month-long effort. I \nbelieve that in the end, we will be able to stand together and tell the \nAmerican people that we truly have accomplished two great and \ninnovative things with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that if we get an Interior \nappropriations bill, the money will be in it. Everyone should know that \nit is subject to two conditions: A full authorization bill being passed \nand signed and subject to the General Accounting Office reviewing the \nprocedures for the appraisal of the property and assuring the Congress \nof what they have done, in a sense with the expertise that is \nconsistent with what must be used in order to satisfy Congress that \nthere is a fair purchase price involved in the agreement.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and very much \nappreciate the leadership he has shown on this important issue as well. \nThis is a truly bipartisan effort we have made on behalf of New Mexico. \nThis is not just an issue of the 106th Congress. This is an issue that \nour Sate has been pursuing for many decades. Back in the early 1960s, \none of our predecessors in the Senate, Senator Clinton Anderson, made a \nvaliant effort to bring the Baca Ranch into Federal ownership so the \npublic could enjoy it and so its preservation could be assured for \nfuture generations.\n  After 3 years of effort in that direction, he abandoned the effort \nbecause of the infighting that occurred among competing interests. \nThen, Mr. President, over two years ago I rose in this chamber to \nintroduce a bill to authorize the acquisition of the Baca Location #1, \na ranch which comprises about ninety percent of the magnificent Valles \nCaldera. Today I rise to cosponsor a bill with Sen. Domenici that will \nnot only authorize purchase of the Baca Ranch, but also a unique method \nof management for this property.\n  A world renowned volcanic caldera sweeping approximately fifty miles \nin circumference, the Valles Caldera is the ecological heart of the \nJemez Mountains. It's unparalleled vast upland meadows broken by \nforested volcanic domes and intertwined with 27 miles of winding trout \nstreams, are home to a stunning variety of wildlife including: mountain \nlions, black bear, whitetail deer, redtail hawks, eagles, and wild \nturkey. It has also been the breeding ground for one of the largest elk \nherds in the lower forty-eight states.\n  There has been a desire on the part of the Dunigan family, the \ncurrent owners of that land, to see that it go into public ownership, \nand the father of the of the current owners made that attempt before he \ndied. They have recently decided they want to carry through with that \nwish of his and accordingly, as Senator Domenici indicated, the \nnegotiations between the Dunigan family and the Federal Government have \nproceeded and now have come to a good resolution. This presents us with \nan incredible opportunity for the American people.\n  The potential of this land is enormous:\n  It could be used as a grassbank to allow ranchers to rest and \nrehabilitate hundreds of thousands of acres of public range land in New \nMexico without having to lose production in the process;\n  It could provide incredible opportunities for scientific study and \neducation, in the geophysical and biological sciences;\n  It currently is, and could continue to be, one of the premier hunting \nand fishing destinations in the country;\n  It's scenic value makes it an ideal location for the film industry. \nIn fact it has often been used as a backdrop for movies, TV series, and \ncommercials;\n  It presents amazing opportunities for outdoor recreation including, \nhiking, camping, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, and \nphotography; and\n  As with many of the scenic wonders in my home state of New Mexico, \nthere are places within the caldera that are of tremendous cultural \nsignificance to various Native American tribes in the area.\n  Clearly if this property were to be brought into public ownership it \nshould be managed to preserve its incredible natural condition, while \nmaintaining a balance with the various ways it could be used and \nenjoyed. The experiment called for in this bill sets out broad policy \ngoals for the land (to preserve its natural treasures and to make it \nfinancially self-sustaining) and establishes a nine member board of \ntrustees that shall set management policy for what would become the \nValles Caldera Preserve. By requiring that each trustee have experience \nfrom differing but critical perspectives, this trust may be able to \nreach a balance that will meet the needs of the land and the public.\n  The nine members of this board would include:\n  (1) the Supervisor of the Santa Fe National Forest;\n\n[[Page S14418]]\n\n  (2) the Superintendent of Bandelier National Monument;\n  (3) a person with expertise in range management and the livestock \nindustry;\n  (4) a person with expertise in fish and wildlife management including \ngame and non-game species;\n  (5) a person with expertise in sustainable forest management;\n  (6) an active participant in a conservation organization;\n  (7) a person with financial management and business expertise;\n  (8) a person with expertise in the cultural and natural history of \nthe region; and finally;\n  (9) someone active in the State or local government in New Mexico \nfamiliar with the customs of the local area.\n  At least five of these trustees would be required to be residents of \nNew Mexico. It would be an experiment, and would expire within twenty \nyears unless it proves successful and is renewed by Congress.\n  A second part of this bill, not related to the management of the \nValles Caldera Preserve, seeks to address the goal of the Federal land \nmanagement agencies to consolidate their land holdings, by first \nhelping to promote the sale of the widely scattered parcels of land \nthat the Bureau of Land Management has designated ``suitable for \ndisposal,'' and secondly by using the proceeds of those sales towards \nthe acquisition of inholdings within our public lands, areas of \ncritical environmental concern, and other lands of exceptional resource \nvalue. This program would be authorized for ten years.\n  Just as the Baca Ranch can be seen as a large inholding surrounded by \nfederal land which is worthy of public ownership, there are many other \ninholdings in our national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and public \nlands, where private owners are willing and eager to sell to \ngovernment. At the same time, there are some two million acres of \npublic land that the BLM has determined are too remote, isolated, or \notherwise situated to make management more of a burden than a benefit \nto the Federal tax payer.\n  Often these lands are small 20 and 40 acre parcels surrounded by, or \nforming checker boarded areas with, private or state land. Though \nconsolidating these lands has long been a goal of Federal land \nmanagers, the costs of surveying the land for endangered species, \narcheological artifacts, and for the purpose of determining a fair \nmarket value has hampered these efforts. This bill would create a \nmechanism to accelerate this work.\n  Mr. President, this bill is important because it holds the real \npromise of bringing the entire Valles Caldera into public ownership \nafter so many failures in the past. It represents a compromise which \nSen. Domenici and I have worked on with the Administration, the House \nMembers of the New Mexico delegation, and with some consultation with \nthe majority staff of the Energy & and Natural Resources Committee. We \nhave also received innumerable comments from various constituencies.\n  Like all negotiated legislation, each constituency and interest group \nwould like to change a piece here or there. However, I believe it is \noverall a good bill which meets the broadest concerns raised by those \nconstituencies and should be viewed as a whole rather than in pieces. \nMy sincere hope is that we will be able to pass it substantially as it \nis early next session.\n  The other issue that Senator Domenici spoke to is the appropriating \nof funding for the purchase. I also am extremely pleased with that. I \nknow the administration has felt strongly that we should try to get the \nfull funding for the purchase of the ranch accomplished in this session \nof the 106th Congress before we adjourn. I know Senator Domenici has \nworked hard to accomplish that. I also worked with the Appropriations \nCommittee members and the administration to full fund this purchase. I \nam very pleased to know that we are going to see that full \nappropriation at such time as we have an Interior appropriations bill \nsigned into law.\n  This is an important effort for the State of New Mexico. I believe \nwhen the 106th Congress is finally completed, not the end of this week \nor next week but a year from now, when we look back and see what was \naccomplished in that 106th Congress that is important to the State of \nNew Mexico and the people of New Mexico, this acquisition of the Baca \nRanch will be at the top of the list.\n  I very much appreciate the good bipartisan effort that has gone into \nthis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 1893. A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to prohibit \nthe Secretary of the Interior from taking land into trust for Indian \ntribes for gaming purposes under certain conditions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                    gaming clarification act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a Senate companion \nbill to legislation sponsored in the other body by the distinguished \nRepresentative from southwestern Missouri (Mr. Blunt). This bill \nintends to clarify the application of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, \nor IGRA, in Missouri.\n  Specifically, this bill would prevent Indian Tribes from setting up \ncasino gambling operations in areas of Missouri where non-Indians \ncurrently are prohibited from gambling. This is vitally important, if \nfor no other reason than to maintain harmony in these communities. It \nis also essential to preserve the family-friendly atmosphere that draws \nso many vacationers to these areas. Branson, Missouri, in particular, \nhas attained national fame as an extraordinarily beautiful area, with \nfun activities and entertainment suitable for parents and children \nalike.\n  An invasion of gambling into this setting would wreck this tremendous \nasset. It would bring all the well-known pathologies and social \nproblems that accompany gambling. I oppose introducing gambling into \nthese areas and will do all I can to fight it. We must protect the \nfamily spirit that makes Branson a national destination for \nvacationers. We must do likewise for other Missouri communities that \noffer similar sanctuaries from the hyperactive stress of modern life, \nas well as great places for residents to raise children, build homes, \nand do business.\n  The bill I introduce today is very similar to one I offered in 1997. \nThat bill would also have prevented Tribally owned casinos in areas of \nMissouri where non-Indian casinos are currently illegal. It became \nnecessary when a Tribe in Oklahoma applied to put land in the small \ntown of Seneca, Missouri into trust status for gambling purposes. They \nwanted to operate a casino where no one else could do so legally and to \ndo so despite overwhelming community objection. Fortunately, the \nInterior Secretary indicated to me that he would not approve that \napplication, and the Tribe ultimately withdrew its gambling \napplication. Thus, the issue was satisfactorily resolved without \nlegislation.\n  More recently, however, a flurry of applications has been filed to \nput Indian-owned land into trust for non-gambling activities. I am glad \nthe Tribes are finding that non-gambling activities, as proposed uses \nfor these lands, can be more beneficial and more friendly to their \ncommunities and neighbors. However, a great many of my constituents are \nconcerned that these trust applications might make it easier to apply \nfor gambling later. They worry that some Tribes might be seeking to \napprove gambling casinos through the back door. This bill will \neliminate that concern by clarifying the meaning of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act with respect to Missouri.\n  When the Congress adopted IGRA in 1988, it intended for a State's \ngeneral policy toward gambling to be considered in evaluating \napplications by Indian Tribes to start casino operations. Drawing upon \npast court decisions in this area, the Congress provided that a Tribe \nmight be eligible to conduct casino gambling on their lands in a State \n``that permits such gambling for any purpose by any person, \norganization, or entity.'' Once a State decides to move away from a \ncriminal/prohibitory stance toward gambling, and adopts instead a \ncivil/regulatory stance, Tribes are to have the opportunity to engage \nin gambling in that State as well. To that end, they may ask the State \nto negotiate a compact to regulate those casinos.\n  Generally, this approach helps ensure public peace while also \nensuring the Tribes get to participate in gambling on more-or-less the \nsame basis as non-Indians in the State. If the people of a State, \nthrough their legislature or through direct legislation, decide to \nlegalize casino gambling ``by any person,\n\n[[Page S14419]]\n\norganization, or entity,'' they cannot simply exclude the Tribes in \nfavor of whatever non-Indian gambling companies might have the inside \ntrack in the State government. The Tribes are to have the same \nopportunity as the non-Indian companies.\n  But, if the people of a State maintain a general prohibition on \ngambling--whether as an expression of moral opposition or for some \nother reason--the Tribes will also need to respect this public opinion \njust like everyone else. I believe this is the situation in Missouri, \nwhose constitution includes just such a general prohibition on casino \ngambling, with an exception for casinos based on the Missouri and \nMississippi Rivers.\n  Article III of the Missouri Constitution sets out the powers of the \nMissouri General Assembly. Section 39 of that article makes certain \nthings expressly outside of the legislature's authority. This is where \nthe State's general prohibition on gambling appears. ``The General \nAssembly shall not have power,'' it says, ``to authorize lotteries or \ngift enterprises for any purpose, and shall enact laws to prohibit the \nsale of lottery or gift enterprise tickets.'' It says prohibit, not \nregulate.\n  Gambling, in general, is still prohibited by State law. Under section \n572.020 of the Missouri Revised Statutes, ``the crime of gambling'' is \na class C misdemeanor, unless committed by a professional player, in \nwhich case the crime is a class D felony. This means the crime of \ngambling is punishable by fine of up to $300 in the case of a \nmisdemeanor. A professional player may be fined up to $5,000 or twice \nthe amount of any gain received, up to a limit of $25,000. These \ncriminal offenses also carry potential prison sentences, of 15 days for \na misdemeanor and up to 5 years for felony gambling.\n  The State constitution does not give the General Assembly authority \nto legalize these crimes. The power to legalize gambling was withheld \nfrom the General Assembly by the express terms of the constitution. Any \nchange would require a constitutional amendment, ratified by the voters \nof Missouri.\n\n  The voters did exercise their authority to authorize very limited \nexceptions, without removing the general prohibition on legalized \ngambling. In the case of casino gambling, the voters authorized the \nGeneral Assembly to legalize certain games only on excursion gambling \nboats and floating facilities docked along the Missouri and Mississippi \nRivers. Again, the voters granted these limited exceptions without \ndisturbing the general constitutional prohibition on gambling, which is \na criminal offense elsewhere in the State.\n  The initiative that created this exception took this approach because \nmany areas of Missouri have strong objections to gambling casinos. \nParticularly in southwest Missouri, many citizens hold strong moral \nobjections to gambling. Many others simply fear that gambling would \ndestroy the family atmosphere that makes the Branson area a desirable \nand unique vacation spot. Still others are concerned that gambling \ndisproportionately preys on the hopes of the poor, making it a \nparticularly regressive economic activity.\n  We can see this expression of the community's view in the votes that \nwere cast on the Missouri and Mississippi riverboat casino initiative. \nIn the November 1994 election, voters in Taney county (where Branson is \nlocated) voted against the casino initiative 73% to 27%. In Greene \ncounty (where southwest Missouri's largest metropolitan area of \nSpringfield is located), 58% of voters opposed the riverboat casinos. \nFinally, in Newton county (the home of Seneca, Missouri, where a Tribe \nonce sought to impose a casino on the local residents), 62% of voters \nopposed the constitutional amendment.\n  Knowing the strength of these communities' opinions on gambling in \ngeneral, the sponsors of the initiative petition drive had no real \nalternative but to leave the general gambling prohibition intact while \ncarving out a very narrow geographic exception for Missouri's two major \nrivers. Otherwise, the initiative would almost certainly have failed \nstatewide as well. Therefore, the constitutional amendment reassured \nsouthwest Missourians that they likely would not feel the change \ndirectly--it would affect only the two rivers far away from them, and \nwould not bring casinos into the family oriented Branson and \nSpringfield areas. The general constitutional prohibition on gambling \nstayed in force.\n  The limited exception for riverboat casinos, therefore, did not \nchange the State's posture on gambling from a criminal/prohibitory one \nto a civil/regulatory one. In areas such as the Branson, Missouri area, \ngambling is still a criminal offense. IGRA's requirement that the State \nnegotiate to allow Tribally owned casinos is not triggered, since \ncasino gambling in that area is not permitted by ``any person, \norganization, or entity.'' As I mentioned earlier, that's the language \nIGRA uses to trigger a State's obligation to negotiate with the Tribes \nto create a regulatory compact.\n  Tribes wanting to operate casinos on the Missouri or Mississippi \nRivers might have a case under IGRA, since there are persons, \norganizations, or entities authorized to gamble there. But this is not \ntrue in Branson, Springfield, or other areas off the rivers where \ngambling is still prohibited and where the General Assembly lacks \nconstitutional authority to legalize it even if it wanted to.\n  This view of IGRA is not undermined, as some claim, by the \nMashantucket Pequot case decided in 1990. In that case, the \nMashantucket Pequots sued Connecticut to force the State to negotiate a \ncasino gambling compact because the State authorized ``Las Vegas \nNights'' as a fundraising activity for certain nonprofit organizations. \nConnecticut had argued that the occasional Las Vegas Nights did not \nmean that the State had decriminalized gambling in general.\n  However, those nonprofits authorized to operate casinos, even on a \nvery occasional basis, fall within the express language of ``any \nperson, organization, or entity'' used in IGRA, which is what the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals found. Allowing nonprofits to engage in \nsome forms of casino gambling did move the State of Connecticut into a \ncivil/regulatory stance on casino gambling. The State did not \nabsolutely prohibit it; it regulated the type of organization permitted \nto engage in gambling. Thus, IGRA was triggered by the express language \nof the law.\n  This is completely different from the situation in Missouri, where \nall persons, organizations, and entities are flatly prohibited, by \ncriminal law, from casino gambling anywhere but on the Missouri and \nMississippi Rivers. The Mashantucket Pequot case does not apply to the \nMissouri situation. Geographic limitations, like in Missouri, were not \nat issue in that case.\n  Thus, the language of this bill does not really change the current \npolicy of IGRA. It simply makes explicit what is already plainly \nimplicit under current legislation and case law. It would take express \nnotice of the provision in Missouri's constitution on gambling and \nrecognize that Missouri still maintains a criminal/prohibitory stance \ntoward gambling off the rivers.\n  Because some pro-gambling advocates are attempting to read the \nMashantucket Pequot case too broadly, trying to make it apply to \nMissouri when it clearly does not, this bill is essential. In the past, \na number of Tribes have tried to use that argument to try to set up \ncasinos in Missouri--even in a small town like Seneca, nowhere near the \nMissouri or Mississippi Rivers. Because some people are trying to read \ninto the Mashantucket Pequot case a view that is really not there, this \nbill writes into law the correct interpretation.\n  I appreciate the hard work my colleague in the other chamber did on \nthis bill, and am glad to have the opportunity to resolve this issue \nonce and for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1894. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain land to Park \nCounty, Wyoming; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     north cody, wy land conveyance\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today to \nprovide for the conveyance of economic development land for Park \nCounty, WY.\n  The management of our public lands and natural resources is often \ncomplicated and requires the coordination of many individuals to \naccomplish desired objectives. When western folks\n\n[[Page S14420]]\n\ndiscuss Federal land issues, we do not often have an opportunity to \nidentify proposals that capture and enjoy the support from a wide array \nof interests; however, the bill Senator Enzi and I are introducing \ntoday offers just such a unique prospect. Project coordinators and \ninvolved parties have spent a great deal of time incorporating the \nconcerns of various individuals by presenting their plans to agency and \ncongressional representatives.\n  This parcel of land was identified by the Bureau of Land Management \nand Bureau of Reclamation as an unsuitable area for public domain and \nthe agencies have recommended that it be disposed of by the Federal \nGovernment. The Park County Commissioners subsequently approached the \nWyoming Congressional Delegation about allowing the county to pursue \neconomic development efforts that would be beneficial to the local town \nand surrounding communities. Specifically, this legislation is needed \nto allow the Federal Government to sell approximately 190 acres of land \nto Park County, WY for the appraised value of $240,000. The county \ncommissioners intend to work with an economic development group to \nattract new businesses to the area and allow other companies to expand \nat an industrial park adjacent to the conveyance land.\n  Mr. President, this bill enjoys the support of many different groups \nincluding county government officials as well as the local community. \nThis proposal will provide for the creation of a number of private \nsector jobs in a county that has 82 percent Federal land ownership. It \nis my hope that the Senate will seize this opportunity to allow a local \ncommunity to improve their livelihoods and economic prospects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1894\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Building Act of 1959 to give \nfirst priority to the location of Federal facilities in central \nbusiness areas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n                    the downtown equity act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my good \nfriend, the senior senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, in introducing \nthe ``Downtown Equity Act of 1999.''\n  The location of federal buildings and facilities have a tremendous \nimpact on local communities. We are introducing the ``Downtown Equity \nAct'' to ensure that the federal government is a good neighbor that \npromotes the vibrancy of communities throughout the country.\n  Guidance for federal agencies on the location of their facilities \nexists in two executive orders. Unfortunately, these directives are at \ntimes inconsistent with each other and have been used to support \ndifferent goals. This became clear to me when I worked closely with the \nGeneral Services Administration (GSA), the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (INS) and the city of Burlington. In 1998, I \ncalled together a meeting with all these interested parties to discuss \neligible locations for a new INS facility in downtown Burlington. \nOfficials from the city cited one executive order about locating \nbuildings in downtown areas while INS officials countered with another \nexecutive order that promotes the location of federal facilities in \nrural areas. Instead of complementing one another to promote a \nreasonable policy, the two executive orders are negating each other and \nclearly neither have enough teeth to result in the policy proclaimed in \neither order.\n  Mr. President, managing a city is a difficult enough task. Mayors and \ncity managers across the country should not have to also wade through \ndueling executive orders when they share the same goals as the \nAdministration to re-energize town centers. The federal government \nneeds to set a clear policy on the location of federal buildings in \ndowntown areas. Without legislation to clarify this policy, agencies \nmake decisions about the location of buildings and operations that can \nundercut the viability of central business districts, encourage sprawl, \ndegrade the environment, and have an adverse impact on historical \neconomic development patterns. Federal facilities should be sited, \ndesigned, built and operated in ways that contribute to--not detract \nfrom--the economic well-being and character of our cities and towns. \nFederal facilities can have a tremendous impact and we need to make \nsure that location decisions do not erode the character and quality of \nlife in our cities and towns. I want to prevent a repeat of the \nexperiences in Vermont, and I know that Senator Baucus has many of the \nsame concerns in Montana.\n  The Downtown Equity Act of 1999 clarifies the intention of these \ndueling executive orders by directing federal officials to give \npriority to locating federal facilities in central business\n\n[[Page S14421]]\n\nareas. This bill does not pit urban areas versus rural areas, but \ninstead promotes the siting of these facilities in downtown areas--\nurban or rural. By adopting this legislation, the Federal government \ncan become a leader in the effort to limit sprawl and support the \neconomic vitality of central business areas.\n  There is a fundamental problem with development that our bill also \ntries to address: it's more expensive to build and rent in a \ntraditional downtown area than to build on an empty site outside of a \nbusiness district. Downtown areas have great difficulty competing in \nthe procurement process because of the higher costs generally \nassociated with downtown areas. Sometimes, despite the best intentions \nof federal officials, sites with the lowest absolute cost are \npredisposed to win. This approach is too simplistic. Our ``Downtown \nEquity Act of 1999'' directs the General Services Administration to \nstudy the feasibility of establishing a system for giving equal \nconsideration to both the absolute and adjusted costs of locating in \nurban and rural areas, and between projects inside and outside of \ncentral business areas. While the absolute cost of projects will always \nbe important, a more balanced and robust consideration of the costs of \na project is needed.\n  The benefits of limiting sprawl, supporting historic development \npatterns, and revitalizing our downtown central business areas can \nmitigate the higher costs associated with constructing, leasing, and \noperating Federal establishments inside central business areas. Unless \nthe overriding mission of the agency or economic prudence absolutely \ndictate otherwise, location of Federal facilities should be supportive \nof local growth management plans for downtown central business areas.\n  When Federal landlords or tenants arrive in town, we have every right \nto expect that they will be good neighbors. Beyond that, the Federal \ngovernment also needs to be a leader in the effort to limit sprawl and \nprotect the environment and the character of our cities and towns. \nLivable and thriving central business districts can be a renewable \nresource, and the Federal government should be part of the solution, \nnot part of the problem.\n  Senator Baucus and I look forward to working with our colleagues and \nwith the Executive Branch to bring much needed reform to the decision-\nmaking process that governs the siting of Federal facilities. We all \nrecognize that decisions to prevent or limit sprawl will always be made \nlocally, but the Federal Government can do much to help our communities \nact on their decisions. And, the Federal Government must stop being an \nunwitting accomplice to sprawl by siting buildings outside of downtown \nareas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, and \na section-by-section summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1896\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Downtown Equity Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that locating Federal \n     facilities in central business areas--\n       (1) strengthens the economic base of cities, towns, and \n     rural communities of the United States and makes them \n     attractive places to live and work;\n       (2) enhances livability by limiting sprawl and providing \n     air quality and other environmental benefits; and\n       (3) supports historic development patterns.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that Federal agencies recognize the \n     implications of the location of Federal facilities on the \n     character, environment, economic development patterns, and \n     infrastructure of communities;\n       (2) to ensure that the General Services Administration and \n     other Federal agencies that make independent location \n     decisions give first priority to locating Federal facilities \n     in central business areas;\n       (3) to encourage preservation of historic buildings and \n     stabilization of historic areas; and\n       (4) to direct the Administrator of General Services to \n     study the feasibility of establishing a system for meaningful \n     comparison of Federal facility procurement costs between \n     central business areas and areas outside central business \n     areas.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Currently, the location \n     of federal offices and other facilities is governed by \n     several different laws and executive orders, which often \n     creates confusion and conflict. For instance, current law \n     gives a strong preference to locating Federal facilities in \n     rural areas, while an Executive Order (No. 12072) promotes \n     the location of Federal facilities in central business areas. \n     These conflicting policies can have serious adverse \n     consequences to communities, such as promoting sprawl and \n     contributing to the decline of downtown areas.\n       The ``Downtown Equity Act of 1999'' seeks to eliminate this \n     confusion by establishing a clear, statutory preference for \n     locating Federal facilities in central business areas, both \n     in rural and urban areas. Thus, Federal facilities will help \n     strengthen the economic base of cities, towns and rural \n     communities and make them more attractive places to live and \n     work. Locating Federal facilities in downtown areas will also \n     support historic development patterns, limit sprawl, and have \n     other important environmental benefits.\n       The bill also requires the General Services Administration \n     (GSA) to study the feasibility of establishing a procurement \n     assessment system which considers both the absolute and \n     adjusted costs of locating Federal facilities between central \n     business areas and outside those areas.\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Title.\n       Section 2. Finding and Purposes\n       Section 3. Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1959 (40 USC \n     601 et seq.) to add a new section establishing a preference \n     for locating Federal facilities in central business areas in \n     both rural and urban areas. This preference could be waived \n     if locating a facility in such area would either materially \n     compromise the mission of the agency or would not be \n     economically prudent. GSA is required to adopt rules to \n     implement this provision and also to report annually to the \n     Congress on the location of Federal agencies under this \n     section. This section also defines ``central business area'' \n     as the centralized business area determined by local \n     officials.\n       Section 4. This section requires that within two years, the \n     GSA conduct a study and report to Congress on the feasibility \n     of establishing a system for comparing the absolute and \n     adjusted costs of locating Federal facilities in rural areas \n     as compared to urban areas and in central business areas as \n     compared to outside central business areas. The bill \n     authorizes a total of $400,000 for the study.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Vermont, Senator Leahy in introducing the Downtown Equity Act of \n1999. This bill will make the federal government a better partner with \nlocal officials when it comes to locating federal offices in a \ncommunity. It will establish in statute a clear preference for federal \noffices to be located in the central business areas of a community. Why \nis this important?\n  We all know the many problems facing community leaders as they chart \nthe future course of their cities and towns. They must balance \ndevelopment patterns, employment, historic preservation, city services, \ntransportation, and many other factors to arrive at a plan that makes \nthe most sense for them.\n  In many cases, the Federal government is a major source of employment \nand economic activity in these communities. That is particularly true \nin smaller cities and towns, where federal employees can make up a \nlarger percentage of the employment base than in our large metropolitan \nareas.\n  But too often, local officials find themselves battling with federal \nagencies over where to locate, or relocate, Federal facilities. The \ndesires of agencies to locate on the outskirts of a small town can \nconflict with the needs of the community to preserve a vital business \ncenter downtown.\n  I have seen firsthand some of these location battles in Montana. \nCommunities such as Helena, Billings and Glasgow, have seen agencies \nthreaten to move out of the downtown area, removing a linchpin of \neconomic development that supports other local businesses. In another \ncase, this time in Butte, an agency looked to abandon an historic \nbuilding downtown in favor of a new site closer to the Interstate.\n  The impact on these communities from such actions can be devastating. \nIn Helena, for example, the relocation of the federal building would \nhave removed over 400 Federal workers from the area and dealt a major \nblow to plans to revive the downtown core, known as Last Chance Gulch. \nAnd in Glasgow, a small town even by Montana standards, the relocation \nfrom the central business area to a new site on the outskirts of town \nthreatened the survival of other businesses downtown and contributed to \nsprawl. Yes, even in the Big Sky state, sprawl is a threat to the \nvitality of our communities and the beauty of our environment.\n  Many of these conflicts between communities and Federal agencies \nstems from the confusing, and sometimes conflicting, jumble of laws, \nexecutive orders, and regulations. It almost seems as if there is a \nprovision to justify almost anything an agency wants to do. One law \ntells agencies to locate in rural areas. An executive order tells \nagencies to give priority to central business areas. No wonder agencies \nare confused and community leaders are angry.\n  Mr. President, that's not right. We should have a clear, simple to \nunderstand policy when it comes to location of Federal facilities. \nFurthermore, that policy should make it easier for the Federal \ngovernment to help community leaders who seek to maintain the vitality \nof their downtown areas. And that is what our bill does.\n  First, as a matter of policy, it states that locating federal \nfacilities in central business areas is good for the economy and the \nlivability of communities.\n  But more importantly, the bill implements that policy by requiring \nthat the head of each Federal agency give first priority to central \nbusiness areas when locating, or relocating, Federal facilities. This \nrequirement could be waived if it would materially compromise the \nmission of the agency or if it would not be economically prudent. But \nthose would be exceptions to the general rule that downtown areas \nshould be the preferred area for Federal offices. And the downtown \nareas will be determined by local officials, not Federal agencies.\n  This bill will be good for our communities. And it will be good for \nthe Federal government.\n  In closing let me express my appreciation to my colleague from \nVermont for all the work that he has put into this issue. His \nleadership has been instrumental in crafting this bill. I look forward \nto working with him to bring this bill through the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and before the Senate early next year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1897. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nan Office of Autoimmune Disease at the National Institutes of Health, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n           the nih office of autoimmune diseases act of 1999\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the NIH \nOffice of Autoimmune Diseases Act of 1999. This legislation, which is \nvery similar to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives by \nCongressman Waxman, would create an Office of Autoimmune Diseases as \npart of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of \nHealth. I would like to outline briefly why I feel that this office and \nthis legislation are needed.\n  To understand autoimmune diseases, it is first necessary to talk \nabout the body's immune system. The immune system is a collection of \ntissues which is designed to fend off any foreign invaders into our \nbody. For example, we live in a world surrounded by microbes of various \nkinds, many of which would be harmful to us if they could set up shop \nin our bodies. However, the immune system recognizes that a foreign \nmicrobe has entered our body and it mobilizes a variety of defenses to \nexpel this foreign invader.\n  The critical importance of the immune system can be easily seen when \nsomething goes wrong with it. For example, when a baby is born with a \nmajor defect in its immune system, it is extremely vulnerable to \nattacks by bacteria that a healthy baby would be able to fight off. \nSuch immune-deficient babies need to be protected from their \nenvironment in order to preserve their lives. You may have seen the TV \nprograms about such ``bubble babies'', who have to spend their entire \nlives in a protective plastic bubble or a spacesuit.\n  However, although the immune system is essential for human life, it \nsometimes can cause problems with our health. When someone gets a \nkidney transplant, for example, it is the immune system which tries to \nfight off this ``foreign invader'', a process called rejection. The \nsurvival of the transplant requires that the recipient be\n\n[[Page S14423]]\n\ngiven treatment in order to suppress the immune system.\n  Occasionally, the body's immune system goes haywire and starts to \nattack the body's own tissues as if they were foreign invaders. This \nprocess is called autoimmunity, and diseases in which autoimmunity is \nthought to play an important role are called autoimmune diseases. The \nspectrum of human illnesses for which there is evidence of an \nautoimmune component is extremely broad, ranging from lupus to diabetes \nto multiple sclerosis. At the National Institutes of Health, these \ndifferent diseases are often studied in completely different \ninstitutes: diabetes in the National Institute of Diabetes and \nDigestive and Kidney Diseases; lupus in the National Institute of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases; multiple sclerosis in the National \nInstitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; and so forth.\n  Despite being studied in different locations, these diseases all have \none thing in common: abnormalities of the immune system that lead to an \nautoimmune process in which the body actually attacks itself. It is \nvital that researchers on one autoimmune disease understand what \nresearch advances are being made on other autoimmune diseases; the key \nto understanding the autoimmune process in multiple sclerosis might \nvery well be uncovered by a researcher working on autoimmunity in \ndiabetes.\n  This is where the need for an NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases \narises. Its purpose is to make sure that there is cooperation and \ncoordination across scientific disciplines for all those working on the \nbroad spectrum of autoimmune diseases. Researchers working on \nautoimmunity in one narrowly defined disease must be able to benefit \nfrom research advances in autoimmune research. The history of medicine \nis replete with examples where breakthroughs in one area were actually \na direct consequence of advances in a completely unrelated field.\n  This bill sets up an Office of Autoimmune Diseases at NIH, along with \na broadly representative coordinating committee to assist it. The \ndirector of the Office of Autoimmune Diseases will be responsible for \nsetting an agenda for research and education on autoimmune diseases, \nfor promoting cooperation and coordination among the disparate entities \nthat are working on autoimmune diseases, for serving as principal \nadvisor to HHS on autoimmune diseases, for husbanding resources for \nautoimmune disease research, and for producing reports to keep other \nscientists and the public informed about progress in autoimmune disease \nresearch.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to explain why I have a particular interest \nin the area of autoimmune diseases. A very close friend of mine in \nDelaware, Ms. Tia McDowell, is fighting valiantly against a chronic \ndisease. At present, the treatments for this disease no longer seem to \nbe working very well, so Tia's hope lies in new research advances. \nAlthough doctors are not sure what causes Tia's disease, they do think \nthat autoimmunity plays an important part. For Tia, and for others with \ndiseases where autoimmunity is important, I want to make sure that we \nare moving ahead with research in the most efficient manner possible, \nand I think that creation of an NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases is \none way to help this process along.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the NIH Office of \nAutoimmune Diseases Act of 1999 as something we in Congress can do to \nhelp our research scientists conquer this puzzling and pernicious group \nof diseases. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 226\n\n       Whereas Japan is the world's second largest economy with \n     exports and imports together equal to one-fifth of its gross \n     domestic product;\n       Whereas Japan is the second largest trading partner of the \n     United States and sends almost one-third of its exports to \n     the United States;\n       Whereas prosperity and growth in Japan, one of the primary \n     beneficiaries of the liberal international trading system, is \n     dependent on the maintenance of open markets throughout the \n     world;\n       Whereas prosperity in the Asian region and globally \n     requires open markets in Japan;\n       Whereas Japan has a profound interest in ensuring that the \n     World Trade Organization continues to thrive and develop, and \n     that world markets are open on the basis of a rules-based \n     system that is widely supported by governments, businesses, \n     nongovernmental organizations, and average citizens \n     throughout the world;\n       Whereas Japan's dependence on open markets requires Japan \n     to take a leadership role, rather than a defensive posture, \n     in the next round of multilateral trade negotiations;\n       Whereas support for free trade in the United States and in \n     many other countries has become increasingly fragile;\n       Whereas the world's major trading nations, including Japan, \n     have a special responsibility to take the measures necessary \n     to strengthen a consensus for free trade;\n       Whereas Japan's importation of manufactured goods, as a \n     share of its gross domestic product, is considerably lower \n     than that of other industrialized nations and is one of the \n     lowest of all nations reporting data to the World Bank;\n       Whereas Japan has one of the lowest levels of intra-\n     industry trade in the industrialized world according to the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development;\n       Whereas even in the case of rice where some progress was \n     made at the Uruguay Round, the Government of Japan agreed to \n     a tariff-rate quota, yet set the over quota tariff rate at a \n     level that is currently equivalent to approximately a 500 \n     percent ad valorem duty, thus drastically reducing the \n     possible market impact of the concession;\n       Whereas Japan is protecting its trade-distorting policies \n     in the areas of agriculture, forestry, and fishing and is \n     trying to shift the focus of the next round of multilateral \n     trade negotiations away from concessions and liberalization \n     of its trade-distorting policies in these areas;\n       Whereas there is a concern that in the previous rounds of \n     multilateral trade negotiations, the Government of Japan has \n     been able to minimize the commitments it made;\n       Whereas there is a concern that the Government of Japan may \n     be able to minimize the actual implementation of commitments \n     through formal government measures and informal government \n     guidance to counter the effects of those commitments on \n     liberalization;\n       Whereas reducing Japanese tariffs and eliminating \n     traditional nontariff barriers appears to have less of an \n     effect than expected on improving market access in Japan in \n     many sectors because of the complex and opaque network of \n     systemic barriers that continue to exist in much of Japan's \n     economic system;\n       Whereas despite the fact that Japan is a full participant \n     in the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement and appears to \n     be making concessions equal in value to the concessions made \n     by other parties, Japan has not opened the government \n     procurement market to the degree expected by the United \n     States and other trading partners;\n       Whereas because of the impediments in the Japanese \n     government procurement market that were not addressed by the \n     GATT and the WTO, the United States has had to negotiate \n     bilateral government procurement agreements covering \n     computers, telecommunications equipment, medical products, \n     satellites, and supercomputers;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan has called for reopening \n     the WTO Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the \n     GATT 1994 (the Antidumping Agreement), and supports similar \n     efforts by other nations, which would result in reducing the \n     effectiveness of United States trade law and the ability of \n     the United States to take action against the injurious and \n     unfair trade practice of dumping;\n       Whereas the advanced tariff liberalization process would be \n     further along but for the opposition of Japan at the Asia-\n     Pacific Economic Cooperation forum; and\n       Whereas a focus on Japanese practices and commitments at \n     the next round of multilateral trade negotiations is more \n     important than ever because the trade laws of the United \n     States, such as section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, section \n     1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, \n     and title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of \n     1988, have been significantly weakened as a result of \n     agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     appropriate officials in the executive branch--\n       (1) should include, in the United States negotiating \n     objectives for the next round of multilateral negotiations, \n     specific expectations as to how the negotiations will result \n     in changes in the Japanese market;\n       (2) should pay special attention to commitments required of \n     the Government of Japan in the next round of negotiations and \n     ensure that commercially meaningful Japanese concessions \n     equivalent to concessions made by other major trading nations \n     will lead to market change in Japan;\n       (3) should cooperate closely with other major trading \n     nations to ensure that the next round of negotiations results \n     in genuine change in Japan's markets.\n       (4) should consult closely with Congress throughout the \n     next round of negotiations about the specific impact of the \n     negotiations on Japan's markets, and should provide periodic \n     reports, with full input from the private sector, about \n     progress being made in addressing Japanese barriers within \n     the negotiations;\n       (5) should devote the resources needed to analyze market \n     barriers in Japan and to analyze how these market barriers \n     can be addressed in the next round of negotiations; and\n       (6) should work closely with United States manufacturers, \n     service providers, and nongovernmental organizations to \n     develop the priority areas for focusing United States efforts \n     with respect to Japan in the next round of negotiations and \n     to determine the progress being made in meeting those \n     priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14425-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14425-S14426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 227--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE IN \n  APPRECIATION OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR EMPLOYER SUPPORT OF THE \n                           GUARD AND RESERVE\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nKennedy, and Mr. Rockefeller) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S. Res. 227\n\n       Whereas the National Committee for Employer Support of the \n     Guard and Reserve (NCESGR) was established by Presidential \n     proclamation issued in 1972;\n       Whereas national defense planners at that time, \n     anticipating the end of the draft under the Military \n     Selective Service Act, foresaw the potential that the \n     Nation's reserve component forces would be used increasingly \n     to meet national security requirements, that the operations \n     of members' civilian employers would be disrupted by that \n     development, that employers accustomed to National Guard and \n     Reserve service being an alternative to compulsory active \n     duty service would question the necessity for volunteer \n     participation in the Nation's community-based defense forces, \n     and that the employers' support for Guard and Reserve service \n     would erode;\n       Whereas, to counteract those potential problems, the \n     National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and \n     Reserve was chartered to develop public understanding of the \n     National Guard and Reserve forces and to enlist the support \n     of employers of members of the reserve components in the \n     development of personnel policies and practices that \n     encourage employee participation in National Guard and \n     Reserve programs;\n       Whereas, for over 25 years, the National Committee for \n     Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve has informed \n     employers of the ever-increasing importance of the National \n     Guard and Reserve, explaining to employers the necessity for, \n     and the role of, these forces in national defense;\n\n[[Page S14426]]\n\n       Whereas there are over 4,200 Employer Support of the Guard \n     and Reserve (ESGR) volunteers from among the business, civic, \n     and community leaders in committees in all 50 States, the \n     District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and \n     Guam;\n       Whereas the ESGR volunteers carry out a variety of programs \n     and services to inform communities and employers about the \n     vital role of the National Guard and Reserve;\n       Whereas ESGR volunteers honor with suitable recognition the \n     many employers who actively support employee participation in \n     the National Guard and Reserve;\n       Whereas ESGR volunteers educate employers of members in the \n     National Guard and Reserve and those employees about the \n     rights and obligations regarding military leave that were \n     established or reaffirmed by the Uniformed Services \n     Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1974;\n       Whereas, to underscore the important role of the National \n     Guard and Reserve in our national defense, the National \n     Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve \n     developed the Statement of Support program under which \n     employers of members of the reserve components are invited to \n     declare their support for their employees' participation in \n     the National Guard and Reserve;\n       Whereas the first statement of support under the program \n     was signed by the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive \n     Officer of General Motors in the Office of the Secretary of \n     Defense on December 13, 1972;\n       Whereas the next day, President Richard Nixon signed a \n     statement of support covering all Federal civilian employees \n     and, since then, Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and \n     Clinton have all made the same commitment;\n       Whereas thousands of other employers nationwide have \n     likewise signed statements of support for service of their \n     employees in the reserve components;\n       Whereas nearly 50 percent of America's total military might \n     is composed of National Guard and Reserve component members;\n       Whereas despite the ending of the Cold War in 1989, the \n     military commitments of the United States have not \n     diminished;\n       Whereas the Nation's reserve components are being called \n     upon more than ever before to contribute to the protection of \n     our national security interests and are critical contributors \n     to that mission;\n       Whereas, during the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, more \n     than 260,000 Reserves were called to active duty to support \n     military operations in the Persian Gulf region;\n       Whereas National Guard and Reserve members contribute over \n     13,000,000 duty days yearly in support of military operations \n     and exercises worldwide, which is a rate of duty that is 13 \n     times greater than the rate of duty experienced during the \n     Cold War; and\n       Whereas employers, public officials, military leaders, and \n     military members rely on the National Committee for Employer \n     Support of the Guard and Reserve to promote public and \n     private understanding of the National Guard and Reserve in \n     order to obtain the employer and community support that is \n     necessary to ensure the availability and readiness of reserve \n     component forces: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that the National \n     Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve makes \n     vital contributions to enabling the National Guard and \n     Reserve to support the national security strategy while, at \n     the same time, acting on behalf of the Nation's employers to \n     ensure that their interests are represented with equity and \n     fairness; and\n       (2) the Senate congratulates the National Committee for \n     Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, its staff, and \n     volunteers for their commitment to our national defense, for \n     their contribution of time and talent, and for maintaining \n     the much needed support of employers and communities for the \n     National Guard and Reserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14426-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 228--MAKING CHANGES TO SENATE COMMITTEES FOR THE \n                             106TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution;

Res. 230\n\n       Whereas government discrimination in Germany against \n     individuals and groups based on religion or belief violates \n     Germany's obligations under the Universal Declaration of \n     Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, and the Helsinki Accords, which provide \n     that member states must ``recognize and respect the freedom \n     of the individual to profess and practice alone or in \n     community with others, religion or belief acting in \n     accordance with the dictates of his own conscience'';\n       Whereas the 1993 through 1998 State Department Country \n     Reports on Human Rights Practices in Germany have disclosed \n     acts of Federal, State, and local government discrimination \n     in Germany against members of minority religious groups, \n     including Charismatic Christians, Muslims, Jehovah's \n     Witnesses, and Scientologists;\n       Whereas State Department Human Rights Reports on Germany \n     have also disclosed acts of government discrimination against \n     United States citizens because of their religious beliefs;\n       Whereas State Department Human Rights Reports on Germany \n     have disclosed discrimination based on religion or belief in \n     Germany in such forms as exclusion from government employment \n     and political parties; the use of ``sect-filters'' (required \n     declarations that a person or company is not affiliated with \n     a particular religious group) by government, businesses, \n     sports clubs, and other organizations; government-approved \n     boycotts and discrimination against businesses; and the \n     prevention of artists from performing or displaying their \n     works;\n       Whereas United Nations reports have disclosed \n     discrimination based on religion or belief in Germany, and a \n     1997 report by the United Nations Special Rapporteur for \n     Religious Intolerance concluded that the Government of \n     Germany ``must implement a strategy to prevent intolerance in \n     the field of religion and belief'';\n       Whereas the 1998 report of the State Department's Advisory \n     Committee on Religious Freedom Abroad warned that unless the \n     work of the German Government's Parliamentary Inquiry \n     Commission on ``so-called sects and psycho-groups'', which \n     investigated dozens of religious groups, including Mormons \n     and other minority Christian groups, ``focuses [its] work on \n     investigating illegal acts, [it] runs the risk of denying \n     individuals the right to freedom of religion or belief'', and \n     the Committee specifically reported that ``members of the \n     Church of Scientology and of a Christian charismatic church \n     have been subject to intense scrutiny by the Commission, and \n     several members have suffered harassment, discrimination, and \n     threats of violence''; and\n       Whereas in 1997, a United States immigration judge granted \n     a German woman asylum in the United States, finding that she \n     had a well-founded fear of persecution based on her religious \n     beliefs if she returned to Germany: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Government of Germany to uphold its \n     commitments to ``take effective measures to prevent and \n     eliminate discrimination against individuals or communities \n     on the grounds of religion or belief'' and ``foster a climate \n     of mutual tolerance and respect between believers of \n     different communities'', as required by the Organization on \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe's Vienna Concluding \n     Document of 1989;\n       (2) urges the Government of Germany to enter into a \n     constructive dialogue with minority groups subject to \n     government discrimination based on religion or belief;\n       (3) continues to hold the Government of Germany responsible \n     for protecting the right of freedom of religion or belief of \n     United States citizens who are living, performing, doing \n     business, or traveling in Germany; and\n       (4) calls upon the President to assert the concern of the \n     United States Government to the Government of Germany \n     regarding government discrimination in Germany based on \n     religion or belief.\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution \nconcerning religious discrimination in Germany with\n\n[[Page S14427]]\n\nmy colleague, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. \nThe resolution urges the German government to eliminate religious \ndiscrimination within its country because I believe, as a matter of \ngeneral government policy, no religion or belief should be \ndiscriminated against. Anytime the government collects or allows \nbusinesses to collect and use information that marks an individual as \nbeing different, it is discriminatory and it is wrong. This is a human \nrights issue. An individual or a group should be allowed to worship in \nprivate without public repercussions.\n  A letter sent to me from the Department of State in August, states \n``Wherever it may occur, discrimination against an individual or group \nis a fundamental human rights violation, and the United States \ngovernment is still very concerned about incidents of discrimination in \nGermany.'' The Department of State Human Rights Reports on Germany have \ndisclosed discrimination based on religion or belief in Germany in such \nforms as: exclusion from government employment and political parties; \nthe use of ``sect-filters'' (required declarations that a person or \ncompany is not affiliated with a particular religious group) by \ngovernment, businesses, sport clubs, and other organizations; \ngovernment-approved boycotts and discrimination against businesses; \nand, the prevention of artists from performing or displaying their \nworks.\n  I also am aware of the possibilities of United States companies based \nin Germany being coerced by the German government to discriminate \nagainst American and other employees based on their beliefs. We have a \nnumber of German companies conducting business in the United States. I \ndo not want to see these discriminatory practices imported to our \ncountry. This issue of government discrimination is not solely \ncontained within the borders of Germany.\n  The resolution is simple and straightforward. It urges the German \ngovernment to enter into a constructive dialogue with minority groups \nsubject to government discrimination based on religion or belief. The \nresolution also calls upon the president to assert the United States' \nconcern to Germany regarding government discrimination based on \nreligion or belief.\n  If the goal of a world functioning under a flag of democratic freedom \nis to be realized, the leaders of the free world must set the example. \nGermany is a leader in the European and world communities. Germany also \nis a strong United States ally. It is my hope that the German \ngovernment will allow its country men and women to be leaders of a free \nsociety where an individual's beliefs are the sole decision of the \nindividual rather than a matter of state.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record a letter I sent \nto the Department of State on July 16, 1999 as well as the Department \nof State's response to my letter.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Marc Grossman,\n     Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, State \n         Department, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Grossman: Over the past six years there has been a \n     steady increase in the number of religious freedom violations \n     in Germany. These violations have been noted in the State \n     Department Human Rights Country Reports on Germany and the \n     1998 report of the State Department Advisory Committee on \n     Religious Freedom. They have also been a matter of concern to \n     various human rights groups. All of these reports have \n     described both government and private sector discrimination \n     against individuals and groups, including American citizens, \n     because of their religious beliefs.\n       Last November, several of my colleagues in the Senate and I \n     wrote to Chancellor Schroeder to express our concerns about \n     this discrimination and the need for dialogue between the \n     German Government and representatives of various religious \n     groups. When we finally received a reply to our inquiry from \n     the German Foreign Office in March, it was accompanied with a \n     copy of the ``Religious Freedom'' section of the 1998 State \n     Department Human Rights Report on Germany with a note stating \n     that the 1998 Report revised ``certain views found in former \n     reports.'' We were quite disappointed that the Foreign Office \n     reply largely ignored our concerns. While I do not share the \n     German view that the 1998 Human Rights Report signaled that \n     the State Department is no longer concerned with religious \n     discrimination in Germany, I find the German Government's \n     perception of the Report troubling.\n       One religious group in Germany that has been the subject of \n     the State Department reports is the Christian Community in \n     Cologne (CCK), an 1,100 member Church headed by an American, \n     Pastor Terry Jones. The 1998 Report stated that virtually no \n     incidents of harassment, discrimination, or death threats \n     have been directed at CCK members since 1992. However, I have \n     seen statements from Pastor Jones, along with other reports \n     and news stories that indicate that the CCK has been the \n     subject of discrimination since 1992. Tax difficulties aside, \n     the CCK has been subject to harassment by government \n     ``sect'' commissions, threats of violence, and members \n     being denied jobs and child custody because of their \n     Church affiliation. The sources of these reports include \n     the 1998 Interim Report of the State Department Advisory \n     Committee on Religious Freedom Abroad; an April 1998 CNN \n     Worldview story; the testimony of a CCK representative at \n     a September 1997 hearing before the Commission on Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE); and a May 1997 Report \n     from the British House of Lords. Also, in testimony before \n     the CSCE in July 1998, a representative from the Center \n     for the Study of New Religious Movements criticized \n     Germany for police raids that have occurred against small, \n     independent Pentacostal churches. The Universal Life \n     Church has also suffered discrimination in Germany. Press \n     reports indicate that members of this Christian Church \n     lost their jobs, not because of any wrongdoing, but \n     because of their commitment to their faith.\n       Another minority group that has been subject to significant \n     discrimination in Germany is the Church of Scientology and \n     its members. The documentation of discrimination against both \n     Americans and Germans based solely on their Church membership \n     seems irrefutable. I especially find the growing governmental \n     use and sponsorship of ``sect-filters'' disturbing. \n     Nonetheless, in spite of all this evidence and documentation, \n     the German Government seems to believe the State Department \n     has revised its views as to the existence of religious \n     discrimination in their country. I have also seen media \n     reports that characterized the 1998 Report as effectively \n     ending earlier State Department criticism of Germany for its \n     treatment of Scientologists.\n       I cannot believe these characterizations of the Human \n     Rights Report are an accurate representation of the position \n     of the State Department on these matters. Clearly, the matter \n     of religious discrimination and persecution in Germany needs \n     to be reviewed and the position of the State Department \n     clarified. That review should include a thorough evaluation \n     of the problem, the extent to which the German government is \n     responsible for these actions, and a determination of the \n     appropriate response for these actions, and a determination \n     of the appropriate response of the United States Government \n     to this serious situation.\n       As I mentioned earlier, the letter sent to Chancellor \n     Schroeder by my Senate colleagues and I expressed the belief \n     that an open and direct dialogue between the German \n     Government and minority religious groups was sorely needed. \n     In particular, I am aware that the State Department had \n     undertaken efforts to establish such a dialogue between the \n     German Government and the Church of Scientology. I applaud \n     this effort. Unfortunately, I understand that the German \n     Government has refused to enter into any such dialogue. Is \n     the State Department considering any steps it can take to \n     encourage such a discussion?\n       Given Germany's strong commitment to democracy, I am \n     troubled by the continuing reports and the evidence of \n     government sponsored discrimination in Germany against \n     minority religious groups. For Germany to abide by its \n     international treaty commitments it must respect the beliefs \n     of all religious groups. At whatever level it occurs, it \n     remains the responsibility of the German Federal Government \n     to ensure that the entire country complies with its \n     international human rights treaty obligations. This should \n     especially be true when American citizens are involved.\n       While I commend the efforts of the State Department to \n     address discrimination in Germany based on religion or \n     belief, it is very important for your Human Rights Country \n     Report on Germany to be clarified so that the position of the \n     State Department on this issue is unmistakably clear. I hope \n     to work with you to resolve these important issues and look \n     forward to your reply to my letter at your earliest \n     opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Thank you for your July 16 letter \n     regarding religious freedom violations in Germany and the \n     State Department's 1998 Human Rights Report. I am responding \n     on behalf of Assistant Secretary Grossman. Your letter raises \n     several important issues concerning ongoing efforts at the \n     State Department to work with German officials and affected \n     minority groups to end discrimination in Germany based on \n     religion or belief. Wherever it may occur, discrimination \n     against an individual or group is a fundamental human rights \n     violation, and the United States Government is still very \n     concerned about incidents of discrimination in Germany. As \n     the past six years of Human Rights Reports indicate, \n     religious discrimination in Germany continues to take place\n\n[[Page S14428]]\n\n     and the Department of State is committed to addressing issues \n     of religious intolerance.\n       We, too, were puzzled with characterizations of the 1998 \n     Human Rights Report as ending criticism of Germany. While we \n     would rather devote our time to working with the German \n     government on ways to end discrimination in Germany based on \n     religion or belief, it is also very important to express \n     criticism and concern with ongoing German discriminatory \n     actions and policies. This critical review is one of the \n     primary purposes of the annual Human Rights Report. To \n     interpret the 1998 Report's greater inclusion of German \n     government statements attacking minority groups and \n     rationalizing discriminatory acts and policies as State \n     Department agreement with such statements is wrong.\n       Perception of the report aside, we are particularly \n     concerned with growing use of sect filters in Germany which \n     prevent a person from practicing his or her profession or \n     participating in public and private fora, solely based on \n     that person's religion or belief. This clearly discriminatory \n     practice is being used by the Federal Ministry of Economics, \n     state governments, private businesses and other organizations \n     in Germany. We have discussed with German state and federal \n     authorities the violation of individual rights posed by sect-\n     filters and will continue our efforts to end the use of such \n     filters.\n       On the subject of discrimination against the Evangelical \n     churches in Germany, specifically the Christian Community in \n     Cologne (CGK), U.S. Embassy personnel have met with two \n     associate pastors of the CGK. We have been unable to meet \n     with Pastor Jones, the leader of the church who testified \n     before the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     in 1997 about discrimination. The two pastors interviewed did \n     describe incidents of religious discrimination in child \n     custody and employment situations. However, until we are able \n     to verify these allegations of discrimination, the State \n     Department is reluctant to include such examples in an \n     official report.\n       Over the past year, State Department officials in \n     Washington and Germany have undertaken a determined effort to \n     bring together representatives of the Church of Scientology \n     with representatives of the German Federal Government to open \n     a dialogue on issues of concern. To our dismay, the German \n     Government has refused to meet with Scientology \n     representatives. Regardless of what the German Government \n     thinks about the nature and philosophy of Scientology, \n     refusal to enter into a constructive dialogue is troubling. \n     We will continue to press the German Government to take this \n     step.\n       As your letter correctly states, Germany is obligated by \n     various international human rights treaties to respect the \n     freedom of an individual to worship alone or in community \n     with other religious or beliefs acting in accordance with the \n     dictates of his own conscience. And no matter at what level \n     discrimination occurs, it is the responsibility of the German \n     Federal Government to ensure that the entire country complies \n     with its international human rights treaty obligations. We \n     look forward to working with you and other Members of \n     Congress to that end in Germany.\n       I hope our response has addressed your concerns. Please do \n     not hesitate to contact us if you have further questions \n     about this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Barbara Larkin,\n     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14428-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency declared in 1979 is to \ncontinue in effect beyond November 14, 1999, to the Federal Register \nfor publication. Similar notices have been sent annually to the \nCongress and published in the Federal Register since November 12, 1980. \nThe most recent notice appeared in the Federal Register on November 12, \n1998. This emergency is separate from that declared with respect to \nIran on March 15, 1995, in Executive Order 12957.\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran that began in 1979 has \nnot been fully resolved. The international tribunal established to \nadjudicate claims of the United States and U.S. nationals against Iran \nand of the Iranian government and Iranian nationals against the United \nStates continues to function, and normalization of commercial and \ndiplomatic relations between the United States and Iran has not been \nachieved. On March 15, 1995, I declared a separate national emergency \nwith respect to Iran pursuant to the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act and imposed separate sanctions. By Executive Order 12959 of \nMay 6, 1995, these sanctions were significantly augmented, and by \nExecutive Order 13059 of August 19, 1997, the sanctions imposed in 1995 \nwere furthered clarified. In these circumstances, I have determined \nthat it is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities that \nare in place by virtue of the November 14, 1979, declaration of \nemergency, including the authority to block certain property of the \nGovernment of Iran, and which are needed in the process of implementing \nthe January 1981 agreements with Iran.\n                                                  William J.

WILLIAMS, WINNER OF THE MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, ``Hero'' is a word that is \ninappropriately used with some frequency in this day and age. This is \ncertainly unfortunate, for a true ``hero'' is not the person who caught \nthe game winning pass, but is an individual who has distinguished \nthemself through courage. No matter how diluted this term have become \nthrough informal and casual use, it remains simply the best way to \ndescribe James E. Williams.\n  There was a time not long ago when all Americans understood the \nimportance of military service and the notion of sacrificing of one's \nself for the better of the nation. James Williams was one such man, an \nindividual who was so anxious to render military service, he lied about \nhis age in order to join the United States Navy in 1946. Over the \ncourse of his career, Mr. Williams would repeatedly demonstrate his \nfierce determination and bravery.\n  Our involvement in the conflict in Vietnam was still relatively small \nin 1966, but such was not the case for those who were working to topple \nthe democratic government of the Republic of Vietnam. Communist forces \nwere operating extensively throughout South Vietnam, terrorizing \npeasants, and fighting a low intenstity conflict against our forces and \nour allies. That the infiltration of the enemy into the Republic of \nVietnam was largescale was proven on that day late in October of 1966 \nwhen Mr. Williams and eight other sailors operating on two different \nplastic river boats engaged in a three-hour firefight with enemy \npersonnel. As a result of that action, more than 1,000 communist \nmilitary personnel were killed in action, and almost seventy North \nVietnamese boats were sunk or destroyed. The courage demonstrated by \nMr. Williams in the face of overwhelming odds, and the effective attack \nhe mounted, led to his being awarded the Medal of Honor for his \nactions. Only the citation from the Medal of Honor awarded Mr. Williams \nadequately describes his heroism, and it reads:\n\n       For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of \n     his life above and beyond the call of duty as a member of \n     River Section 531 during combat operations on the Mekong \n     River in the Republic of Vietnam. On 31 October 1966, Petty \n     Officer Williams was serving as Boat Captain and Patrol \n     Officer aboard River Patrol Boat (PBR) 105 accompanied by \n     another patrol boat when the patrol was suddenly taken under \n     fire by two enemy sampans. Petty Officer Williams immediately \n     ordered the fire returned, killing the crew of one enemy boat \n     and causing the other sampan to take refuge in a nearby river \n     inlet. Pursuing the fleeing sampan, the U.S. patrol \n     encountered a heavy volume of small arms fire from enemy \n     forces, at close range, occupying well-concealed positions \n     along the river bank. Maneuvering through this fire, the \n     patrol confronted a numerically superior enemy force aboard \n     two enemy junks and eight sampans augmented by heavy \n     automatic weapons fire from ashore. In the savage battle that \n     ensued, Petty Officer Williams, with utter disregard for his \n     own safety, exposed himself to the withering hail of enemy \n     fire to direct counterfire and inspire the actions of his \n     patrol. Recognizing the overwhelming strength of the enemy \n     force, Petty Officer Williams deployed his patrol to await \n     the arrival of armed helicopters. In the course of this \n     movement he discovered an even larger concentration of enemy \n     boats. Not waiting for the arrival of the armed helicopters, \n     he displayed great initiative and boldly led the patrol \n     through the intense enemy fire and damaged or destroyed fifty \n     enemy sampans and seven junks. This phase of the action \n     completed, and with the arrival of the armed helicopters, \n     Petty Officer Williams directed the attack on the remaining \n     enemy force. Now virtually dark, and although Petty Officer \n     Williams was aware that his boats would become even better \n     targets, he ordered the patrol boats' search lights turned on \n     to better illuminate the area and moved the patrol perilously \n     close to shore to press the attack. Despite a waning supply \n     of ammunition the patrol successfully engaged the enemy \n     ashore and completed the rout of the enemy force. Under the \n     leadership of Petty Officer Williams, who demonstrated \n     unusual professional skill and indomitable courage throughout \n     the three hour battle, the patrol accounted for the \n     destruction or loss of sixty-five enemy boats and inflicted \n     numerous casualties on the enemy personnel. His extraordinary \n     heroism and exemplary fighting spirit in the face of grave \n     risks inspired the efforts of his men to defeat a larger \n     enemy force, and are in keeping with the finest traditions of \n     the United States Naval Service.\n\n  By the time Mr. Williams retired in 1967, and having fought in two \nwars, he was the most decorated enlisted man in the history of the \nUnited States Navy. Anyone who looked at the medals adorning his dress \nuniform would immediately recognize James Williams as a hero by noting \nhis three Purple Hearts; three Bronze Stars; the Vietnamese Cross of \nGallantry; the Navy and Marine Corps Medal; two Silver Stars; the Navy \nCross; and of course, the Medal of Honor.\n  Despite having served his nation commendably and heroically, James \nWilliams still wanted to contribute to society and hoped to follow in \nthe footsteps of his father as a lawman. In 1969, Mr. Williams was \nnominated as the United States Marshal for the District of South \nCarolina by President Richard M. Nixon, and he again distinguished \nhimself as a no-nonsense law and order man, vital for a day and age \nwhen some people reveled in challenging the system and in seeking \nconfrontation with authorities. I doubt that too many people were \nfoolish to cross swords with James E. Williams, and his work as a law \nenforcement official helped keep South Carolina safe and peaceful.\n  In the years following his retirement from Federal service, Mr. \nWilliams continued to contribute to the nation, but as a private \ncitizen. He was very active in the ``Medal of Honor Society'', a \nprivate organization dedicated to promoting knowledge and education \nabout America's highest award.

Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the \nuntimely death of Sacramento Mayor Joe Serna. This past Sunday, \nNovember 7, 1999, the City of Sacramento and the State of California \nlost an inspirational public servant and a great statesman. The death \nof Mayor Serna represents a loss for all of those who had the honor to \nknow him, and for the entire City of Sacramento.\n  Mayor Serna had a distinguished public career, culminating in the \nelection as Mayor of our State's Capital City in 1992. He served his \ncountry and his community as an educator, Peace Corps worker and public \nservant. He was a man of compassionate spirit, dedicated ideals and \nprincipled acts.\n  Mayor Serna's accomplishments, both personally and professionally, \nare many. Here are a few highlights:\n  1966--Earned his Bachelor's degree in Social Science and Government \nat California State University, Sacramento.\n  1966--Earned his Master's degree in Political Science at University \nof California, Davis.\n  1966--Served in the Peace Corps in Guatemala.\n  1969--Joined the faculty at California State University, Sacramento.\n  1975--Served as Education Advisor to then-Lieutenant Governor Mervyn \nDymally.\n  1981--Elected to the Sacramento City Council, where he would serve 11 \nyears.\n  1991--Received the Distinguished Faculty Award.\n  1992--Elected as Mayor of Sacramento.\n  1995--Received the Economic Development Leadership Award by the \nNational Council for Urban Economic Development.\n  1996--Reelected as Mayor of Sacramento.\n  1998--Led the effort for the redevelopment of downtown Sacramento.\n  1998--Received an honorary doctorate degree from Golden Gate \nUniversity.\n  I have known Mayor Serna for many years, and he was a visionary for \nSacramento and the region.\n  Mayor Serna led California's Capital City toward a more positive and \nprosperous direction. He was extremely dedicated to the economic \nrevitalization and redevelopment of Sacramento. Under his leadership, \nthe Sacramento City Council helped to revitalize the downtown \ncommunity, the region's heart and center. He appointed the first \nCouncil of Economic Advisors to help frame the City's economic agenda. \nIn addition, Mayor Serna assembled a negotiating team that preserved \nthe Sacramento Kings, the region's National Basketball Association \nTeam, when the King's owners threatened to move the team out of town.\n  Mayor Serna was not only an honorable mayor, he was also a role model \nto the Latino community and an inspiration to all Californians. He was \nthe first Latino elected as mayor of one of California's major cities, \nexemplifying the success that one can attain through education, hard \nwork, and commitment--regardless of ethnicity. I believe Mayor Serna \ntranscended ethnic politics without every losing sight of his ethnic \nbackground and his humble beginnings.\n  Mayor Serna grew up working in the fields of San Joaquin County. In \nthe early 1960's he was an activist with the United Farm Workers, \nfighting for farm workers and for disadvantaged people. He went on to \nearn his bachelor's degree in Social Science and his master's degree in \nPolitical Science. He later entered the Peace Corps to serve the people \nin Guatemala as a community-development volunteer. Mayor Serna went on \nto became a professor at California State University in Sacramento and \nthen served his community as Mayor of the City of Sacramento.\n  Along the way, he helped to inspire a host of talented Latino elected \nofficials at all levels of government. Community leaders such San \nJoaquin County Supervisor Steve Gutierrez, State Senator Deborah Ortiz, \nand Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante attribute their participation \nin public service in part to the example and inspiration of Joe Serna.\n  As Supervisor Steve Gutierrez said, ``Mayor Serna went from being a \nfarm worker to organizer to an educator to mayor of Sacramento. He was \ntruly an exemplary public servant and leader.''\n  Most recently, I had the pleasure to meet with Mayor Serna in \nSacramento just hours after a heinous shooting had occurred at a Jewish \ncommunity center in Los Angeles. We had an opportunity to discuss at \nlength the issue of hate crimes and other regional issues. Mayor Serna \nwas passionate about his community and he deeply cared for its people. \nEven until his final days, he worked for a better life for his fellow \ncitizens.\n  Joe Serna leaves a powerful legacy in many lives and a lasting vision \nfor his beloved city of Sacramento. He was a dynamic leader, and we \nCalifornians were fortunate for his service. Mayor Serna will be sorely \nmissed. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Isabel, the entire \nSerna family, and the community of Sacramento.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14430-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14430-S14431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BOB GREENLEE\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize and congratulate Bob Greenlee on the occasion \nof his retirement from the Boulder City Council.\n  Bob and his wife Diane came to Colorado from Iowa in 1975 and used \ntheir savings to buy a small AM radio station in Boulder. Through their \nhard work and determination, they turned that small AM radio station \ninto KBCO, one of the top radio stations in the State. In addition to \ntheir work in radio, they have also helped bring several successful \nbusinesses to their community, expanding nationwide and employing \nthousands of people across the country through their enterprises. As \npart of their overall business philosophy, Bob and Diane have helped \nmany others achieve their entrepreneurial dreams by assisting them in \nbusiness ventures and startup companies.\n  The Greenlee's have also been an integral part of the Boulder \ncommunity through their philanthropic work. Together, they founded the \nBoulder County chapter of the ``I Have a Dream Foundation'' which \nassists underprivileged youth achieve their goal of a college \neducation. Bob and Diane have also endowed their own family foundation \nto carry on their tradition of philanthropy in Colorado. Their work has \nhelped thousands of people across Colorado in their desire to achieve \nthe ``American dream.''\n  As the cornerstone of his community involvement, Bob served on the \nBoulder City Council for 16 years as the voice of common sense and \nreason. In 1997, Bob was selected on a unanimous vote by his fellow \ncouncil members to serve as Boulder's mayor. As part of the city \ncouncil, Bob's lasting legacy will be his thoughtful, reasoned voice in \nhow a city should be operated. He views on frugality in the city budget \nand a common sense approach to city regulation will serve as an \nenduring reminder of his years of service to the community.\n  While he is retiring from City Council, Bob's interest in government \nhas not ended. He currently serves as the chairman of the Republican \nLeadership Program. The program is aimed at teaching the fundamentals \nof our democracy and is used as a forum to discuss current issues that \nimpact our everyday lives. His leadership has created one of the \nstrongest programs of its kind in the country, and will serve to \neducate Coloradans on the need to be involved in the issues which face \nour state and our country.\n  Bob Greenlee has shown us all that the American dream can still be \nattained. He and Diane started by knowing that they could make a \ndifference, and through their hard work and diligence, they were able \nto build their\n\n[[Page S14431]]\n\nlives in order to serve others. People like Bob and Diane Greenlee were \nthe cornerstone of our democracy and must be recognized for their \ncontributions to our society.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor and a privilege to recognize Bob \nGreenlee on his outstanding career and community involvement. I would \nlike to thank Bob and Diane for their service, and wish them both much \nsuccess in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14431-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORLD CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on August 26, 1999, 13 young women, \nages 15 and 16, put the First State on the map again by capturing the \nSenior League Softball World Series in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n  This was a tremendous accomplishment for Delaware and for the \ncountry. The Stanton-Newport team completed an undefeated run through \nthe double elimination tournament by winning a come-from-behind victory \nover a persistent and well seasoned team from the Philippines.\n  As one reporter put it, eight teams participated in the tournament, \nbut ``only one will have its flag fly over the field for the next \nyear.'' Proudly that will be the flag of the United States of America \nthanks to the team from the great State of Delaware.\n  The Stanton-Newport team is an outstanding example of the power of \nyouth sports in America. As I have said many times in the past, young \npeople need a hobby they love, at least one adult who supports them and \na good many friends with similar interests. Organized sports provides \nthis much and more.\n  In competitive sports young people learn responsibility, discipline, \nand the importance of cooperation and teamwork on and off the field. \nLater, these same young individuals will be able to apply their hard-\nearned lessons to everyday life.\n  The young women of Stanton-Newport epitomize the exceptional athletes \nand citizens from across the nation who are inspired on a daily basis \nby their committed parents and coaches.\n  I am proud to call this team a home-grown product and continue to \nsalute their efforts on behalf of the First State and the rest of our \nnation. They are indeed World Champions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14431-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DR.

Mr. President, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to recognize the outstanding work and \naccomplishments of Dr. Edwin Strong-Legs Richardson, Penobscot Indian \nPsychologist and President of Kiyan Indian Consultant Group. He is also \nknown as Song-gan-la Gan-Naw, which is Penobscot for Strong-Legs and \nKiyan Nakicinjin, which is Sioux for Flying Defender.\n  Dr. Richardson's admirable work ethic began at the age of thirteen \nwhen he started supporting his family as a logger. He has long been a \nnationally and internationally renowned applied behavioral scientist, \nconsultant, trainer, retired Army Officer, and Spiritual Leader. For \nover fifty years, Dr. Richardson has been an educator-trainer, \nincluding professional ski instructor, mountaineer, and military \ninstructor. He was voted one of the top instructors at four different \nuniversities/colleges and number one at two institutions.\n  As a combat Infantryman, Dr. Richardson fought the Germans, Japanese, \nand Vietnamese and served as the Commanding Officer of a Psychiatric \nDetachment in the Koran War. During his service, he was awarded for \nbravery under fire by his enlisted men and also received a commendation \nfrom General Westmoreland for an emergency landing of an airplane.\n  Dr. Richardson earned a B.S. in Pre-Med from the University of New \nHampshire and his Masters of Education in Physical and Mental \nRehabilitation from Springfield College. He then went on to The Ohio \nState University to receive his Doctorate in Health Education and \nCounseling.\n  I commend Dr. Richardson in raising public awareness of cultural \ndiversity through his teaching, television programs, and books he has \nauthored. He is an outstanding model for not only the Native American \ncommunities, but for all communities.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Christine Russell, who last week left my staff after seven \nyears as my legislative assistant and policy advisor on environmental, \ntransportation and energy issues. She married Alex Wells on October \n30th in South Carolina. She and her husband will be living in \nHarrisburg, PA.\n  As my primary staff member responsible for the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, which I now chair, she was one of my chief staff \nliaisons with New Hampshire municipalities in need of Federal \nassistance, and with the Federal and State agencies responsible for \nthese important issues. Chris was always there for me, and for the \npeople of New Hampshire. She will be terribly missed.\n  Christine came to my office from the National Association of \nManufacturers a few years after I came to the Senate. She brought with \nher the skills to balance private sector and public sector concerns \nregarding environmental, energy and transportation issues. Skills which \nI found invaluable during her years in my office.\n  In addition to her outstanding policy skills, Chris provided a warm \nsmile and enjoyable attitude to my Senate office. She was professional, \nintelligent, and articulate--but it was her enthusiasm and energy that \nwas most infectious. Chris was dedicated to her job, the U.S. Senate, \nand the people of New Hampshire. Alex is a very fortunate man, indeed!\n  Chris, on behalf of the people of New Hampshire and my entire staff, \nbest wishes in all of your future endeavors.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support \nof private sector innovation to solve a public problem. My state is the \nsite of a brand new, state of the art facility that will recycle \ncarpets, chemically breaking them down to their virgin chemical \ncomponents. Allied Signal and DSM are jointly opening the first-ever \ncarpet recycling plant in Augusta, GA, on November 15. It's a fitting \nday for the opening of a carpet recycling plant since it is America \nRecycles Day 1999.\n  Carpets comprise of a significant portion of the Nation's landfills. \nYet there are few programs at the state or local level targeted to \nredirecting carpets out of community landfills. The AlliedSignal-DSM \nfacility, aptly named ``Evergreen,'' will ensure that each year over \n200 million pounds of carpet never see a landfill. Now it may be hard \nto imagine 200 million pounds of carpet, so let me help you visualize \nit. If you had a 12 foot wide roll of carpeting you could lay it from \nNew York to San Francisco and back again, and that would equal about \n200 million pounds. And the Evergreen facility will save that much \nlandfill space each year.\n  The carpeting that will be recycled in Augusta will not simply be \nbroken down mechanically and remade into new carpets. Instead it will \nbe depolymerized--broken down chemically into the individual chemical \npolymers that comprise the nylon fiber in the carpets. The primary \nchemical is caprolactum, but they can't produce enough at their \nfacilities to meet the demands of their customers.\n  So they had a choice to make--either find another source of \ncaprolactum or build new chemical plants that could be used to make \ncaprolactum. With dedicated research engineers, they made several \ntechnological breakthroughs that enabled them to obtain caprolactum \nfrom used carpeting in a more economical fashion than to produce it at \na new chemical plant. They can actually recycle old carpets into \ncaprolactum more economically than they could produce it from scratch.\n  Avoiding the production of caprolatum in itself yields tremendous \nenvironmental benefits. To produce from scratch the amount of \ncaprolactum that the Evergreen facility will generate would take more \nthan 700 million barrels of oil a year, and 4 trillion Btus more in \nenergy usage. That is enough energy to heat 100,000\n\n[[Page S14432]]\n\nhomes a year. So it is not just landfill space that is saved under the \nEvergreen project.\n  AlliedSignal and DSM plan to market nylon 6 products made with \ncaprolactum from the Evergreen facility to carpet manufacturers, auto \nmakers and others to produce the highest quality nylon products. You \nwill soon see Infinity Forever Renewable Nylon on products in early \n2000.\n  I applaud the private sector initiatives that led to the evergreen \nproject and I am particularly pleased that they have chosen the great \nstate of Georgia in which to operate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14432-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES DUNCAN\n\n Mr. BURNS Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of James \nDuncan of Billings, Montana, a shining example of altruism and \nleadership.

LINTON\n\n Mr. SARBANES. I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated and \neffective leader of our Nation's transit program, Gordon J. Linton. \nGordon recently resigned his post as the thirteenth head of the FTA to \nmove on to other opportunities, and I would like to express my \nappreciation for the outstanding work that he has done.\n  During his six-year tenure as head of the Federal Transit \nAdministration (FTA), Gordon Linton has proved to be one of the best \nand most accomplished Administrators. He spearheaded the FTA's Livable \nCommunities Initiative which has demonstrated that transit can make a \nsubstantial contribution toward improving the quality of life in \ncommunities all across the Nation by improving the links between \ntransportation and housing, schools, places of worship, employment and \nrecreation. He worked tirelessly to expand citizen participation in the \ndecision-making process to help make transit facilities and services \nmore customer friendly and community-oriented. He played a key role in \nshaping the transit portion of the landmark Transportation Equity Act \nfor the 21st Century--or TEA-21--which is providing record levels of \nfunding for public transportation and established the innovative Access \nto Jobs program which is designed to ensure that people in transition \nfrom welfare to work have adequate transportation services.\n  I first came to know Gordon six years ago in July, when I chaired his \nnomination hearing in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee. It was clear that day, and evident throughout the past six \nyears, that Gordon Linton was a passionate advocate for transit. He not \nonly designed and directed over $37 billion in federal mass transit \ninvestments throughout the country--but never forgot that leadership \nbegins by example and used public transportation himself to get to work \nand in traveling in communities around America. Mr. Linton came to \nMaryland on numerous occasions to support mass transit projects and \nimprovements--projects such as the Baltimore Light Rail system; \nregional transit, such as the MARC commuter rail system; small town and \nrural systems to connect citizens in our rural areas to jobs, health \ncare, education. He has done this in Maryland and he has done this in \nevery state across the Nation.\n  Mr. Linton has exemplified a steadfast commitment to public service \nand public transportation. He is the longest-serving head of the \nFederal transit program since it was enacted in 1961. Before coming to \nWashington, Mr. Linton served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of \nRepresentatives in Pennsylvania where he was instrumental in passage of \nthe Commonwealth's first dedicated source of funding for transit and \nPennsylvania's seat belt legislation. I am pleased to say that through \nhis work as a Pennsylvania legislator and through his sincere, skillful \nshepherding of the Federal transit assistance program, Mr. Linton has \nproven his commitment to improve mobility, invest in our future and \nmake America more livable for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I know that every one of us whose constituents have \nbenefitted from Gordon J. Linton's leadership of our Federal Transit \nprograms wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14432-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GARY W.

Puryear of the 94th Regional Support Command, for his \nleadership and vision in creating one of the most comprehensive \ndevelopment and land exchange projects in support of the soldiers, \nsailors, and marines in the United States Armed Services.\n  Mr. Puryear established himself as a leader while developing a state-\nof-the-art home and training center for twenty-one units of the United \nStates Army, Navy, and Marine Corps Reserve in Manchester. He \nspearheaded this innovative program, assisting the Department of the \nArmy in saving over $2.5 million dollars in repair and maintenance \ncosts. His efforts also saved the Navy over $350,000 per year in lease \ncosts, and fostered the expansion goals of both the Manchester Airport \nand Saint Anselm College.\n  Mr. Puryear also actively worked to publicize the Army Reserve's \nModular Design System (MDS), highlighting its cost effectiveness and \nspeed, and subsequently reaffirming the importance of pursuing a \nprocess of multiple and mutual success.\n  Mr. Puryear's efforts largely contributed to creating this state-of-\nthe-art training center. As a result, 1,091 soldiers now occupy the \ncenter as a residence and a training site. The center itself indirectly \nhelped expand the Manchester Airport as a vital shipping and \ntransportation link by freeing up prime development space for airport \nrelated activities.\n  Gary Puryear has proven himself an innovative leader who is committed \nto the United States Armed Forces, and the community as a whole. He has \nassisted in saving the taxpayers thousands of dollars annually, \nenhancing the readiness of our armed forces, and solidifying a long-\nterm military presence in Manchester and Londonderry.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Mark Aldrich on the occasion of his retirement, on November \n30th, from the United States Senate after 20 years of service.\n  For the past nine years, Mark has served as my State Director, \nconfidant and community leader. Mark also served my predecessor, \nSenator Gordon Humphrey, as a loyal and dedicated staff member for more \nthan a decade.\n  Over the years, I have had the pleasure to travel thousands of miles \nwith Mark, through the Great North Woods, the covered bridges of Orford \nand Cornish, and the scenic mountains of the Monadnock Region. Mark and \nI drove in his old Cadillac * * * sharing stories and helping the \npeople of New Hampshire.\n  Together we worked to secure federal funding for the expansion of the \nManchester Airport, the newly completed Reserve Center in Londonderry, \nthe Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the development of the Pease Air Force \nBase and so many other important projects that have helped to fuel the \nNew Hampshire economy. Mark should take great pride in his many fine \naccomplishments, especially in promoting economic vitality in the North \nCountry and throughout the state. I know that the many businesses and \ncommunities he helped will miss him, as I will.\n  Mark is the kind of leader that we all aspire to become. He mixed \nhumor with guidance, making each of his fellow staff members feel \ncomfortable while sharing his advice and expertise. He energized the \noffice allowing for greater productivity and a fierce sense of loyalty.\n\n[[Page S14433]]\n\n  As Mark embarks on this new journey, I wish he and Connie every \nhappiness life has to offer. I know he will enjoy his leisure time with \nJonathan exploring the trails of the White Mountains and I am sure his \ncoaching skills will continue to flourish as he cheers on Molly and her \nteammates at Concord High. And the engagements with his band ``Souled \nOut'' will continue to experience success.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSan Francisco Police Officer James Guelff on the fifth anniversary of \nhis death in the line of duty.\n  This coming Saturday, the City of San Francisco will honor Officer \nGuelff by having his name enshrined at the corner of Pine and Franklin \nin San Francisco where he was slain on November 13, 1994.\n  Responding to a distress call, Officer Guelff, stationed at Northern \nPolice Station, reached the crime scene and was immediately fired upon \nby a suspect shielded by body armor and armed with an AK 223, an Uzi, \ntwo semi-automatic pistols, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. In \nan attempt to defend himself, Officer Guelff returned fire but his \npolice issue revolver could not penetrate the gunman's kevlar vest and \nbulletproof helmet. Officer Guelff was killed under the barrage of the \nassailant's bullets as he attempted to reload his revolver.\n  Officer James Guelff bravely faced an assailant with defensive armor \nand firepower no police officer should ever confront. In response to \nhis death, his relatives and fellow officers embarked on a national \ncampaign to restrict felons' access to body armor.\n  This incident helped raise awareness of the unacceptable risks \nofficers face on the street when they encounter gunmen with equal or \nbetter defensive protection. The bottom line is that criminals who use \nbody armor have a deadly offensive weapon.\n  It is a tribute to the memory of Office James Guelff and a tribute to \nthe persistence and dedication of his family and fellow officers that \nCalifornia passed legislation restricting the use of body armor by \nfelons.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the James Guelff Body Armor Act of \n1999 to enact Federal regulations on body armor. First, the measure \nincreases the penalties criminals receive if they commit a crime \nwearing body armor. Specifically, a violation will lead to an increase \nof two levels under the Federal sentencing guidelines. Second, it makes \nit unlawful for violent felons to purchase, use, or possess body armor.\n  This legislation is included in S. 254, the Juvenile Justice Crime \nbill, which is in its final negotiations in a joint House-Senate \nconference committee.\n  It is my hope that the Conference Committee will finish its job \nquickly so that we can provide a lasting tribute to Officer James \nGuelff. This legislation will better protect our police officers by \nmaking sure they are adequately supplied with body armor, and that \nhardened criminals are deterred from using body armor.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me on this special day in \nhonoring Officer James Guelff and celebrating the life of a true \nAmerican hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14433-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING ALASKA'S VETERANS OF UNDERAGE MILITARY SERVICE\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, earlier this year the Alaska \nLegislature passed a resolution honoring Alaska's Veterans of Underage \nMilitary Service. This is an important veterans organization in Alaska, \nand I would like to let the Senate know a little bit about it by \nsubmitting the text of the state resolution in the Record.\n  I ask that the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n  Resolution of the Alaska Legislature Honoring Alaska's Veterans of \n                       Underage Military Service\n\n       The Twenty-first Alaska State Legislature is proud to \n     commend Veterans of Underage Military Service and its members \n     for their attempts to locate and assist all underage veterans \n     of America's armed forces.\n       Throughout history, nations have called upon their youth to \n     fight their wars, and it is inevitable that some men and \n     women under the legal age, usually driven by strong \n     patriotism, have enlisted in the armed forces. In some \n     instances, these youth were discovered and separated from the \n     service having already seen action. After being discharged \n     from one branch of service for being underage, many promptly \n     enlisted in another branch of the armed services.\n       The Twenty-first Alaska State Legislature recognizes these \n     men and women who understood the importance of fighting for \n     freedom and honors their valiant efforts as defenders of the \n     United States of America during times of war and peril. The \n     Veterans of Underage Military Service Veterans was formed in \n     1990 to help such individuals, who were frequently discharged \n     from the service and stripped of their awards and their \n     military benefits.\n       The goal of the Veterans of Underage Military Service \n     organization is to contact all veterans who served in any \n     branch of the United States Armed Forces when they were under \n     legal age and to advise and assist them in obtaining a proper \n     discharge and veterans' benefits. A secondary goal is to \n     establish a historical record of underage veterans by \n     publishing their names, deeds, and stories. The organization \n     currently consists of more than 1,000 members nationwide who \n     served in the United States Armed Forces before they were of \n     legal age.\n       The Twenty-first Alaska State Legislature wishes to \n     recognize Alaska's own members of the Veterans of Underage \n     Military Service: Judd Clemens, Michael Mitchell, Gordon \n     Severson, Gene Wheeler, Larry Connolly, Miles Pierce, Elsie \n     Sexton, and Thor Weatherby.\n       We, the members of the Twenty-first Alaska State \n     Legislature honor the Veterans of Underage Military Service. \n     We commend them for their attempts to locate and assist all \n     underage veterans of the United States Armed Forces and \n     support their efforts to make ``whole'' these national \n     heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14433-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO ANDY FRENCH, EDDIE  WILSON, AND LIBBY O'FLAHERTY FOR THEIR \n                             HEROIC EFFORTS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor three individuals who define heroic action and the selflessness \nof many of the citizens of the State of New Hampshire. While only \nteenagers, these three individuals acted with maturity and grace in \nsaving the life of Carol Black of Newton, Massachusetts.\n  Andy French, Eddie Wilson, and Libby O'Flaherty, all of Gilford, New \nHampshire, were enjoying a quiet afternoon on the lake when they \nspotted Carol Black. Upon seeing the body of the unconscious woman in \nthe water of Lake Winnepesaukee, the three youths selflessly came to \nher aid. They did not hesitate before saving her, a testament to their \nindividual honor.\n  Mr. President, in a society where we too often hear stories of youth \nviolence, it is refreshing to hear of heroic deeds such as this. Too \noften, the actions of a few that have wandered from the fold overshadow \nthose who have acted with continual kindness.\n  It is one of the deepest pleasures for me to be able to rise today to \nhonor these three individuals from my home area. Their kindness and \ndedication sets a precedent for other youth to follow. It is an honor \nto represent them in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14433-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14433-S14434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ADDRESS BY KING ABDULLAH OF JORDAN AT THE KENNEDY LIBRARY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on October 14, the John F. Kennedy \nPresidential Library in Boston hosted a dinner in honor of King \nAbdullah II of Jordan.\n  In his remarks, King Abdullah spoke eloquently of the strong ties \nbetween the United States and Jordan, his vision for strengthening \npeace in the Middle East, and his hope of creating new opportunities \nfor future generations in Jordan.\n  Like his father, King Hussein, King Abdullah cares deeply about the \nJordanian people and stability in the region, and his comments are very \ninspiring. I believe that all of us who care about the future of the \nMiddle East\n\n[[Page S14434]]\n\nwill be interested in his remarks, and I ask that they be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   Speech by His Majesty King Abdullah II at the Kennedy Library in \n                   Boston, Thursday, October 14, 1999\n\n       Senator Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy, Mr. Manning, Ladies and \n     gentlemen, allow me first to express my sincere gratitude for \n     this beautiful evening which Rania and I shall cherish for \n     the rest of our lives.\n       Senator, I would like to add my voice to all those who have \n     paid tribute, over the years, to the Kennedy family, for the \n     contribution that they have made to the improvement of human \n     life and for the painful sacrifices that have made us all \n     realize the value of true citizenship.\n       I say that Senator, because I also happen to belong to a \n     family that has devoted itself since the turn of this century \n     to the improvement of the life of the Arab people. Over the \n     years, many sacrifices have been made to ensure that the \n     freedom, liberty, and integrity of the Arab mind is \n     sacrosanct, that the rights of the Arabs are not forgotten or \n     betrayed and that their future is protected.\n       As I conclude my second working visit to the United States, \n     I am very proud of the special relations that bind Jordan \n     with your country. The foundations of these ties, so \n     carefully laid by my late father have seen us making peace \n     with our Israeli neighbors, and subsequently guarding its \n     sustainability and continuity. Through our partnership with \n     America, we have built a unique model in our region. It is a \n     model of peace that is cemented by the respect of the \n     principles of democracy, freedom of expression, political \n     pluralism, free economic enterprise, and human dignity. It is \n     being continually reinforced through our positive interaction \n     with our neighbors.\n       Most importantly, it is the necessary requirement for \n     successfully facing the challenges ahead which are numerous \n     and quite complex. In my mind, the most daunting task that I \n     have set myself to accomplish is to guarantee that our \n     younger generation get an equal opportunity like others \n     elsewhere in the world: An opportunity to be active \n     participants in the shaping of their own destiny, one that \n     will hopefully focus on technological advances in science, on \n     being a part of the information technology revolution, and on \n     being able to enjoy the best of education, medical care, and \n     environmental standards.\n       These are big challenges that necessitate, first and \n     foremost, that we rid ourselves of the dark past of war, \n     conflict, and strife in our region, prior to getting ready to \n     embark on a future course of promise, rewards, and \n     accomplishments.\n       These challenges require more than ever that the \n     partnership with the United States be solid, strong, and \n     sustainable. The role that the United States has played in \n     the making of peace in our region must be complemented with \n     continued efforts designed to rehabilitate our region. If it \n     is to effectively participate in the community of nations, \n     not through conflict, but rather through a concrete \n     realization of a new positive role.\n       All of you present here tonight can contribute to the \n     making of a new region. We in Jordan will continue to provide \n     the model, but we need your support and contribution.\n       I do not want to keep you any longer; suffice it to say \n     that I am very grateful to all of you for your interest, your \n     support, and your determination to help us attain a dream \n     that befits the dawn of a new millennium.\n       Thank you again, and we hope to see you in the near future \n     in our part of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14434-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MAJOR CLINT CROSIER\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nMajor Clinton E. Crosier, an Air Force Fellow on my staff, and commend \nhis superior performance throughout this past year as a key member of \nmy national security team.\n  Major Crosier has been on active duty since 1988. During his 11-year \ncareer he has served as an Executive Office and Operations Management \nOfficer, during which time he deployed to Saudi Arabia during \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He has served as a Satellite \nOperations Flight Commander, overseeing the operations of part of the \nAir Force's multibillion dollar constellation of military \ncommunications satellites; and also as a Missile Operations Crew \nCommander and Flight Commander, supervising the training and \ncertification of over 200 of the nuclear launch officers serving as the \nbackbone of America's nuclear deterrent.\n  During his career, his outstanding performance and professionalism \nhas been recognized by his selection as the 90th Missile Wing's Staff \nOfficer of the Year; 28th Air Division's Company Grade Officer of the \nYear and Lance P. Sijan Leadership Award Winner; three-time selection \nas unit Company Grade Officer of the Year; Unit Evaluator of the Year; \nand Unit Flight Commander of the Year. Major Crosier is also a \nDistinguished Graduate of the Air Force's Operations Management Officer \nschool and Squadron Officer School, and graduated first in his class \nduring satellite operations training and missile operations training.\n  Upon arrival at the Pentagon just over a year ago, Major Crosier was \ntasked with building the Air Force's first ever Air Command and Staff \nCollege program for Congressional staff. This program, known as ACSC, \nis a 44-week graduate level program designed to provide mid-career \nofficers with an in-depth understanding of the principles and \napplication of air and space power. This was the first time in history \nthis program had been offered to Congressional staff. In this capacity, \nMajor Crosier was directly responsible for the graduation of 18 staff \nmembers from both the House and Senate in a ceremony last month over \nwhich the Secretary of the Air Force presided. During this ceremony, \nSecretary Peters heralded the Capitol Hill ACSC seminar Major Crosier \nbuilt as a ``very important tool to cement the important partnership \nbetween the Air Force and the Congress . . . that will serve \nindefinitely as a bridge between our two great institutions.'' \nAdditionally, Secretary Peters praised Major Crosier personally by \ndescribing his effort as an ``astronomical benefit'' to the Air Force.\n  Most recently, Major Crosier was one of only 10 officers in the \nentire Air Force selected for the prestigious Legislative Fellowship \nprogram, through which he came to work as a member of my personal \nstaff. The Air Force's Legislative Fellowship program is designed to \nidentify the Air Force's highest caliber performers through an \nextremely competitive selection process. These individuals are then \nprovided an in-depth education in the legislative processes of Congress \nthrough a one-year assignment in a Member's office, to prepare them for \nfuture senior leadership positions in the Air Force. Throughout the \npast year, he has been an invaluable resource to me, and a credit to \nthe United States Air Force.\n  Due to his vast experience in space and missile operations, Clint was \nable to provide me with expert assistance in my capacity as Chairman of \nthe Strategic Force Subcommittee on Armed Services, providing technical \nexpertise on a myriad of advanced space operations and missile defense \nprograms. He quickly became an expert on dozens of programs critical to \nnational security. Major Crosier also was responsible for performing \ntopical research and preparing me for dozens of Armed Services \nCommittee hearings, and provided a vital role on a number of wide \nranging issues from the Department of Defense Authorization and \nAppropriations Bills to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the \nVieques Weapons Range.\n  Major Crosier has been an outstanding addition to my staff, and has \nserved with the highest degree of integrity and distinction. His \nperformance has earned my highest praise, and he has distinguished \nhimself as one of the top military officers I have had the great \nprivilege to know during 16 years in Congress. Major Crosier has \ndemonstrated himself to be one of the Air Force's brightest future \nsenior leaders. As Major Crosier departs the Senate to serve on the \npersonal staff of the Secretary of the Air Force, I extend my sincerest \nappreciation for his valuable and professional service. I will not only \nmiss Clint's knowledge and efficiency, I will also miss his enthusiasm. \nClint is an honorable and dedicated individual. I wish he, his wife \nShelle, and their children, all the best in future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14434-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14434-S14435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATE COMMITTEE CHANGES\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

The Senate may also be \nready to take action on the remaining appropriations bills during \ntomorrow's session of the Senate. Senators should adjust their \nschedules for the possibility of votes throughout the day and into the \nevening. The leadership appreciates the patience and cooperation of his \ncolleagues as we attempt to complete the appropriations process prior \nto Veterans Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/09/senate-section/article/S14435-6", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
