Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S.J. Res. 14, which the clerk will report by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 14) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to \n     prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \n     States.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McConnell amendment No. 2889, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Hollings amendment No. 2890, to propose an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States relating to contributions \n     and expenditures intended to affect elections.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the proposed \namendment to the United States Constitution to permit Congress to \nprevent the desecration of our greatest national symbol: the American \nflag. I want to thank Chairman Hatch for his leadership on this \nimportant issue. Last year, Senator Hatch, on behalf of myself and many \nothers, introduced S.J. Res. 14, a constitutional amendment to \nauthorize Congress to protect the flag through appropriate legislation. \nSince 1998, the Judiciary Committee has held four hearings on this \nissue. I am pleased that this resolution now has 58 Senate sponsors. In \naddition, the House of Representatives has already passed an identical \nresolution, H.J. Res. 33, on June 24, 1999, by a vote of 305 to 124.\n  Throughout our history, the flag has held a special place in the \nhearts and minds of Americans. Even as the appearance of the flag has \nchanged with the addition of new stars to reflect our\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\ngrowing nation, its meaning to the American people has remained \nconstant. The American flag symbolizes an ideal for Americans, and or \nall those who honor the great American experiment. It represents \nfreedom, sacrifice, and unity. It is a symbol of patriotism, of loved \nones lost, and of the American way of life. The flag stands in this \nChamber, in our court rooms, and in front of our houses; it is draped \nover our honored dead; and it flies at half-mast to mourn our heroes. \nIt is the subject of our national anthem, our national march and our \nPledge of Allegiance. In short, the flag embodies America itself. I \nbelieve that our nation's symbol is a unique and important part of our \nheritage and culture, a symbol worthy of respect and protection.\n  This is not a new perspective. The American flag has enjoyed a long \nhistory of protection from desecration. Chief Justice Harlan, upholding \na 1903 Nebraska statute proscribing use of the Flag in advertisements \nstates,\n\n       [To] every true American the Flag is a symbol of the \n     nation's power--the emblem of freedom in its truest, best \n     sense. It is not extravagant to say that to all lovers of the \n     country it signifies government resting on the consent of the \n     governed; liberty regulated by law; the protection of the \n     weak against the strong; security against the exercise of \n     arbitrary power; and absolute safety for free institutions \n     against foreign aggression. Halter v. Nebraska, 205 U.S. 34, \n     41 (1907).\n\n  It is for these reasons that Americans overwhelmingly support \npreserving and protecting the American flag. During a hearing I chaired \nin March 1998, entitled ``The Tradition and Importance of Protecting \nthe United States Flag,'' the witnesses noted that an unprecedented 80 \npercent of the American people supported a constitutional amendment to \nprotect the flag. Recent polls show that support unchanged. In \naddition, the people's elected representatives reflected that vast \npublic support by enacting flag protection statutes at both the State \nand Federal levels. In fact, 49 State legislatures have passed \nresolutions asking Congress to send a constitutional amendment to the \nStates for ratification.\n\n  Regrettably, the Supreme Court has chosen instead to impose the \nacademic and elitist values of Washington, DC, on the people, instead \nof permitting and upholding the values that people attempted to demand \nof their government. In 1989, the Supreme Court ignored almost a \ncentury of history and thwarted the people's will in the case of Texas \nv. Johnson by holding that the American flag is just another piece of \ncloth for which no minimum of respect may be demanded.\n  In response, the Congress swiftly attempted to protect the flag by \nmeans of a statue, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, only to have that \nstatute also struck down by the Supreme Court in United States v. \nEichman. In 1989, 1990 and 1995 the Senate voted on proposed \nconstitutional amendments to allow protection of the flag--and each \ntime the proposal gained a majority of votes, but not the necessary \ntwo-thirds super-majority needed to send the amendment to the States \nfor ratification. And so we are here today to try again.\n  Critics of this measure urge that it will somehow weaken the rights \nprotected by the first amendment. I would draw their attention to the \nlong standing interpretation of the first amendment prior to Texas v. \nJohnson. At the time of the Supreme Court's decision, the tradition of \nprotecting the flag was too firmly established to suggest that such \nlaws are inconsistent with our constitutional traditions. Many of the \nstate laws were based on the Uniform Flag Act of 1917. No one at that \ntime, or for 70 years afterwards, felt that these laws ran afoul of the \nfirst amendment. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself upheld a Nebraska \nstatute preventing commercial use of the flag in 1907 in Halter v. \nNebraska. As Chief Justice Rhenquist noted in his dissent in Texas v. \nJohnson, ``I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act \nof Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States which make criminal \nthe public burning of the flag.''\n  Mr. President, I also reject the notion that amending the \nConstitution to overrule the Supreme court's decisions in the specific \ncontext of desecration of the flag will somehow undermine the first \namendment as it is applied in other contexts. This amendment does not \ncreate a slippery slope which will lead to the erosion of Americans' \nright to free speech. The flag is wholly unique. It has no rightful \ncomparison. An amendment protecting the flag from desecration will \nprovide no aid or comfort in any future campaigns to restrict speech.\n  Moreover, an amendment banning the desecration of the flag does not \nlimit the content of any true speech. As Justice Stevens noted in his \ndissent in Texas v. Johnson, ``[t]he concept of `desecration' does not \nturn on the substance of the message the actor intends to convey, but \nrather on whether those who view the act will take serious offense.'' \nLikewise, the act of desecrating the flag does not have any content in \nand of itself. The act takes meaning and expresses conduct only in the \ncontext of the true speech which accompanies the act. And that speech \nremains unregulated. As the Chief Justice noted, ``flag burning is the \nequivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, \nis most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, \nbut to antagonize others.''\n  But what if we fail to act? What is the legacy we are leaving our \nchildren? At a time when our nation's virtues are too rarely extolled \nby our national leaders, and national pride is dismissed by many as \narrogance, America needs, more than ever, something to celebrate. At a \ntime when too many Americans have lost respect because of disrespectful \nactions of elected leaders, we need a national symbol that is beyond \nreproach. At a time when Hollywood, which once inspired Americans with \nCapra-esque tales of heroism, integrity, and national pride, now \nbestows its highest honors on works that glorify the dysfunctional, the \nmiserable, the materialistic, and the amoral. America needs its flag \nuntainted, representing more than some flawed agenda, but this \nextraordinary nation. The flag, and the freedom for which it stands, \nhas a unique ability to unite us as Americans.\n  In sum, there is no principal or fear that should stand as an \nobstacle to our protection of the flag. The American people are seeking \na renewed sense of purpose and patriotism. They want to protect the \nuniquely American symbol of sacrifice, honor and freedom. The genius of \nour democracy is not that the values of Washington would be imposed on \nthe people, but that the values of the people would be imposed on \nWashington. I urge my colleagues to join me in letting the values of \nthe American people affect the work we do here. It is my earnest hope \nthat by amending the Constitution to prohibit its desecration, this \nbody will protect the heritage, sacrifice, ideals, freedom, and honor \nthat the flag uniquely represents.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak I support of the \njoint resolution, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Utah, \nSenator Orrin Hatch, proposing an amendment to the Constitution \nauthorizing Congress to prohibit physical desecration of the American \nflag.\n  From the birth of our nation, the flag has represented all that is \ngood and decent about our country. On countless occasions, on \nbattlefields across the world, the Stars and Stripes led young \nAmericans into battle. For those who paid the ultimate price for our \nnation, the flag blanketed their journey and graced their final resting \nplace.\n  Mr. President, the Flag is not just a piece of cloth. It is a symbol \nso sacred to our nation that we teach our children not to let it touch \nthe ground. It flies over our schools, our churches and synagogues, our \ncourts, our seats of government, and homes across America. It unites \nall Americans regardless of race, creed or color. The flag is not just \na symbol of America, it is America.\n  Those who oppose this constitutional amendment say it impinges on \nfreedom of speech and violates our Constitution. As a veteran who was \nwounded twice in Vietnam protecting the principles of freedoms that \nAmericans hold sacred, I am a strong supporter of the first amendment. \nHowever, I believe this is a hollow argument. There are many limits \nplaced on ``free speech,'' including limiting yelling ``fire'' in a \ncrowded theater. Other freedoms of speech and expression are limited by \nour slander and libel laws.\n  In 1989 and 1990 the Supreme Court struck down flag protection laws \nby\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nnarrow votes. The Court has an obligation to protect and preserve our \nfundamental rights as citizens. But the American people understand the \ndifference between freedom of speech and ``anything goes.''\n  When citizens disagree with our national policy, there are a number \nof options available to them other than destroying the American Flag to \nmake their point. Let them protest, let them write to their newspaper, \nlet them organize, let them march, let them shout to the rooftops--but \nwe should not let them burn the flag. Too many have died defending the \nflag for us to allow it be used in any way that does not honor their \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. President, in a day where too often we lament what has gone wrong \nwith America, it's time to make a stand for decency, for honor and for \npride in our nation. I urge my colleagues to support the flag \namendment. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with some hesitancy I will vote in favor \nof the flag protection constitutional amendment. My hesitancy stems not \nfrom any doubt that our Nation should provide specially protected \nstatus to our flag--I firmly believe the flag should be protected from \ndesecration. I am hesitant because we are voting to amend our Nation's \nConstitution and every Senator should exercise extreme caution when \nconsidering such changes.\n  I have given careful consideration on the important amendment \ncurrently before the Senate. A decade ago, when the Supreme Court \nissued its 5-to-4 decision invalidating flag desecration statutes, I \nread each of the three opinions filed by Justices of the Court. I was \nconvinced then, and remain convinced now, that the Court erred in its \ndecision and that such statutes, if properly written, are \nconstitutional. For this reason, I shall vote in favor of both the \nconstitutional amendment to protect our flag and the proposed amendment \nto substitute a flag protection statute for the constitutional \namendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my thoughts on a \nconstitutional amendment to ban flag burning and other acts of \ndesecration.\n  As a veteran of 30 years in the United States Navy and United States \nNaval Reserve, I know the pride members of the Armed Forces have in \nseeing the United States flag wherever they may be in the world. I \nshare the great respect most Vermonters and Americans have for this \nsymbol.\n  I personally abhor the notion that anyone would choose to desecrate \nor burn the flag as a form of self-expression. Members of the Armed \nServices place their lives at risk to defend the rights guaranteed by \nthe United States Constitution, including the First Amendment freedom \nof speech. It is disrespectful of these past and present sacrifices to \ndesecrate this symbol.\n  It seems highly ironic to me that an individual would desecrate the \nsymbol of the country that provides freedoms such as the first \namendment freedom of speech. However, in my opinion the first amendment \nmeans nothing if it is not strong enough to protect the rights of those \nwho express unpopular ideas or choose a distasteful means of this \nexpression.\n  I have given this issue a great deal of thought. I must continue to \noppose this amendment since I do not think that a valid constitutional \namendment, one that does not infringe on the first amendment, can be \ncrafted. The first amendment right of freedom of speech is not an \nabsolute right though as we have in the past recognized the legitimacy \nof some limits on free speech.\n  I do not think, however, that we should open the Bill of Rights to \namendment for the first time in our history unless our basic values as \na nation are seriously threatened. In this case, in recent years there \nhave not been a significant number of incidents of this misbehavior.\n  In my view, a few flag desecrations or burnings around the Nation by \nmedia-seeking malcontents does not meet this high standard and I \ntherefore cannot support the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor, I rise today \nin support of S.J. Res. 14, which would amend the United States \nConstitution to prohibit the desecration of our flag. Opponents to this \nmeasure contend that the right to desecrate the flag is the ultimate \nexpression of speech and freedom. I reject the proposition as I believe \nthat the desecration of our flag is a reprehensible act which should be \nprohibited. It is an affront to the brave and terrible scarifies made \nby millions of American men and women who willingly left their limbs, \nlives, and loved ones on battlefields around the world.\n  It is an affront to these Americans who have given the greatest \nsacrifices because of what the flag symbolizes. To explain what our \nflag represents, former United States Supreme Court Chief Justice \nCharles Evans Hughes in his work, ``National Symbol,'' said.\n\n     The Flag is the symbol of our national unity, our national \n           endeavor, our national aspiration.\n     The flag tells of the struggle for independence, of union \n           preserved, of liberty and union one and inseparable, of \n           the sacrifices of brave men and women to whom the \n           ideals and honor of this nation have been dearer than \n           life.\n     It means America first; it means an undivided allegiance.\n     It means America united, strong and efficient, equal to her \n           tasks.\n     It means that you cannot be saved by the valor and devotion \n           of your ancestors, that to each generation comes it \n           patriotic duty; and that upon your willingness to \n           sacrifice and endure as those before you have \n           sacrificed and endured rests the national hope.\n     It speaks of equal rights, of the inspiration of free \n           institutions exemplified and vindicated, of liberty \n           under law intelligently conceived and impartially \n           administered. There is not a thread in it but scorns \n           self-indulgence, weakness, and rapacity.\n     It is eloquent of our community interests, outweighting all \n           divergencies of opinion, and of our common destiny.\n\n  Former President Calvin Coolidge, echoed Chief Justice Hughes in \n``Rights and Duties.''\n\n     We do honor to the stars and stripes as the emblem of our \n           country and the symbol of all that our patriotism \n           means.\n     We identify the flag with almost everything we hold dear on \n           earth.\n     It represents our peace and security, our civil and political \n           liberty, our freedom of religious worship, our family, \n           our friends, our home.\n     We see it in the great multitude of blessings, of rights and \n           privileges that make up our country.\n     But when we look at our flag and behold it emblazoned with \n           all our rights, we must remember that it is equally a \n           symbol of our duties.\n     Every glory that we associate with it is the result of duty \n           done. A yearly contemplation of our flag strengthens \n           and purifies the national conscience.\n\n  Given what our flag symbolizes, I find that incomprehensible that \nanyone would desecrate the flag and inexplicable that our Supreme Court \nwould hold that burning a flag is protected speech rather than conduct \nwhich may be prohibited. I find it odd that one can be imprisoned for \ndestroying a bald eagle's egg, but may freely burn our nation's \ngreatest symbol. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to pass S.J. Res. 14 \nso that our flag and all that it symbolizes may be forever protected.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S.J. Res. 14, I \nam proud to rise in support of the proposed constitutional amendment \ngranting Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the \nflag of the United States. Last June, the House of Representatives \npassed an identical resolution by the requisite two-thirds vote margin, \nso I urge that my colleagues in the Senate also pass this resolution \nwith similar bipartisan support and send the proposed amendment to the \nstates for ratification.\n  Our flag occupies a truly unique place in the hearts of millions of \ncitizens as a cherished symbol of freedom and democracy. As a national \nemblem of the world's greatest democracy, the American flag should be \ntreated with respect and care. Our free speech rights do not entitle us \nto simply consider the flag as ``personal property'', which can be \ntreated any way we see fit including physically desecrating it as a \nlegitimate form of political protest.\n  We debate this issue at a very special and important time in our \nnation's history.\n  This year marks the 55th anniversary of the allies' victory in the \nSecond World War. And, fifty-nine years ago, Japanese planes launched \nan attack on Pearl Harbor that would begin American participation in \nthe Second World War.\n  During that conflict, our proud marines climbed to the top of Mount \nSuribachi in one of the most bloody battles of the war. No less than \n6,855 men died to put our American flag on\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\nthe mountain. The sacrifice of the brave American soldiers who gave \ntheir life on behalf of their country can never be forgotten. This \nhonor and dedication to country, duty, freedom and justice is enshrined \nin the symbol of our Nation--the American flag.\n  The flag is not just a visual symbol to us--it is a symbol whose \npattern and colors tell a story that rings true for each and every \nAmerican.\n  The 50 stars and 13 stripes on the flag are a reminder that our \nnation is built on the unity and harmony of 50 states. And the colors \nof our flag were not chosen randomly: red was selected because it \nrepresents courage, bravery, and the willingness of the American people \nto give their life for their country and its principles of freedom and \ndemocracy; white was selected because it represents integrity and \npurity; and blue because it represents vigilance, perseverance, and \njustice.\n  Thus, this flag has become a source of inspiration to every American \nwherever it is displayed.\n  For these reasons and many others, a great majority of Americans \nbelieve--as I strongly do--that the American flag should be treated \nwith dignity, respect and care--and nothing less.\n  Unfortunately, not everyone shares this view.\n  In June of 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that the Flag Protection Act \nof 1989, legislation adopted by the Congress in 1989 generally \nprohibiting physical defilement or desecration of the flag, was \nunconstitutional. This decision, a 5-4 ruling in U.S. v. Eichman, held \nthat burning the flag as a political protest was constitutionally-\nprotected free speech.\n  The Flag Protection Act had originally been adopted by the 101st \nCongress after the Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. Johnson that \nexisting Federal and state laws prohibiting flag-burning were \nunconstitutional because they violated the first amendment's provisions \nregarding free speech.\n  I profoundly disagreed with both rulings the Supreme Court made on \nthis issue. In our modern society, there are still many different \nforums in our mass media, television, newspapers and radio and the \nlike, through which citizens can freely and fully exercise their \nlegitimate, constitutional right to free speech, even if what they have \nto say is overwhelmingly unpopular with a majority of American \ncitizens.\n  Accordingly, in 1995, I also joined as an original cosponsor of a \nproposed constitutional amendment granting Congress the power to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. \nAlthough the House of Representatives easily passed that resolution by \nthe necessary two-thirds vote margin, the Senate fell a mere three \nvotes short.\n  I am hopeful that today's effort will deliver the three additional \nvotes that are needed to send this proposed amendment to the states for \nratification. Of note, prior to the Supreme Court's 1989 Texas v. \nJohnson ruling, 48 states, including my own state of Maine, and the \nFederal government, had anti-flag burning laws on their books for \nyears--so it's time the Congress gave the states the opportunity to \nspeak on this issue directly.\n  Mr. President, whether our flag is flying over a ball park, a \nmilitary base, a school or on a flag pole on Main Street, our national \nstandard has always represented the ideals and values that are the \nfoundation this great nation was built on. And our flag has come not \nonly to represent the glories of our nation's past, but it has also \ncome to stand as a symbol for hope for our nation's future.\n  Let me just state that I am extremely committed to defending and \nprotecting our Constitution--from the first amendment in the Bill of \nRights to the 27th amendment. I do not believe that this amendment \nwould be a departure from first amendment doctrine.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to uphold the great symbol of our \nnationhood by supporting the flag amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 14. \nThis important joint resolution calls for an amendment to the United \nStates Constitution that would allow the United States Congress to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\n  For years now I have been among the strongest supporters in the \nUnited States Senate of amending the United States Constitution to \nallow Congress to prohibit physical desecration of the United States \nflag. I was pleased the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed \na resolution identical to S.J. Res. 14 on June 24, 1999, by a vote of \n305-124, and I look forward to voting for S.J. Res. 14 in the near \nfuture.\n  In 1989, the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision in the \ncase of Texas v. Johnson, stated that the First Amendment prevented a \nstate from protecting the American flag from acts of physical \ndesecration. Since that time, a number of individuals have sought to \nseize on this misguided Supreme Court decision to justify flag burning. \nMr. President, why would any citizen, who wishes to continue enjoying \nthe great privileges of being an American, need a legal right to burn \nour Nation's flag in public?\n  No amount of tortured legal argumentation can overcome common sense \nand the plain meaning of the First Amendment. The first amendment to \nthe Constitution states that no law shall abridge the ``freedom of \nspeech.'' The key word in this portion of the amendment is ``speech.'' \nLaws that do not abridge ``speech'' are not prohibited by this section \nof the amendment. Simply put, burning the United States flag is not \nspeech. A flag is not burned with words. Rather, a flag is burned with \nfire. As such, burning a flag is more appropriately classified as \nconduct, which is not protected by the first amendment.\n  The proposition that our greatness as a nation rests on whether or \nnot an individual is permitted to burn Old Glory simply does not add \nup. At a time in our national history when disparate influences appear \nto be dividing people, the American flag represents unity. During the \nAmerican Revolution, and subsequent conflicts, the flag has unified our \ndiverse nation. Our flag symbolizes the freedoms we enjoy everyday. \nGenerations of Americans have gone forth from our shores to stop \nenemies abroad from taking away these freedoms.\n  In addition, our great nation has always used the flag to honor those \nwho, proudly in the uniform of our military, made great sacrifices. \nThese are startling statistics that tend to be forgotten with the \npassage of time: World War II, 406,000 U.S. service members killed; \nKorea 55,000 U.S. service members killed; Vietnam, 58,100 U.S. service \nmembers killed, and Persian Gulf, 147 U.S. service members killed. For \nall those who gave their life, let us not forget that their caskets \nwere draped in our flag as the final expression of our nation's \nthankfulness.\n  The memory and honor of those who have fought under our flag demands \nthat our flag be protected against reckless conduct presenting itself \nas ``free speech.''\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2890\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be up \nto 2 hours of debate on the Hollings amendment No. 2890, to be equally \ndivided in the usual form between the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, and the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for Senate Joint Resolution 14, the constitutional amendment to \nprotect the flag of the United States. I believe it is vital that we \nenact this amendment without further delay.\n  We have considered this issue in the Judiciary Committee and on the \nSenate Floor many times in the past decade. I have fought to achieve \nprotection for the flag ever since the Supreme Court first legitimized \nflag burning in the case of Texas v. Johnson in 1989.\n  The American flag is much more than a piece of cloth. During moments \nof despair and crisis throughout the history of our great Nation, the \nAmerican people have turned to the flag as a symbol of national unity. \nIt represents our values, ideals, and proud heritage. There is no \nbetter symbol of freedom and democracy in the world than our flag. As \nformer Senator Bob Dole said a few years ago, it is the one symbol that \nbrings to life the Latin phrase that appears in front of me in\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\nthe Senate Chamber, e pluribus unum, which means, ``out of many, one.''\n  Ever since the American Revolution, our soldiers have put their lives \non the line to defend what the flag represents. We have a duty to honor \ntheir sacrifices by giving the flag the protection it once had, and \nclearly deserves today.\n  In our history, the Congress has been very reluctant to amend the \nConstitution, and I agree with this approach. However, the Constitution \nprovides for a method of amendment, and there are a few situations \nwhere an amendment is warranted. This is one of them.\n  The only real argument against this amendment is that it interferes \nwith an absolute interpretation of the free speech clause of the first \namendment. However, restrictions on speech already exist through \nconstitutional interpretation. In fact, before the Supreme Court ruled \non this issue, the Federal government and the States believed that flag \nburning was not constitutionally protected speech. The Federal \ngovernment and almost every state had laws prohibiting desecration that \nwere thought to be valid before the Supreme Court ruled otherwise in \n1989.\n  Passing this amendment would once again give the Congress the \nauthority to protect the flag from physical desecration. It would not \nreduce the Bill of Rights. It would simply overturn a few very recent \njudicial decisions that rejected America's traditional approach to the \nflag under the law.\n  Flag burning is intolerable. We have no obligation to permit this \nnonsense. Have we focused so much on the rights of the individual that \nwe have forgotten the rights of the people?\n  I strongly urge all my colleagues to join with us today and support \nthis amendment. We are on the side of the American people, and I am \nfirmly convinced that we are on the side of what is right. Once and for \nall, we should pass this constitutional amendment and give the flag of \nthe United States of America the protection it deserves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to make remarks generally on the \nflag amendment. Frankly, I think it is a travesty on this \nconstitutional amendment to bring up campaign finance reform as a \nconstitutional amendment to this amendment. But be that as it may, any \nSenator has a right to do that.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote down the Hollings amendment, as it \nshould be voted down. That is a serious debate that has to take place, \nand it should not take place as a constitutional amendment. Having said \nthat, let me comment about why we are here.\n  The Senate began today's session with the Pledge of Allegiance to our \nAmerican flag. Today, we resume debate over a proposal that will test \nwhether the pledge we make--with our hands over our hearts--is one of \nconsequence or just a hollow gesture. We resume debate over S.J. Res. \n14, a constitutional amendment to permit Congress to enact legislation \nprohibiting the desecration of the American flag. Now all we are \nasking, since the Court has twice rejected congressional statutes, is \nto give Congress the power to protect our flag from physical \ndesecration. It seems to me that is not much of a request.\n  It should be a slam dunk. But, unfortunately, politics is being \nplayed with this amendment. Congress would not have to act on it if it \ndidn't want to, but it would have the power to do so. It also involves \nthe separation of powers doctrine.\n  The Supreme Court, in its infinite wisdom, has indicated that flag \nburning, defecating on the flag, or urinating on the flag is a form of \nfree speech.\n  I don't see how anybody in his right mind can conclude that. There is \nno question that is offensive conduct and it ought to be stamped out. \nOn the other hand, all we are doing is giving Congress the power to \nenact legislation that would prohibit physical desecration of the flag. \nCongress doesn't have to, if it doesn't want to; it can, if it wants \nto.\n  When we enacted those prior statutes to protect the flag, they passed \noverwhelmingly. It was also under the guise that we were trying to \nprotect the flag through statutory protection, which I of course \npointed out very unfailingly in both cases was unconstitutional. Of \ncourse, the Supreme Court upheld what I said they would uphold.\n  Symbols are important. The American flag represents, in a way that \nnothing else does, the common bond shared by the people of this nation, \none of the most diverse in the world. It is our one overriding symbol \nof unity. We have no king; we won our independence from him over 200 \nyears ago. We have no state religion. What we do have is the American \nflag.\n  Whatever our differences of party, politics, philosophy, race, \nreligion, ethnic background, economic status, social status, or \ngeographic region, we are united as Americans in peace and in war. That \nunity is symbolized by a unique emblem, the American flag. Its stars \nand stripes and rich colors are the visible embodiment of our Nation \nand its principles and values and ideals.\n  The American flag has come to symbolize hope, opportunity, justice, \nand freedom--not just to the people of this Nation but to people all \nover the world. Failure to protect the flag would lessen the bond among \nus as Americans and weaken the symbolism of our sovereignty as a \nnation.\n  This proposed amendment recognizes and ratifies James Madison's \nview--and the constitutional law that existed for centuries--that the \nAmerican flag is an important and unique incident of our national \nsovereignty. As Americans, we display the flag in order to signify \nnational ownership and protection. The Founding Fathers made clear that \nthe flag reflects the existence and sovereignty of the United States, \nand that desecration of the flag was a matter of national--I repeat--\nnational concern that warranted government action. This same \nsovereignty interest does not exist for our national monuments or our \nother symbols. While they are important to us all, the flag is unique. \nIt is flown over our ships. We carry it into battle. We salute it and \npledge allegiance to it. We do these things because the flag is the \nunique symbol unity and sovereignty.\n  The proposed amendment reads simply: ``The Congress shall have the \npower to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \nStates.'' S.J. Res. 14 is not an amendment to ban flag desecration, but \nan amendment to allow Congress to make the decision on whether to \nprohibit it. It is not self-executing, so a statute defining the terms \nand penalties for the proscribed conduct will need to be enacted, \nshould this amendment be approved by two-thirds of the Senate today, or \nwhenever.\n  While it would be preferable to enact a statute, and not take the \nrare and sober step of amendment the Constitution, our amendment is \nnecessary because the Supreme Court has given us no choice in the \nmatter.\n  I understand there is some lack of knowledge in this body where \npeople have not realized that for 200 years we have protected the flag \nand that 49 States have anti-flag-desecration language. But in two \nnarrow 5-4 decisions, breaking from over 200 years of precedent--Texas \nv. Johnson and United States v. Eichman--the Court overturned prior \nState statutes prohibiting the desecration of the flag.\n  Make no mistake about it: The United States Senate is the forum of \nlast resort to ensure that our flag is protected. H.J. Res. 33--an \nidentical measure--has already won the necessary two-thirds vote in the \nHouse of Representatives by a vote of 305 to 124, with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. In fact, nearly 50 percent of the Democrats in the \nHouse voted for the measure.\n  In addition, the people, expressing themselves through 49 State \nlegislatures, have expressed their readiness to ratify the measure by \ncalling upon Congress to pass this constitutional amendment to protect \nthe flag. Protecting the flag is not a partisan gesture, nor should it \nbe. Especially at a time of election-year partisan rhetoric, this \namendment to protect our flag is an opportunity for all Americans to \ncome together as a country and honor the symbol of what we all are. \nThis effort will not only reaffirm our allegiance to the flag, it will \nreestablish our national unity.\n  The American people revere the flag of the United States as the \nunique symbol of our Nation and the freedom we enjoy as Americans. As \nSupreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said in his dissent in Texas v. \nJohnson:\n\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\n\n       [A] country's flag is a symbol of more than ``nationhood \n     and national unity.'' It also signifies the ideas that \n     characterize the society that has chosen that emblem as well \n     as the special history that has animated the growth and power \n     of those ideas. . . . So it is with the American flag. It is \n     more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, \n     and the gifts of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling \n     colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of \n     equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill \n     for other peoples who share our aspirations.'' [491 U.S. at \n     437 (dissenting)]\n\n  In the long process of bringing this amendment to the floor, we have \ngone more than half way to address the concerns of critics. I think it \nis time for opponents of the amendment to join with us in offering the \nprotection of law to our beloved American flag.\n  Justice John Paul Stevens, in his dissent in the Texas v. Johnson \ndecision, said it best:\n\n       The ideas of liberty and equality have been an irresistible \n     force in motivating leaders like Patrick Henry, Susan B. \n     Anthony, and Abraham Lincoln, schoolteachers like Nathan Hale \n     and Booker T. Washington, the Philippine Scouts who fought at \n     Bataan, and the soldiers who scaled the bluff at Omaha Beach. \n     If those ideas are worth fighting for--and our history \n     demonstrates that they are--it cannot be true that the flag \n     that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of \n     protection from unnecessary desecration. [491 U.S. at 439]\n\n  I want to talk a little bit about the arguments that I have heard \nover the past several years, and again this week, from some of my \ncolleagues who oppose this amendment. Opponents contend that preventing \nthe physical desecration of the flag actually tramples on the sacred \nright of Americans to speak freely. Although I respect many people who \nhave this view, I strongly disagree with it. I hope that, as I have \ncome to understand their perspective, they too will be open to mine \nand, together, we will be able to achieve consensus on the most \nimportant issue of all--protecting and preserving the American flag.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag would not infringe on \nfree speech. If burning the flag were the only means of expressing \ndissatisfaction with the nation's policies, then I imagine that I, too, \nmight oppose this amendment. But we live in a free and open society. \nThose who wish to express their political opinions--including any \nopinion about the flag--may do so in public, private, the media, \nnewspaper editorials, peaceful demonstrations, and through their power \nto vote.\n  Certainly, destroying property might be seen as a clever way of \nexpressing one's dissatisfaction. But such action is conduct, not \nspeech. Law can be, and are, enacted to prevent such actions, in large \npart because there are peaceful alternatives equally expressive. After \nall, right here in the United States Senate, we prohibit speeches or \ndemonstrations of any kind in the public galleries, even the silent \ndisplay of signs or banners. As a society, we can, and do, place \nlimitations on both speech and conduct.\n  Mutilating our Nation's great symbol of national unity is simply not \nnecessary to express an opinion. Those individuals who have a message \nto the country should not confuse their right to speak with a supposed \n``conduct right,'' which allows one to desecrate a symbol that embodies \nthe ideals of a Nation that Americans have given their lives to \nprotect.\n  For this reason, I must reiterate strongly that the flag protection \namendment does not effectively amend the first amendment. It merely \nreverses two erroneous decisions of the Supreme Court and restores to \nthe people the right to choose what law, if any, should protect the \nAmerican flag.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues miss this point and talk about how \nwe cannot amend the Bill of Rights or infringe on free speech, and I \nwas struck by how many of them voted for the flag protection statute in \n1989. Think about that. They cannot have it both ways. How can they \nargue that a statute that bans flag burning does not infringe on free \nspeech, and yet say that an amendment that authorizes Congress to enact \nsuch a statute banning flag burning does infringe on free speech?\n  Moreover, the argument that a statute will suffice is an illusion. We \nhave been down this road before, and it is an absolute dead end, having \nbeen rejected by the Supreme Court less than 30 days after oral \nargument, in a decision of fewer than 8 pages. They will do the same to \nany other statute of general applicability to the flag. A \nconstitutional amendment is necessary because the Supreme Court has \ngiven us no choice in this matter.\n\n  We all understand the game that is being played. We have people who \nchanged their vote at the last minute to prevent the flag amendment \nfrom passing, as they did on the balanced budget amendment. The same \npeople who voted for the statute are claiming their free speech rights \nwould be violated by this amendment, but I guess not by the statute \nthat allows them to ban desecration of the flag--a statute that I think \nthey all know would be automatically held unconstitutional by the \nSupreme Court. It is a game. It is time for people to stand up for this \nflag.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that because the Supreme Court has spoken \nwe can do little to override this newly minted, so-called \n``constitutional right.'' In my view, this concedes far too much to the \njudiciary.\n  No human institution, including the Supreme Court, is infallible. \nSuppose that the year is 1900 and we are debating the passage of an \namendment to override the Plessy versus Ferguson decision. That was the \ndecision in which the Supreme Court rules that separate-but-equal is \nequal, and that the Constitution requires only separate-but-equal \npublic transportation and public education. The Plessy decisions was \nalmost unanimous, 8-1 in contrast to the Johnson and Eichman decisions, \nwhich were 5-4. Would any of my colleagues be arguing that we could not \npass an amendment to provide that no state may deny equal access to the \nsame transportation, public education, and other public benefits \nbecause of race or color simply because the Court had spoken the final \nword? Would any one of my colleagues argue that the Plessy decision had \nto stand because an amendment might change the 14th amendment? Of \ncourse not.\n  The suggestion by some that restoring Congress' power to protect the \nAmerican flag from physical desecration tears at the fabric of our \nliberties is so overblown that it is difficult to take seriously. In \nfact, I think it is phony. These arguments ring particularly hollow \nbecause until 1989, 48 states and the federal government had flag \nprotection laws. Was there a tear in the fabric of our liberties then? \nOf course not.\n  It goes without saying that among the most precious rights we enjoy \nas Americans is the right to govern ourselves. It was to gain this \nright that our ancestors fought and died at Concord and Bunker Hill, \nSaratoga, Trenton, and Yorktown. And it was to preserve that right that \nour fathers, brothers, and sons bravely gave their lives at New \nOrleans, Flanders, the Bulge, and Mt. Suribachi. The Constitution \nexists for no other purpose than to vindicate this right of self-\ngovernment by the people. The Framers of the Constitution did not \nexpect the people to meekly surrender their right to self-government, \nor their judgment on constitutional issues, just because the Supreme \nCourt decides a case a particular way. Nor, when they gave Congress a \nrole in the amendment process, did the Framers expect us to surrender \nour judgment on constitutional issues just because another, equal and \nco-ordinate branch of government, rules a particular way. The amendment \nprocess is the people's check on the Supreme Court. If it were not for \nthe right of the people to amendment the Constitution, set out in \nArticle 5, we would not even have a Bill of Rights in the first place. \nIt was the people through their elected representatives--not the \ncourts--who enshrined the freedom of speech in the Constitution.\n  The Framers did not expect the Constitution to be routinely amended, \nand it has not been. The amendment process is difficult and \nexceptional. But it should not be viewed as an unworthy or unrighteous \nprocess either. The amendment process exists to vindicate the most \nprecious right of the people to determine under what laws they will be \ngoverned. It is there to be used when the overwhelming majority of \nvoters decide that they should make a decision rather than the Supreme \nCourt.\n  In Texas versus Johnson and United States versus Eichman the Supreme \nCourt decided for Americans that a\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\nstatute singling out the flag for special protection is based on the \ncommunicative value of the flag and therefore violates the first \namendment. The Court decided that what 48 states and the federal \ngovernment had prohibited for decades was now wrong. Since the Johnson \nand Eichman decisions, several challenges have been brought against the \nstate statutes prohibiting flag desecration. State courts considering \nthese types of statutes have uniformly held these statutes \nunconstitutional.\n  One recent case, Wisconsin versus Janssen, involved a defendant who \nconfessed to, among other things, defecating on the United States flag. \nRelying on the Supreme Court's Johnson decision, the Wisconsin high \ncourt invalidated a state statute prohibiting flag desecration on the \nground that the statute was overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.\n  In reaching that decision, the court noted that it was \ndeeply offended by Janssen's conduct, and stated that ``[t]o many, \nparticularly those who have fought for our country, it is a slap in the \nface.'' The court further explained that ``[t]hough our disquieted \nemotions will eventually subside, the facts of this case will remain a \nglowing ember of frustration in our hearts and minds. That an \nindividual or individuals might conceivably repeat such conduct in the \nfuture is a fact which we acknowledge only with deep regret.'' What was \nparticularly distressing about this decision is that the court found \nthe statute constitutionally invalid even though the state was trying \nto punish an individual whose vile and senseless act was devoid of any \nsignificant political message, as so many of them are.\n\n  The court noted ``the clear intent of the legislature is to proscribe \nall speech or conduct which is grossly offensive and contemptuous of \nthe United States flag. Therefore, any version of the current statute \nwould violate fundamental principles of first amendment law both in \nexplicit wording and intent.'' Under prevailing Supreme Court \nprecedent, then, the Court found that the proscribed conducted was \nprotected ``speech.'' The Wisconsin decision, like those before it, \ndemonstrates that, because of the narrow Johnson and Eichman decisions \nof the U.S. Supreme Court, any statute, state or federal, that seeks to \nprohibit flag desecration will be struck down.\n  The Wisconsin Supreme Court, however, noted that all was not lost. \nThe Court opined that ``[i]f it is the will of the people in the \ncountry to amend the United States Constitution in order to protect our \nnation's symbol, it must be done through normal political channels,'' \nand noted that the Wisconsin legislature recently adopted a resolution \nurging Congress to amend the Constitution to prohibit flag desecration.\n  Clearly, with the House having already sent us the amendment on a \nstrong, bipartisan vote, the ball is firmly here in the Senate's court. \nIf we are serious about protecting the American flag, it is up to this \nbody, at this time, to take action and to send this proposed amendment \nto the people of the United States.\n  After all the legal talk and hand-wringing on both sides of this \nissue, what is comes down to is this: Will the Senate of the United \nStates confuse liberty with license? Will the Senate of the United \nStates deprive the people of the United States the right to decide \nwhether they wish to protect their beloved national symbol, Old Glory? \nForty-nine state legislatures have called for a flag protection \namendment. By an overwhelming and bipartisan vote, the House of \nRepresentatives has passed the amendment. Now it is up to the Senate to \ndo its job. Let us join together and send this amendment to the people.\n  This resolution should be adopted, and the flag amendment sent to the \nstates for their approval. Our fellow Americans overwhelmingly want to \nsee us take action that really protects the flag and this, my friends, \ncan do just that. I urge you to support the flag protection amendment \nand, by doing so, preserve the integrity and symbolic value of the \nAmerican flag.\n  It is now time for the Senate to heed the will of the people by \nvoting for the flag protection constitutional amendment. Doing so will \nadvance our common morality and the system of ordered liberty \nencompassed in our history, laws and traditions. We must restore the \nConstitution and the first amendment, send the flag amendment to the \nStates that have requested it with near unanimity, and return to the \nAmerican people the right to protect the United States flag. It is time \nto let the people decide.\n  Again, I come back do that major point. All this amendment does is \nrecognize that there are three separated powers in this country--the \nlegislative, executive, and judicial branches of Government. When the \njudicial branch says we can no longer enact by statute the protection \nof the flag and suggests we have to pass a constitutional amendment if \nwe want to protect the flag, then this amendment gives the Congress the \nright to be coequal with the other branches of Government. It gives us \nthe right to protect the flag through a constitutional amendment and it \ngives us the right, if we so choose, to pass legislation similar to the \nlegislation that a vast majority of Members of this body voted for back \nin 1989.\n  Last but not least, in this day and age, many of our young people \ndon't even have a clue to what happened back between 1941 and 1945. \nThey don't even realize what happened in the Second World War.\n  Sending this amendment to the 50 States would create a debate on \nvalues, which is necessary in this country, like we have never had \nbefore. It will be up to the people to decide. That is all we are \nasking. Let the people, through their State legislatures, decide \nwhether or not we should protect the flag. That is not a bad request. \nIt is something that needs to be done. Above all, it restores to the \nCongress the coequal power as a coequal branch of Government that is \ngone because of the very narrow set of 4-5 Supreme Court decisions. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does our side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 1 hour, the \nSenator from South Carolina has 1 hour, and the Senator from Vermont \nhas a half hour.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I control the \ntime on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I will take a very \nshort time. I speak in favor of the flag protection amendment to the \nConstitution. It is an honor for me to be a cosponsor of this \nconstitutional amendment, 1 of 58. Most everything has been said, I \nsuppose, that needs to be said about it. Of course, no one here is in \nfavor of desecration of the flag. What we have is a difference of view \nas to how to deal with that issue.\n  This constitutional amendment has been around for a very long time \nand has been considered several times. Certainly, this symbol of the \nflag is one that should be held in the highest regard. Most everyone \nagrees with that.\n  This measure states:\n\n       The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  That should be the case. It seems to me what that does is helps to \ndefine freedom of speech. We can do that.\n  What we are saying is it is illegal to physically desecrate the flag \nof the United States. I cannot imagine how people can disagree with \nthat. The Senate has voted on this matter in the past in 1989, 1990, \nand 1995, and each time a majority was in favor. The House passed an \nidentical measure in June of 1999 by a vote of 305-124 with a \nsufficient majority. Each year we get a little closer to passing it.\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\n  Why do we need a flag protection amendment? Forty-nine State \nlegislatures have already passed resolutions urging this constitutional \namendment. The flag, obviously, is a sacred symbol and deserves \nprotection from desecration. It is a symbol of national unity and \nidentification. We all know of the sacrifices that have been made, and \nthis flag typifies that; this flag is symbolic of that. It is an \ninspiration for people.\n  The attempts in the past have failed in terms of statutory issues. \nThe Supreme Court struck down the Texas v. Johnson in 1989 in a 5-4 \ndecision. In 1990, there was another 5-4 decision.\n  This is a reasonable request to accommodate and I believe most \nAmericans want to protect this flag. If this is the necessary way to do \nit, then I am for that.\n  I am very pleased to be a cosponsor, and I urge this be passed in the \nSenate. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, time runs \nequally.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand we are on the flag \namendment. That is why I waited for them to complete their hour and I \nbegin mine.\n  Mr. HATCH. My understanding is, it is the Hollings amendment that is \nbeing debated.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is what Senator Hatch says, but that is not what \nthe Chair says.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate currently has under consideration \nthe Hollings amendment No. 2890.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. All this time has been taken off the Hollings \namendment? Come on. We have been talking about the flag. I approached \nthe Chair when we started. Right to the point, the Parliamentarian said \nthey are arguing the flag amendment. Senator Thurmond started, and then \nSenator Hatch talked on the flag amendment. The others have been \ntalking on the flag amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding the Hollings \namendment is an amendment to the flag amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. We can use our time any way we want to on our side. The \namount of time is still remaining for Senator Hollings on his side. As \nI understand it, we are debating the Hollings amendment, but I talked \ngenerally about the flag amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Hollings amendment is an amendment to the \nflag amendment and is under consideration.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 1 hour.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I'm addressing the so-called freedom of \nspeech with respect to campaign financing. I explained yesterday \nafternoon how we, in the 1974 act, tried to clean up the corruption. \nCash was being given, all kinds of favors and demands were being made \non members of the Government, as well as in the private sector. \nNumerous people were convicted. We enacted the 1974 act after the \nMaurice Stans matter in the Nixon campaign.\n  We debated one particular point--that you could not buy the office. \nNow the contention is that you can buy the office because under the \nfirst amendment protecting freedom of speech, and money being speech, \nthere is no way under the Constitution that it can be controlled. Of \ncourse, that is a distortion by the Buckley v. Valeo decision for the \nsimple reason that we finally have Justice Stevens saying that ``money \nis property.'' Justice Kennedy goes right into the distortion. I quote \nfrom the case of Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC:\n\n       The plain fact is that the compromise the Court invented--\n     --\n\n  I emphasize the word ``invented''----\n\n     in Buckley set the stage for a new kind of speech to enter \n     the political system. It is covert speech. The Court has \n     forced a substantial amount of political speech underground, \n     as contributors and candidates devise ever more elaborate \n     methods of avoiding contribution limits, limits which take no \n     account of rising campaign costs. The preferred method has \n     been to conceal the real purpose of the speech.\n  Then further:\n\n       Issue advocacy, like soft money, is unrestricted . . . \n     while straightforward speech in the form of financial \n     contributions paid to a candidate . . . is not. Thus has the \n     Court's decision given us covert speech. This mocks the First \n     Amendment.\n\n  I hope everybody, particularly the other side of the aisle, \nunderstands that I am reading from Justice Kennedy:\n\n       This mocks the First Amendment.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Soft money must be raised to attack the problem of soft \n     money. In effect, the Court immunizes its own erroneous \n     ruling from change.\n\n  We have it foursquare. There is no question that the majority in \nBuckley has mocked the first amendment. Four Justices in Buckley v. \nValeo found that you could control spending. They treated money as it \nhas been treated in the Congress--as property and not speech.\n  Let's look, for example, at the hearing we had. When the Senate is \nasked to consider contributions, they consider them property. So we had \nthe Thompson investigation. Seventy witnesses testified in public over \na total of 33 days; 200 witness interviews were conducted; 196 \ndepositions were conducted under oath; 418 subpoenas were issued for \nhearings, depositions, and documents; and more than 1.5 million pages \nof documents were received.\n  They did not say that Charlie Trie, Johnny Huang and others had free \nspeech. The lawyers in those particular cases would be delighted to \nhear a Congressman who now takes the position that: Oh, it is all free \nspeech. Don't worry about any violations because the first amendment \nprotects this money. The first amendment protects it as free speech. \nThat is out of the whole cloth. They have been singsonging because they \nenjoy this particular corruption.\n  What corruption? As I pointed out yesterday, we used to come in here \nand work. Thirty years ago, under Senator Mansfield, we would come in \nat 9 o'clock Monday morning and we would have a vote. The distinguished \nleader at that time usually had a vote to make sure we got here and \nstarted our week's work--and I emphasize ``week's work.'' We worked \nthroughout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and we were \nlucky to complete our work by Friday evening at 5 o'clock.\n  Now: Monday is gone. Tuesday morning is gone. We don't really work \nhere. We are waiting and not having any votes. People are coming back \ninto town. Nobody is here to listen. On Wednesday and Thursday we have \nto have windows so we can go fundraise. Can you imagine that? That \nought to embarrass somebody. But I have asked for windows, too, because \nthat is the way it is.\n  The money chase--the amount of money that must be chased--has \ncorrupted this Congress. Everybody knows it. The people's business is \nset aside. On Friday, we go back home. What do we do? We have fund-\nraisers. We don't have free-speech raisers, like they are talking about \non the floor of the Senate now.\n  They get all pontifical and stand up and talk oh so eruditely about \nthe Constitution and the first amendment. They know better than anyone \nthat this is property. But as long as they can sell everybody that \nthere are no limits, there are no restrictions on money because it is \nfree speech, then it is ``Katie bar the door'' and we have really gone \ndown the tube.\n  It is not that bad; it is worse. We used to have a break, I think it \nwas on February 12, for Lincoln's birthday. It might have been a long \nweekend, but it was not a 10-day break. Now, January is gone. Then we \nhad a 10-day break in February. We had a 10-day break again in March. \nWe will have another 10-day break in April. We will have another 10-day \nbreak in May and at the beginning of June. Then we will have the Fourth \nof July break. Then we will have the month of August off--all of this \nkeeping us from doing the people's business.\n\n  I thought once our campaigns were over we would come up here and go \nto work on behalf of the people's business. Instead, we work on behalf \nof our own business: reelection. All in the name of this tremendous \nvolume of money, money, money everywhere. They are trying to defend it \non the premise of: Give me the ACLU and the Washington Post. Then they \nput up a sandwich\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\nboard about newspapers: If the Hollings amendment is passed, the \nnewspapers can't write editorials. I never heard of such nonsense.\n  This does not have to do with anybody's freedom of speech. We cannot, \nshould not and would not ever take away anybody's speech. But we can \ntake away the money used in campaigns and limit it just like every \nother country does. In England, they limit the amount of time in which \nyou can actually conduct the campaign. They do not talk about campaigns \nin reference to the Magna Carta: Wait a minute, you have taken away my \nspeech here in the Parliament. There is none of that kind of nonsense. \nBut here, it is the kind of thing we are having to put up with.\n  The question is, Can this problem be solved another way?\n  That is exactly what the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, says: \nWe have a problem. Let's solve it in another way. He puts in a \nstatutory amendment with respect to the flag.\n  With respect to campaign financing, give me a break. We have tried \nfor 25 years--everything from public finance to free TV time, to soft \nmoney, to hard money limitations, to any and every idea.\n  Now we have the Vice President proposing an endowment to finance \nfederal campaigns. They think all you have to do is come up with a new \nidea and then you are really serious about this. If you are going to \nget serious, vote for this amendment. Then, by gosh, we are playing for \nkeeps.\n  There are a lot of people on McCain-Feingold getting a free ride \nvoting for it, knowing it is never going anywhere because the Senator \nfrom Kentucky is manifestly correct, it is patently unconstitutional. \nThere is no question that this Court would find McCain-Feingold \nunconstitutional. Everybody knows that. This is one grand charade, as \nthe corruption continues.\n  I emphasize that this amendment does not take a side with McCain-\nFeingold, with hard money, with soft money, with the Vice President's \nendowment, with anything else or any idea one may have about \ncontrolling spending in Federal elections. It is not pro, it is not \ncon, it is not for, it is not against. It merely gives authority to the \nCongress to do what we intended back in 1974 with the amended version \nof the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971; and that is, to stop \npeople from buying the office.\n  The corruption is such that you have to buy the office. We are \nrequired to buy it. I can tell you, because two years ago I spent more \nof my time raising $5.5 million for my seventh reelection to the Senate \nthan I did campaigning. So I speak advisedly. I have asked for windows. \nI have asked for parts of this corruption that we are all involved in. \nThe only way it is going to be cleaned up is a constitutional \namendment.\n\n  What does Justice Kennedy say? He says: Buckley mocks the first \namendment. Mind you, there was only one Justice who called money \nproperty, but another said it mocked the first amendment. Then I read \nfrom the decision:\n\n       Soft money must be raised to attack the problem of soft \n     money. In effect, the Court immunizes its own erroneous \n     ruling from change.\n\n  Imagine that. The Court has immunized the ruling from change; namely, \nyou cannot change it by statute. Listen Senator Conrad, and any other \nSenator interested in playing games with this corruption, saying we \nwill put in a little statute. There have been 2,000 or 20,000 \namendments to the Constitution. Give me a break. The last five or seven \namendments had to do with elections. None of them is as important as \nthis particular national corruption of Congress. We all know about it. \nWe all participate in it. We have no time to be a Congress. We are just \na dignified bunch of money raisers for each other and for ourselves.\n  It is sad to have to say that on the floor of the Senate, but it is \ntime we give the people a chance. This does not legislate or provide \nanything. It just says, come November, as a joint resolution, let the \npeople decide. I think the people have decided. That is why my \namendment is timely. During this year's presidential primaries everyone \nwas talking about campaign finance reform--reform, reform, reform. \nCandidates were saying, I am the reform candidate.\n  The one thing they are trying to reform is campaign financing, this \ncorruption. Now even the Vice President has come out and said: The \nfirst day I am your President, I will submit McCain-Feingold--knowing \nit is an act in futility. Let's pass McCain-Feingold unanimously. The \nCourt throws it out later this year. It is not going anywhere. The \nCourt has time and again said soft money is speech. That is the \nmajority of this crowd. But I admonish the four Justices in Buckley v. \nValeo who said they could do it. Now we have two other Justices talking \nsense. We know good and well that the people want a chance to talk on \nthis, to vote on this.\n  I had no sooner put this up years ago, back in the 1980s, and the \nStates' Governors came and, by resolution, asked that we amend the \nHollings amendment so as to include the States. So that now the \nHollings amendment reads that Congress is hereby empowered to regulate \nor control spending in Federal elections, and the States are hereby \nallowed to regulate or control spending in State elections.\n  It should be remembered that the last, I think, six out of seven \namendments, took an average of 17 or 18 months. This is very timely for \nthe people to vote on in November, when the issue has already been \ndiscussed and debated throughout the primaries. The people are ready to \nvote on campaign finance reform. And both presidential candidates, Bush \nand Gore, are now trying to position themselves as reformers on \ncampaign finance. We can solve that by having the people vote on the \nissue in and of itself. Within 17 months, on average, we can have the \npeople vote and by this time next year have it confirmed by the \nCongress and this mess will cleaned up. Then we can go back to work for \nthe people of America and cut out this money machine operation that we \ncall a Congress.\n  We not only have to go out during breaks and raise money, we now have \n``power hours.'' We have the ``united fund,'' your fair share \nallocation that you are supposed to raise and contribute to the \ncommittee. It becomes more and more and more. Every time I turn around, \ninstead of trying to get some work done, we have more money demands.\n  So if you want to stop the corruption and stop the charade of calling \ncampaign contributions free speech, this amendment is the solution. We \nare not taking away anybody's speech. We in Congress don't call it \nspeech when we conduct these hearings, year-long hearings with hundreds \nof witnesses and millions of pages of testimony to get the scoundrels. \nFor what? Not for exercising their free speech but for violating \nlimitations on money contributions. We treat money as property when we \nhave these fund raisers. We don't call them free-speech raisers. We \ntreat it as property, except when we try to really stop the corruption.\n\n  I hope we will stop it today and vote affirmatively on the Hollings-\nSpecter amendment so that we can move on and get back to our work.\n  Go up to the majority leader and ask him: Mr. Leader, I would like \nyou to bring up TV violence. He will say: Well, that will take 3 or 4 \ndays. We don't have time.\n  Why don't we have time? We don't work on Monday. We don't work on \nFriday, just the afternoons on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday. We \ncan't even allow amendments.\n  We are going in this afternoon at 3:30 to the Budget Committee, but \nwe have been putting that off again and again. I just checked an hour \nago and it was said: We really don't know whether the vote is fixed. \nThey try to fix the jury, fix the vote so there are no amendments to be \naccepted. The vote is fixed. It is an exercise--if you don't go along \nwith their fix--in futility. Yet Members go around and say: I am a \nMember of the most deliberative body in the United States, most \ndeliberative body in the world. The money chase has corrupted us so \nthat we are fixed in a position where we can't deliberate. We don't \ndeliberate. We have forgotten about that entirely and, in fact, rather \nenjoy it. So long as nobody raises any questions and we all can go back \nhome and continue to raise money, we think we are doing a good job.\n  It is a sad situation. I hope we can address it in an up-front manner \nand support the amendment.\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\n  I retain the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that time under the quorum call \nnot be charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, is the time going to be \ndivided equally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time would ordinarily be divided equally. \nUnder this request, if I understand the request of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, the time will be divided equally. As the time runs, it \nwill be subtracted equally from both sides.\n  There is a deadline of 12:30, which the Senator's unanimous consent \nrequest would violate if time was not charged. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry. Is the time to be charged against \nthis amendment equally referring to the amendment of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator from South Carolina asked \nthat the time not be charged while the Senate is in a quorum call. \nHowever, the Senate is under a previous order of a deadline of 12:30. \nTherefore, the time would have to be charged one way or another. The \ntime expires at 12:30.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection to the request as long as the time is \ndivided equally on his amendment to my constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is my request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time will be divided \nequally between now and 12:30.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the matter of the Hollings \namendment, we----\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, as I understand it there is an \nhour for debate on the underlying constitutional amendment between \n11:30 and 12:30 against which this time will not be charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct--just a second.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncharged equally only against the amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina and that the hour for debate between 11:30 and \n12:30 remain the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we had extensive debate yesterday on \nthe Hollings amendment. Let me repeat some of that for the record \ntoday.\n  The Hollings amendment is at least very straightforward. As I \nunderstand what the Senator from South Carolina is saying, in order to \nenact the various campaign finance schemes that have been promoted \naround the Senate over the last decade or so, you have to, in fact, \namend the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I think he is \ncorrect in that. I happen to think, however, that is a terrible idea.\n  His amendment would essentially eviscerate the first amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution, change it dramatically for the first time in 200 \nyears, to allow the Government--that is us here in the Congress--to \ndetermine who may speak, when they may speak and, conceivably, even \nwhat they may speak. Of course, under this amendment, the press would \nnot be exempt. So everyone who had anything to say about American \npolitical matters in support of or in opposition to a candidate would \nfall under the regulatory rubric of the Congress. The American Civil \nLiberties Union called this a ``recipe for repression.'' It is the kind \nof power the Founding Fathers clearly did not want to reside in elected \nofficials.\n  So this is a step we should not take. The good news is the last time \nwe voted on the Hollings amendment in 1997, it only got 38 votes. I am \nconfident this will not come anywhere near the 67 votes it would need \nto clear the Senate.\n  I am rarely aligned with either Common Cause or the Washington Post \non the campaign finance issue. They oppose the Hollings amendment. \nSenator Feingold, of McCain-Feingold fame, also opposes the Hollings \namendment.\n  This would be a big step in the wrong direction. I am confident the \nSenate will not take that step when the vote occurs sometime early this \nafternoon.\n  Now, some random observations on the subject of campaign finance \nreform. There has been a suggestion that this has become a leading \nissue nationally and will determine the outcome of the Presidential \nelection. I think, first, it is important to kind of look back over the \nlast few months at how this issue has fared with the American people, \nsince it has been discussed so much by the press. There was an ABC-\nWashington Post poll right after the New Hampshire primary among both \nRepublicans and Democrats, weighting the importance of issues. Among \nRepublicans, only 1 percent--this was a national poll--thought campaign \nfinance reform was an important issue and, among Democrats, only 2 \npercent.\n  Earlier this year, in January, another poll--a national poll--asked: \nWhat is the single most important issue to you in deciding whom you \nwill support for President? Campaign finance was down around only 1 \npercent of the people nationally who thought that was an important \nissue in deciding how to vote for President. Further, a more recent \nCNN-Gallup-USA Today poll, in March--essentially after the two \nnominations for President for both parties had been wrapped up, after \nSuper Tuesday--asked: What do you think is the most important problem \nfacing this country today? It was open-ended. American citizens could \npick any issue they wanted to as the most important problem facing this \ncountry today.\n  In this poll of the American public, over 1,000 adults all across \nAmerica, 32 different issues were mentioned. It was an open-ended poll \namong American citizens as to what they thought was the most important \nissue. Not a single person mentioned campaign finance reform in this \nopen-ended survey after Super Tuesday, after this issue had been much \ndiscussed in the course of the nomination fights for both the Democrats \nand the Republicans. Of course, in California, on the very same day as \nthe Super Tuesday vote, there was, in fact, a referendum on the ballot \nin California providing for taxpayer funding of elections and all of \nthe various schemes promoted by the reformers here in the Senate in \nrecent years. It was defeated 2-1.\n\n  So we have substantial evidence among the American people as to what \nthey feel about this issue in terms of its importance in casting votes \nfor the President of the United States or, for that matter, for Members \nof Congress as well.\n  It has been suggested by the reformers on this issue over the years \nthat if we will just pass various forms of campaign finance reform, the \npublic will feel better about us, their skepticism about us will be \nreduced, and their cynicism about politics will subside. A number of \nother countries have passed the kind of legislation that has been \nproposed here over the last 15 or 20 years. Most of those--or all of \nthose countries don't have a first amendment, so they don't have that \nimpeding legislative activity. I think it is interesting to look at \nthese other countries and what the results have been in terms of public \nattitudes about government that have come after they have passed the \nkinds of legislation that has been advocated around here in one form or \nanother over the years.\n  Let's look at some industrialized democracies. Our neighbor to the \nnorth, Canada, has passed many of the types of regulations supported by \nthe reformers in the Senate over the years. They have passed spending \nlimits for all national candidates. All national candidates must abide \nby these to be eligible to receive taxpayer matching funds. The Vice \nPresident just yesterday came out with a taxpayer-funded scheme for \ncongressional elections. I have seen survey data on that. It would be \nmore popular to vote for a congressional pay raise than to vote to \nspend tax money on buttons and balloons and commercials. That is what \nthe Vice President came out for yesterday. We look forward to debating, \nin the course\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\nof the fall election, how the American people feel about having their \ntax dollars go to pay for political campaigns.\n  Nevertheless, other countries have done that. I was talking about \nCanada. Candidates can spend $2 per voter for the first 15,000 votes \nthey get, a dollar per voter for all votes up to 25,000, and 50 cents \nper voter beyond 25,000. They have spending limits on parties that \nrestrict parties to spending the product of a multiple used to account \nfor the cost of living. This is an incredibly complex scheme they have \nin Canada-- a product of a multiple used to account for cost of living \ntimes the number of registered voters in each electoral district in \nwhich that party has a candidate running for office.\n\n  It almost makes you laugh just talking about this.\n  Right now, in Canada, it comes out to about $1 per voter. They have \nindirect funding via media subsidies. The Canadian Government requires \nthat radio and TV networks provide all parties with a specified amount \nof free air time during the month prior to an election. The Government \nalso provides subsidies to defray the cost of political publishing and \ngives tax credits to individuals and corporations which donate to \ncandidates and/or parties. It sounds similar to the Gore proposal of \nyesterday.\n  They have this draconian scheme up in Canada in which nobody gets to \nspeak beyond the Government's specified amount. The Government's \nsubsidies are put into both campaigns and parties and media subsidies.\n  What has been the reaction of the Canadian people in terms of their \nconfidence expressed toward their Government?\n  The most recent political science studies of Canada demonstrate that \ndespite all of this regulation of political speech by candidates and \nparties, the number of Canadians who believe that ``the Government \ndoesn't care what people like me think'' has grown from roughly 45 \npercent to approximately 67 percent.\n  The Canadians put in this system presumably to improve the attitude \nof Canadians about their Government, and it has declined dramatically \nsince the imposition of this kind of control over political speech. \nConfidence in the national legislature in Canada declined from 49 \npercent to 21 percent, and the number of Canadians satisfied with the \nsystem of government has declined from 51 percent to 34 percent.\n  Here we have in our neighbor to the north, Canada, an example of a \ncountry responding to concerns about cynicism about politics in \ngovernment put in all of these speech controls, and the people in \nCanada have dramatically less confidence in the Government now than \nthey did before all of this was enacted.\n  Let's take a look at Japan.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, ``Japanese election \ncampaigns, including campaign financing, are governed by a set of \ncomprehensive laws that are the most restrictive among democratic \nnations.''\n  After forming a seven-party coalition government in August, 1993 \nPrime Minister Hosokawa--this sounds like the Vice President--placed \ncampaign finance reform at the top of his agenda, just as Vice \nPresident Gore did yesterday. He asserted that his reforms would \nrestore democracy in Japan. In November 1994, his legislation passed. \nAfter this legislation, the Japanese Government imposed the following \nrestrictions on political speech. Listen to this. This is the law in \nJapan:\n  Candidates are forbidden from donating to their own campaigns.\n  Any corporation that is a party to a Government contract, grant, \nloan, or subsidy is prohibited from making or receiving any political \ncontributions for 1 year after they receive such a contract, grant, \nloan, or subsidy.\n  In addition, there are strict limits on what corporations and unions \nand individuals may give to candidates and parties.\n  There are limits on how much candidates may spend on their campaigns.\n  Candidates are prohibited from buying any advertisements.\n  Listen to this: Candidates are prohibited from buying any \nadvertisements in magazines and newspapers beyond the five print media \nads of a specified length that the Government purchases for each \ncandidate.\n  Parties are allotted a specific number of Government-purchased ads of \na specified length.\n  The number of ads a party gets is based on the number of candidates \nthey have running.\n  It is illegal for these party ads to discuss individual candidates in \nJapan. It is illegal.\n  In Japan, candidates and parties spend nothing on media advertising \nbecause not only are they prohibited from purchasing print media ads, \nthey are also prohibited from buying time on television and radio.\n  Talk about speech controls--in Japan, candidates can't buy any time \non television and radio.\n  The Government requires TV stations to permit parties and each \ncandidate a set number of television and radio ads during the 12 days \nprior to the election. Each candidate gets to make one Government-\nsubsidized television broadcast.\n  The Government's Election Management Committee--that is a nice \ntitle--provides each candidate with a set number of sideboards and \nposters that subscribe to a standard Government-mandated format.\n  The Election Management Committee also designates the places and \ntimes that candidates may give speeches.\n  In Japan, the Government designates the times and places candidates \nmay give speeches.\n  This is the most extraordinary control over political discussion \nimaginable. All of this campaign finance reform in Japan was enacted \nearlier in the 1990s.\n  What makes it even more laughable is, after all of this happened, all \nof these regulations on political speech that amount to a reformers \nwish list were imposed, you have to ask the question: Did cynicism \ndecline? Did trust in government increase? ``Not so should be noted,'' \nas we say down in Kentucky. Following the disposition of these \nregulations, the number of Japanese who said they had ``no confidence \nin legislators''--the Japanese passed campaign finance reform that \nCommon Cause could only drool over. They did it in Japan. And after \nthey did it, following the imposition of these regulations, the number \nof Japanese who said they had ``no confidence in legislators'' rose to \n70 percent.\n  Following the enactment of this draconian control of political \ndiscourse that I just outlined, in Japan only 12 percent of Japanese \nbelieve the Government is responsive to the people's opinions and \nwishes.\n  After the enactment of all of this control over political discussion \nin Japan, the percentage of Japanese ``satisfied'' with the nation's \npolitical system fell to a mere 5 percent and voter turnout continued \nto decline.\n  Let's take a look at France.\n  In France, there is significant regulation of political activity:\n  Government funding of candidates;\n  Government funding of parties;\n  Free radio and television time, reimbursement for printing posters \nand for campaign-related transportation;\n  They banned contributions to candidates by any entity except parties \nand PACs;\n  Individual contributors to parties are limited;\n  Strict expenditure limits are set for each electoral district;\n  And every single candidate's finances are audited by a national \ncommission to ensure compliance with the rules.\n  Despite these regulations, the latest political science studies in \nFrance demonstrate that the French people's confidence in their \nGovernment and political institutions has continued to decline, and \nvoter turnout has continued to decline.\n  Let's take a look at Sweden.\n  Sweden has imposed the following regulations on political speech:\n  In Sweden, there is no fundraising--none at all--or spending for \nindividual candidates. Citizens merely vote for parties and assign \nseats on proportion of votes they receive.\n  The Government subsidizes print ads by parties.\n  Despite the fact that Sweden has no fundraising or spending for \nindividual candidates since these requirements have been in force, the \nnumber of Swedes disagreeing with the statement that ``parties are only \ninterested in people's votes, not in their opinions'' has declined from \n51 percent to 28 percent.\n  The number of people expressing confidence in the Swedish Parliament \nhas declined from 51 percent to 19 percent.\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\n  So we could follow the rest of the world and trash the first \namendment and enact all of these draconian controls over political \ndiscussion, and there is no evidence anywhere in the world that \nproduces greater faith in government or greater confidence in the \nprocess. In fact, there is every bit of evidence that it declines \ndramatically after the enactment of these kinds of reforms.\n  I am confident we will not start repealing the first amendment today \nthrough the passage of the Hollings amendment. Only 38 Senators voted \nfor this in 1997 when it was last before us, and I am certain there \nwon't be many more than that today.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains in opposition to the Hollings \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Three minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Wisconsin is here to speak in \nopposition to the Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent if I could speak \nfor 15 minutes in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since there are 3 minutes more in opposition to the \nHollings amendment, I am happy to give the Senator from Wisconsin my 3 \nminutes and hope he might be accommodated for a few more minutes to \ncomplete his statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to give the Senator 3 minutes, and I ask the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina if he would give some time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We have no time. I have the Senator from Pennsylvania \ncoming. I want to be accommodating but time is limited.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Obviously, both sides have the same amount of time. I \nask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 15 minutes, if \nnecessary adding on to the time. Obviously, if the opponents were to \nfeel the same, I have no opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised we have a deadline of \n12:30. Therefore, the Senator's unanimous consent request would \nnecessarily have to come out of Senator Hollings' time, after the 3 \nminutes have been used from the opposition.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the debate on the \nJudiciary Committee amendment to the Constitution be moved to 11:45 to \naccommodate the distinguished Senator, with the time divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I certainly thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the proposed constitutional \namendment offered by the junior Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nHollings.\n  First I would like to say a few words about the Senator from South \nCarolina. Our colleague Senator Hollings has been calling for \nmeaningful campaign finance reform for perhaps longer than any other \nMember of the U.S. Senate. I disagree with this particular approach. \nBut I certainly do not question his sincerity or commitment to reform.\n  Back in 1993, my first year in the Senate, Senator Hollings offered a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment to take up a constitutional amendment \nvery similar to the one that is before us today. I remember we had a \nvery short period of time before that vote came up, and I decided to \nvote with the Senator from South Carolina on that day. I did so because \nI believed that other than balancing the Federal budget, there was \nperhaps no more fundamental issue facing our country than the need to \nreform our election laws.\n  Such a serious topic I believed at the time merited at least a \nconsideration of a constitutional amendment. And I will certainly \nconfess to a certain level of frustration at that time with the fact \nthat the Senate and other body had not yet acted to pass meaningful \ncampaign finance reform in that Congress.\n  To be candid, I immediately realized, even as I was walking back to \nmy office from this Chamber, that I had made a mistake. I started \nrethinking right away whether I really wanted the U.S. Senate to \nconsider amending the first amendment, even to address the extremely \nimportant subject of campaign finance reform.\n  Then, 18 months later, my perspective on this question began to \nchange even more as I was presented with two new development here in \nthe Senate.\n  First I was given the privilege of serving on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and, second, I learned that the 104th Congress, newly under \nthe control of what remains the majority party, was to become the \nengine for a trainload of proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \nAs a member of the Judiciary Committee, I had a very good seat to \nwitness first hand the surgery that some wanted to perform on the basic \ngoverning document of our country, the Constitution.\n  It started with a proposal right away for a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. Soon we were considering a term limits \nconstitutional amendment, and then a flag desecration constitutional \namendment, then a school prayer amendment, then a super majority tax \nincrease amendment, and then a victims rights amendment. In all over \n100 constitutional amendments were introduced in the 104th Congress. A \nsimilar number were introduced in the last Congress as well. And in \nthis Congress already we have seen over 60 constitutional amendments \nintroduced.\n  As I saw legislator after legislator suggest that every sort of \nsocial, economic, and political problem we have in this country could \nbe solved merely with enactment of a constitutional amendment, I chose \nto oppose strongly not only this constitutional amendment but others \nthat also sought to undermine our most treasured founding principle. I \nfirmly believe we must curb this reflexive practice of attempting to \ncure each and every political and social ill of our Nation by tampering \nwith the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution of this country was not a \nrough draft. We must stop treating it as such.\n  We must also understand that even if we were to adopt this \nconstitutional amendment, and the states were to ratify it, which we \nall know is not going to happen, it will not take us one single, \nsolitary step closer to campaign finance reform. It is not a silver \nbullet. This constitutional amendment empowers the Congress to set \nmandatory spending limits on congressional candidates. Those are the \nkind of mandatory limits that were struck down in the landmark Buckley \nv. Valeo decision.\n  Here is the question I pose for supporters of this amendment: If this \nconstitutional amendment were to pass the Congress and be ratified by \nthe States, would campaign finance reformers have the necessary 51 \nvotes--or more likely the necessary 60 votes--to pass legislation that \nincludes mandatory spending limits? I don't think so.\n  We do not even have 60 votes to pass a ban on soft money at this \npoint. And we probably don't even have a bare majority of the Senate \nwho support spending limits, much less mandatory spending limits.\n  I have been working for many years with the senior Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, on a bipartisan campaign finance proposal. \nWhile our proposal has changed over the years, we have consistently \nbeen guided by a desire to work within the guidelines established by \nthe Supreme Court. Although our opponents disagree, we are confident \nthat the McCain-Feingold bill is constitutional and will be upheld by \nthe courts.\n  I am mystified by the comments of the Senator from South Carolina who \nstated pointblank: Everyone knows the McCain-Feingold bill is \nunconstitutional. In fact, the recent Missouri Shrink case said by a 6-\n3 margin such limitations on contributions are constitutional. It was a \nsupermajority of the Supreme Court. It is not credible, I believe, for \nanyone to argue at this point that a ban on soft money is \nunconstitutional.\n  Our original proposal, unlike the law that was considered in Buckley \nv. Valeo, included voluntary spending limits. We offered incentives in \nthe form of free and discounted television time to encourage but not \nrequire candidates to limit their campaign spending. That kind of \nreform is patterned on the Presidential public funding system that was \nspecifically upheld in Buckley.\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\n  Later versions of our bill have focused on abolishing soft money, the \nunlimited contributions from corporations, unions, and wealthy \nindividuals to political parties. Very few constitutional scholars, \nother than a current nominee to the FEC, Brad Smith, believe that the \nConstitution prevents us from banning soft money. As I indicated, the \nMissouri Shrink case makes that clear.\n  The key point is this: We don't need to amend the Constitution to do \nwhat needs to be done. Of course, when we bring a campaign finance bill \nto the floor we are met with strong resistance. In fact, so far we have \nbeen stopped by a filibuster. The notion that this constitutional \namendment will somehow magically pave the way for legislation that \nincludes mandatory spending limits simply ignores the reality of the \nopposition that campaign finance reformers face in the Senate, and I \nthink we face in the Senate even after a ratification of the Hollings \namendment.\n  This amendment, if ratified, would remove the obstacle of the Supreme \nCourt from mandatory spending limit legislation, but it will not remove \nthe obstacle of those Senators such as the Senator from Kentucky, who \nbelieve we need more money, not less, in our political system.\n  Most disconcerting to me is what this proposed constitutional \namendment would mean to the first amendment. I find nothing more sacred \nand treasured in our Nation's history than the first amendment. It is \nperhaps the one tenet of our Constitution that sets our country apart \nfrom every type of government formed and tested by mankind throughout \nhistory. No other country has a provision quite like our first \namendment.\n  The first amendment is the bedrock of the Bill of Rights. It has as \nits underpinning the notion that every citizen has a fundamental right \nto disagree with his or her government. It says that a newspaper has an \nunfettered right to publish expressions of political or moral thought. \nIt says that the Government may not establish a State-based religion \nthat would infringe on the rights of those individuals who seek to be \nfreed from such a religious environment.\n\n  I have stood on the floor of the Senate to oppose the proposed \nconstitutional amendment that would allow Congress to prohibit the \ndesecration of the U.S. flag, and I do so again this week. I do so \nbecause that amendment, for the first time in our history, would take a \nchisel to the first amendment. It would say that individuals have a \nconstitutional right to express themselves--unless they are expressing \nthemselves by burning a flag.\n  Just as I deplore as much as anyone in this body any individual who \nwould take a match to the flag of the United States, I am firmly \nconvinced that unrestrained spending on congressional campaigns has \neroded the confidence of the American people in their government and \ntheir leaders. I believe we should speak out against those who \ndesecrate the flag. I believe we should take immediate steps to \nfundamentally overhaul our system of financing campaigns. But I do not \nbelieve, as the supporters of this constitutional amendment and other \namendments believe, that we need to amend the U.S. Constitution to \naccomplish our goals.\n  Nothing in this constitutional amendment before the Senate today \nwould prevent what we witnessed in the last election. Allegations of \nillegality and improprieties, accusations of abuse, and the selling of \naccess to high-ranking Government officials would continue no matter \nwhat the outcome of the vote on this constitutional amendment. Only the \nenactment of legislation that bans soft money contributions will make a \nmeaningful difference.\n  I see Members of the Senate as having three choices. First, they can \nvote for constitutional amendments and one-sided reform proposals that \nbasically have predetermined fates of never becoming law. That allows \nyou to say you voted for something and put the matter aside. Second, \nthey can stand with the Senator from Kentucky and others who tell us \n``all is well'' with our campaign finance system and we should not be \ndisturbed that so much money is pouring into the campaign coffers of \ncandidates and parties.\n  A third option is that Senators can join with the Senator from \nArizona and myself and others who have tried to approach this problem \nfrom a bipartisan perspective and have tried to craft a reform proposal \nthat is fair to all, and constitutional.\n  Without meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform, the American \npeople will continue to perceive their elected leaders as being for \nsale. They will continue to distrust and doubt the integrity of their \nown Government. And they will have good reason for that distrust and \ndoubt. This system of legalized bribery threatens the very foundations \nof our democracy.\n  Senator McCain and I intend to make sure that the Senate will have \nanother opportunity to address this issue. We have had many debates on \ncampaign finance reform, and we will have many more until we pass it. I \nunderstand and share the frustration of those who support reform and \nare tired of seeing our efforts fail. I want to finish this job too. \nBut the way to address the campaign finance problem is to pass \nconstitutional legislation, not a constitutional amendment. We must \nredouble our efforts to break the deadlock and give the people real \nreform this year, not 7 or more years from now.\n  I urge the Members of the Senate to reject this amendment. It is not \nnecessary to tinker with the first amendment in order to accomplish \ncampaign finance reform. I greatly admire the sincerity and commitment \nof the Senator from South Carolina, but I do not think his amendment \nwill bring us any closer to passing campaign finance reform.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah, again, for his courtesy in allowing me \nto address this issue. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWisconsin. I only hasten to add that this particular amendment has \nnothing to do with favoring or opposing the McCain-Feingold amendment. \nI have voted for that at least four or five times already.\n  Read the Nixon v. Shrink decision when they say money is speech, and \nin the Colorado v. FEC decision when they allowed soft money. One can \ntell a majority of the Court has no idea. Money talks; money is \nspeech--that is the way the Court is going. I reiterate, McCain-\nFeingold is an act in futility.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Jonathan \nBingham, ``Democracy or Plutocracy? The Case for a Constitutional \nAmendment to Overturn Buckley v. Valeo'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Annals of the American Academy, Jul., 1986]\n\n  Democracy or Plutocracy? The Case for a Constitutional Amendment to \n                       Overturn Buckley v. Valeo\n\n                         (By Jonathan Bingham)\n\n       Abstract: In the early 1970s the U.S. Congress made a \n     serious effort to stop the abuses of campaign financing by \n     setting limits on contributions and also on campaign \n     spending. In the 1976 case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme \n     Court upheld the regulation of contributions, but invalidated \n     the regulation of campaign spending as a violation of the \n     First Amendment. Since then, lavish campaigns, with their \n     attendant evils, have become an ever more serious problem. \n     Multimillion-dollar campaigns for the Senate, and even for \n     the House of Representatives, have become commonplace. \n     Various statutory solutions to the problem have been \n     proposed, but these will not be adequate unless the \n     Congress--and the states--are permitted to stop the \n     escalation by setting limits. What is needed is a \n     constitutional amendment to reverse the Buckley holding, as \n     proposed by several members of Congress. This would not mean \n     a weakening of the Bill of Rights, since the Buckley ruling \n     was a distortion of the First Amendment. Within reasonable \n     financial limits there is ample opportunity for that \n     ``uninhibited, robust and wide-open'' debate of the issues \n     that the Supreme Court correctly wants to protect.\n       The First Amendment is not a vehicle for turning this \n     country into a plutocracy,'' says Joseph L. Rauh, the \n     distinguished civil rights lawyer, deploring the ruling in \n     Buckley v. Valeo.\\1\\ It is the thesis of this article that \n     the Supreme Court in Buckley was wrong in nullifying certain \n     congressional efforts to limit campaign spending and that the \n     decision must not be allowed to stand. While statutory \n     remedies may mitigate the evil of excessive money in politics \n     and are worth pursuing, they will not stop the feverish \n     escalation of campaign spending. They\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\n     will also have no effect whatever on the spreading phenomenon \n     of very wealthy people's spending millions of dollars of \n     their own money to get elected to Congress and to state \n     office.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       When the Supreme Court held a national income tax \n     unconstitutional, the Sixteenth Amendment reversed that \n     decision. Buckley should be treated the same way.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 was the first \n     comprehensive effort by the U.S. Congress to regulate the \n     financing of federal election campaigns. In 1974, following \n     the scandals of the Watergate era, the Congress greatly \n     strengthened the 1971 act. As amended, the new law combined \n     far-reaching requirements for disclosure with restrictions on \n     the amount of contributions, expenditures from a candidate's \n     personal funds, total campaign expenditures, and independent \n     expenditures on behalf of identified candidates.\n       The report of the House Administration Committee \n     recommending the 1974 legislation to the House explained the \n     underlying philosophy:\n       ``The unchecked rise in campaign expenditures, coupled with \n     the absence of limitations on contributions and expenditures, \n     has increased the dependence of candidates on special \n     interest groups and large contributors. Under the present law \n     the impression persists that a candidate can buy an election \n     by simply spending large sums in a campaign.\n       ``Such a system is not only unfair to candidates in \n     general, but even more so to the electorate. The electorate \n     is entitled to base its judgment on a straightforward \n     presentation of a candidate's qualifications for public \n     office and his programs for the Nation rather than on a \n     sophisticated advertising program which is encouraged by the \n     infusion of vast amounts of money.\n       ``The Committee on House Administration is of the opinion \n     that there is a definite need for effective and comprehensive \n     legislation in this area to restore and strengthen public \n     confidence in the integrity of the political process.'' \\2\\\n       The 1974 act included a provision, added pursuant to an \n     amendment offered by then Senator James Buckley, for \n     expedited review of the law's constitutionality. In January \n     1976 the Supreme Court invalidated those portions that \n     imposed limits on campaign spending as violative of the First \n     Amendment's guarantee of free speech.\n       In his powerful dissent, Justice White said, ``Without \n     limits on total expenditures, campaign costs will inevitably \n     and endlessly escalate.'' \\3\\ His prediction was promptly \n     borne out. Multimillion-dollar campaigns for the Senate have \n     become the rule, with the 1984 Helms-Hunt race in North \n     Carolina setting astonishing new records. It is no longer \n     unusual for expenditures in contested House campaigns to go \n     over the million-dollar mark; in 1982 one House candidate \n     reportedly spent over $2 million of his own funds.\n       In 1982 a number of representatives came to the conclusion \n     that the Buckley ruling should not be allowed to stand and \n     that a constitutional amendment was imperative. In June \n     Congressman Henry Reuss of Wisconsin introduced a resolution \n     calling for an amendment to give Congress the authority to \n     regulate campaign spending in federal elections. In December, \n     with the cosponsorship of Mr. Reuss and 11 others,\\4\\ I \n     introduced a broader resolution authorizing the states, as \n     well as the Congress, to impose limits on campaign \n     spending. The text of the proposed amendment was:\n       Section 1. The Congress may enact laws regulating the \n     amounts of contributions and expenditures intended to affect \n     elections to federal office.\n       Section 2. The several states may enact laws regulating the \n     amounts of contributions and expenditures intended to affect \n     elections to state and local offices.\\5\\\n       In the Ninety-eighth Congress, the same resolution was \n     reintroduced by Mr. Vento and Mr. Donnelly and by Mr. Brown, \n     Democrat of California, and Mr. Rinaldo, Republican of New \n     Jersey. A similar resolution was introduced in the Senate by \n     Senator Stevens, Republican of Alaska. As of the present \n     writing, the resolution has been reintroduced in the Ninety-\n     ninth Congress by Mr. Vento.\\6\\\n       No hearings have been held on these proposals, and they \n     have attracted little attention. Even organizations and \n     commentators deeply concerned with the problem of money in \n     politics and runaway campaign spending have focused \n     exclusively on statutory remedies. Common Cause, in spite of \n     my pleading, has declined to add a proposal for a \n     constitutional amendment to its agenda for campaign reform or \n     even to hear arguments in support of the proposal. A \n     constituency for the idea has yet to be developed.\n\n\n                       the nature of the problem\n\n       This article proceeds on the assumption that escalating \n     campaign costs pose a serious threat to the quality of \n     government in this country. There are those who argue the \n     contrary, but their view of the nature of the problem is \n     narrow. They focus on the facts that the amounts of money \n     involved are not large relative to the gross national product \n     and that the number of votes on Capitol Hill that can be \n     shown to have been affected by campaign contributions is not \n     overwhelming.\n       The curse of money in politics, however, is by no means \n     limited to the influencing of votes. There are at least two \n     other problems that are, if anything, even more serious. One \n     is the eroding of the present nonsystem on the public's \n     confidence in our form of democracy. If public office and \n     votes on issues are perceived to be for sale, the harm is \n     done, whether or not the facts justify that conclusion. In \n     Buckley the Supreme Court itself, in sustaining the \n     limitations on the size of political contributions, stressed \n     the importance of avoiding ``the appearance of improper \n     influence'' as `` `critical . . . if confidence in the system \n     of representative government is not to be eroded to a \n     disastrous extent.' '' \\7\\ What the Supreme Court failed to \n     recognize was that `` \\6\\ confidence in the system of the \n     representative government' '' could likewise be `` `eroded to \n     a disastrous extent' '' by the spectacle of lavish spending, \n     whether the source of the funds is the candidate's own wealth \n     or the result of high-pressure fund-raising from contributors \n     with an ax to grind.\n       The other problem is that excellent people are discouraged \n     from running for office, or, once in, are unwilling to \n     continue wrestling with the unpleasant and degrading task of \n     raising huge sums of money year after year. There is no doubt \n     that every two years valuable members of Congress decide to \n     retire because they are fed up with having constantly to beg. \n     For example, former Congressmen Charles Vanik of Ohio and \n     Richard Ottinger of New York, both outstanding legislators, \n     were clearly influenced by such considerations when they \n     decided to retire, Vanik in 1980 and Ottinger in 1984. Vanik \n     said, among other things, ``I feel every contribution carries \n     some sort of lien which is an encumbrance on the legislative \n     process. . . . I'm terribly upset by the huge amounts that \n     candidates have to raise.'' \\8\\ Probably an even greater \n     number of men and women who would make stellar legislators \n     are discouraged from competing because they cannot face the \n     prospect of constant fundraising or because they see a \n     wealthy person, who can pay for a lavish campaign, already in \n     the race.\n       In ``Politics and Money,'' Elizabeth Drew has well \n     described the poisonous effect of escalating campaign costs \n     on our political system:\n       ``Until the problem of money is dealt with, it is \n     unrealistic to expect the political process to improve in any \n     other respect. It is not relevant whether every candidate who \n     spends more than this opponent wins--though in races that are \n     otherwise close, this tends to be the case. What matters is \n     what the chasing of money does to the candidates, and to the \n     victors' subsequent behavior. The candidates' desperation for \n     money and the interests' desire to affect public policy \n     provide a mutual opportunity. The issue is not how much is \n     spent on elections but the way the money is obtained. The \n     point is what raising money, not simply spending it, does to \n     the political process. It is not just that the legislative \n     product is bent or stymied. It is not just that well-armed \n     interests have a head start over the rest of the citizenry--\n     or that often it is not even a contest. . . . It is not even \n     relevant which interest happens to be winning. What is \n     relevant is what the whole thing is doing to the democratic \n     process. What is at stake is the idea of representative \n     government, the soul of this country.'' \\9\\\n       Focusing on the different phenomenon of wealthy candidates' \n     being able to finance their own, often successful, campaigns, \n     the late columnist Joseph Kraft commented that ``affinity \n     between personal riches and public office challenges a \n     fundamental principle of American life.'' \\10\\\n\n\n                   shortcoming of statutory proposals\n\n       In spite of the wide agreement on the seriousness of the \n     problems, there is no agreement on the solution. Many \n     different proposals have been made by legislators, \n     academicians, commentators, and public interest \n     organizations, notably Common Cause.\n       One of the most frequently discussed is to follow for \n     congressional elections the pattern adopted for presidential \n     campaigns: a system of public funding, coupled with limits on \n     spending.\\11\\ Starting in 1955, bills along these lines have \n     been introduced on Capitol Hill, but none has been adopted. \n     Understandably, such proposals are not popular with \n     incumbents, most of whom believe that challengers would gain \n     more from public financing than they would.\n       Even assuming that the political obstacles could be \n     overcome and that some sort of public financing for \n     congressional candidates might be adopted, this financing \n     would suffer from serious weaknesses. No system of public \n     financing could solve the problem of the very wealthy \n     candidate. Since such candidates do not need public funding, \n     they would not subject themselves to the spending limits. The \n     same difficulty would arise when aggressive candidates, \n     believing they could raise more from private sources, \n     rejected the government funds. This result is to be expected \n     if the level of public funding is set too low, that is, at a \n     level that the constant escalation of campaign costs is in \n     the process of outrunning. According to Congressman Bruce \n     Vento, an author of the proposed constitutional amendment to \n     overturn Buckley, this has tended to happen in Minnesota, \n     where very low levels of public funding are provided to \n     candidates for state office.\n       To ameliorate these difficulties, some proponents of public \n     financing suggest that the spending limits that a candidate \n     who takes government funding must accept should be waived for \n     that candidate to the extent an opponent reports expenses in \n     excess of those\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\n     limits. Unfortunately, in such a case one of the main \n     purposes of public funding would be frustrated and the \n     escalation of campaign spending would continue. The candidate \n     who is not wealthy is left with the fearsome task of quickly \n     having to raise additional hundreds of thousands, or even \n     millions, of dollars.\n       Another suggested approach would be to require television \n     stations, as a condition of their licenses, to provide free \n     air time to congressional candidates in segments of not less \n     than, for instance, five minutes. A candidate's acceptance of \n     such time would commit the candidate to the acceptance of \n     spending limits. While such a scheme would be impractical for \n     primary contests--which in many areas are the crucial ones--\n     the idea is attractive for general election campaigns in \n     mixed urban-rural states and districts. It would be \n     unworkable, however, in the big metropolitan areas, where the \n     main stations reach into scores of congressional districts \n     and, in some cases, into several states. Not only would \n     broadcasters resist the idea, but the television-viewing \n     public would be furious at being virtually compelled during \n     pre-election weeks to watch a series of talking-head shows \n     featuring all the area's campaigning senators and \n     representatives and their challengers. The offer of such \n     unpopular television time would hardly tempt serious \n     candidates to accept limits on their spending.\n       Proponents of free television time, recognizing the limited \n     usefulness of the idea in metropolitan areas, have suggested \n     that candidates could be provided with free mailings instead. \n     While mailings can be pinpointed and are an essential part of \n     urban campaigning, they account for only a fraction of \n     campaign costs, even where television is not widely used; \n     accordingly, the prospect of free mailings would not be \n     likely to win the acceptance of unwelcome campaign limits on \n     total expenses.\\12\\\n       Yet another method of persuading candidates to accept \n     spending limits would be to allow 100 percent tax credits for \n     contributions of up to, say, $100 made to authorized \n     campaigns, that is, those campaigns where the candidate has \n     agreed to abide by certain regulations, including limits on \n     total spending.\\13\\ It is difficult to predict how effective \n     such a system would be, and a pilot project to find out would \n     not be feasible, since the tax laws cannot be changed for \n     just one area. For candidates who raise most of their funds \n     from contributors in the $50-to-$100 range, the incentive to \n     accept spending limits would be strong, but for those--and \n     they are many--who rely principally on contributors in the \n     $500-to-$1000 range, the incentive would be much weaker. This \n     problem could be partially solved by allowing tax credits for \n     contributions of up to $100 and tax deductions for \n     contributions in excess of $100 up to the permitted limit. \n     Such proposals, of course, amount to a form of public \n     financing and hence would encounter formidable political \n     obstacles, especially at a time when budgetary restraint and \n     tax simplification are considered of top priority.\n       Some of the most vocal critics of the present anarchy in \n     campaign financing focus their wrath and legislative efforts \n     on the political action committees (PACs) spawned in great \n     numbers under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. \n     Although many PACs are truly serving the public interest, \n     others have made it easier for special interests, especially \n     professional and trade associations, to funnel funds into the \n     campaign treasuries of legislators or challengers who will \n     predictably vote for those interests. Restrictions, such as \n     limiting the total amount legislative candidates could accept \n     from PACs, would be salutary \\14\\ but no legislation aimed \n     primarily at the PAC phenomenon--not even legislation to \n     eliminate PACs altogether--would solve the problem so well \n     summarized by Elizabeth Drew. The special interests and \n     favor-seeking individual givers would find other ways of \n     funneling their dollars into politically useful channels, and \n     the harassed members of Congress would have to continue to \n     demean themselves by constant begging.\n       PAC regulation and all the other forms of statutory \n     regulation suffer from one fundamental weakness: none of them \n     would affect the multimillion-dollar self-financed campaign. \n     Yet it is this type of campaign that does more than any other \n     to confirm the widely held view that high office in the \n     United States can be bought.\n       Short of a constitutional amendment, there is only one kind \n     of proposal, so far as I know, that would curb the super-rich \n     candidate, as well as setting limits for others. Lloyd N. \n     Cutler, counsel to the president in the Carter White House, \n     has suggested that the political parties undertake the task \n     of campaign finance regulation.\\15\\ Theoretically, the \n     parties could withhold endorsement from candidates who refuse \n     to abide by the party-prescribed limits and other \n     regulations. But the chances of this happening seem just \n     about nil. Conceivably a national party convention might \n     establish such regulations for its presidential primaries, \n     but to date most contenders have accepted the limits imposed \n     under the matching system of public funding; John Connally of \n     Texas was the exception in 1980. For congressional races, \n     however, it is not at all clear what body or bodies could \n     make such rules and enforce them. Claimants to such authority \n     would include the national conventions, national committees, \n     congressional party caucuses, various state committees, and, \n     in some cases, country committees. Perhaps our national \n     parties should be more hierarchically structured, but the \n     fact is that they are not.\n       On top of all this, the system would work for general \n     election campaigns only if both major parties took parallel \n     action. If by some miracle they did so, the end result might \n     be to encourage third-party and independent candidacies.\n       Let me make clear that I am not opposed to any of the \n     proposals briefly summarized earlier. To the extent I had the \n     opportunity to vote for any of the statutory proposals during \n     my years in the House, I did so. Nor am I arguing that a \n     constitutional amendment by itself would solve the problem; \n     it would only be the beginning of a very difficult task. What \n     I am saying is that, short of effective action by the \n     parties, any system to reverse the present lethal trends in \n     campaign financing must have as a basic element the \n     restoration to the Congress of the authority to regulate the \n     process.\n\n\n                    the merits of the buckley ruling\n\n       The justices of the Supreme Court were all over the lot in \n     the Buckley case, with numerous dissents from the majority \n     opinion. The most significant dissent, in my view, was \n     entered by Justice White, who, alone among the justices, had \n     had extensive experience in federal campaigns. White's \n     position was that the Congress, and not the Court, was the \n     proper body to decide whether the slight interference with \n     First Amendment freedoms in the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     was warranted. Justice White reasoned as follows:\n       ``The judgment of Congress was that reasonably effective \n     campaigns could be conducted within the limits established by \n     the Act. . . . In this posture of the case, there is no sound \n     basis for invalidating the expenditure limitations, so long \n     as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently \n     substantial, which in my view they are . . .\n       ``. . . expenditure ceilings reinforce the contribution \n     limits and help eradicate the hazard of corruption. . . .\n       ``Besides backing up the contribution provisions, . . . \n     expenditure limits have their own potential for preventing \n     the corruption of federal elections themselves.\\16\\ ''\n       Justice White further concluded that\n       ``limiting the total that can be spent will ease the \n     candidate's understandable obsession with fundraising, and so \n     free him and his staff to communicate in more places and ways \n     unconnected with the fundraising function.\n       ``It is also important to restore and maintain public \n     confidence in federal elections. It is critical to obviate \n     and dispel the impression that federal elections are purely \n     and simply a function of money, that federal offices are \n     bought and sold or that political races are reserved for \n     those who have the facility--and the stomach--for doing \n     whatever it takes to bring together those interests, groups, \n     and individuals that can raise or contribute large fortunes \n     in order to prevail at the polls.\\17\\ ''\n       Two of the judges of the District of Columbia Circuit \n     Court, which upheld the 1974 act--judges widely respected, \n     especially for their human rights concerns--later wrote law \n     journal articles criticizing in stinging terms the Supreme \n     Court's holding that the spending limits were invalid. For \n     example, the late Judge Harold Leventhal said in the Columbia \n     Law Review: ``The central question is what is the interest \n     underlying regulation of campaign expenses and is it \n     substantial? The critical interest, in my view, is the same \n     as that accepted by the [Supreme] Court in upholding limits \n     on contributions. It is the need to maintain confidence in \n     self-government, and to prevent the erosion of democracy \n     which comes from a popular view of government as responsive \n     only or mainly to special interests.\\18\\\n       ``A court that is concerned with public alienation and \n     distrust of the political process cannot fairly deny to the \n     people the power to tell the legislators to implement this \n     one-word principle: Enough! \\19\\ ''\n       Here are excerpts from what Judge J. Skelly Wright had to \n     say in the Yale Law Journal:\n       ``The Court told us, in effect, that money is speech.\n       ``. . . [This view] accepts without question elaborate mass \n     media campaigns that have made political communication \n     expensive, but at the same time remote, disembodied, \n     occasionally . . . manipulative. Nothing in the First \n     Amendment . . . commits us to the dogma that money is \n     speech.\\20\\\n       ``. . . far from stifling First Amendment values, [the 1974 \n     act] actually promotes them. . . . In place of unlimited \n     spending, the law encourages all to emphasize less expensive \n     face-to-face communications efforts, exactly the kind of \n     activities that promote real dialogue on the merits and leave \n     much less room for manipulation and avoidance of the \n     issues.\\21\\ ''\n       The Supreme Court was apparently blind to these \n     considerations. Its treatment was almost entirely \n     doctrinaire. In holding unconstitutional the limits set by \n     Congress on total expenditures for congressional campaigns \n     and on spending by individual candidates, the Court did \n     not claim that the dollar limits set were unreasonably \n     low. In the view taken by the Court, such limits were \n     beyond the power of the Congress to set, no matter how \n     high.\n       Only in the case of the $1000 limit set for spending by \n     independent individuals or groups ``relative to a clearly \n     identified candidate'' did the Court focus on the level set \n     in the law. The Court said that such a limit ``would appear \n     to exclude all citizens and\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\n     groups except candidates, political parties and the \n     institutional press from any significant use of the most \n     effective modes of communication.'' \\22\\ In a footnote, the \n     Court noted:\n       ``The record indicates that, as of January 1, 1975, one \n     full-page advertisement in a daily edition of a certain \n     metropolitan newspaper cost $6,971.04--almost seven times the \n     annual limit on expenditures ``relative to'' a particular \n     candidate imposed on the vast majority of individual citizens \n     and associations.'' \\23\\\n       The Court devoted far more space to arguing the \n     unconstitutionality of this provision than to any of the \n     other limits, presumably because of this point it had the \n     strongest case. Judge Leventhal, too, thought the $1000 \n     figure for independent spending was unduly restrictive and \n     might properly have been struck down. As one who supported \n     the 1974 act while in the House, I believe, with the benefit \n     of hindsight, that the imposition of this low limit on \n     independent expenditures was a grave mistake.\n       Let us look for a moment at the question of whether \n     reasonable limits on total spending in campaigns and on \n     spending by wealthy candidates really do interfere with the \n     ``unfettered interchange of ideas,'' ``the free discussion of \n     governmental affairs,'' and the ``uninhibited, robust and \n     wide-open'' debate on public issues that the Supreme Court \n     has rightly said the First Amendment is designed to \n     protect.\\24\\ In Buckley the Supreme Court has answered that \n     question in the affirmative when the limits are imposed by \n     law under Congress' conceded power to regulate federal \n     elections. The Court answered the same question negatively, \n     however, when the limits were imposed as a condition of \n     public financing. In narrow legalistic terms the distinction \n     is perhaps justified, but, in terms of what is desirable or \n     undesirable under our form of government, I submit that the \n     setting of such limits is either desirable or it is not.\n       Various of the solutions proposed to deal with the \n     campaign-financing problem, statutory and nonstatutory, raise \n     the same question--for example, the proposal to allow tax \n     credits only for contributions to candidates who have \n     accepted spending limits, and the proposal that political \n     parties should impose limits. All such proposals assume that \n     it is good public policy to have such limits in place. They \n     simply seek to avoid the inhibition of the Buckley case by \n     arranging for some carrot-type motivation for the observance \n     of limits, instead of the stick-type motivation of compliance \n     with a law.\n       I am not, of course, suggesting that those who make these \n     proposals are wrong to do so. What I am suggesting is that \n     they should support the idea of undoing the damage done by \n     Buckley by way of a constitutional amendment.\n       Summing up the reason for such an amendment, Congressman \n     Henry Reuss said, ``Freedom of speech is a precious thing. \n     But protecting it does not permit someone to shout `fire' in \n     a crowded theater. Equally, freedom of speech must not be \n     stressed so as to compel democracy to commit suicide by \n     allowing money to govern elections.\\25\\\n\n\n           independent expenditures in presidential campaigns\n\n       Until now the system of public financing for presidential \n     campaigns, coupled with limits on private financing, has \n     worked reasonably well. Accordingly, most of the proposals \n     mentioned previously for the amelioration of the campaign-\n     financing problem have been concerned with campaigns for the \n     Senate and the House.\n       In 1980 and 1984, however, a veritable explosion occurred \n     in the spending for the presidential candidates by allegedly \n     independent cmmittees--spending that is said not to be \n     authorized by, or coordinated with, the campaign committees. \n     In both years, the Republican candidates benefited far more \n     from this type of spending than the Democratic: In 1980, the \n     respective amounts were $12.2 million and $45,000; in 1984, \n     $15.3 million and $621,000.\\26\\\n       This spending violated section 9012(f) of the Presidential \n     Campaign Fund Act, which prohibited independent committees \n     from spending more than $1000 to further a presidential \n     candidate's election if that candidate had elected to take \n     public financing under the terms of the act. In 1983 various \n     Democratic Party entities and the Federal Election \n     Commission, with Common Cause as a supporting amicus curiac, \n     sued to have section 9012(f) declared constitutional, so as \n     to lay the groundwork for enforcement of the act. These \n     efforts failed. Applying the Buckley precedent, the three-\n     judge district court that first heard the case denied the \n     relief sought, and this ruling was affirmed in a 7-to-2 \n     decision by the Supreme Court in FEC v. NCPAC in March \n     1985.\\27\\\n       The NCPAC decision clearly strengthens the case for a \n     constitutional amendment to permit Congress to regulate \n     campaign spending. For none of the statutory or party-action \n     remedies summarized earlier would touch this new eruption of \n     the money-in-politics volcano.\n       True, even with a constitutional amendment in place, it \n     would still be possible for the National Conservative \n     Political Action Committee or other committees to spend \n     unlimited amounts for media programs on one side of an issue \n     or another, and these would undoubtedly have some impact on \n     presidential--and other--campaigns. However, the straight-out \n     campaigning for an individual or a ticket, which tends to be \n     far more effective than focusing on issues alone, could be \n     brought within reasonable limits.\n\n\n                             looking ahead\n\n       The obstacles in the way of achieving a reversal of Buckley \n     by constitutional amendment are, of course, formidable. This \n     is especially true today when the House Judiciary Committee \n     is resolutely sitting on other amendments affecting the Bill \n     of Rights and is not disposed to report out any such \n     amendments.\n       In addition to the practical political hurdles to be \n     overcome, there are drafting problems to solve. The simple \n     form so far proposed \\28\\--and quoted previously--needs \n     refinement.\n       For example, if an amendment were adopted simply giving to \n     the Congress and the states the authority to ``enact laws \n     regulating the amount of contributions and expenditures \n     intended to affect elections,\\29\\ the First Amendment \n     question would not necessarily be answered. The argument \n     could still be made, and not without reason, that such \n     regulatory laws, like other powers of the Congress and the \n     states, must not offend the First Amendment. I asked an \n     expert in constitutional law how this problem might be dealt \n     with, and he said the only sure way would be to add the words \n     ``notwithstanding the First Amendment.'' But such an addition \n     is not a viable solution. The political obstacles in the way \n     of an amendment overturning Buckley in its interpretation of \n     the First Amendment with respect to campaign spending are \n     grievous enough; to ask the Congress--and the state \n     legislatures--to create a major exception to the First \n     Amendment would assure defeat.\n       The answer has to be to find a form of wording that says, \n     in effect, that the First Amendment can properly be \n     interpreted so as to permit reasonable regulation of campaign \n     spending. In my view, it would be sufficient to insert in the \n     proposed amendment,\\30\\ after ``The Congress,'' the words \n     ``having due regard for the need to facilitate full and free \n     discussion and debate.'' Section 1 of the amendment would \n     then read, ``The Congress, having due regard for the need to \n     facilitate full and free discussion and debate, may enact \n     laws regulating the amounts of contributions and expenditures \n     intended to affect elections to federal office.'' Other ways \n     of dealing with this problem could no doubt be devised.\n       Another drafting difficulty arises from the modification in \n     the proposed amendment of the words ``contributions and \n     expenditures'' by ``intended to affect elections.'' This \n     language is appropriate with respect to money raised or spent \n     by candidates and their committees, but it does present a \n     problem in its application to money raised and spent by \n     allegedly independent committees, groups, or individuals. It \n     could hardly be argued that communications referring solely \n     to issues, with no mention of candidates, could, consistent \n     with the First Amendment, be made subject to spending limits, \n     even if they were quite obviously ``intended to affect'' an \n     election. Accordingly, a proper amendment should include \n     language limiting the regulation of ``independent'' \n     expenditures to those relative to ``clearly identified'' \n     candidates, language that would parallel the provisions of \n     the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended.\\31\\\n       These are essentially technical problems that could be \n     solved with the assistance of experts in constitutional law \n     if the Judiciary Committee of either house should decide to \n     hold hearings on the idea of a constitutional amendment and \n     proceed to draft and report out an appropriate resolution.\n       Many of those in and out of Congress who are genuinely \n     concerned with political money brush aside the notion of a \n     constitutional amendment and focus entirely on remedies that \n     seem less drastic. They appear to assume that Congress is \n     more likely to adopt a statutory remedy, such as public \n     financing, than go for an enabling constitutional amendment \n     that could be tagged as tampering with the Bill of Rights. I \n     disagree with that assumption.\n       Incumbents generally resist proposals such as public \n     financing because challengers might be the major \n     beneficiaries, but most incumbents tend to favor the idea of \n     spending limits. The Congress is not by its nature averse to \n     being given greater authority; that would be especially true \n     in this case, where until 1976 the Congress always thought it \n     had such authority. I venture to say that if a carefully \n     drawn constitutional amendment were reported out of one of \n     the Judiciary Committees, it might secure the necessary two-\n     thirds majorities in both houses, with surprising ease.\n       The various state legislatures might well react in similar \n     fashion. A power they thought they had would be restored to \n     them.\n       The big difficulty is to get the process started, whether \n     it be for a constitutional amendment or a statutory remedy or \n     both. Here, the villain, I am afraid, is public apathy. \n     Unfortunately, the voters seem to take excessive campaign \n     spending as a given--a phenomenon they can do nothing about--\n     and there is no substantial consistency for reform. The House \n     Administration Committee, which in the early 1970s was the \n     spark plug for legislation, has recently shown little \n     interest in pressing for any of the legislative proposals \n     that have been put forward.\n       The 1974 act itself emerged as a reaction to the scandals \n     of the Watergate era, and it may well be that major action, \n     whether statutory or constitutional, will not be a practical \n     possibility until a new set of scandals bursts into the open. \n     Meanwhile, the situation will only get worse.\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Personal communication with Joseph L.

Sec. 431(17).\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that article was 10 years after Buckley \nv. Valeo. I am constantly reminded by the opposition that I only got 38 \nvotes in 1997 for my amendment. There is a pleasure, an enjoyment to \nthis wonderful corruption. There is not any question we used to have a \nbetter conscience. This article shows how even the Senator from Alaska, \nMr. Stevens, and others cosponsored it. I had a dozen Republican \ncosponsors.\n  Now the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, and the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, have it down to a Republican article of faith: We \nhave the money and they, the Democrats, have the unions, and so we are \nnot going to limit the money.\n  Governor George W. Bush has already raised $74 million and spent all \nbut $8 million of it. He spent $64 million by March. The very idea of \nbuying the office is a disgrace. It is a disgrace. As Senator Long of \nLouisiana said when we passed the Federal Election Campaign Act of \n1971, we want to make sure everyone can participate.\n  Buckley v. Valeo has stood the first amendment on its head. It has \ntaken it away. That is what the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, and others do not understand.\n  The Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, amended the first amendment to take \naway the speech of the ordinary American in important Federal \nelections. There is no question when one has to raise 5.5 million bucks \nin a little State like South Carolina--I looked around for somebody \nelse to run last time. We could not get them to run for Congress \nbecause it cost too much. We could not even get a candidate on our side \nin the First District, in the Third District, and all around. It has \ngotten to where people say: Look, this thing costs too much; I don't \nhave the time, I don't have the money.\n  That is a part of the corruption.\n  Look at the considerations of Justice White 25 years ago, and I read \nfrom his opinion. I remind everybody that four of the Justices found \nmoney as property and not speech; it could be controlled. It was only \nby a 1-vote margin that we are into this 25-year dilemma, like a dog \nchasing its tail around and around and the corruption growing and \ngrowing.\n  I quote from Justice White:\n\n       It is accepted that Congress has power under the \n     Constitution to regulate the election of Federal officers, \n     including the President and Vice President. This includes the \n     authority to protect the elective processes against the two \n     great natural and historical enemies of all republics--open \n     violence and insidious corruption.\n\n  Then talking about the insidious corruption:\n\n       Pursuant to this undoubted power of Congress to vindicate \n     the strong public interest in controlling corruption and \n     other undesirable uses of money in connection with election \n     campaigns, the Federal Election Campaign Act substantially \n     broadened the reporting and disclosure requirements that so \n     long have been a part of the Federal law. Congress also \n     concluded that limitations on contributions and expenditures \n     were essential if the aims of the act were to be achieved \n     fully.\n\n  Buckley v. Valeo limited contributions. It took away freedom of \nspeech under the premise here--what a terrible thing. I have the quotes \nfrom the distinguished Senator from Kentucky that ``we eviscerate the \nfirst amendment with this Hollings-Specter amendment that limits who \nmay speak, when they may speak, what they may speak''--by the way, this \napplies to the press--``what they may report, when they may report and \nwho may report.''\n  Actually, there is no question that the decision in Buckley amended \nthe first amendment. What we are trying to do is complete a uniformity \nwhere everybody is treated equally, the speech of the contributor as \nwell as the speech of the candidate.\n  Going on, I quote from Justice White:\n\n       The congressional judgment which was ours to accept was \n     that other steps must be taken to counter the corrosive \n     effects of money in Federal election campaigns.\n\n  This is 25 years ago:\n\n       One of these steps is 608(e), which aside from those funds \n     that are given to the candidate or spent at his request or \n     with his approval or cooperation, limits what a contributor \n     may independently spend in support or denigration of one \n     running for Federal office.\n\n  That is the soft money about which we are talking. Moving on, I \nquote:\n\n       Congress was plainly of the view that these expenditures \n     also have the potential for corruption. But the Court claimed \n     more insight as to what may improperly influence candidates \n     than is possessed by the majority of Congress that passed \n     this bill, and the President who signed it. Those supporting \n     the bill undeniably include many seasoned professionals who \n     have been deeply involved in elective processes and have \n     viewed them at close range over many years.\n\n  Then he goes on:\n\n       I have little doubt, in addition, that limiting the total \n     that can be spent will ease the candidate's understandable \n     obsession with fundraising and so free him and his staff to \n     communicate in more places and ways unconnected with the \n     fundraising function.\n\n  Actually talking about freedom of speech, you have time to talk to \nconstituents. I remember after the last campaign, I went around the \nState, county to county, and they said: Fritz, why in the world are you \ncoming around? You just won. I said: Yeah, but I really didn't get to \ntalk to the voters. I had to talk to contributors. I didn't have time \nfor the voters other than during the scheduled debates. I would like to \nmeet the voters and talk to them in a more intimate way. That is quoted \nin the press.\n  This is 25 years ago, foreseeing the corruption.\n  I quote from Justice White:\n\n       There is nothing objectionable, indeed, it seems to me a \n     weighty interest in favor of the provision in the attempt to \n     insulate the political expression of Federal candidates from \n     the influence inevitably exerted by the endless job of \n     raising increasingly large sums of money. I regret that the \n     Court has returned them all to the treadmill.\n       It is also important to restore and maintain public \n     confidence in Federal elections. It is critical to obviate or \n     dispel the impression that Federal elections are purely and \n     simply a function of money, that Federal officers are bought \n     and sold, or that political races are reserved for those who \n     have the facility and the stomach for doing whatever it takes \n     to bring together those interest groups and individuals who \n     can raise or contribute large fortunes in order to prevail at \n     the polls.\n\n  I could go on and on. There is no question that we had a very erudite \nobservation here by Justice White, very visionary. Everybody says: You \nhave to have somebody who has vision. That is a visionary statement in \nBuckley v.\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\nValeo. Even though it was in a dissenting opinion, it foretold what we \nwere going to run into.\n  Once the campaign was over, I thought we would come up here and work \nfor the people of the United States, not for ourselves. We could give \nall the time to our treadmill here, as Justice White says, but we raise \nthe money, raise the money, raise the money, raise the money. It goes \non and on and it takes away from our actual function as the most \ndeliberative body.\n  Yes, we got only 38 votes the last time. The conscience is \ndiminishing. We got a majority vote back in the 1980s back when we had \na conscience.\n  We also once had a conscience on the budget. Now we hold the totally \nfalse premise that a deficit is a surplus. I do not have today's data, \nbut I have the day before yesterday's. We have The Public Debt To the \nPenny. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Public Debt to the Penny\n               [Current 03/24/2000--$5,730,876,091,058.27]\nCurrent month:                                            Amount\n    03/23/2000.................................    $5,729,458,665,582.66\n    03/22/2000.................................     5,727,734,275,348.06\n    03/21/2000.................................     5,728,846,067,846.82\n    03/20/2000.................................     5,728,253,942,273.38\n    03/17/2000.................................     5,728,671,330,064.36\n    03/16/2000.................................     5,724,694,663,639.63\n    03/15/2000.................................     5,747,793,381,625.76\n    03/14/2000.................................     5,748,566,517,856.04\n    03/13/2000.................................     5,745,831,852,208.71\n    03/10/2000.................................     5,745,712,662,449.10\n    03/09/2000.................................     5,744,560,824,206.30\n    03/08/2000.................................     5,745,125,070,490.06\n    03/07/2000.................................     5,747,932,431,376.73\n    03/06/2000.................................     5,745,099,557,759.64\n    03/03/2000.................................     5,742,858,530,572.10\n    03/02/2000.................................     5,732,418,769,036.22\n    03/01/2000.................................     5,725,649,856,797.45\nPrior months:\n    02/29/2000.................................     5,735,333,348,132.58\n    01/31/2000.................................     5,711,285,168,951.46\n    12/31/1999.................................     5,776,091,314,225.33\n    11/30/1999.................................     5,693,600,157,029.08\n    10/29/1999.................................     5,679,726,662,904.06\nPrior fiscal years:\n    09/30/1999.................................     5,656,270,901,615.43\n    09/30/1998.................................     5,526,193,008,897.62\n    09/30/1997.................................     5,413,146,011,397.34\n    09/30/1996.................................     5,224,810,939,135.73\n    09/29/1995.................................     4,973,982,900,709.39\n    09/30/1994.................................     4,692,749,910,013.32\n    09/30/1993.................................     4,411,488,883,139.38\n    09/30/1992.................................     4,064,620,655,521.66\n    09/30/1991.................................     3,665,303,351,697.03\n    09/28/1990.................................     3,233,313,451,777.25\n    09/29/1989.................................     2,857,430,960,187.32\n    09/30/1988.................................     2,602,337,712,041.16\n    09/30/1987.................................     2,350,276,890,953.00\n \nNote.--Looking for more historic information?

When you \ncan't get votes--it is amazing I get any kind of votes because the \noverwhelming majority calls this deficit a surplus. You can find out \nthat on 9-30-99, the debt was $5.656 trillion. It has now grown to \n$5.730 trillion.\n  I just got back from London. I had lunch there with Parliament, and I \nasked the Presiding Officer: Do you all have a deficit or a surplus? He \nsaid: Oh, we have a surplus. We have a balanced budget. I said: How do \nyou measure it? He said: By the amount of money you have to borrow.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer is an eminent certified public \naccountant. He knows how to keep the books. He would not go along with \nthe kinds of books we keep here, showing that we're borrowing money and \ncalling it a surplus. It's a deficit. It is an increase in the debt.\n  In addition, the interest expense on the public debt outstanding is \n$158,799,000,000. That is what we have spent just on interest costs \nsince the beginning of the fiscal year. That is the real waste. We had \na conscience under President Reagan; now it's waste, fraud, and abuse. \nI served on the Grace Commission. Surely, we could get votes in those \ndays because we had a conscience.\n  We don't have a conscience anymore. Thirty-eight votes; I am lucky to \nget 18. I don't mind. Somehow, somewhere, some time, this has to be \nexposed. It is one grand corruption of the Congress itself. We know it. \nEverybody else knows it. The public showed that they know it, too, \nduring the primaries.\n  If we do not get a hold of ourselves and do something about it in \nthis particular session, we are gone goslings. That is all I have to \nsay.\n  It is a tragic thing when you have to stand up here and defend the \nright of the people to vote on controlling spending in elections. They \nhave it at city hall with the constable. They have it in the State \ncapitals with the Governor. Now we have it with the national Congress. \nEverybody wants to try to control spending.\n  We go along with this farce of free speech and that we are amending \nthe Constitution, really, the first amendment. In reality we are \namending the Constitution to give the first amendment its freedom of \nspeech. The first amendment gave that freedom of speech, but once money \nis attached to the speech, you take it away from those who do not have \nmoney. That is exactly what has occurred.\n  Buckley v. Valeo has amended the first amendment. They are all so \nexcited and alarmed about it and laugh as they go back into the \nCloakroom because they know exactly what we are talking about on the \nfloor. Nobody is here. It is a Tuesday morning and nobody has to vote \nuntil 2:15. We will have a caucus and we will go in and talk about how \nwe have been doing on fundraising. Then when we get through talking \nabout doing the fundraising, we will go ahead and vote this down, \naccording to the Senator from Kentucky. But there will come another \nday. I am glad for the 6-year term. We have a little time left. I have \nbeen at it some 20 years now. We will continue. It takes a little time. \nBut what Justice White stated back in Buckley v. Valeo has come to \npass. It has brought us to where the most deliberative body can't \ndeliberate.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum. Does the other side have any time? Both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Well, I think we will allocate the time to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is a right way and a wrong way of \nreforming our system of campaign finance. The Hollings proposal to \namend our Constitution is simply the wrong way. It would, in effect, \namend the first amendment to our Constitution to allow any \n``reasonable'' restrictions to be placed on independent campaign \nexpenditures and contributions. Why does he propose that we amend the \nfirst amendment? Because the Supreme Court of the United States has \nheld that restrictions on independent expenditures violate the first \namendment's free speech protection and that such restrictions could \nonly be justified upon a showing of a compelling--as opposed to any \nreasonable--reason.\n  The Hollings amendment would gut the free speech protections of the \nfirst amendment. It would allow the curtailing of independent campaign \nexpenditures that could overcome the natural advantage that incumbents \nhave. It would, thus, limit free speech and virtually guarantee that \nincumbents be reelected. Thus, the Hollings amendment could change the \nvery nature of our constitutional democratic form of government by \nestablishing what the Founders of the Republic feared most: a permanent \nelite or ruling oligarchy. Let me explain.\n  The very purpose of the first amendment's free speech clause is to \nensure that the people's elected officials effectively and genuinely \nrepresent the public. For elections to be a real check on government, \nfree speech must be guaranteed--both to educate the public about the \nissues, and to allow differing view points to compete in what Oliver \nWendell Holmes called ``the market place of ideas.''\n  Simply put, without free speech, government cannot be predicated \nupon, what Thomas Jefferson termed, ``the consent of the governed.'' \nWithout free speech, there can be no government based on consent \nbecause consent can never be informed.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States recognized this fundamental \nprinciple of democracy in the 1976 case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 \n(1976). The Court in Buckley recognized that free speech is meaningless \nunless it is\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\neffective. In the words of Justice White, ``money talks.'' Unless you \ncan get your ideas into the public domain, all the homilies and \nhosannas to freedom of speech are just plain talk. Thus, the Supreme \nCourt held that campaign contributions and expenditures are speech--or \nintrinsically related to speech--and that the regulating of such funds \nmust be restrained by the prohibitions of the first amendment.\n  The Buckley Court made a distinction between campaign contributions \nand campaign expenditures. The Court found that free speech interests \nin campaign contributions are marginal at best because they convey only \na generalized expression of support. But independent expenditures are \nanother matter. These are given higher first amendment protection \nbecause they are direct expressions of speech. The Court reaffirmed the \nprinciples it outlined in Buckley just a few months ago in Nixon v. \nShrink Missouri Gov't.\n  Consequently, because contributions are tangential to free speech, \nCongress has a sizeable latitude to regulate them in order to prevent \nfraud and corruption. But not so with independent expenditures. In the \nwords of the Court:\n\n       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by \n     restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of \n     their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This \n     is because virtually every means of communicating in today's \n     mass society requires the expenditure of money. [424 U.S. at \n     19-20].\n\n  The Hollings amendment's allowance of restrictions on expenditures by \nCongress and state legislatures would impose direct and substantial \nrestraints on the quantity of political speech. It would permit placing \ndrastic limitations on both individuals and groups from spending money \nto disseminate their own ideas as to which candidate should be \nsupported and what cause is just. The Supreme Court noted that such \nrestrictions on expenditures, even if ``neutral as to the ideas \nexpressed, limit political expression at the core of our electoral \nprocess and of the First Amendment freedoms.'' [Buckley at 39].\n  Indeed, even candidates under the Hollings proposal could be \nrestricted in engaging in protected first amendment expression. Justice \nBrandeis observed, in Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375 (1927), \nthat in our republic, ``public discussion is a political duty,'' and \nthat duty will be circumscribed where a candidate is prevented from \nspending his or her own money to spread the electoral message. That a \ncandidate has a first amendment right to engage in public issues and \nadvocate particular positions was considered by the Buckley Court to be \nof:\n\n       . . . particular importance . . . candidates [must] have \n     the unfettered opportunity to make their views known so that \n     the electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates' \n     personal qualities and their positions on vital public issues \n     before choosing among them on election day. 424 U.S. at 53.\n\n  Campaign finance reform should not be at the expense of free speech. \nThis amendment--in trying to reduce the costs of political campaigns--\ncould cost us so much more: our heritage of political liberty. Without \nfree speech our Republic would become a tyranny. Even the liberal \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union opposes Hollings-type approaches to \ncampaign reform and called such approaches a ``recipe for repression.''\n  The simple truth is that there are just too many on the other side of \nthe aisle that believe that the first amendment is inconsistent with \ncampaign finance reform. That is why they are pushing the Hollings \nproposal. To quote House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, ``[w]hat we \nhave is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech and \nour desire for a healthy campaign in a healthy democracy. You can't \nhave both.''\n  I strongly disagree. You can have both. We have to have both. For \nwithout both, the very idea of representative democracy is imperiled. \nThat is why I oppose the Hollings amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Hollings controls the time until 11:45 \na.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, does the Senator from Vermont have 30 \nminutes under a previous order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 22 and a half \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my understanding was that the Senator from \nVermont had 30 minutes in the order entered into last week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, but the UC was amended \nby a subsequent UC that moved the time from the beginning time to \n11:45.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Vermont be restored to his full 30 minutes, following the time of \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield, I am trying to retain some \ntime for my cosponsor, Senator Specter from Pennsylvania. I heard 10 \nminutes ago he was on his way to the floor. I would be glad for the \nSenator to proceed if we could reserve 10 minutes of time when Senator \nSpecter gets here at 11:45.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell the Senator that my only concern--\nand I am perfectly willing to make sure he is protected, however the \ntime works. I think by mistake somebody on the other side of the aisle \nyielded some of my time without my permission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be restored to a full 30 minutes, \nwithout in any way interfering with the time of the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Was that starting time 30 minutes from this \nmoment and then to reserve the 10 minutes for Senator Specter?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, I will start now. But the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina will not lose any of the time reserved for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He will retain his 10 minutes, that is \ncorrect. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 20, 1999, 14 young students and a \nteacher lost their lives at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. \nThat was one of a series of deadly incidents of school violence over \nthe last 2 years. The day that happened, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwas not engaged in working on crime proposals or public safety issues. \nThat day, like today, we were devoting our attention to the symbolism \nof this proposed amendment to the Constitution, which would weaken the \nfirst amendment for the first time in history, so that we might make \ncriminal the burning of the American flag.\n  Scores of our Nation's children have been killed and wounded over the \nlast 2 years. They haven't been killed or wounded by burning flags. \nThey have been killed and wounded by firearm violence. Our loss has \nbeen from school violence that has shaken communities across this \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House \nhave not found time to have the juvenile crime bill conference meet and \nresolve the differences. So even though we have passed a juvenile crime \nbill, one that has modest gun control in it, the gun lobby said we \ncan't meet on that. We cannot have meetings on it. We cannot resolve \nthose differences. Instead, we step forward and say to the American \npeople: We will protect your children, we will protect your schools, we \nwill make sure we have a constitutional amendment banning the burning \nof flags.\n  Like all Americans, all parents, I abhor the burning of flags. But \nlike American parents, especially those with children in school, I know \nthe danger to those children of gun violence and other criminal \nactivity in this country is far more of a danger than the burning of a \nflag.\n\n  The Republican majority has not moved the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill that is needed to provide Federal assistance to \nvictims of Hurricane Floyd, or to help those who need fuel assistance, \nor to fund our men and women engaged in international peacekeeping \nefforts in Kosovo. Nor has the Republican majority moved responsibly to \nhelp fill the 77 judicial vacancies plaguing the Federal courts around \nthe Nation. Nor has the majority yet moved a budget resolution to meet \nthe April 1 and April 15\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\ndeadlines of the Budget Act. I recall that 2 years ago no final budget \nresolution passed the Congress, and I hope that experience of \ncongressional inattention will not be repeated. We need to raise the \nminimum wage, pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, approve prescription \ndrug benefits, and authorize the FDA to help stem the public health \nhazard of tobacco products. There is a lot to be done, and very little \nis being done.\n  I came to the Senate again last week to urge action on the juvenile \ncrime conference. This Congress has kept the country waiting too long \nfor action on juvenile crime legislation and sensible gun safety laws. \nWe are fast approaching a first-year anniversary of the shooting at \nColumbine High School in Littleton, CO, without any response from \nCongress except for a bill that passed the Senate 3-to-1, a bill that \nwe all praised and took credit for, a bill that, unfortunately, didn't \ngo anywhere. It sat in a closed conference, behind a door that says: \nParents of America cannot be admitted.\n  If we did all our work, if we did something about gun violence, if we \ndid something about our children who are dying in the streets of \nAmerica, if we did something about school safety and something about \njuvenile justice, if we passed our budget on time, as the law requires, \nif we did something on medical privacy, if we did those things, fine, \nset aside a couple of weeks for symbolic actions. But let's do our work \nfirst. Let's do the things that should be done first.\n  Next month, Americans have to have their tax returns in, by April 15, \nbecause it is the law. It is also the law that says we are supposed to \nget our budget done. But we won't. The Congress of the United States \nhas shown 2 years ago that we have not followed the law.\n  For some time I have been urging the Senate to rededicate itself to \nthe work of helping parents, teachers, police and others to curb school \nviolence. On May 11 last year, the Republican majority in the Senate \nallowed us to turn our attention to the important problems of school \nviolence and juvenile crime. Over the ensuing two weeks the Senate \nworked its way through scores of amendments. The Hatch-Leahy juvenile \njustice legislation that passed the Senate last May 20, received a \nstrong bipartisan majority of 73 votes. Under the plan put forward by \nthe Republican leader, this juvenile justice legislation had become the \nvehicle for the anti-violence amendments adopted by the Senate last \nMay.\n  I urged a prompt conference. When things bogged down, I took the \nunusual step of coming to the Senate to offer a unanimous consent \nrequest to move to conference on the legislation, which eventually \nprovided the blueprint for finally agreeing to conference on July 28.\n  Unfortunately, the conference was convened for a single afternoon of \nspeeches. Democrats from the House and Senate tried to proceed, to \noffer motions about how to proceed, and to begin substantive \ndiscussion, but we were ruled out of order by the Republican majority.\n  Since that time I have returned to the Senate a number of times to \nspeak to these important issues and to urge the Republican to reconvene \nthe juvenile crime conference. I have joined with fellow Democrats to \nrequest both in writing and on the floor that the majority let us \nfinish our work on the conference and send a good bill to the \nPresident. On October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic \nconferees sent a letter to Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde calling \nfor an open meeting of the juvenile crime conference. On March 3, 2000, \nafter yet another shocking school shooting involving 6-year-old \nclassmates in Michigan, Representative Conyers and I wrote again to \nSenator Hatch and Congressman Hyde requesting an immediate meeting of \nthe conference. The response has been resounding silence.\n  I worry that after a major debate on the floor, one in which we have \nboth Republicans and Democrats bring up amendments and pass some and \nvote down others, we then let the subject of juvenile justice languish. \nWe have seen press releases, but the families of America have yet to \nsee a bill.\n  Three weeks ago, I was honored to be invited to a White House summit \nby the President of the United States. He had three other Members of \nCongress--the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nHenry Hyde; the distinguished chairman of our Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch; and the distinguished ranking member of the House \nJudiciary Committee, Congressman Conyers. We met in the Oval Office in \na rather extraordinary meeting. I have been to many over 25 years, and \nI do not remember one where the President stayed so engaged for such a \nlong period of time in such a frank and open exchange.\n  The President concurs with the reconvening of the conference and \naction by the Congress to send him a comprehensive bill before the 1-\nyear anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. But all of his entreaties \nhave been rebuffed as well. We have been in recess more than we have \nbeen in session since that time. Take a couple of days and wrap this \nup, and send it to the President.\n  Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile crime \nconference and put together an effective juvenile justice conference \nreport that would include reasonable gun safety provisions. It bothers \nme that this Senate, under its majority leadership, cannot find the \ntime nor the will to pass balanced, comprehensive juvenile justice \nlegislation.\n  With respect to juvenile crime, I hope the majority will heed the \ncall of our Nation's law enforcement officers to act now to pass a \nstrong and effective juvenile justice conference report. Ten national \nlaw enforcement organizations representing thousands of law enforcement \nofficers have endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety amendment. They \nsupport loophole-free firearm laws.\n  These are the ones who do:\n  International Association of Chiefs of Police;\n  International Brotherhood of Police Officers;\n  Police Executive Research Forum;\n  Police Foundation;\n  Major Cities Chiefs;\n  Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;\n  National Sheriffs Association;\n  National Association of School Resource Officers;\n  National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; and\n  Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association.\n  Should we not at least listen to the law enforcement people who are \nasked every day to put their lives on the line to protect all of us, \nand should we not at least listen to them when they say, Pass this \nmodest bill? But no. We see the gun lobbies run all kinds of ads \nbasically telling the Congress, Don't do it; we will not allow you to \ndo it. The Congress meekly says, Yes, sir; yes, sir; we will let the \ngun lobby run our schedule--not those of us who are elected to do it.\n  I was in law enforcement. I spent 8 years in law enforcement. I know \nlaw enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns out \nof the hands of people who should not have them.\n  I am not talking about people who use guns for hunting or for sport, \nas my neighbors and I do in Vermont, but about criminals and \nunsupervised children. The thousands of law enforcement officers \nrepresented by these organizations are demanding the Congress act now \nto pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference. As leader \nof the Democrats on this side, I am willing to meet on a moment's \nnotice to do that.\n  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about \nschool violence over the last two years and worried about when the next \nshooting may occur. They pray it does not happen at their school or \ninvolve their children.\n  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the epidemic of youth violence in \nour schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to \ndo our part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, \neffective juvenile crime legislation, and measures to keep guns out of \nthe hands of children and away from criminals. It is well past the time \nfor Congress to act.\n  Instead, the Senate will be called upon to devote several more days \nthis week to debating this proposal to amend the Constitution to \nrestrict the First Amendment's fundamental protection of political \nexpression for the\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\nfirst time in our nation's history in order to criminalize flag burning \nas a form of political protest. We can debate that. But can't we take \nat least as much time to debate things that will actually involve the \nsafety of our children?\n  I am prepared to debate the merits of the proposed constitutional \namendment to restrict political speech. I contributed to an extensive \nset of minority views in the Committee's report that lay out the flaws \nin the proponents' arguments and the case for protecting the \nConstitution and our Bill of Rights. We have debated this before and \nmust do so, again.\n  I treat proposals to amend the Constitution with utmost seriousness. \nOur role in the process is a solemn responsibility. But when we have \nconcluded this debate, as we will in the next few days, I hope that the \njuvenile crime bill conference committee will complete its work. I hope \nthat we will move the emergency supplemental appropriations needed to \nhelp our citizens hurt by Hurricane Floyd and by high fuel prices. I \nhope that we will vote to increase the minimum wage without further \ndelay; I hope that we will enact a real patients' bill of rights, and \nthat we will approve a meaningful prescription drug benefit, and that \nwe will pass the statutory authority now needed by the FDA to regulate \ntobacco products. I hope that we will vote on the scores of judicial \nnominations sent to us by the President to fill the 77 vacancies \nplaguing the federal courts and our system of justice; and I hope that \nwe will make progress on the many other matters that have been \nsidetracked by the majority.\n  My friends on the Republican side of the Senate control the schedule. \nThey set the priorities. But I hope they realize that these are \npriorities of the American people and will allow us to vote on them.\n  Mr. President, on the proposed constitutional amendment we are \ndebating, I note that the minority views in the committee report extend \nover 30 pages, yet we are asked to limit the debate on the proposal to \n2 hours. Nobody wants to filibuster a proposal. But if we are going to \namend the Constitution, especially if we are going to amend the first \namendment, and especially if we are going to amend the Bill of Rights \nfor the first time in over 200 years, I think the American people \ndeserve more than a couple of hours of chitchat and quorum calls to \ndiscuss what we are going to do.\n  I look forward to hearing from Senator Feingold, the ranking member \nof the Constitution Subcommittee. I look forward to hearing from \nSenator Bob Kerrey, the only Congressional Medal of Honor recipient \namong us; or Senator Robb, of Virginia, who is a decorated veteran and \ndistinguished Senator; and, of course, the constitutional sage of the \nSenate, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Robert C. Byrd.\n  The Senate was intended to be a place for thoughtful debate, for the \noffering of amendments and for votes on amendments. We should not \nshort-change this debate. Let us do justice to the task of considering \nthis constitutional amendment before we are called upon to vote, again.\n  This afternoon we will first vote on the Flag Protection Act \namendment offered by Senators McConnell, Bennett, Dorgan and Conrad \nwith the support of Senators Dodd, Torricelli, Bingaman, Lieberman and \nByrd. Having reviewed that proposal, I intend to support it as well. It \nis a statutory alternative to the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Now, let us remember one thing. No matter how Senators vote on the \nproposed amendment, either for or against it, there is one thing that \nunites every single Member of this body. We all agree that flag burning \nis a despicable and reprehensible act. It is usually done to show great \ndisrespect to our country and our institutions and all it stands for. \nIt has to be especially offensive to those who put their lives on the \nline for this country, whether in the Armed Forces, law enforcement, or \nelsewhere.\n  But the ultimate question before us is not whether we agree that flag \nburning is a despicable and reprehensible act. We all agree that it is. \nThe issue is whether we should amend the Constitution of the United \nStates, with all the risks that entails, and narrow the precious \nfreedoms ensured by the First Amendment for the first time in our \nhistory, so that the Federal Government can prosecute the tiny handful \nof Americans who show contempt for the flag. Such a monumental step is \nunwarranted and unwise.\n  Proponents of the constitutional amendment note the views of \ndistinguished American veterans and war heroes who have expressed their \nlove of the flag and support for the amendment. Those who fought and \nsacrificed for our country deserve our respect and admiration. I \nremember very much the letters that came back from my uncle in World \nWar II, and other friends and neighbors in subsequent wars.\n  They know the costs as well as the joys of freedom and democracy. \nTheir sacrifices are lessons for us all in what it means to love and \nhonor our flag and the country and the principles for which our flag \nstands. On this question of amending our Constitution, some would like \nto portray the views of veterans as being monolithic, when in fact many \noutstanding veterans oppose the amendment.\n  Above all, these veterans believe that they fought for the freedoms \nand principles that make this country great, not just the symbols of \nthose freedoms. To weaken the nation's freedoms in order to protect a \nparticular symbol would trivialize and minimize their service.\n  Last year, we were honored to have former Senator John Glenn, my dear \nfriend, who served this nation with special distinction in war and in \npeace and in the far reaches of space, come back to the Senate to \ntestify before the Judiciary Committee. This is a veteran of both World \nWar II and the Korean conflict.\n  He told us:\n\n       It would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the \n     symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental \n     freedoms themselves. Let the flag fully represent all the \n     freedoms spelled out in the Bill of Rights, not a partial, \n     watered-down version that has altered its protections.\n       The flag is the nation's most powerful and emotional \n     symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most \n     revered symbol. But it is a symbol. It symbolizes the \n     freedoms that we have in this country, but it is not the \n     freedoms themselves. . . .\n       Those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, who died \n     following that banner, did not give up their lives for a red, \n     white and blue piece of cloth. They died because they went \n     into harm's way, representing this country and because of \n     their allegiance to the values, the rights and principles \n     represented by that flag and to the Republic for which it \n     stands.\n\n  These are powerful words from our former colleague, John Glenn, a man \nwe all agree is a true American hero.\n  Last spring I wrote to General Colin L. Powell, our Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff during the Persian Gulf War, about this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. I thank him for having answered the call and \nfor adding his powerful voice to this debate. He wrote me the \nfollowing:\n\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration.\n       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, \n     that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I \n     really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute \n     someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We \n     should condemn them and pity them instead.\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment \n     exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but \n     also that which we find outrageous.\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long \n     after they have slunk away.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to have the full text of \nGeneral Powell's letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret),\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your recent letter asking \n     my views on the proposed flag protection amendment.\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\n       I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a \n     love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as \n     a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.\n       Americans revere their flag as a symbol of the Nation. \n     Indeed, it is because of that reverence that the amendment is \n     under consideration. Few countries in the world would think \n     of amending their Constitution for the purpose of protecting \n     such a symbol.\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration.\n       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, \n     that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I \n     really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute \n     someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We \n     should condemn them and pity them instead.\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment \n     exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but \n     also that which we find outrageous.\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long \n     after they have slunk away.\n       Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will \n     create trying to implement the body of law that will emerge \n     from such an amendment.\n       If I were a Member of Congress, I would not vote for the \n     proposed amendment and would fully understand and respect the \n     views of those who would. For or against, we all love our \n     flag with equal devotion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L. Powell.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Gary May lost both his legs while serving this country in \nVietnam. He spoke about how he felt and why he did not feel that we \nshould amend the Constitution on this point:\n\n       I am offended when I see the flag burned or treated \n     disrespectfully. As offensive and painful as this is, I still \n     believe that those dissenting voices need to be heard. This \n     country is unique and special because the minority, the \n     unpopular, the dissenters and the downtrodden, also have a \n     voice and are allowed to be heard in whatever way they choose \n     to express themselves that does not harm others. The freedom \n     of expression, even when it hurts, is the truest test of our \n     dedication to the belief that we have that right . . .\n       Freedom is what makes the United States of America strong \n     and great, and freedom, including the right to dissent, is \n     what has kept our democracy going for more than 200 years. \n     And it is freedom that will continue to keep it strong for my \n     children and the children of all the people like my father, \n     late father in law, grandfather, brother, me, and others like \n     us who served honorably and proudly for freedom.\n       The pride and honor we feel is not in the flag per se. It's \n     in the principles that it stands for and the people who have \n     defended them. My pride and admiration is in our country, its \n     people and its fundamental principles. I am grateful for the \n     many heroes of our country and especially those in my family. \n     All the sacrifices of those who went before me would be for \n     naught, if an amendment were added to the Constitution that \n     cut back on our First Amendment rights for the first time in \n     the history of our great nation.\n       I love this country, its people and what it stands for. The \n     last thing I want to give the future generations are fewer \n     rights than I was privileged to have. My family and I served \n     and fought for others to have such freedoms and I am opposed \n     to any actions which would restrict my children and their \n     children from having the same freedoms I enjoy.\n\n  Many thoughtful and patriotic veterans object to this attempt to \nlegislate patriotism. Those who testified before the Committee did not \nhave to prove their patriotism. They are automatically, by their \nservice to this country, true patriots. They spoke in eloquent terms \nabout the importance of respect and love for country coming from the \nheart of a citizen or a soldier, not being imposed from without by the \ngovernment.\n  I have thought so many times when I have been in countries where \ndictators rule to be able to say to them, do you have laws that require \neverybody to respect the symbols of your country, and they say, of \ncourse we have laws and we will prosecute anybody who doesn't obey the \nlaws and respect the symbols of our country.\n  I say, we are better in our country. We don't need the laws. We are a \nnation of a quarter of a billion people and our people respect the \nsymbols of this great nation and what it stands for, without having to \nhave the ``flag police'' on the corner, without having to have laws \npassed by Congress. They do it because they honor those symbols.\n  For the same reason, my family and I fly the flag proudly at our home \nin Vermont. We know it is protected by the people of Vermont. We also \nknow that it would probably be a very foolish thing for anybody to step \nfoot on the property to do any damage to that flag. But we don't have \nto worry about it. People drive by, smile and wave. They know what a \nproud symbol it is and how proudly we fly the flag.\n  I remember what Senator Bob Kerrey, the only recipient of the \nCongressional Medal of Honor currently serving in the United States \nCongress, said last year: ``Real patriotism cannot be coerced. It must \nbe a voluntary, unselfish, brave act to sacrifice for others.'' Senator \nKerrey reminded us that in this country we believe that ``it is the \nright to speak the unpopular and objectionable that needs the most \nprotecting by our government.'' Speaking specifically of the act of \nflag burning, he added: ``Patriotism calls upon us to be brave enough \nto endure and withstand such an act--to tolerate the intolerable.''\n  The late John Chafee, a distinguished member of this body and a \nhighly decorated veteran of World War II and Korea, pointed out that \njust as forced patriotism is far less significant than voluntary \npatriotism, a symbol of that patriotism that is protected by law will \nbe not more, but less worthy of respect and love. He said: ``We cannot \nmandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact, in my view taking steps \nto require citizens to respect the flag, sullies its significance and \nsymbolism.''\n  James Warner, a decorated Marine flyer who was a prisoner of war of \nthe North Vietnamese for six years, has made this point in graphic \nterms. He wrote:\n\n       I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph \n     of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag. \n     ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest \n     against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''\n       ``No.'' I said, ``that proves that I am right. In my \n     country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that \n     people disagree with us.'' The officer was on his feet in an \n     instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto \n     the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting \n     I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his \n     eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten \n     the satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the \n     burning flag, against him . . .\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? . . . \n     Don't be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to have the James Warner \neditorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     When They Burned the Flag Back Home--Thoughts of a Former POW\n\n                          (By James H. Warner)\n\n       In March of 1973, when we were released from a prisoner of \n     war camp in North Vietnam, we were flown to Clark Air Force \n     base in the Philippines. As I stepped out of the aircraft I \n     looked up and saw the flag. I caught my breath, then, as \n     tears filled my eyes, I saluted it. I never loved my country \n     more than at that moment. Although I have received the Silver \n     Star Medal and two Purple Hearts, they were nothing compared \n     with the gratitude I felt then for having been allowed to \n     serve the cause of freedom.\n       Because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when \n     I saw it for the first time after 5\\1/2\\ years, it hurts me \n     to see other Americans willfully desecrate it. But I have \n     been in a Communist prison where I looked into the pit of \n     hell. I cannot compromise on freedom. It hurts to see the \n     flag burned, but I part company with those who want to punish \n     the flag burners. Let me explain myself.\n       Early in the imprisonment the Communists told us that we \n     did not have to stay there. If we would only admit we were \n     wrong, if we would only apologize, we could be released \n     early. If we did not, we would be punished. A handful \n     accepted, most did not. In our minds, early release under \n     those conditions would amount to a betrayal, of our comrades \n     of our country and of our flag.\n       Because we would not say the words they wanted us to say, \n     they made our lives wretched. Most of us were tortured, and \n     some of my comrades died. I was tortured for\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\n     most of the summer of 1969. I developed beriberi from \n     malnutrition. I had long bouts of dysentery. I was infested \n     with intestinal parasites. I spent 13 months in solitary \n     confinement. Was our cause worth all of this? Yes, it was \n     worth all this and more.\n       Rose Wilder Lane, in her magnificent book ``The Discovery \n     of Freedom,'' said there are two fundamental truths that men \n     must know in order to be free. They must know that all men \n     are brothers, and they must know that all men are born free. \n     Once men accept these two ideas, they will never accept \n     bondage. The power of these ideas explains why it was illegal \n     to teach slaves to read.\n       One can teach these ideas, even in a Communist prison camp. \n     Marxists believe that ideas are merely the product of \n     material conditions; change those material conditions, and \n     one will change the ideas they produce. They tried to ``re-\n     educate'' us. If we could show them that we would not abandon \n     our belief in fundamental principles, then we could prove the \n     falseness of their doctrine. We could subvert them by \n     teaching them about freedom through our example. We could \n     show them the power of ideas.\n       I did not appreciate this power before I was a prisoner of \n     war. I remember one interrogation where I was shown a \n     photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a \n     flag. ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country \n     protest against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''\n       ``No,'' I said. ``That proves that I am right. In my \n     country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that \n     people disagree with us.'' The office was on his feet in an \n     instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto \n     the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting \n     I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his \n     eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten \n     the satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the \n     burning flag, against him.\n       Aneurin Bevan, former official of the British Labor Party, \n     was once asked by Nikita Khrushchev how the British \n     definition of democracy differed from the Soviet view. Bevan \n     responded, forcefully, that if Khrushchev really wanted to \n     know the difference, he should read the funeral oration of \n     Pericles.\n       In that speech, recorded in the Second Book of Thucydides' \n     ``History of the Peloponnesian War,'' Pericles contrasted \n     democratic Athens with totalitarian Sparta. Unlike the \n     Sparatans, he said, the Athenians did not fear freedom. \n     Rather, they viewed freedom as the very source of their \n     strength. As it was for Athens, so it is for America--our \n     freedom is not to be feared, for our freedom is our strength.\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. What better way to hurt them than \n     with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread freedom. The flag \n     in Dallas was burned to protest the nomination of Ronald \n     Reagan, and he told us how to spread the idea of freedom when \n     he said that we should turn American into ``a city shining on \n     a hill, a light to all nations.'' Don't be afraid of freedom, \n     it is the best weapon we have.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Those of us who oppose the constitutional amendment \nconcerning flag protests understand that the political pressure for \nthis amendment is strong, but our hope is that the Senate will in the \nend heed the wisdom of John Glenn, when he urged us to reject the \namendment:\n\n       There is only one way to weaken the fabric of our country, \n     and it is not through a few misguided souls burning our flag. \n     It is by retreating from the principles that the flag stands \n     for. And that will do more damage to the fabric of our nation \n     than 1,000 torched flags could ever do. . . . History and \n     future generations will judge us harshly, as they should, if \n     we permit those who would defile our flag to hoodwink us into \n     also defiling our Constitution.\n\n  We should not adopt a proposal that will whittle away at the first \namendment for the first time in our history. We act here as stewards of \nthe Constitution, guardians and trustees of a precious legacy. The \ntruly precious part of that legacy does not lie in outward things--in \nmonuments or statues or flags. All that those tangible things can do is \nremind us of what is precious--our liberty.\n  Our Constitution guards our freedoms and the first amendment is the \nmarble of our democracy; it is the bedrock of our rights and \nconstitutional protections. It guarantees the freedom of religion--the \nfreedom to practice a religion or not to practice a religion, as you \nbelieve. It guarantees our freedom of speech. By doing that, it \nguarantees diversity. If you guarantee diversity, you guarantee \ndemocracy. Our bill of rights has been doing that for over 200 years. \nWe are the envy of the world because of the way we protect our \nfreedoms.\n  Look at all the other countries, countries that have not achieved and \nwill not achieve greatness because they stifle dissent, because they do \nnot allow freedom of expression.\n  If, God forbid, some natural disaster or terrorist act swept away all \nthe monuments of this country, the Republic would survive just as \nstrong as ever. But if some failure of our souls were to sweep away the \nideals of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, then not all the stone, \nnot all the marble, not all the flags in the world would restore our \ngreatness. Instead, they would be mocking reminders of what we had \nlost.\n  I trust this Senate will uphold the Constitution and the first \namendment. I trust this Senate will uphold the lessons of history. I \ntrust this Senate will tell the founders of this Nation, when they \nwrote the bill of rights, they gave us a precious gift that we would \nhold unchanged throughout our lives and the lives of our children and \nthe lives of our grandchildren, because that is the way we honor our \ncountry.\n  That is the way we honor the sacrifices of so many millions who \nprotected our freedoms throughout the years.\n  Mr. President, do I still have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve seconds.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the amendment, \nwhose principal sponsor is the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nHollings, which would authorize the Congress and State legislatures to \nlimit campaign contributions and campaign expenditures.\n  Senator Hollings and I have been the principal cosponsors of this \nprovision since 1988. It is denominated as a constitutional amendment, \nbut, in fact, it is not a constitutional amendment, but instead it is a \nprovision which would alter the opinion of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States in Buckley v. Valeo which says that money was equated \nwith speech. I believe that to be an incorrect constitutional \ninterpretation, as do 209 professors of law who have submitted a \nstatement urging the overruling of Buckley v. Valeo.\n  Since the Supreme Court of the United States is not about to do that, \nthe only recourse is to follow the procedure today on what is \ndenominated a constitutional amendment, but it is not a constitutional \namendment because there is nothing in the first amendment which says \nspeech is money. That is not in the first amendment. The first \namendment guarantees freedom of speech, and an opinion by a majority of \nthe Supreme Court of the United States in Buckley v. Valeo has made \nthat interpretation.\n  Just as in the flag-burning case, there is nothing in the first \namendment which says freedom of speech includes the right to burn an \nAmerican flag. But in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court handed down \nthat interpretation. It is important to note, as a matter of \nconstitutional law, what the Supreme Court says is denominated as the \nopinion of the Court. If any effort were to be made to change the \nlanguage of the first amendment, I would strenuously oppose any such \neffort. But the provision to allow Congress and State legislatures to \ncontrol campaign contributions and expenditures does not do that.\n  On a purely personal note, this decision had special significance for \nme on January 30, 1976, the day it was handed down, because at that \ntime I was in the middle of a campaign for the Republican nomination to \nthe Senate for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. When the campaign \nstarted in the fall of 1975, the campaign finance law of 1974 governed, \nwhich limited the contributions of an individual for his own candidacy \nto $35,000, which was about the size of my bank account.\n  My opponent in the campaign was Congressman John Heinz. On January \n30, the Supreme Court said that any individual can spend whatever he \nchose, millions if he chose, and John did. That was the balance of the \nelection.\n  At the same time, the Supreme Court said that my brother, Morton \nSpecter, who had the financial ability to finance my campaign--not in \nthe Heinz style, perhaps, but adequately--was limited to $1,000 which \nwas provided for in the law. The question, I think not illogically, \ncame to my mind: What was the difference between John Heinz's money and \nMorton Specter's money? But that is what the Supreme Court said, and \nthey said it in a very curious way.\n  They said:\n\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\n\n       In order to preserve the provisions against invalidation on \n     vagueness grounds--\n\n  They cite the statute--\n\n       it must be construed to apply only to expenditures for \n     communications that express in terms that advocate the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for \n     Federal office.\n\n  They then drop to a footnote:\n\n       . . . which required language such as ``vote for,'' \n     ``elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast your ballot for,'' ``Smith for \n     Congress,'' ``vote against,'' ``defeat and reject.''\n  That has led to the very extraordinary so-called issue \nadvertisements, which are not controllable, where they are bought by \nsoft money. Listen to a couple of illustrative issue advertisements in \nthe 1996 campaign for President Clinton in the summer of 1996, which \nultimately tipped the scales:\n  ``American values,'' ``do our duty to our parents,'' ``President \nClinton protects Medicare,'' ``the Dole-Gingrich budget tried to cut \nMedicare $270 billion,'' ``protect families,'' ``President Clinton cut \ntaxes for millions of working families,'' ``the Dole-Gingrich budget \ntried to raise taxes on 8 million of them,'' ``opportunity,'' \n``President Clinton proposes tax breaks for tuition,'' ``the Dole-\nGingrich budget tried to slash college scholarships,'' ``only President \nClinton's plan meets our challenges, protects our values.''\n  That is curiously, insanely categorized not as an advocacy \nadvertisement, but only an issue ad. But what quality is there in the \nEnglish language which could more emphatically say: Elect President \nClinton, defeat Senator Dole?\n  That is the consequence when millions of dollars are poured into \ncampaigns in soft money, unregulated under the decision of the Supreme \nCourt in Buckley v. Valeo.\n  I note one very important factor: That the consequence of this \nprovision, denominated as an amendment, is not to put into effect any \nspecific reforms, but only to give the Congress of the United States \nthe authority constitutionally to do so. This does not say what \ncorporations can do, what unions can do, what individuals can do. It \nsays only that the constraint of Buckley v. Valeo, the opinion of \nJustices in a split Court, will not preclude Congress from acting on \nthe very important item of having democracy prevail in elections.\n  It is totally antithetical, in my opinion, to have money equated with \npower in a democracy. It subverts the principle of one man-one woman \nequals to one vote if power is equal to money and the rich can dominate \nthe electoral process.\n  I do not believe that Members of the House and Senate sell their \nvotes, although there is a widespread perception of that kind of \ncorruption.\n  There is a problem of access which I try to deal with by holding town \nmeetings in the 67 counties in Pennsylvania. On recent economies where \nthe budgets of Senators are limited as to mailing, it has not been \npossible for me to mail all of my constituents who attended the town \nmeetings. But I think that is a very practical answer to those who \ncomplain about access.\n  If Senators go to the county seat to be in the proximity of their \nconstituents and let their constituents know by a postcard that the \nSenator will be present at a given time, a given place to answer their \nquestions, then I think that kind of a guarantee of access would answer \na great many skeptical comments about fundraisers and the purchase of \naccess.\n  That is why I am proposing legislation which would permit a Senator \nto supplement his mailing budget for one postcard, once a year, to each \nconstituent in each county, providing the Senator personally appears at \nthat event.\n  The reality is, many Senators do not undertake town meetings anymore \nbecause they are very rough, tough affairs where people come in--may \nthe Record show a smile on the face of the Presiding Officer, the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming--they are rough, tough affairs.\n  I think the cost would probably be fairly low because I think \nrelatively few Senators would avail themselves of that opportunity.\n  In conclusion, let me remind my colleagues that what Senator Hollings \nand I are proposing does not change the language of the first \namendment, but instead it substitutes our judgment for the judgment of \nthe Court on what is an opinion of the interpretation of the \nConstitution's first amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the 209 scholars calling for \nthe reversal of Buckley be printed in the Record and that the bill for \npostal mailings also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Statement in Support of Overturning Buckley v. Valeo\n\n(This statement was organized jointly by: Brennan Center for Justice at \n   NYU School of Law, National Voting Rights Institute, U.S. Public \n                        Interest Research Group)\n\n       In its 1976 decision, Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court \n     of the United States held that mandatory campaign spending \n     limits are an unconstitutional denial of free speech.\n       We believe that the Buckely decision should be overturned. \n     The decision overstated the extent to which reasonable limits \n     on campaign expenditures impinge on free speech. The Court \n     also underestimated the corrosive effect of unlimited \n     campaign expenditures on the integrity of our political \n     process.\n       We the undersigned call for the reconsideration and \n     overturning of the Buckley decision.\n\n\n                 209 scholars Opposing Buckley v.

MAIL ALLOWANCES FOR SENATORS.\n\n       Section 506 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1973 (2 \n     U.S.C. 58) is amended by inserting after subsection (b) the \n     following:\n       ``(c) In addition to the funds provided for in subsection \n     (b), the amount available to a Member under subsection \n     (b)(3)(A)(iii) shall include an additional amount sufficient \n     to pay the expenses that would be incurred mailing 1 letter \n     to each postal address in each county in the State of that \n     Member where the Member holds and personally attends a town \n     meeting (not to exceed 1 town meeting per county per \n     year).''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I think we have 5 more minutes. I yield \nthe time to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from South Carolina. \nI think brevity is ideal, and I have said what I have to say. I would \nnot oppose a constitutional amendment to limit Senators' speeches to 10 \nminutes generally. But I thank my colleague from South Carolina.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wish to commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \ncomments about town meetings. But I hope there are Senators in this \nbody who will do town meetings. I expect there probably are some. I \nthink they are the most advantageous thing we could possibly do in \nrural States like mine and, I think, like the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer's State. I do not think either one of us would ever come back \nhere if we were not willing to do them. I think that is the experience \nof most Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \namendment related to flag burning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a unanimous consent agreement that \nactually runs over on the time we are allocated. Is the Senator asking \nunanimous consent to extend the time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes on the \nflag burning amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have time left. I would be glad to \nyield it to the distinguished Senator from Illinois. I have no \nobjection to the 10-minute request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes left. There are \nmeetings we have to get to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we will now go to a \nquorum call rather than to have me speak for 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum call will be charged against \nallocated time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be \npermitted, on our time, to go up to as long as 12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, even though he is on the other side of this \nissue, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend and colleague from the State of Utah \nfor yielding. I am aware of the fact we disagree on this issue. We have \nbeen friends and are adversaries only on issues without any personal \nbasis.\n  Mr. President, this has become a perennial issue before the Senate--\nthe question of whether we will amend the Constitution of the United \nStates to, in fact, somehow ban the desecration of the American flag.\n  Make no mistake about it, flag burning is an insensitive and shameful \nact. But the issue before us is not whether we support flag burning but \nwhether we should amend the Constitution, whether we should amend the \nBill of Rights for the first time in the history of the United States \nof America, whether we should narrow the precious freedoms ensured by \nthe first amendment for the very first time in our Nation's history.\n  When we trace back the origin of this flag burning amendment, we find \nthat it came about as a result of an act by an individual during the \n1984 Presidential election campaign in the State of Texas during the \nRepublican National Convention. A person went down there and ignited an \nAmerican flag, and ignited the passions of many people who feel very \nstrongly about that symbol of our Nation. It gave rise to an effort on \nthe floor of the Congress to pass a law which would ban this sort of \nactivity. Efforts were made, overturned by the Supreme Court, and then \nfinally a constitutional amendment was offered.\n  It is interesting, to me, to put this in some context because we are \ntalking about first amendment rights--rights of expression, rights of \nspeech--which, in fact, are envied around the world.\n  As nations came out from under the yoke of communism and were finally \ngiven an opportunity to write their own future, they looked to the \nUnited States, not to our flag--they had their own flag--but to our \nvalues. They said: The United States is different. The United States \nrespects the rights of individuals to express themselves, even when it \nis unpopular.\n  In many of these same countries, it had been against the law, \npunishable by imprisonment, to even question the Government, let alone \nto burn the flag of the country. But they said: We are going to walk \naway from that totalitarian view of the world. We are going to stand \nfor freedom, just like the United States of America.\n  One after another, the leaders of these new democracies came here to \nthe U.S. Capitol to appear before a joint session of Congress and \nreally said, in so many words, their model, their ideal, their goal, \nwas to follow our 200-plus year history of the Bill of Rights.\n  Those of us who want to stand in defense of the Bill of Rights \nunderstand that sometimes our positions are unpopular and sometimes \nuncomfortable. I think back a year ago. Remember, it was just a year \nago the Columbine High School massacre shocked America. It stunned us \nto believe this could happen in a school, that innocent children could \nbe mowed down with guns.\n  If the epicenter of this shock was at Columbine, it was certainly in \nthe State of Colorado, as well, as they reflected on this violence.\n  Do you recall a few days after the Columbine shootings, the National \nRifle Association held its convention in Denver, CO? Those in the \nsurrounding areas came out to peacefully protest and demonstrate \nagainst the National Rifle Association and its agenda and its \ninsensitivity to the Columbine High School shootings.\n  As much as I might disagree with the agenda of the National Rifle \nAssociation, I will have to stand here and say they had a right to \nmeet. They had a right to meet in Denver, CO, and to express their \npoints of view. As reprehensible and shameful as some might have found \nit, that is a right guaranteed by the first amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  In 1998, in Idaho, white supremacists obtained a permit for a ``100-\nman flag parade,'' and they marched, carrying American flags alongside \nNazi banners. The owner of a local bookstore in Coeur D'Alene made a \npoint of keeping his store opened. He observed: ``Nazis were burning \nbooks in the 1930s, and I don't want them closing stores in the 90s.''\n  To think of it--Old Glory side by side with the Nazi banner.\n  I am not certain this amendment would even touch that activity. I \nfind that reprehensible; I find that disgusting. Yet I understand it. \nThat is what America is all about. The real test of our belief in the \nBill of Rights, the real test of our belief in freedom of expression is \nwe stand back and say, as much as we disagree and despise every word \nyou are saying, you have a right as an American to say it. That is a \ncore principle of this democracy. That is a principle that is at issue \nwith the offering of this amendment, this amendment which says: We will \nseparate out one group of Americans who engage in this despised conduct \nof burning flags, and we will say, we will amend the Bill of Rights for \nthe first time in our history to stop that activity.\n  Senator Hatch, last year, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \ninvited a man I respect very much, Tommy Lasorda, who was a former \nmanager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who came and talked about his \nstrong feelings in support of this amendment. He talked about a day in \nthe baseball park when someone jumped out of the stands, started to \nburn a flag, and one of the other players raced over to grab the flag \nand put out the fire, how proud he was that this player--Rick Monday--\nwould put out the fire of this flag.\n  I asked Mr. Lasorda a question when it came my turn. I said: As I \nunderstand it, most of the people who jump out of the stands and run \nonto the field are not televised. A decision is made by the television \nstations and the management not to put the television cameras on these \npeople who race around the field whenever they do. He said: That is \ncorrect. I said: Why is that? He said: Because if you give them \nattention, it just encourages that kind of activity. I said to Mr. \nLasorda--and say today in debate--what more attention could we give to \nthese dim-witted clods who would burn the flag but to amend the Bill of \nRights for the first time in history? How seldom this occurs, how \nreprehensible it is, how awful it would be for us to respond to this \nterrible conduct by saying: You have our attention. We are going to \namend the Bill of Rights. We will show you. Then we will see a flood of \nthis kind of activity, I am afraid.\n  Some of the people I respect from both sides of the aisle have been \nquoted during the course of this debate. Gen. Colin Powell, former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, no one would question his \npatriotism, whether they belong to the American Legion or the VFW, \nAMVETS, or any veterans group. He opposes this amendment. He wrote a \nletter to Senator Leahy in 1999 and said:\n\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration. * * * I would not amend that \n     great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The \n     flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk \n     away.\n\n  General Powell got it right, a man who has served our country, has \nput his life on the line in combat like so many other veterans who are \nquoted in the minority views and who understand they were fighting for \nsomething more than a piece of cloth. They were fighting for a piece of \nhistory, a piece of history that goes back over 200 years, when men--\nand they were all men--came forward to write this document, the \nConstitution of the United States and said: We will make certain that \nno matter what any State or Federal Government should try to do, we \nwill hold sacred the rights of an individual for freedom of expression \nand freedom of speech no matter how unpopular it may be.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join us in condemning the action \nbut not in desecrating our Bill of Rights. It is a document which has \nbeen a source of pride for many generations. It will continue to be.\n  Some people say even the word ``desecration'' in this amendment is a \nlittle hard to follow. What is a physical desecration of the flag? \nWell, burning it is one illustration, but is it the only one? For \nexample, I raised this in committee about 2 years ago. Would we\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\nconsider it a desecration of the flag for someone to use an American \nflag as a seat cover in their automobile? Some might say that is a \ndesecration, sitting on the flag. I would ask them to think twice. Take \na trip down to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. Get up close and \nsee Abraham Lincoln, that son of Illinois of whom we are so proud. Look \nvery closely at what he is sitting on. He is sitting on an American \nflag. I don't think that is a desecration. I think we understand the \ncontext is trying to indicate the importance of this President.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose this amendment and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am intrigued by the comments of my \ncolleague from Illinois. I would like to focus all the attention in the \nworld on those who desecrate the American flag. I think it would be a \ngreat thing. It would help everybody in this country to know how \ndistasteful it is and how denigrating to our country it is and how \ndenigrating it is for all those who have died for this country \nfollowing the flag, how denigrating it is to everybody who served in \nthe military, how denigrating it is to every schoolchild, how \ndenigrating it is to people who believe in values and things that are \nright. I have no trouble focusing on somebody who runs on the field \nburning a flag. I would like to focus on that creep as much as I could. \nI think if we did a little bit more of that, we might find a renewed \nresurgence of feelings about our country out there.\n  To be honest with you, if I interpret what the Senator said, he \nbasically said that people ought to be able to make their statement. I \nwonder if he would be happy to have anybody who wants to make a \nstatement in our gallery make any statement they want to every day that \nwe meet. I think he would acknowledge that would disrupt the workings \nof the most important legislative body in the world.\n  There are limitations on everything, including the first amendment. \nBy the way, how do you call offensive conduct of defecating, urinating \non the flag or burning the flag with contempt, how do you call that \nfree speech? The Supreme Court apparently has done so, but then, again, \nwhat we are talking about here, just look at this amendment. It is a \nvery simple amendment. It is not telling us to do anything about the \nflag. What it says is: The Congress shall have the power to prohibit \nthe physical desecration of the flag of the United States. My gosh, it \ndoesn't tell us what to do. It just says we are going to take back this \npower that we had before this other third of the three separate powers, \nthe judiciary, took it away from us and took it away from 49 States, \nall of which have asked us to restore that right to the States and the \nFederal Government.\n  These people are arguing against an amendment that gives the Congress \nback the power it had before, that it had for 200 years. Where is the \nlogic in that? Many of these folks who are going to vote against this \namendment voted for an anti-flag-desecration statute back in 1989. If \nthey believe it is free speech today to defecate on the flag, then why \nwasn't it in 1989 when they voted for that useless statute that I stood \nup and said was unconstitutional and voted against and which later was \ndeclared to be what I said it would be, unconstitutional? Why didn't \nthey vote against it if they are so enamored with this argument on free \nspeech?\n  But forget the free speech argument. What about the power of three \nseparate branches of Government? Why should we let the judiciary tell \n49 States and the Congress of the United States we don't have any power \nto protect the national symbol of our sovereignty, of our patriotism, \nof our Nation? Any self-respecting Senator would want to stand up for \nthe rights of the Congress, especially since this amendment doesn't say \nwhat we have to do. It basically says we have the right to change \nthings. That is what you do with a constitutional amendment.\n  Some opponents of the flag-protection amendment have argued that we \nshould be passing more restrictions on gun ownership rather than \ndebating our constitutional amendment to protect the American flag. \nGive me a break. Everything is gun amendments around here. We have \n20,000 laws, rules, and regulations about guns in this society that \naren't even being enforced by this administration. While I believe \nthere is no shortage of important issues for the Senate to take up, I \nbelieve the flag amendment is not only vital to protect our shared \nvalues as Americans, but also that this debate is particularly timely \ntoday as we all strive to recover what is good and decent about our \ncountry.\n\n  We see evidence of moral decay and a lack of standards all around us. \nOur families are breaking down, our communities are being divided, and \nthere are leaders who are not providing the appropriate moral \nleadership for the American public. Our popular culture, including \nmovies, television, video games, and music, bombards our children with \noffensive messages of violence and selfishness. The very disturbing \nincidents of gun violence--particularly at our public schools--is a \nparticular result of a culture that is afraid to teach that certain \nideas are right or wrong. As the saying goes, you have to stand for \nsomething, or you will fall for anything.\n  Today, the Senate has a unique opportunity to say that our country, \nand our culture, does stand for something; that on the issue of \nprotecting and safeguarding an incident of national sovereignty, we \nstand for something. Today, we can reaffirm that all Americans share \ncertain beliefs and values and a respect for this symbol of our \nnational sovereignty. We can give a united bedrock of principle to a \ngeneration that is increasingly floating adrift and alone. Think about \nit. If we pass this amendment, we will create a debate on values in \nthis country in all 50 States. That alone justifies this amendment--\nalthough I could give many additional justifications even better than \nthat.\n  The disillusioned young people in our society today learn a very \nnegative lesson by watching our Government sit powerlessly as \nexhibitionists and anarchists deface the embodiment of our sovereignty \nand our common values. What do you think they take away from watching \npeople who dishonor the memory of those millions of men and women who \nhave given their lives for the future of America? Allowing desecration \nof the flag lowers again the standards of elemental decency that all of \nus must and should live by. This proposed amendment affirms that \nwithout some aspirations to national unity, there might be no law, no \nConstitution, no freedoms such as those guaranteed by the Bill of \nRights. The Bill of Rights was never intended to be a license to engage \nin any kind or type of behavior that one can imagine. Don't sell this \namendment, and what it stands for, short.\n  If we pass this amendment by the necessary two-thirds vote, the \nSenate will say that our symbol of sovereignty, the embodiment of so \nmany of our hopes and dreams, can no longer be dragged through the mud, \ntorn asunder, or defecated on. We will say to the young people of \nAmerica that there are ideals worth fighting for and protecting. There \nis a reason we are united as Americans, and that our experiment in \ndemocracy has proven to be the most enlightened government in history.\n  Can anyone think of a better message to send to our young people than \nto begin to reclaim the values of liberty, equality, and personal \nresponsibility that Americans have defended and debated?\n  The flag amendment is not a distraction from matters of violence and \neducation and social decay; nor is it an abdication of responsibility, \nas it has been called by some who oppose it. If there has been an \nabdication of responsibility, it has been to defend the irresponsible \nnotion that the Bill of Rights exists to allow people to engage in any \ntype of behavior or conduct that one can imagine. We need more \nattention to public values and standards, not less.\n\n  I am deeply offended by those who say the Senate has more important \nthings to do than discuss a flag-protection constitutional amendment. I \nurge those of my colleagues who think the Senate is too important for \nthe American flag to listen to the American people on this issue. I \njust came from a press conference where seven Congressional Medal of \nHonor recipients were there praying that the people of this country \nwill get the Members of the\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nSenate to support this flag amendment.\n  The vast majority of our citizens support amending the Constitution \nto protect our Nation's flag. Even then, this amendment just says it \ngives the right to the Congress to do that. To these citizens and \nelected officials, protecting the flag as the symbol of our national \nunity and community and utilizing the constitutional amendment process \nto do so is no trivial matter.\n  Sitting in our gallery today are people who put their lives on the \nline to defend our flag and the principles for which it stands. These \nare the fortunate ones who were not required to make the ultimate \nsacrifice like my brother was in the Second World War, and like my \nbrother-in-law was in Vietnam. Every one of these people--like tens of \nthousands of American families across our country--have traded the life \nof a loved one for a flag, folded at a funeral. Let's think about that \ntrade--and about the people who made it for us--before deciding whether \nthe flag is important enough to be addressed in the Senate.\n  Given the great significance of the flag, it is not surprising that \nsupport for the flag amendment is without political boundaries. It is \nnot, as some suggest, a battle between conservatives on one side and \nliberals on the other. Indeed, the flag amendment transcends all \npolitical, racial, religious, and socioeconomic divisions. This is \nconsistently reflected in national polling, in resolutions to Congress \nfrom 49 State legislatures requesting Congress to send the flag \namendment to the States for ratification, and in the support of a \nbipartisan supermajority of the House of Representatives both last year \nand during the 104th Congress.\n  Is this overwhelming support for the flag amendment, as manifested \nthrough polling and through the actions of State and national \nlegislatures, frivolity? Are we trivializing the Constitution, when a \nvast majority of Americans speaking for themselves or through elected \nrepresentatives seek to utilize the article V amendment process, itself \nconstructed by our Founding Fathers to right the wrongs of \nconstitutional misinterpretation? Are we irresponsible if we simply \nrestore the law as it existed for two centuries prior to two Supreme \nCourt decisions, which were 5-4 decisions, hotly contested decisions? \nDoes the principle of ``government by the people'' end where the self-\nprofessed ``experts'' convince themselves that the concerns of the \noverwhelming majority of ordinary citizens and their representatives \nare not important?\n  Is the Constitution, which establishes processes for its own \namendment, wrong? I say it is the Constitution which establishes \nprocesses for its own amendment, and it is right. It says that the \nConstitution will be amended when two-thirds of the Congress and three-\nfourths of the States want to do so. It does not say that this \nprocedure is reserved for issues that some law professors think are \nimportant, or issues that would crumble the foundations of our great \nRepublic.\n\n  If ``government by the people'' means anything, it means that the \npeople can decide the fundamental questions concerning the checks and \nbalances in our Government. The people can choose whether it is \nCongress or the Supreme Court that decides whether flag desecration is \nagainst the law.\n  I urge colleagues to think hard about what they consider to be \n``important'' before they conclude that the Senate should ignore the \npeople and what they think is important and what should be considered \nimportant before they conclude that the Senate should ignore the \npeople's desire to make decisions about the Government which governs \nthem. The flag amendment is the very essence of ``government by the \npeople'' because it reflects the people's decision to give Congress a \npower that the Supreme Court has taken away. This question is very \nimportant. I urge my colleagues not to think that this body is above \nlistening to the vast majority of citizens of this country who want to \ngive Congress the ability to determine whether and how to protect the \nAmerican flag.\n  People should not say that there are more important issues than this \none. This issue involves the very fabric of our society, what we are \nall about, and what our children, we hope, will be all about. This \nissue is very important. Anybody who thinks otherwise is trivializing \nthis very important issue and the 80 percent of the American people who \nare strongly for it. The other 20 percent are not strongly against it; \nonly a small percentage of those are. The rest of them just don't know \nor don't care.\n  You should have been with those seven Congressional Medal of Honor \nrecipients, Miss America, and a whole raft of other veterans outside as \nwe talked about why this amendment is important.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1793-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We now have 4 minutes equally divided under \nthe McConnell amendment No. 2889, S.J. Res. 14.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we all despise those who desecrate the \nflag. The issue before the Senate today is how we should deal with that \nproblem.\n  In the late 1980s, the Congress passed a statute designed to prohibit \nthis vile practice. It was struck down by the Supreme Court on First \nAmendment grounds. For the last several years we have had proposals in \nthe Senate to amend the Bill of Rights in order to prohibit flag \ndesecration despite the First Amendment. However, I think we should be \nvery reluctant about amending the Bill of Rights.\n  Therefore, I have offered the amendment which we will be voting on \nshortly. It takes a new a statutory approach that I am confident would \nbe upheld by the Supreme Court. Simply put, my alternative approach \nprotects the flag by prohibiting three kinds of desecration. First, \ndesecration of the flag that incites violence or breach the peace. \nSecond, desecration of a flag belonging to the United States \ngovernment. Third, desecration of a flag stolen from someone else and \ndestroyed on government land. Anyone who engages in any of this kind of \nreprehensible behavior would be subject to fines of up to $250,000 and/\nor imprisoned for up to 2 years. I think this is a better approach than \ntinkering with the Bill of Rights for the first time in 200 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I generally support the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky on all campaign finance reform issues because I \nthink he is one of the most learned people, if not the most learned \nperson in this area and on many other occasions. On this issue I \ncannot.\n  I predicted back in 1989 it was unconstitutional when they passed the \nstatute, which passed overwhelmingly by a lot of people who, today, \nwhen this amendment is finally voted upon, will vote against it. In \nother words, they passed the statute that would do what this amendment \nwould allow the Congress, if it so chooses to do, to do.\n  It seemed illogical to me they are unwilling to do what really has to \nbe done because we have had two statutory attempts to resolve the \nproblem of physical desecration of our beloved American flag. Both \ntimes I predicted it was unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's \ndecisions, and both times they were held to be unconstitutional. So a \nstatute is not going to do the job.\n  In spite of good intentions, the only way we can resolve this problem \nand do it effectively without taking anybody's rights away is to do \nwhat we are doing--not passing a constitutional amendment that \nprohibits physical desecration of the flag. We are passing a \nconstitutional amendment that gives the Congress a coequal status with \nthe judiciary, two coequal branches of Government to have the right to \ndetermine what to do with regard to the flag. That is what we intend to \ndo.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote against this amendment because it\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\nwould undermine, of course, the constitutional amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to oppose amending the Constitution \nof the United States to outlaw flag burning, and I will support the \nMcConnell statute to punish flag burners who want to incite violence. \nThe flag stands for freedom, and so does our Bill of Rights. I believe \nthat both must be protected.\n  Colin Powell recently wrote, ``I would not amend that great shield of \nDemocracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying \nproudly long after they have slunk away. Finally, I shudder to think of \nthe legal morass we will create in trying to implement the body of law \nthat will emerge from such an amendment.''\n  As our good friend John Glenn, a great Senator, a great astronaut, \nand a great Marine, once declared, ``[I]t would be a hollow victory \nindeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at \nthose fundamental freedoms themselves. Let the flag fully represent all \nthe freedoms spelled out in the Bill of Rights, not a partial, watered-\ndown version that alters its protections.''\n  We can solve this problem with an amendment that is identical to a \nstatute written by the Senator from Kentucky, the Flag Protection Act \nof 1999.\n  This amendment would protect the flag of the United States from being \ndestroyed or damaged in certain situations. Under this amendment, any \nperson who destroys or damages the flag of the United States with the \nprimary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a \nbreach of peace will receive a stiff fine, imprisonment, or both.\n  This amendment also increases the fine and imprisonment penalties for \ndamaging a flag belonging to the United States or damaging a flag on \nFederal land.\n  I support this amendment because I believe that our flag is the very \nsymbol of our liberty, unity, and equality as a nation--a proud \nreminder of the democracy we hold so dear. But while we should protect \nthe American flag, we also must remain vigilant in our protection of \nthe Constitution.\n  This amendment stands on solid constitutional ground. Although the \nstatute criminalizes the destruction or damaging of the American flag \nwith the intent to provoke imminent violence or breach of the peace, \nSupreme Court precedent supports this approach. In Chaplinsky v. New \nHampshire (1942), the Court upheld the constitutionality of laws that \nprohibit expression calculated, and likely to cause, a breach of the \npeace.\n  So I support this amendment because it not only protects our American \nflag, but it also preserves the rights and freedoms established in the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to protect our flag. But just as \nimportant, we can preserve the constitutional ideals symbolized by the \nflag.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 14, the flag \nprotection constitutional amendment, and to explain, quite briefly, my \nopposition to Senator McConnell's statutory substitute.\n  The McConnell amendment (No. 2889) would amend the U.S. Code to \nestablish jail terms and fines for (1) damaging a flag ``with the \nprimary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a \nbreach of the peace,'' (2) damaging a flag that belongs to the United \nStates, or (3) damaging a flag that belongs to a third party if the \ndamage occurs within the ``exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of the \nUnited States.'' See Section 3, proposed 18 U.S.C. 700.\n  I oppose the McConnell amendment for three reasons. First, the narrow \nstrictures of the amendment would provide little protection for the \nflag. For example, the McConnell amendment would not apply to the very \ncase (Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989)) in which the Supreme Court \nstruck down flag protection statutes. In that case, Gregory Johnson \nburned a flag that had been stolen from a bank. He did not burn the \nflag on Federal property; be burned it in front of city hall as a \npolitical protest. Thus, the second and third restrictions of the \nMcConnell amendment (a ban on destroying flags stolen from the United \nStates, and a ban on destroying stolen flags on Federal property) would \nnot have applied. As for the first restriction (a ban on burning a flag \nwhen such action could cause imminent violence or a breach of the \npeace), it is important to note that the Court in Texas v. Johnson \nfound that unless there was evidence that a riot ensued or threatened \nto ensue one could not protect the flag under the breach of the peace \ndoctrine.\n  Second, it seems unlikely that the amendment would survive scrutiny \nby the U.S. Supreme Court. In response to Texas v. Johnson, Congress \nquickly enacted a facially content-neutral, flag-protection statute \nthat it hoped would pass constitutional muster. See Public Law 101-131. \nOn June 11, 1990, in United States v. Eichman (496 U.S. 310 (1990)), \nthe Supreme Court struck down that law. The Court found the following: \n``Although the Flag Protection Act contains no explicit content-based \nlimitation on the scope of prohibited conduct, it is nevertheless clear \nthat the government's asserted interest is `related to the suppression \nof free expression,' and concerned with the content of such expression. \nThe Government's interest in protecting the `physical integrity' of a \nprivately owned flag rests upon a perceived need to preserve the flag's \nstatus as a symbol of our Nation and certain national ideas.'' Id. at \n315-16. If precedent is an accurate guide, it is likely that the Court \nwould reach a similar conclusion if it considered the McConnell \namendment.\n  Finally, as one of the 58 Senate sponsors of S.J. Res. 14, I want to \nsee that resolution receive an up-or-down vote. The sponsors of the \namendment and the numerous veterans, patriotic, civic, and religious \ngroups have worked hard to bring the constitutional amendment to a \nvote.\n  In closing, I would like to reaffirm my support for S.J. Res. 14. I \ncannot believe that our Founding Fathers intended ``freedom of \nexpression'' to encompass the willful destruction of our national \nsymbol--the symbol of America that so many of our sons and daughters \nhave given their lives to defend.\n  Mr. HATCH.

The Senate will now consider amendment No. \n2890 to S.J. Res. 14 offered by Senator Hollings. There are 4 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my colleagues all acknowledge the need \nfor more and more money each time we come up for election or get into \npolitical campaigns.\n  There has been very little discussion of the actual chase for that \nmoney which has corrupted the institution. I hate to say that. When I \ngot here 33 years ago, we would come to work, and Senator Mansfield, \nthe majority leader, would have a vote at 9 o'clock on Monday morning. \nSenator Byrd did the\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\nsame thing as majority leader. We would work throughout the week up \nuntil 5 o'clock on Friday. Now Mondays and Fridays are gone. We start \non the half day on Tuesdays, and then Wednesdays and Thursdays we all \nwant a window.\n  There is no window in the Chamber, but there are plenty of windows. \nYou to have get with the dialog, as they call it up here, and that is \nfor the money chase. We used to have the extended Easter break and the \nFourth of July, but now we have not only January gone, there are 10 \ndays in February, March, April, 10 days in May, June, the July break, \nAugust, the month off, and we are supposed to go home and get money.\n  If you go to the leader and ask, please call up a bill, it may take 3 \nor 4 days, he looks at you as if you are loony. Talk about debating, \ndeliberating--this deliberative body has been so corrupted, it can't \ndeliberate. Don't give me this so-called eviscerate the first \namendment. Buckley v. Valeo did that. The intent there was that every \nmother's son, anybody of ordinary means, could offer for the \nPresidency. What has really happened is that we have taken away the \nspeech of those who are without money. And for those who are \nmillionaires, they can buy the office. In fact, it has stood the intent \non its head whereby, instead of forbidding the purchase of the office, \nwe have to buy it. You have to get more money.\n  I hope we will vote for this constitutional amendment which is \nneutral. It is not pro or con McCain-Feingold or public financing or \nwhatever it is. It gives the people a chance to vote. All you have to \ndo is look to the primaries we have just gotten through. The people are \nready, willing, and able to vote and stop this corruption.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we had this constitutional amendment \nbefore us in 1997. It only got 38 votes, and it takes 67 votes to \nchange the constitution. Frankly, I am surprised it even got 38 votes. \nThis amendment would essentially repeal a major part of the First \nAmendment. The Bill of Rights has protected our free speech for over \n200 years. We do not need to begin eviscerating it now.\n  The Washington Post opposes this amendment. Common Cause opposes this \namendment. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and \nothers oppose this amendment. This amendment is simply a very bad idea.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nBennett.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from South \nCarolina on his honesty in that he recognizes the proposals with \nrespect to campaign finance reform that have been on this floor are, in \nfact, unconstitutional. But he seeks to solve the problem with a \nconstitutional amendment, which I think is best summarized in the \ncomment by the Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, who said this does \nnot amend the first amendment with respect to political speech, it \nrepeals it.\n  I don't want to vote in favor of something that could be considered \nby as careful a scholar as the Senator from Washington as repealing \nfree speech for politicians. We have the same rights, I think, that \neveryone else should have. For that reason, I ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote on \nSenator Hollings' proposal to amend the Constitution to allow Congress \nand the States to impose reasonable limits on contributions and \nexpenditures made to support or oppose candidates for elected office. \nIn this case, I believe that the high threshold I have established for \nsupporting a constitutional amendment--that it address a significant \nthreat to the Republic or some egregious wrong--has been met.\n  This amendment addresses an unfortunate fact whose truth has become \nmore and more apparent in the past several years: money and the never \nending chase for it are threatening the integrity of our political \nsystem and jeopardizing the essence of our democracy. Although money \nhas always played a role in American politics, its impact became \noverwhelming during the last few election cycles. Political fundraising \nand spending during the 1996 campaign was 73 percent greater than \nduring the 1992 campaign, and there is no reason to believe we won't \nbreak that record in 2000. We are all intimately familiar with the time \nand resources we need to spend to raise that money, and with the \nnumerous questionable events and actions that were spurred by the money \nchase during the last Presidential election. Most of those events and \nactions, I have sadly concluded, were legal under our current campaign \nfinance laws. But that does not mean they were not wrong. I think they \nwere. By ensuring that we will be able to put a limit on the amount of \nmoney spent in political campaigns, this constitutional amendment would \nhelp restore a sense of integrity--and of sanity--to our campaign \nfinance system and to our democracy.\n  Much of the debate over this proposed amendment centers on what some \ncall its threat to the principle of free speech. That, of course, is a \nprinciple we all hold dear. But I say, Mr. President, that free speech \nis not what is at issue here. Free speech is about the inalienable \nright all of us have to express our views without government \ninterference. It is about the vision the Framers of our Constitution \nenshrined in that most important of documents--a vision that ensures \nthat we in Congress will never compromise our American birthright to \nsay things and offer opinions even when those opinions are unpopular or \ndiscomforting. But that simply is not at issue here, Mr. President--\nabsolutely nothing in this amendment will do anything to diminish or \nthreaten any American's right to express his or her views about \ncandidates running for office or about any problem or issue in American \nlife.\n  What would be threatened by this proposed Constitutional amendment, \nMr. President, is something entirely different: the ever increasing and \ndisproportionate power those with money have over our political system. \nAs everyone in this chamber knows, the spiraling costs of running for \noffice require all of us to spend more and more time raising money and \nmore and more time with those who give it. We are all far too familiar \nwith events or meetings with elected officials attended only by those \nwho could afford to give $5,000 or $10,000 or even $100,000--sums of \nmoney that are beyond the capacity of the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans to give. That, Mr. President, is threatening a principle all \nof us hold just as dearly as the principle of free speech: the \nprinciple of democracy. That sacred principle guides our Republic--it \npromises that each person has one vote, and that each and every one of \nus--rich or poor--has an equal right and an equal ability to influence \nthe workings of our government. As it stands now, Mr. President, it is \nthat sacred principle that is under attack and that sacred principle \nthat promises to remain under attack unless we do something to save it. \nAnd that something, I submit, is campaign finance reform.\n\n  I, for one, believe that most of the campaign finance reform we need \ncan and must be done even without this Constitutional amendment. The \nSupreme Court, after all, has made quite clear in its decisions that \neven under its view of money as being equivalent to speech, the \nConstitution still allows Congress to impose restrictions on the amount \nthat can be contributed to campaigns and parties. This, in my view, \nmeans that we have no excuse not to act right now to stop the massive \nsoft money contributions that pose the biggest threat to our system. It \nis important that we not use the First Amendment as a shield against \nchange because it is clearly constitutional to limit and regulate \ncontributions to political campaigns--including soft money.\n  What it appears we cannot do under the Supreme Court's rulings is \nlimit the amount of money we and others spend in the course of \ncampaigns unless we adopt convoluted legislation geared toward \ncomplying with the Supreme Court's view that money is\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\nspeech. I think that the need for reform is so great that it is worth \naccepting convoluted legislation, but I also think that we should act \nnow to vote for this amendment and so ensure that in the future we will \nbe able to properly regulate campaign spending, thereby controlling the \namount of money spent in American political campaigns.\n  Mr. President, nothing less than the future of our democracy is at \nstake here. Unless we act to reform our campaign finance system, people \nwith money will continue to have disproportionate influence in our \nsystem, people who are not even citizens of the United States will try \nto use money to influence our government's decisions, the American \npeople will continue to lose faith in our government's institutions, \nand the genius of our Republic--that it is our citizenship, not our \npocketbook, that gives each of us equal power to play a role in our \ncountry's governance--that genius will be lost.\n  Mr. President, it is for that reason that I have concluded that this \nis one of those rare constitutional amendments that is worth \nsupporting. Our current campaign finance system poses an egregious \nthreat to our Democracy. Big money donations, endless spending and the \nproliferation of anonymously-funded and often inaccurate attack ads all \nhave had an extraordinarily corrosive and distorting affect on our \npolitical system and on the citizenry's view of its role in our \nDemocracy's decisions. I frankly can think of few threats to the \nRepublic greater than one that throws into doubt the integrity and \nwell-functioning of our democratic decision-making process.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote against \nthe Hollings amendment to S.J.Res. 14 which would have amended the \nConstitution to authorize regulation of contributions to, and spending \nby, Federal and State candidates.\n  I am a strong proponent of campaign finance reform. I would even go \nso far as to say that I view the fight to bar private, interested money \nfrom dominating our elections as the core battle that needs to be won \nif Congress is going to turn its attention to enacting an agenda that \nput working families before wealthy, entrenched special interests. The \ncampaign finance reform debate may be to the nineties what civil rights \nwas to the fifties and sixties. In fact, let me go a step further and \nsay the campaign finance reform may be the new civil rights watershed.\n  I do not believe that money equals speech, as some of my colleagues \nhave argued during the debate on the Hollings amendment and in previous \ndebates. The vote is undermined by the dollar. The vote may be equally \ndistributed, but dollars are not. As long as elections are privately \nfinanced, those who can afford to give more will always have a leg up--\nin supporting candidates, in running for office themselves, and in \ngaining access and influence with those who get elected. We all know \nthis is the way it works. And the American people know it, too.\n  I laud my colleague's intentions in offering this amendment. No one \nhas pushed harder on campaign finance reform than the junior Senator \nfrom South Carolina. But while I have supported the Hollings amendment \nin the past, I voted against it today. There is now significant \nmomentum at both the federal and state levels to enact campaign finance \nreform--including public financing of elections, which I believe is \ncritical--in a manner that will pass constitutional muster. These \nefforts, with hard work and determination, have the best chance of \nresulting in meaningful, lasting improvements in our election system, \nand therefore in our democracy.\n  Amending the Constitution is a long and arduous process.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank \nmembers of my staff for their hard work on the last two amendments: Tam \nSomerville, staff director of the Rules Committee; Hunter Bates, \ngeneral counsel, who works with him; Andrew Siff, Denise Grant, and \nNathan Oman who have been deeply involved in the last two amendments. I \nappreciate the great assistance from Senator Bennett of Utah.\n  This is a red letter day for the first amendment. The Hollings \namendment had only 33 votes in favor of the amendment. As we all know, \nit takes 67 votes to approve an amendment to the Constitution. There \nwere 67 votes against this amendment to the Constitution. It is clear \nthat the first amendment is secure for another day, and I thank my \ncolleagues who made that possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nin morning business for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And I shall not. What is the parliamentary situation right \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering S.J. Res. \n14.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask it be set aside and that I may proceed in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Again reserving the right to object, and I will not \nobject, will there be any objection then to, at the conclusion of the \nSenator's morning business speech, we go to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin who has been waiting to speak on the amendment which is \nthe pending business?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Vermont, I am \nwaiting to go to another committee, may I follow the Senator from \nWisconsin?\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, is the Senator from \nWisconsin just going to speak or is he intending to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My intent is simply to speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The order \nwill be the Senator from Alabama for 10 minutes, the Senator from \nWisconsin, followed by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \nunderstanding in helping us work this out, and also the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, for his indulgence.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Shelby pertaining to the introduction of S. 2304 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we in the Senate speak today to honor \nthe American flag, the symbol of our Nation. Both those who favor and \nthose who oppose the amendment to the Constitution now pending do so. \nWe all, of course, seek to honor the flag.\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\n  I dare say that there is not a Senator among us who does not feel \ngoose bumps when first looking up at the dome of the Capitol and seeing \nour flag. I would wager that no U.S. Senator fails to get a lump in the \nthroat when standing to the strains of the national anthem. And I am \nconfident that there is none among us whose eyes do not sometimes mist \nover when watching those seven bars of red and six of white ripple in \nthe breeze and tug at the heart.\n  But, my colleagues, honoring the flag demands that we here fully and \nfairly debate this amendment. Amending the Constitution is an \nundertaking of the greatest import. For the Congress to propose an \namendment to the Constitution of the United States on the basis of \nanything less than a full--even an exhaustive--debate would show less \nthan the full respect due to the flag and the Constitution that it \nrepresents.\n  Honor demands that we view any effort to amend the Constitution with \ntrepidation. Since the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791, America \nhas amended its Constitution on only 17 occasions. Our Constitution has \nserved this Nation well and withstood the test of time, in large part \nbecause Congress has resisted the urge to respond to every adversity, \nreal or imagined, with a constitutional amendment. We should exercise \nrestraint in amending this great charter.\n  We honor the American flag because we love ``the Republic for which \nit stands.'' We honor the banner because we cherish ``one Nation . . . \nwith liberty and justice for all.'' We honor the flag because it \nrepresents a Constitution, that solemn commitment; and a Bill of \nRights, that charter of liberty; unrivaled in the history of humankind.\n  Honor demands that we seek to protect not just the flag, but the \nprinciples in that Constitution and that Bill of Rights--principles of \nfreedom, opportunity, and liberty. I believe these principles, as much \nas our Nation's cherished symbols, frame our history and define our \nNation. As dearly as we hold the flag, we must hold these principles at \nleast as dearly.\n  Yes, there have been some handfuls of sociopaths who burn our flag to \nthrust a firebrand in our eye. The question before us today is: Will \nthe misguided actions of these few misfits cause us to curtail our \nfundamental principles of freedom?\n  We would only grant them victory if we allow their despicable acts to \ngoad us into desecrating the greatest protection of individual rights \nin human history--our Bill of Rights. As Senator Bob Kerrey has said:\n\n       Patriotism calls upon us to be brave enough to endure and \n     withstand such an act--to tolerate the intolerable.\n\n  Let us show our strength, by not rising to the bait. Let us show our \nbravery, by not giving the flag burners what they want. Let us show our \nfaith in the strength of this country and its institutions, by not \nlashing out in anger at those who would defile our flag.\n  The costs of this amendment would exact a far too great a price to \npay. This amendment, if adopted, would criminalize the very acts that \nthe Supreme Court has held to be protected by the first amendment. This \namendment would clearly and intentionally erode the Bill of Rights.\n  This amendment would have an unprecedented, direct, and adverse \neffect on the freedoms embodies in the Bill of Rights. For the first \ntime in our history, this amendment would employ the Constitution and \nthe Bill of Rights--both premised on the idea of limiting the \nGovernment--to limit individual rights, and, in particular, the freedom \nof speech.\n  Our former colleague, Senator John Glenn, said it very well last \nyear. He said:\n\n       Our revered symbol stands for freedom, but is not freedom \n     itself. We must not let those who revile our way of life \n     trick us into diminishing our great gift or even take a \n     chance of diminishing our freedoms.\n\n  I am very proud to attempt to carry on John Glenn's fight against \nthis ill-advised amendment. The Bill of Rights is too fundamental to \nour history, too important to our people, and too necessary to our \nfuture, for us to do anything else.\n  Honoring the flag demands that we also question the vagueness of the \nlanguage of the amendment. Our Constitution Subcommittee heard \ntestimony that the term ``flag of the United States,'' as used in this \namendment, is ``problematic'' and so ``riddled with ambiguity'' as to \n``war with the due process norm that the law should warn before it \nstrikes.'' Even supporters of the amendment, including former Attorney \nGeneral William Barr, have acknowledged that the term ``flag'' could \nmean any of a number of different things. No one can assure us as to \nwhat the term ``flag'' will mean other than to suggest it will be up to \nthe governments of particular jurisdictions.\n  How would the amendment affect flags on T-shirts? How would the \namendment affect flags on scarfs? In the memorable example given by the \nlate and revered Senator John Chafee last year, How would the amendment \naffect a handmade flag rug?\n  Now the amendment, of course, does not make anything illegal by \nitself. It simply gives the Congress the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag. But the question is still a powerful one. We \nmust still ask: What kind of statute would this amendment insulate from \nconstitutional attack?\n  Would this amendment permit Congress to enact a statute that would \ncriminalize wearing a T-shirt with a flag on it? Or could Congress \ncriminalize tearing such a T-shirt?\n  Would the amendment permit Congress to criminalize wearing a scarf \nwith a flag on it? Or could Congress criminalize spitting on such a \nscarf?\n  Would this amendment permit Congress to criminalize making a rug with \na flag on it? Or could Congress criminalize stepping on such a rug?\n  More generally, would the amendment allow Congress to enact statutes \nthat permit the prosecution of people based on the views they express \nwhen they defile the flag? Consider two cases: In case one, a person \nsmears blood on a flag while screaming protest of U.S. involvement in a \nforeign war. In case two, another person drips blood on a flag after \nsuffering an injury at a summertime football game. After adoption of \nthis amendment, would it be constitutional to prosecute the one who \nspoke and not prosecute the other, who did the same thing without \nspeaking?\n  Here's another example. My colleagues may remember the very exciting \nvictory of the U.S. Women's Soccer team in the Women's World Cup last \nyear. A thrilling moment for sure, and tens of thousands of very \npatriotic Americans cheered the heroic deeds of the women who \nrepresented our country.\n  That evening, another soccer game was played here in Washington, DC, \ninvolving this city's major league soccer team, D.C. United. Many of \nthe same fans who cheered the U.S. women that afternoon turned out to \nwatch the D.C. United soccer team. Some of those fans, seeking to play \nfor the TV cameras and their fellow fans brought a prop, which they \nunfurled during the game. Here is a picture of it. As you can see, it \nis an actual flag. It is not a representation or a picture. It is an \nactual flag of the United States with the words ``Thanks Girls!'' \nwritten on it with some type of chalk or marker.\n  Obviously the people who defaced this flag intended no disrespect to \nthe United States or the flag. They were excited soccer fans, and \nprobably very patriotic Americans. I wonder if the sponsors of this \namendment can be sure of the answer to this question: Would the statute \nthat Congress passes to prohibit flag desecration after this \nconstitutional amendment is ratified allow for these people to be \nprosecuted? I think it is a fair question.\n  I think most of us would hope not. But how would the police or the \nprosecutors make that decision? If they look at the message and the \nbeliefs of the people who have written on the flag, isn't that exactly \nthe kind of content discrimination that the first amendment is designed \nto prohibit? Do we really want the government examining the motives of \nthose who deface the flag to see if they are patriotic or well meaning \nenough to avoid discrimination?\n  I don't think so. I think that is what the first amendment is all \nabout: to protect against Government inquiry into a citizen's political \nbeliefs. On the other hand, if we have a completely content-neutral \nstatute and enforcement that does not look at the motives of those who \ndeface the flag, we might\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\nend up prosecuting the excited and patriotic soccer fans shown in this \nposter. Obviously, I don't think we want that either.\n  So this example really shows the difficulties with outlawing \ndesecration of the flag. People in this country use the flag to express \njoy and patriotism as well as opposition to the Government. And the \ntraditions of our country, our respect for free political expression, \ndemands that we not criminalize conduct that we would otherwise accept \nif it were motivated by patriotism instead of political dissent.\n  Some people call these kinds of examples ``wacky hypotheticals.'' But \nwe do not have reliable answers to these questions. And when you are \ntalking about amending the Constitution, you have a duty to consider \nand address hypotheticals. After all, it is not easy to correct a \nmistaken Constitution. We cannot just, by unanimous consent, pass a \ntechnical corrections bill to fix an unintended consequence of a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Let me share another case that I witnessed not far from this Senate \nChamber. I was eating dinner at the restaurant called ``America'' over \nin Union Station. We noticed that the menu is colored like a giant \nAmerican flag. We talked about having to be careful not to spill \nanything on it and how damaging our menu might be a crime under this \namendment. Then we forgot about it and returned to our meal. But just a \nhalf hour later, there was a big commotion in the corner of the \nrestaurant, and we turned to see a woman frantically trying to put out \na fire that had started when her oversized American flag menu had \ngotten too close to the small candles on the table.\n  Now I hope that that woman was not engaged in an angry argument over \nthe Government. But I suppose that is something that the police might \nhave to investigate if this amendment and a statute that it authorized \nbecame law. Don't the police have more important things to investigate \nthan whether the burning of a menu might violate the Constitution?\n  Some have been misled into believing that one can pull a flag off a \nbuilding, burn it, and be protected by the Constitution. That is simply \nnot true. There are many laws in effect today that prohibit theft, the \ndestruction of federal property, or disturbing the peace. These can and \nshould be used to address the majority of flag burning incidents.\n  Honoring the flag demands that we listen, as many on both sides of \nthis debate have, to the true American war heroes who have testified to \nus on this issue. It was particularly inspiring to welcome John Glenn \nback to the Senate last year. The perspectives of the witnesses before \nthe Judiciary Committee last year were of particular interest to me \nbecause they represented the diversity of views on this amendment by \nthe American people, by veterans, and by war heroes. Those who fought \nand sacrificed for our country and its flag deserve our utmost respect \nwhen it comes to this flag amendment. They know well the costs of \nfreedom and democracy, as well as the joys. Some would portray the \nviews of veterans as monolithic, but, as our hearings showed quite \nplainly: They are not.\n  Those many veterans who oppose this amendment do so with conviction \nand power and strength. They know that no one can question their \npatriotism or love of country. Listen to the words of Professor Gary \nMay of the University of Southern Indiana, who lost both his legs in \nthe Vietnam war, and who testified before the Judiciary Committee last \nyear. Professor May said:\n\n       Freedom is what makes the United States of America strong \n     and great, and freedom, including the right to dissent, is \n     what has kept our democracy going for more than 200 years. \n     And it is freedom that will continue to keep it strong for my \n     children and the children of all the people like my father, \n     late father in law, grandfather, brother, me, and others like \n     us who served honorably and proudly for freedom.\n       The pride and honor we feel is not in the flag per se. It's \n     in the principles that it stands for and the people who have \n     defended them. My pride and admiration is in our country, its \n     people and its fundamental principles. I am grateful for the \n     many heroes of our country--and especially those in my \n     family. All the sacrifices of those who went before me would \n     be for naught, if an amendment were added to the Constitution \n     that cut back on our first amendment rights for the first \n     time in the history of our great Nation.\n\n  The late Senator John Chafee, who as all will recall also served \nbravely at Guadalcanal and in the Korean war, last year said simply: \n``[W]e cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact, . . . \ntaking steps to require citizens to respect the flag, sullies its \nsignificance and symbolism.'' Senator Chafee's words still bring a \nbrisk, cool wind of caution. What kind of symbol of freedom and liberty \nwill our flag be if it has to be protected from protesters by a \nconstitutional amendment?\n  My friend and constituent Keith Kruel, a World War II veteran and \npast National Commander of the American Legion, addressed this point \nquite well in testimony he submitted for the Judiciary Committee last \nyear. He said:\n\n       Freely displayed, our flag can be protected only by us, the \n     people. Each citizen can gaze upon it, and it can mean what \n     our heartfelt patriotic beliefs tell us individually. \n     Government ``protection'' of a Nation's banner only invites \n     scorn upon it. A patriot cannot be created by legislation. \n     Patriotism must be nurtured in the family and educational \n     process. It must come from the heartfelt emotion of true \n     beliefs, credos and tenets.\n\n  Senator Bob Kerrey, who is in the Chamber at this time, the only \nCongressional Medal of Honor winner to serve in the Senate in this \ncentury, spoke directly to the point when he said: ``Real patriotism \ncannot be coerced. It must be a voluntary, unselfish, brave act to \nsacrifice for others.'' I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feingold for his \nstatement. I will be relatively brief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if other Senators aren't here, Senator \nKennedy be allowed to speak after myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor not the first time \nto announce my opposition to this proposed constitutional amendment, \ngiving power to the Congress and the States to prohibit physical \ndesecration of the flag of the United States.\n  I wish to speak about this a little bit more personally because I \nthink all of us come to our point based upon real-life experience. My \nfather was a Jewish immigrant born in the Ukraine and who fled \npersecution from Russia. My mother's family came from the Ukraine as \nwell. As a first generation American on my father's side, I revere the \nflag and I am fiercely patriotic. I love to see the flag flying over \nthe Capitol. I love to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. I \nthink it is a beautiful, powerful symbol of American democracy.\n  What I learned from my parents more than anything else, and from my \nown family experience as the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled czarist \nRussia, is that my father came to the United States because of the \nfreedom--the freedom we have as American citizens to express our views \nopenly, without fear of punishment.\n  I am deeply impressed with the sincerity of those who, including \nSenator Hatch, favor this constitutional amendment. I am impressed with \nthe sacrifice and patriotism of those veterans who support this \nconstitutional amendment. I think in the veterans community there \ncertainly are differences of opinion. I do not question their sincerity \nor commitment at all.\n  It is with a great deal of respect for those with whom I disagree, \nincluding some members of the American Legion, that I oppose this \namendment. I oppose it because, to me, it is ultimately the freedom \nthat matters the most. To me, the soul of the flag, as opposed to the \nphysical part of the flag, is the freedom that it stands for, the \nfreedom that my parents talked about with me, the freedom that all of \nus have to speak up. I do not want to amend the Bill of Rights for the \nfirst time in its 209 years of existence. I don't want to amend the \nfirst amendment, the founding principle of freedom of speech from which \nall other freedoms follow.\n  I want to very briefly read from some of what our Justices have had \nto say because I think they say it with more eloquence than I could. In \nTexas v. Johnson, an opinion written by Justice Brennan, joined by \nJustices Marshall, Blackmun, Scalia, and Kennedy--and I note this is a \ndiverse group of judges we are talking about--they said:\n\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\n\n     If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First \n     Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the \n     expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea \n     itself offensive or disagreeable. . . . The way to preserve \n     the flag's special role is not to punish those who feel \n     differently about these matters. It is to persuade them that \n     they are wrong. . . . We do not consecrate the flag by \n     punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the \n     freedom that this cherished emblem represents.\n\n  If freedom of speech means anything, I think it means protecting all \nspeech, even that speech which outrages us. I have no use for those who \ndesecrate the flag. Speech that enjoys widespread support doesn't need \nany protection. As the great Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out, \nfreedom of speech is not needed for popular speech, but instead it is \nfor the thought that we hate, the expression threatened with censorship \nor punishment.\n\n  I quote from General Powell's letter. He has been quoted several \ntimes, but it is too eloquent to pass up:\n\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration. . . . I would not amend that \n     great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The \n     flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk \n     away.\n\n  Our late and dear friend and colleague, Senator Chafee, who was a \nhighly decorated soldier in two wars wrote:\n\n       We cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact, \n     in my view, taking steps to require citizens to respect the \n     flag sullies its significance and its symbolism.\n\n  Finally, my colleague from Wisconsin mentioned Senator Glenn, another \nreal American hero. Senator Glenn said:\n\n       Without a doubt, the most important of those values, rights \n     and principles is individual liberty: the liberty to worship, \n     to think, to express ourselves freely, openly and completely, \n     no matter how out of step these views may be with the \n     opinions of the majority.\n\n  That is the first part of my presentation--just to say that I love \nthis flag. I think when you have the family background I have, you are \nfiercely patriotic. I love this country. My mother and father are no \nlonger alive, but I still think they know I am a Senator. They weren't \nalive when I was elected. It would mean everything in the world to \nthem. But, to me, the real soul of the flag, going beyond the physical \npresence of the flag, is the freedom that the flag stands for. I don't \nthink we should give up on that freedom. I don't think we should amend \nthe first amendment to the Constitution. I think it would be a profound \nmistake. I say that out of respect for those who disagree with me in \nthe Senate. I say it out of respect for those in the veterans community \nwho disagree with me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, once again we are debating whether to \namend the Constitution to prohibit flag burning. Flag burning is a vile \nand contemptuous act, but it is also a form of expression protected by \nthe first amendment. Surely we are not so insecure in our commitment to \nfreedom of speech and the first amendment that we are willing to start \ncarving loopholes now in that majestic language.\n  I strongly oppose the constitutional amendment we are debating today. \nThe first amendment is one of the great pillars of our freedom and \ndemocracy. It has never been amended in over 200 years of our history, \nand now is no time to start. There is not even a plausible factual \nbasis for carving a hole in the heart of the first amendment. There is \nno significant problem.\n  Flag burning is exceedingly rare. Published reports indicate that \nfewer than 10 flag burning incidents have occurred a year since the \nSupreme Court's decision in Texas v. Johnson in 1989 on the first \namendment. Over the last 5 years, there was only one such incident in \nMassachusetts. This is hardly the kind of serious and widespread \nproblem in American life that warrants an assault on the first \namendment. Surely there is no clear and present danger that warrants \nsuch a change. This proposal fails the reality test.\n\n  The Constitution is not a billboard on which to plaster amendments as \nif they were bumper sticker slogans. In this Congress alone, over a \ndozen constitutional amendments have been introduced. With every new \nproposed amendment, we undermine and trivialize the Constitution and \nthreaten to weaken its enduring strength.\n  I remember listening to a speech given by Justice Douglas, one of the \ngreat Supreme Court Justices of this century. Students asked him: What \nwas the most important export of the United States? He said, without \nhesitation: The first amendment because it is the defining amendment \nfor the preservation of free speech as the basic and fundamental right \nin shaping our Nation.\n  Clearly, it would be a mistake of historic proportions for this \nCongress to make the first alteration to the first amendment in more \nthan two centuries. The first amendment breathes light into the very \nconcept of our democracy. It protects the freedoms of all Americans, \nincluding the fundamental freedom of citizens to criticize their \ngovernment and the country itself, including the flag.\n  As the Supreme Court explained in Texas v. Johnson, it is a bedrock \nprinciple underlying the first amendment that the Government may not \nprohibit the expression of an idea simply because the society finds the \nidea itself offensive and disagreeable.\n  No one in the Senate condones the act of flag burning. We all condemn \nit. The flag is a symbol that embodies all that is great and good about \nAmerica. It symbolizes our patriotism, our achievements, and, above \nall, our respect for our freedoms and our democracy. We do not honor \nthe flag by dishonoring the first amendment.\n  Gen. Colin Powell agrees with our opposition to this proposed \namendment. He has told us in reaching this decision he was inspired by \nthe words of James Warner, a former marine aviator, who was a prisoner \nin North Vietnam between 1967 and 1973. As James Warner wrote in 1989: \nIt hurts to see the flag being burned, but I part company with those \nwho want to punish the flag burners. In one interrogation, I was shown \na photograph of American protesters burning a flag. There, the officer \nsaid: People in your country protest against your cause. That proves \nyou are wrong. No, I said, that proves that I am right. In my country \nwe are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people disagree \nwith us.\n  The officer was on his feet in an instant, his face purple with rage. \nHe smashed his fist onto the table and screamed at me to shut up. While \nhe was ranting, I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in \nhis eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten the \nsatisfaction I felt in using his tool, the picture of the burning flag, \nagainst him.\n  That says it all. We respect the flag the most, we protect it the \nbest, and the flag itself flies the highest when we honor the freedom \nfor which it stands.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this misguided constitutional \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at least the Senator is consistent because \nhe opposes both the McConnell amendment and the flag amendment.\n  Having made that point, of the 36 Senators who voted for the \nMcConnell ``statutory fix,'' shall we call the proposal, 30 are \nopponents of the flag-protection amendment. These 30 Senators \napparently believe that some flag desecration should be prohibited. \nVoting for McConnell makes their first amendment arguments a mockery.\n  At least the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is consistent, \nbecause the McConnell amendment says, one, that flag desecration on \nFederal land with a stolen flag should be prohibited; two, damaging a \nflag belonging to the United States will be prohibited; or three, \ndesecrating a flag intending to promote violence should be prohibited.\n  It reminds me of 1989 when a high percentage of Senators in this \nbody, who claim to be against the constitutional amendment to prohibit \ndesecration of our beloved flag, voted for the statutory anti-flag-\ndesecration amendment.\n  If first amendment rights hold with regard to this constitutional \namendment, that it would violate first amendment rights, then why \nwouldn't it have violated first amendment rights with regard to any \nstatute that would prohibit desecration?\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\n  I think anyone can see the game that is going on; that is, that some \nof the folks wouldn't vote to protect the flag no matter what happens \nbecause they know the flag desecration amendment or a statutory \namendment is not going to protect our flag because it will be stricken \ndown as unconstitutional. I predicted it in both cases where the \nSupreme Court has stricken it down.\n  If one agrees that flag desecration is wrong, why limit it to these \ncircumstances provided in the McConnell amendment? Why should it be \nlegal to burn a flag in front of a crowd who loves flag desecration, or \non television where people are at a safe distance, yet make it illegal \nto burn a flag in front of people who would be upset by that act? Why \nmake it illegal to burn a Post Office flag but not a flag belonging to \na hospital across the street? Why make it illegal for a lone camper to \nburn a flag in a campfire at a Yellowstone park, when it is legal to \nburn a flag before hundreds of children at a public school under \ncurrent law?\n  To anyone interested in protecting the flag, these distinctions make \nno sense. That is what is amazing to me. There is such inconsistency. I \npersonally believe that it is the elitist position that calls the 80 \npercent of Americans who believe we should sustain the dignity of our \nflag, of our national symbol, that we are somehow Neanderthals, the 80 \npercent of the people in this country who want to protect our national \nsymbol from acts of physical desecration.\n  The funny thing about it, this amendment does not even do that. All \nthis amendment does is restore the power to the Congress of the United \nStates to be able to pass a statute if the Congress so chooses, \nsomething that we have to do by constitutional amendment if we want to \nbe coequal with the judicial branch of Government.\n  Opponents of the constitutional amendment argue that this would be an \nunprecedented infringement on the freedom of speech, which does not \nsatisfy James Madison's counsel that amendments of the Constitution \nshould be limited to ``certain great and extraordinary circumstances.'' \nSetting aside the fact that flag desecration is conduct, not speech, \nand that our freedom of speech is not absolute, these critics never \nfully address the fact that our Founding Fathers, James Madison in \nparticular, saw protection of the flag as falling outside the scope of \nthe first amendment and was more a matter of protecting national \nsovereignty. The original intent of the Nation's founders indicates the \nimportance of protecting the flag as an symbol of American sovereignty. \nMadison and Jefferson consistently emphasized the legal significance of \ninfractions on the physical integrity of the flag.\n\n  For example, one of Madison's earliest pronouncements concerned an \nincident in October 1800 when an Algerian ship forced a U.S. man of \nwar--the George Washington--to haul down its flag and replace it with \nthe flag from Algiers. As Secretary of State under Thomas Jefferson, \nMadison pronounced such a situation as a matter of international law, a \ndire invasion of sovereignty which ``on a fit occasion'' might be \n``revised.''\n  Madison continued his defense of the integrity of the flag when he \npronounced an active flag defacement in the streets of an American city \nto be a violation of law. On June 22, 1807, when a British ship fired \nupon and ordered the lowering of an American frigate's flag, Madison \ntold the British Ambassador ``that the attack . . . was a detached, \nflagrant insult to the flag and sovereignty of the United States.'' \nMadison believed that ``the indignity offered to the sovereignty and \nflag of the Nation demands. . .an honorable reparation.'' Madison's \nstatements suggests his belief that protecting the physical integrity \nof the flag ensured the protections of the Nation's sovereignty.\n  This is the author of the Constitution. We have these people \ninconsistently voting for statutes--twice in the last 11 years--that \nare unconstitutional, that would, I suppose if you take their arguments \non the floor, denigrate the first amendment to the Constitution. If \nthis constitutional amendment is denigrating it, why isn't the statute \nthey voted for denigrating it as well?\n  Madison did not conclude, as some defenders of the right to deface \nthe flag contend, that the first amendment protected the rights of \nAmericans to tear down a flag or that defacing the flag was a form of \nexpression protected by the first amendment. On the contrary. It would \nappear that Madison had an intimate familiarity with the significance \nof protecting the physical integrity of the flag, especially as such \nprotection related to the first amendment, which he helped draft and \nmove through the First Congress. He knew there had been no intent to \nwithdraw the traditional physical protection from the flag.\n  Madison and Jefferson intended for the Government to be able to \nprotect the flag consistent with the Bill of Rights. This was based on \ntheir belief that obtaining sovereign treatment was distinct from an \ninterest in protecting against the suppression of expression. Madison \nand Jefferson consistently demonstrated that they sought commerce, \ncitizenship, and neutrality rights through the protection of the flag. \nThey did not seek to suppress the expression of alternative ``ideas,'' \n``messages,'' ``views,'' or ``meanings.''\n  Although it is commonly asserted that Congress has never sent an \namendment to the States to amend the Bill of Rights, this assertion is \nabsolutely false. Even if you assume this amendment would lead to a \nviolation of first amendment rights, it is absolutely false to think \nthe Congress has never sent an amendment to the States to amend the \nBill of Rights. Yet the Bill of Rights has been amended in some form on \nseveral occasions. For example, the 13th amendment amended the 5th \namendment as interpreted in Dred Scott v. Sanford, to provide that the \nformer slaves were not property subject to the due process clause, but \nwere free men and women.\n  Further, the 14th amendment was interpreted in Bolling versus Sharpe, \nto have effectively amended the due process clause of the 5th amendment \nto apply equal protection principles to the Federal Government.\n  Moreover, in Engel versus Vitale, the Supreme Court circumscribed the \n1st amendment rights of American school children by holding that the \nestablishment clause precluded prayer in the public schools.\n  Each of these constitutional changes substantially modified the \nrights and correlative duties of affected parties from those originally \nenvisioned by the Framers of the Bill of Rights. The change effected by \nthe Engel versus Vitale decision did not expand rights, but restricted \nthem by taking away the right of children to pray at school.\n  Further, there have always been numerous limits on free speech. We \nlimit libelous and defamatory speech. We limit speech that constitutes \n``fighting words.'' We limit speech that consists of falsely shouting \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. We limit speech that is obscene. We \nlimit speech that jeopardizes national security. And each of these \nlimits balances an important governmental interest in protecting \nagainst an individual's right to engage in radical or dangerous speech.\n  Thus, the Bill of Rights has been amended numerous times and has \nconsistently been interpreted to include limits on speech. The long \nlegal tradition of accepting regulation of physically destructive \nconduct toward the flag is consistent with these limits that balance \nsociety's interest in promoting respect for the nation with an \nindividual's interest in sending a particular message by means of \ndesecrating our beloved flag. The proposed amendment would effect a \nmuch smaller change than the other amendments listed and a much \nnarrower limit on speech than the other limits mentioned. The amendment \nwould simply restore the traditional right of the people to protect the \nphysical integrity of their flag, something that existed 200 years \nbefore the Supreme Court struck it down. Protestors would still be free \nto speak their opinions about the flag at a rally, write their opinions \nabout the flag to their newspaper, and vote their opinions at the \nballot box.\n  Most of the American people, men and women, black, brown, and white, \nsupport the flag protection amendment and 49 State legislatures have \nasked for the flag protection amendment. Accordingly, I believe we \nshould send the flag protection amendment to the States for \nratification.\n  The argument that we have never amended the Bill of Rights or limited\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nspeech is absurd; it is false, and, in any event, the flag protection \namendment would change only the results of a few recent court decisions \nto restore the true meaning of the Bill of Rights as ratified by our \nforefathers.\n  This proposed amendment recognizes and ratifies our Founding Fathers' \nview--and the constitutional law that existed for nearly 200 years--\nthat the American flag is an important and unique incident or symbol of \nour national sovereignty. As Americans, we display the flag in order to \nsignify national ownership and protection. The Founding Fathers made \nclear that the flag, and its physical requirements, related to the \nexistence and sovereignty of the United States and that desecration of \nthe flag were matters of national concern that warranted government \naction.\n  This same sovereignty interest does not exist for our national \nmonuments or our other symbols. While they are important to us all, the \nflag is unique. It is flown over our ships and national buildings. We \ntook the flag to, and planted it for eternity, on the Moon. We carry it \ninto battle. We salute it and pledge allegiance to it. Men and women \nhave died for it and have been tortured for their fidelity to it.\n  Senator McCain, in appearing before our committee, told of one of the \nexperiences he had when he was in the Hanoi prison with others of our \nmen. He said there was a young man who literally could not afford \nshoes. He had no shoes until he was 13 years of age. He was raised in \npoverty. But when he joined the military, he stood out as a really fine \nhuman being, and ultimately he went to officer's candidate school.\n  Flying over Vietnam, he was shot down. When he arrived in the Hanoi \nprison, if I recall it correctly, he took a bamboo needle and he \nknitted together little bits of cloth to make an American flag, and he \nput it inside his shirt. Every night, he would bring out that flag and \nput it on the wall, and they would all salute and pledge allegiance to \nit. It was one of the things that kept them from going insane.\n  One day his captors found him with that flag and took him outside and \nbeat him within an inch of his life. Of course, they took his flag from \nhim. Then they tossed his broken and bleeding body inside the compound \nwhich had a concrete slab in the middle. Senator McCain may tell this \nstory because he can tell it better than I can having been there. I \nthink it is worthwhile to retell it.\n  Senator McCain said they picked him up and cleaned him up as best \nthey could in those very tragic circumstances. He was all black and \nblue with his eyes shut from having been beaten. They had incandescent \nlight bulbs on all day long, every day, and all night long, every \nnight. As they all went to sleep, suddenly Senator McCain looked up and \nhere was this young military man sitting there with another bamboo \nneedle getting little bits of cloth to make another American flag.\n  To be honest with you, that flag meant an awful lot to those people \nwho were under those very terrible circumstances. It means a lot to me.\n  Opponents of this proposed constitutional amendment argue this would \nbe an unprecedented infringement on the freedom of speech which does \nnot satisfy James Madison's counsel that amendments to the Constitution \nshould be limited to ``certain great and extraordinary circumstances.''\n  Setting aside the fact that flag desecration is conduct not speech \nand that our freedom of speech is not absolute, what these critics \nnever fully address is the fact that our Founding Fathers, James \nMadison in particular, saw protection of the flag as falling outside \nthe scope of the first amendment and was more a matter of protecting \nnational sovereignty. The original intent of the Nation's founders \nindicates the importance of protecting the flag as an incident of \nAmerican sovereignty. Madison and others did that.\n  We took this flag, as I said, and planted it for eternity on the \nMoon. We carry it into battle. We salute it and pledge allegiance to \nit. Men and women have died for it and have been tortured for their \nfidelity to it. As Americans we recognize and believe that the flag is \nour unique symbol of unity and sovereignty. As Madison noted, the flag \nis a unique incident which, when desecrated, ``demands an honorable \nreparation.''\n\n  That was how we viewed it--as a people, as a nation--until 1989 when \nthe Court handed down its 5-4 decision in the Johnson case. Are we \nreally going to stand here on the floor of the Senate and pretend that \nthe law never was as it was? Does anyone here believe that two narrow \nSupreme Court decisions should settle whether we as a nation should and \ncan safeguard our symbol of sovereignty?\n  There are opponents to S.J. Res. 14 who argue that our flag--this \nincident of sovereignty--is not important enough to amend the \nConstitution; that amending the Constitution requires a ``great and \nextraordinary occasion.'' Tell that to the young man in Vietnam. For \nreasons I have stated, the Supreme Court's decisions in the Johnson and \nEichman cases--decisions which overturned centuries of law and \npractice--more than meets Senator Leahy's test. Senator Kerrey's test, \nand others. It certainly meets it more than the 27th amendment which \ndealt with pay raises for members of Congress or the 16th amendment \nwhich gave Congress the power to impose an income tax. I can understand \nwhy some in Congress would view the 16th amendment as one of Congress' \nfinest moments, not that I ever have. In fact, my State of Utah was one \nof only three States to reject the 16th amendment.\n  The flag amendment presents this Congress with an opportunity to do \nsomething great and extraordinary. It is anything but an abdication of \nresponsibility. Indeed, one could argue that, failure to vote for this \namendment is an abdication of our responsibility and that restoring the \npower of Congress the power to prohibit acts of desecration against our \nsymbol of national sovereignty would be a great and extraordinary \noccasion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Ten years ago the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision \nstruck down a Texas flag protection statute on the grounds that burning \nan American flag was ``speech'' and therefore protected under the First \nAmendment of the Constitution. I disagreed with the Court's decision \nthen and I still do. I don't believe that the act of desecrating a flag \nis an act of speech. I believe that our flag, as our national symbol, \ncan and should be protected by law.\n  In the intervening years since the Supreme Court decision I have \ntwice supported federal legislation that would make flag desecration \nillegal, and on two occasions I voted against amendments to the \nConstitution to do the same. I voted that way because, while I believe \nthat flag desecration is despicable conduct that should be prohibited \nby law, I also believe that amending our Constitution is a step that \nshould be taken only rarely and then only as a last resort.\n  In the past year I have once again reviewed in detail nearly all of \nthe legal opinions and written materials published by Constitutional \nscholars and courts on all sides of this issue. I pledged to the \nsupporters of the Constitutional amendment that I would re-evaluate \nwhether a Constitutional amendment is necessary to resolve this issue.\n  From my review I have concluded that there remains a way to protect \nour flag without having to alter the Constitution of the United States. \nI joined Senators Bennett, McConnell and Conrad today to introduce \nlegislation that I believe accomplishes that goal.\n  The bill we offered today protects the flag but does so without \naltering the Constitution and a number of respected Constitutional \nscholars tell us they believe this type of statute will be upheld by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. This statute protects the flag by criminalizing \nflag desecration when the purpose is, and the person doing it knows, it \nis likely to lead to violence.\n  Supporters of a Constitutional amendment are disappointed I know by \nmy decision to support a statutory remedy to protect the flag rather \nthan support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I know they are \nimpatient to correct a decision by the Supreme Court that they and I \nbelieve was wrong. I have wrestled with this issue for so long and I \nwish I were not, with my decision, disappointing those, including many \nof my friends, who passionately believe that we must amend the \nConstitution to protect the flag.\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\n  But in the end I know that our country will be better served \nreserving our attempts to alter the Constitution only for those things \nthat are ``extraordinary occasions'' as outlined by President James \nMadison, one of the authors of the Constitution, and only in \ncircumstances when it is the only remedy for something that must be \ndone.\n  More than 11,000 Constitutional amendments have been proposed since \nour Constitution was ratified. However, since the ratification of the \nBill of Rights in 1791 only 17 amendments have been enacted. These 17 \ninclude three reconstruction era amendments that abolished slavery, and \ngave African-Americans the right to vote. The amendments included \ngiving women the right to vote, limiting Presidents to two terms, and \nestablishing an order of succession in case of a President's death or \ndeparture from office. The last time Congress considered and passed a \nnew Constitutional amendment was when it changed the voting age to 18, \nmore than a quarter of a century ago. All of these matters were of such \nscope they required a Constitutional amendment to be accomplished.\n  However, protecting the American flag can be accomplished without \namending the Constitution, and that is a critically important point.\n  Constitutional scholars, including those at the Congressional \nResearch Service, the research arm of Congress, and Duke University's \nProfessor William Alstyne, have concluded that this statute passes \nConstitutional muster, because it recognizes that the same standard \nthat already applies to other forms of speech applies to burning the \nflag as well. This is the same standard which makes it illegal to \nfalsely cry ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Reckless speech that is \nlikely to cause violence is not protected under the ``fighting words'' \nstandard, long recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I believe that future generations--and our founding fathers--would \nagree that it's worth the effort for us to find a way to protect our \nflag without having to wonder about the unintended consequences of \naltering our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. \n14, a proposed constitutional amendment to protect our national flag \nfrom physical desecration.\n  S.J. Res. 14 would give Congress, and Congress alone, the authority \nto draft a statute to protect the flag. It would give Congress the \nopportunity to construct, deliberately and carefully, precise statutory \nlanguage that clearly defines the contours of prohibitive conduct.\n  At the outset, let me say that amending the Constitution is serious \nbusiness, indeed. I know that, and I know we need to tread carefully. \nThe Constitution is, after all, democracy's sacred text. But the \nConstitution is also a living text. As originally conceived, it had no \nBill of Rights. In all, it has been amended 27 times.\n  If the Constitution is democracy's sacred text, then the flag is our \nsacred symbol. In the words of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, \nit is ``a symbol of our freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious \ntolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our \naspirations.'' [dissenting opinion in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 437 \n(1989)]\n  If the flag had no symbolic value, we would not get chills when we \nsee it lowered to half-mast or draped on a coffin. We wouldn't feel so \nmuch pride when we see it flying in front of our homes or at our \nembassies abroad. I wonder, is there any of us who can forget that \nwonderful Joe Rosenthal photograph of the six Marines hoisting that \nflag on the barren crag of Mount Suribachi, after the carnage at Iwo \nJima, where over 6,800 American soldiers were killed. There have been \nmany photographs of soldiers. There has been no photograph I know of \nthat so endures in our mind's eye, that has carried so much symbolism, \nas that one. I remember seeing it because the San Francisco Chronicle \nran it on the front page during World War II. I was just a small child, \nbut from that point on, I knew the flag was something special.\n\n  People speak metaphorically about the fabric of our society and how \nit has become frayed. I submit that in a very real sense, our flag is \nthe physical fabric of our society, knitting together disparate peoples \nfrom distant lands, uniting us in a common bond, not just of individual \nliberty but also of responsibility to one another. As such, the flag is \nmore precious to us, perhaps, than we may even know.\n  The flag flies over government buildings throughout the country. It \nflies over our embassies abroad, a silent but strong reminder that when \nin those buildings, one is on American soil and afforded all the \nprotections and liberties enjoyed back home.\n  Constitutional scholars as diverse as Chief Justices William \nRehnquist and Earl Warren and Associate Justices Stevens and Hugo Black \nhave vouched for the unique status of the national flag. In 1974, Byron \nWhite said:\n\n       It is well within the powers of Congress to adopt and \n     prescribe a national flag and to protect the unity of that \n     flag. . . [T]he flag is an important symbol of nationhood and \n     unity, created by the Nation and endowed with certain \n     attributes.'' [Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. at 585-87 (1974)]\n\n  Justice White continued, ``[T]here would seem to be little question \nabout the power of Congress to forbid the mutilation of the Lincoln \nMemorial or to prevent overlaying it with words or other objects. The \nflag is itself a monument, subject to similar protection.''\n  I could not agree more with the opinion of Justice White: ``The flag \nis itself a monument, subject to similar protection.'' Since that time, \nunfortunately, a narrow majority of the Supreme Court has now ruled \ntwice that this great symbol of our national unity is not protected \nunder the Constitution. So that is why we are here today, to begin the \nprocess of protecting the flag, which is a symbol of all the \nprotections we are afforded as Americans and all the liberties we \nenjoy.\n  The flag flying over our Capitol Building today, the flag flying over \nmy home in San Francisco, each of these flags, separated by distance \nbut not in symbolic value, is its own monument to everything America \nrepresents. It should be protected as such.\n  Our history books are replete with stories of American soldiers who \nwere charged with the responsibility of leading their units into battle \nby carrying our Nation's flag. To them, it was more than a task, it was \nan honor worth dying for, and many did. When one soldier would fall, \nanother would take his place, raise the flag, and press forward. They \nwould not fail. Their mission was too important, the honor too great, \nflag and country too respected to give anything short of the last full \nmeasure of their devotion, their lives, to succeed.\n  The American flag is a revered object as well as a national symbol. \nIndeed, it is our monument in cloth. I believe it should be viewed as \nsuch, and not simply as something that serves as one of many vehicles \nfor free speech.\n  Everything about the flag--its tangible form, its very fabric--has \nsignificance. The shape, the colors, the dimensions, and the \narrangement of the pattern help make the flag what it is. The colors \nwere chosen at the Second Continental Congress in 1777. We all know \nthem well: Red for heartiness and courage; white for purity and \ninnocence; blue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice.\n\n  Moreover, our flag is recognized as unique not only in the hearts and \nminds of Americans but in our laws and customs as well. No other emblem \nor symbol in our Nation carries with it such a specific code of conduct \nand protocol in its display and handling.\n  For example, Federal law specifically prescribes that the flag should \nnever be displayed with its union down, except as a signal of dire \ndistress or in instances of extreme danger to life or property. When a \nflag is flown upside down, it is in fact a signal of distress.\n  The U.S. flag should never touch anything beneath it: neither ground, \nfloor, water, or merchandise. The U.S. flag should never be dipped to \nany person or thing. And the flag should never be carried horizontally \nbut should always be carried aloft and free.\n  Why, then, should it be permissible conduct to burn, to desecrate, to \ndestroy this symbol, this emblem, this national monument? That is not \nmy definition of free speech.\n  For the first two centuries of this Nation's history, that was not \nthe Supreme Court's definition of free speech\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\neither. In fact, until the Court's 1989 decision in Texas v. Johnson, \n48 of the 50 States had laws preventing burning or otherwise defacing \nour flag.\n  As I said at the outset, I don't take amending the Constitution \nlightly. But when the Supreme Court issued the Johnson decision and the \nsubsequent United States v. Eichman decision [496 U.S. 310 (1990)], \nthose of us who want to protect the flag were forced to find an \nalternative path.\n  In the Johnson case, the Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, struck down a \nState law prohibiting the desecration of American flags in a manner \nthat would be offensive to others. The Court held that the prohibition \namounted to a content-based regulation. By design, at least according \nto the Court, the lawfulness of Johnson's conduct could only be \ndetermined by the content of his expression. As a result, the Texas \nstatute could not survive the strict scrutiny required by legal \nprecedent, so the Court struck it down.\n  After the Johnson case was decided, Congress passed the Flag \nProtection Act of 1989. That Act prohibited all intentional acts of \ndesecrating the American flag and was, therefore, not a content-based \nprohibition on speech or expression. Nevertheless--and this is the \npoint why a statute won't do--another narrow majority of the Supreme \nCourt acted quickly to strike down the Federal statute as well, ruling \nthat it suffered the same flaw as the Texas statute in the Johnson \ndecision and was consequently inconsistent with the First Amendment. \nThat 5-4 decision makes today's discussion necessary.\n  I support S.J. Res. 14 because it offers a way to return the Nation's \nflag to the protected status it deserves. The authority for a nation to \nprotect its central symbol of unity was considered constitutional for \ntwo centuries. It was only a decade ago that a narrow majority of the \nSupreme Court told us otherwise.\n  It is important to point out that S.J. Res. 14 is not intended to \nprotect ephemeral images or representations of the flag but only the \nphysical flag itself. In other words, this amendment is not intended to \nrestrict the display of images of the American flag on articles of \nclothing, patches, or similar items. This amendment would only protect \nthe flag itself.\n  Because we are protecting our national symbol, it makes sense to me \nthat Members of Congress, representing the Nation as a whole, should \ncraft the statute protecting our flag.\n  I also believe the amendment is consistent with free speech. I \ndisagree with those who say we are making a choice between trampling on \nthe flag and trampling on the first amendment. Protecting the flag, \ncircumscribing certain conduct, will not prevent people from expressing \ntheir ideas through other means in the strongest possible terms.\n  I support this amendment because I believe flag burning is content, \nnot speech, and can be regulated as such. But to my friends who would \nargue otherwise, I remind them that even the right to free speech is \nnot unrestricted. For example, the Government can prohibit speech that \nthreatens to cause imminent tangible harm, including face-to-face \n``fighting words'', incitement to violate our laws, or shouting \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. Obscenity and false advertising are not \nprotected under the first amendment, and indecency over the broadcast \nmedia can be limited to certain times of day.\n  Even Justice William Brennan's decision in New York Times Co. v. \nSullivan [376 U.S. 253 (1964)] accepted that some speech (in that case, \nknown false statements criticizing official conduct of a public \nofficial) may be sanctioned.\n  There is much that is open to debate about the proper parameters of \nfree speech. In the dissent to the 1990 Eichman case, Justice Stevens \nwrote that certain methods of expression may be prohibited if three \ncriteria can be met:\n  First, the prohibition must be supported by a legitimate societal \ninterest unrelated to the ideas the speaker desires to express. I \nbelieve protecting the flag meets the first test. It does not matter \nwhy an individual chooses to desecrate a flag--all desecration is \nequally prohibited.\n  Second, the speaker must be free to express his or her ideas through \nother means. Again, a law protecting the flag does nothing to keep an \nindividual from expressing his or her views through speech or countless \nother activities.\n  Third, societal interest must outweigh the ability of an individual \nto choose among every possible form of speech. In this case, I believe \nthe significance of the flag--its value as a symbol of freedom and \ndemocracy throughout the world, its ability to bring us together as a \nnation, and the effect its destruction has on many Americans--clearly \noutweighs the need to protect an individual's ability to express his or \nher views in every conceivable way.\n  Is anyone here convinced that desecrating a flag might be the only \nway for someone to express an opinion?\n  I recognize that by supporting a constitutional amendment to protect \nthe flag, I am choosing a different course from many of my fellow \nDemocrats in Congress and, quite frankly, from many of my close friends \nfor whom I have the greatest respect. But my support for this amendment \nreflects my broader belief that the time has come for the Nation to \nbegin a major debate on its values. We need to ask ourselves what we \nhold dear--is there anything upon which we will not cast our contempt?\n  How can we foster respect for tradition as well as ideological \ndiversity? How can we foster community as well as individuality? These \nare all important values, and we must learn to reconcile them. We must \nnot advance one value at the expense of another.\n  The framers of the Constitution recognized two important elements in \nour constitutional tradition--liberty and responsibility. Without \nresponsibility, without the rule of law, there could be no protection \nof life, limb, or property--there could be no lasting liberty. I \nbelieve there is a danger in moving too far in either direction--toward \ntoo restrictive order, or toward unfettered individual liberty.\n  The key is the balance. In this instance, I believe we cannot tilt \nthe scales entirely in favor of individual rights when there exists a \nvast community of people in this country who have gone to war for our \nflag.\n  There are mothers and fathers, wives, husbands, and children who have \nreceived that knock on their front door and have been told their son or \ndaughter, husband or wife, father or mother has been killed in the line \nof duty. They have been given a flag on this occasion, a flag which \nhelps preserve the memory of their loved one and which speaks to his or \nher courage. That is the symbol, that is the emblem, that is the \nnational monument.\n  Requiring certain individuals to stop defacing or burning the flag, I \nthink, is a very small price to pay on behalf of millions of Americans \nfor whom the flag has deep personal significance.\n  Less than a decade ago, when 48 States had laws against flag burning, \nthere was no less free speech. And if this amendment is adopted, the \nFirst Amendment will continue to thrive. I believe S.J. Res. 14 will \nprotect the integrity of the flag and keep our First Amendment \njurisprudence intact.\n  While expressing my support for S.J. Res. 14, I briefly want to \nexplain why I oppose the amendment my colleague from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, offered. His amendment, derived from the text of S. 982, \nwould have had the effect of replacing the constitutional language with \nstatutory language.\n  However well-intentioned and earnest the Senator was in offering the \namendment, I believe it was flawed. The Supreme Court, following its \nrulings in Texas v. Johnson and U.S. v. Eichman, would certainly strike \nit down as violative of the First Amendment. We have been down this \nroad before.\n\n  The Johnson and Eichman decisions stipulate that neither Congress nor \nthe States may provide any special protection for the flag. In both \ndecisions, the Court made it clear that special legal protections for \nthe American flag offend the Court's concept of free speech. Because \nthe Court views the flag itself as an object of symbolic speech and not \nas a monument, any conduct taken with regard to the flag constitutes \nprotected expression, as well. So we cannot overrule such a notion with \na statute. That is why, clearly and simply, we need a constitutional \namendment. And that is why I stand today to support that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that the Senate is not \noperating under a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that even without a time agreement, \nwe have had a good debate. Senators on both sides of the issue have \nspoken. We have had practically no quorum calls. We should have debate \nlike this where Senators can speak.\n  I see two of the most distinguished veterans of the Vietnam war on \nthe floor, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb. Both are highly \ndecorated veterans of that war.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield to the Senator from \nNebraska, and then upon completion of his statement, that he be able to \nyield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withhold the request so the Senator from Utah can speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, as I understand it, the \nSenate has to go out at about 5:30.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I renew the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Supporters of this amendment are winning converts. Each \nelection cycle seems to bring them closer to the 67 votes they need to \nsend this 17-word amendment to the States for their ratification. And \n49 legislatures have already indicated they would ratify this amendment \nif Congress were to take this action.\n  Mr. President, these 17 words would make it constitutional for \nCongress to pass a law giving the government the power to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States of America.\n  Let me say at the beginning that I have deep respect for those who \nhave views that are different from mine. The Senator from California \nspoke very eloquently in favor of this amendment. I have heard the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, indeed, submit a personal appeal for \nme to reconsider my views on this issue. I have a great deal of respect \nfor the purpose of this amendment. I especially pay tribute to the U.S. \nAmerican Legion. These patriots have done more than any others to help \nyoung Americans understand that freedom is not free.\n  I have had the honor, through 16 years of public service, to \nexperience what the American Legion and other service organizations \nhave done, but especially the American Legion and the Girl's State and \nBoy's State organizations, taking on the people who do not understand \nthe history and the story of the United States of America. They teach \nthem that story, that history, and they teach them to require the \nrespect necessary to be a good citizen. It is the value they add to our \ncommunity that is immeasurable.\n  I have listened with an open mind to their appeals that I support \nthis amendment. Regretfully and respectfully, I must say no.\n  I fear the unintended consequence of these 17 words and the laws that \nmay be enacted later will be far worse than the consequences of us \nwitnessing the occasional and shocking and disgusting desecration of \nthis great symbol of liberty and freedom.\n  Mr. President, real patriotism cannot be coerced. It must be a \nvoluntary, unselfish, brave act to sacrifice for others. When Americans \nfeel coercion, especially from their Government, they tend to rebel. So \nnone of us should be surprised if one unintended consequence of the \nlaws that prohibit unpopular activity such as this is an actual \nincrease in the incidence of flag desecration.\n  Another unintended consequence of this amendment will be the \ndiversion of police resources from efforts to protect us from dangerous \ncrime. Nobody should underestimate that this fact will happen. The \nefforts to protect us from those who desecrate the flag will require \nthe training of police officers on when and where to respond to \ncomplaints.\n  Mr. President, we pass the laws, but others must implement and \nenforce them. They will receive complaints about neighbors and friends \nor people who desecrate the flag. The police will have to respond to \nevery one of them. These laws will give the power of the Government to \nlocal law enforcement agencies to decide when some individual is \ndesecrating the flag.\n\n  There are 45 words in the first amendment and this amendment protects \nthe rights of citizens to speak, to assemble, to practice their \nreligious beliefs, to publish their opinions and petition their \nGovernment for redress of grievance. The 17 words that are in this \nproposed 28th amendment would limit what the majority of Americans \nbelieve is distasteful and offensive speech.\n  Though this seems very reasonable because most Americans do not \napprove of flag desecration, it is only reasonable if we forget that it \nis the right to speak the unpopular and objectionable that needs the \nmost protecting by our Government.\n  In this era of political correctness, when the fear of 30 second ads \nhas homogenized and sterilized our language of any distasteful truths, \nthis amendment takes us in the opposite direction of that envisioned by \nour Founding Fathers whose words and deeds bravely challenged the \nstatus quo.\n  Last year when I testified about this before the Judiciary Committee, \nI took the liberty of buying an American flag and gave it to the \ncommittee.\n  I bought that flag because every time I look at it, it reminds me \nthat patriotism and the cause of freedom produces widows. Widows who \nhold the flag to their bosom as if it were the live body of their \nloved-one.\n  The flag says more about what it means to be an American than a \nthousand words spoken by me. Current law protects the flag. If anyone \nchooses to desecrate my flag--and survives my vengeful wrath--they will \nface prosecution by our Government. Such acts of malicious vandalism \nare prohibited by law.\n  The law also protects me and allows me to give a speech born of my \nanger and anguish in which I send this flag aflame. Do we really want \nto pass a law making it a crime for a citizen despondent over a war, or \nabortion, or something else they see going on in their country to give \na speech born of their anger? Do we really want a law that says the \npolice will go out and arrest them and put them in jail?\n  I hope not. Patriotism calls upon us to be brave enough to endure and \nwithstand such an act--to tolerate the intolerable. I sincerely and \nrespectfully thank all of those who hold views different from mine for \ntheir patriotism. I will pray this amendment does not pass. But I thank \nGod for the love of country exhibited by those who do.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, thank you. I thank my distinguished \ncolleague and fellow Vietnam veteran from Nebraska for his words. It is \nan important topic.\n  Mr. President, when I came home from Vietnam a little over thirty \nyears ago, I came home to a nation divided. I was assigned by the U.S. \nMarine Corps to head up a major officer recruiting program on college \ncampuses all across America. It was 1969 and anti-war fever was \nconsuming the nation. As you can imagine, my Marine uniform on a \ncollege campus became a lightning rod for protests and protesters. In \nthis assignment, Mr. President, incoming bullets, rockets and artillery \nwere replaced by insults, jeers and demonstrations. At times, it was \ntough.\n  I had just spent a tour of duty, which included commanding an \ninfantry company in combat, and over 100 of my men received the Purple \nHeart, almost a quarter of them posthumously. Like all other warriors \nwho served in uniform, it wasn't their job to question the policy that \nsent them to Vietnam, but they answered the call and those that died, \ndid so with honor, for our Nation.\n  So while I did my best to reason with the crowds that came out to \ngreet me on college campuses, I didn't appreciate the instinctive \ndisrespect that was shown to me and the uniform I wore.\n  But Mr. President, I rise today to defend the rights of those \nindividuals 30 years ago to protest me and my uniform.\n  Freedom of speech is the foundation of our democracy--and silencing \nthat speech would have been against everything I had fought for in \nVietnam. To\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\nparaphrase an old saying: I didn't agree with what they said. But I had \nbeen willing to die to protect their right to say it.\n  Mr. President, I am repulsed by any individual who would burn the \nflag of my country to convey a message of dissent. It is an act I abhor \nand can barely comprehend. But in the democracy that our forefathers \nfounded, and that generations of Americans have fought and died to \npreserve, I simply do not have the right to decide how another \nindividual expresses his or her political views. I can abhor those \npolitical views, but I cannot imprison someone for expressing them. \nThat's a fundamental tenet of democracies and its what makes America \nthe envy of the world, as the home of the free and the brave.\n  Mr. President, when we frame the acceptable context for conveying a \npolitical message, we qualify freedom in America. We chip away at the \nextraordinary freedom that has distinguished us from our enemies for \n200 years.\n  Last week, I received an e-mail from a retired U.S. Marine Corps \nColonel from Virginia. Like many Americans (and many American \nveterans), he had struggled with this issue and searched his conscience \nfor what's right. In his message to me, he said: ``I have seen our flag \ntorn in battle, captured by our enemies, and trampled on by protesters. \nIn all those events I never felt that the American way of life was in \ngrave peril . . . for whenever our flag fell or was destroyed there was \nalways another Marine to step forward and pull a replacement from his \nhelmet or ruck sack.''\n  He continued: ``The Constitution is the bedrock of America, the \nnation . . . the people. It is not possible to pull another such \ndocument from our `national ruck sack.' We have but one Constitution, \nand it should be the object of our protection.''\n\n  Mr. President, there is no question that it is precisely because the \nflag represents those sacred ideals that define our democracy, that we \nare so angry to see one being trampled or torn or torched. What angers \nus the most is the message of disrespect that desecration conveys. The \ningratitude of the desecrater is tangible and we simply cannot help but \nbe outraged. How can anyone be so shallow and so ungrateful that they \nwould destroy the flag of a nation so great that it gives them the \nfreedom to commit such a despicable act?\n  In fact, Mr. President, it is the motivation of the flag burner, not \nthe burning of the flag itself, that makes us so angry that we want to \npunish that individual and throw away the keys. We know that when an \nAmerican flag is old and tattered, or damaged and no longer fit to fly, \nwe don't bury it, or throw it in the trash. We burn it. That is the \nproper, respectful method of disposing of a flag. So it is not the \nburning of the flag that stirs us to anger. It is the reason why the \nflag was burned that gets us so upset. And the reason why the flag is \nburned (to convey a message of dissent) is the reason why the \nConstitution protects it.\n  It is precisely because the act of flag burning sends a message that \nelicits such a visceral and powerful response that it is undeniably \nspeech. Vulgar, crude, infantile, repulsive, ungrateful speech, but \nundeniably speech.\n  Mr. President, since speech that enjoys the support of the majority \nis never likely to be limited, the Bill of Rights, by its very design, \nprotects the rights of a minority in key areas that the founders held \ndear. And it is the freedom to dissent peacefully that separates the \ngreatest democracy the world has ever known from other regimes like \nthose in China, Cuba, Iraq, and others where political dissent has been \nmet with imprisonment and sometimes death.\n  We've applauded the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to individuals \nin other countries willing to risk their lives to peacefully protest \ntheir government. And we know that the first sign that freedom is in \ntrouble anywhere around the world is when the government starts locking \nup its dissenters.\n  If we reach past our natural anger and disgust for a few publicity-\nhungry flag-burners, we know in our hearts that a great nation like \nours, a nation that defends liberty all over the world, should not \nimprison individuals who exercise their right to political dissent. And \nwe know in our hearts that a few repulsive flag-burners pose no real \ndanger to a nation as great as ours.\n  Mr. President, a great defender of freedom in the world, General \nColin Powell, had this to say in letter last year about this amendment:\n\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The first amendment \n     exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that which we agree or disagree, but also \n     to that which we find outrageous. I would not amend that \n     great shield of Democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The \n     flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk \n     away.\n\n  Mr. President, our flag stirs very deep emotions in me. It never \nfails to inspire me. I still get a chill down my spine when it passes \nin a parade. And I've handed it, folded, to too many widows not to \nrevere it to the core of my being.\n  I fully support the Citizens Flag Alliance and especially my fellow \nmembers of the American Legion for all their hard work to instill in \nour people a greater respect for our flag. I understand why so many of \nmy fellow veterans support this amendment. But I want the same thing \nthey want. I want all of our citizens to respect our flag and all that \nit stands for.\n  Mr. President, I want that flag to be the proud symbol of a nation \nthat is truly free. And for it to be that proud symbol, we must also \nprotect the sacred freedoms placed in the first amendment of the \nConstitution by our forefathers.\n  Mr. President, I am a proud veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. And I \nlearned many lessons serving in combat in Vietnam. I served with \nMarines who loved this country and were great patriots. They were often \nyoung and sometimes scared. But they risked their lives in Southeast \nAsia.\n  Some of those brave warriors died for our nation. On two separate \noccasions, I had men literally die in my arms.\n  Those who made the ultimate sacrifice may have died keeping faith \nwith their country. They may have died so that others might be free. \nThey may have died for an ideal or a principle or a promise--sacred \nintangibles that transcend time. Some might say they died for the flag. \nBut I was there, Mr. President, and they did not die for a piece of \ncloth (however sacred), that eventually becomes worn and tattered and \neventually has to be replaced. No. They died fighting for all that our \nflag represents.\n  My fellow veterans who died in combat sacrificed their lives for \nthese intangibles that are the core values of our democracy. They died \nfor liberty and tolerance, for justice and equality. They died for that \nwhich can never burn. They died for ideals that can only be desecrated \nby our failure to defend them.\n  In opposing this amendment, I truly believe that I am again called \nupon to defend those intangible ideals--like freedom and tolerance--for \nwhich so many of us fought, and too many of us died. I am in a \ndifferent uniform today, in a different place and time. But I feel as \nif, in some way, I am again battling the odds to defend principles \nthat, as a younger man, I was willing to die for. I'd still put my life \non the line today to defend those principles.\n  I say that because the flag represents freedom to me. But the first \namendment guarantees that freedom. And when we seek to punish those who \nexpress views we don't share, then we--not the flag burners--we begin \nto erode the very values, the very freedoms, that make America the \ngreatest democracy the world has ever known. I support our flag, and \nthe republic for which it stands. But I cannot, with the faith I have \nin that republic, support this constitutional amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. And I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNebraska who has received the highest honor our country can bestow on \nany who has defended America in battle; the Medal of Honor. I am proud \nto appear with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for his statement, as I do the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska. I can assure my friend from Virginia, a\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\nyoung marine, my son, will receive a copy first thing in the morning at \nhis home in California of the speech by the Senator from Virginia and a \nspeech by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Later this evening I am going to be having dinner with my oldest and \ndearest friend, a man I went to college with, a marine. He served the \nRepublic and faced the same kind of reaction when he came back from \ncombat from Vietnam. One day he was in a firefight in Vietnam, 2 days \nlater he was walking down the street in his uniform in the United \nStates, facing protesters' shouts.\n  Having risked his life, as did both of you, he said what saved him \nthrough that time was to know exactly for what he fought. At least he \nhas had the satisfaction of seeing so much of that come full circle: \nThe Wall here, people realizing that whatever the protesters had \nagainst the war, it should not be against the warriors, especially when \nthey see the names of tens of thousands who did not come back.\n  I recall last year when the Senate rose as one to commemorate the \nheroism and valor of the Senator from Nebraska. Both of you have been \ndecorated for heroism, both of you have faced near death in battle. I \nthink both of you have come back here to serve your country in as \nstrong a way as you did there, both as Senators but in bringing a calm, \nconsidered, integrity constantly throughout your service in the Senate.\n  I am not a veteran. I did not serve in battle. But I think how proud \nI am to have served in the Senate with both of you. I thank you for \nyour speech tonight. I hope all Americans and all Senators will listen.\n  Mr. President, I met again today with Vermont representatives to the \nAmerican Legion convention, which is taking place in Washington this \nweek. These are people who deserve our respect, who served this nation \nin time of war, and who sacrificed so that our freedoms and way of life \nwould triumph over Nazi Germany. As they gather, I pledge to continue \nto work with them to address the unmet needs of American veterans. \nAbraham Lincoln reminded us of our sacred obligation ``to care for him \nwho shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.''\n  Following the Judiciary Committee's hearings last year on the \nconstitutional amendment to restrict the first amendment to protect the \nflag from use in political protest, I asked Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady, \nchairman of the Citizens Flag Alliance, what in his opinion were the \nmost pressing issues facing our veterans. His response may surprise the \nproponents of the constitutional amendment. His response to my inquiry \nregarding the most pressing issues facing veterans was ``broken \npromises, especially health care.''\n  I asked the same question of Professor Gary May, an American hero who \nlost both legs while serving his country in Vietnam. Professor May \nsaid:\n\n       Veterans and their families need services and \n     opportunities, not symbolism. Recruitment for military \n     service is predicated in part on a quid pro quo--if honorable \n     service is rendered, then meaningful post-service benefits \n     will follow. Our record of making good on this contract is \n     not good. The favorable expressed sentiment for veterans by \n     supporters of the flag desecration amendment would be better \n     placed in support of extending and stabilizing services \n     responsive to the day-to-day needs of ordinary veterans and \n     their families.\n\n  Have we followed this good counsel here in the Senate? The \nunfortunate answer is no. Our veterans and retirees have received more \nhigh-sounding rhetoric about patriotism than real efforts on our part \nto resolve the broken promises.\n  During the debate on the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct of 1998, the Senate voted to shift over $10 billion worth of \ncritical veterans funding to help pay for extravagant highway spending \nprograms.\n  Three times that year, the Senate raided veterans' programs: in the \nbudget resolution, in the IRS Reform legislation, and in the VA/HUD \nAppropriations Bill. All three times, too many Senators voted against \nthe veterans. If only a few more of those who now beat their chests \nabout symbolic actions had voted for them, the necessary funding for \nveterans would have been assured.\n  We have had numerous other missed opportunities to increase the funds \nin the Veteran Administrations medical care account. Hospitals are \nseeing more patients with less funding and staff, and it can take \nmonths to get a doctor's appointment. It is not mere symbolism to fund \nthose hospitals.\n  It has been estimated that a third of all homeless people in this \ncountry are American veterans. Many of those people may be suffering \nfrom post-traumatic stress disorder or other illnesses relating to \ntheir military service.\n  We all know that with the end of the cold war, military bases are \nclosing. Military retirees who relied on the base hospitals for space-\navailable free medical care are losing access to care. Many service \nmembers retired near military bases specifically so that they could \nenjoy the free medical care we promised them, but now they have to find \nhealth care in the marketplace.\n  I saw this in Vermont recently, where we had to fight--yes, fight--to \nkeep adequate funding for the only veteran's hospital in the State. The \nin-patient surgical program at the White River Junction VA hospital was \nnearly closed down. If the closure had gone through, many elderly \nVermont and New Hampshire veterans would have had to travel all the way \nto Boston for medical care, and many of them just cannot. The VA has \nrecommitted itself to the White River Junction program, but this sort \nof thing is happening all across the country.\n  Last year, we finally raised the veteran's budget for medical care by \n$1.7 billion. I was particularly relieved that Vermont veterans finally \nreceived some assistance, in the form of a $7 million Rural Health Care \nInitiative. That funding will develop a number of innovative programs \nto bring high quality care closer to home. I would remind everyone that \na majority of the Senate defeated an amendment offered by my friend \nPaul Wellstone that would have raised VA medical care funding an \nadditional $1.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2000. I was proud to vote for \nthe increase, but disappointed that more of colleagues did not go along \nwith this much-needed amendment.\n  We have a long way to go in ensuring that our veterans receive the \nhealth care that they so richly deserve. After many years of fixed \nfunding and increased costs, we need continued funding increases, and \nnew programs to provide higher quality care.\n  We must also keep our promises to those who have completed a military \ncareer. I have strongly supported efforts to improve TRICARE, the \nmilitary health care system upon which military retirees rely for their \nhealth care. The system is generally sound, but problems have arisen in \ndeveloping the provider networks and ensuring quick reimbursements for \npayments. Last November, I supported a TRICARE forum in Burlington, \nVermont, to allow retirees and other participants to express their \nconcerns directly to health care providers. Of course, we must also \nensure that Medicare-eligible retirees continue to receive high quality \nhealth care.\n  What are we doing instead? In 1996, we changed the immigration laws \nto expedite deportation proceedings by cutting back on procedural \nsafeguards and judicial review. The zealousness of Congress and the \nWhite House to be tough on aliens has successfully snared permanent \nresidents who have spilled their blood for this country. As the INS \nprepares to deport American veterans for even the most minuscule \ncriminal offenses, we have not even been kind enough to thank them for \ntheir service with a hearing to listen to their circumstances. Last \nyear I introduced the Fairness to Immigrant Veterans Act, S. 871, to \nremedy this situation, but it has been bottled up in committee.\n  If we truly wish to do something patriotic, what we should be talking \nabout is honoring our veterans. We should honor our veterans by \nanswering Lincoln's call ``to care for him who shall have borne the \nbattle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' We should honor our \nveterans with substance rather than symbols.\n  If we fail to meet the concrete needs of American veterans and try to \npush them aside with symbolic gestures, we will have failed in our duty \nnot only to our veterans, but to our country, as well. I wonder where \nwe would be if the effort and funds expended each year lobbying for the \nconstitutional amendment had been directed toward the needs of our \nveterans and their families\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nand to making sure that we honor them by fulfilling our commitments to \nthem.\n  I see one of the many veterans of World War II serving still in the \nSenate, and I will yield to my friend and neighbor, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak in this \ndebate. This is the fourth time this amendment has come to the floor \nsince I have been present. But the speeches, statements, the addresses \nby the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Virginia compel me \nsimply to bear witness to them. There are 10 Members in the Senate \ntoday, 10 remaining persons, who were in uniform in World War II.\n  I was in the Navy--not heroically; and I was called up again briefly \nin Korea. I was part of that generation in which service to the Nation \nwas so deeply honored, and lived with horror to see the disrespect \nshown those who answered the country's service in Vietnam, as they were \nasked to do. They were commanded to do so and they had taken an oath to \nobey.\n  What a thrilling thing it is to see, two such exemplars, men of \nheroism, achievement and spotless honor, come to this floor and speak \nas they have done. We take one oath which binds us today. Those who \nhave been in the military have taken earlier oaths. Our oath is to \nuphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all \nenemies, foreign and domestic--not ``foreign or,'' not just \n``foreign.'' This was added over the course of the 19th century.\n  Surely, there would be no one, however unintentionally--and I say \nthis as a member of the American Legion--who would propose that to \ndebase the First Amendment to the Constitution meets the criteria of \nupholding and defending it.\n  Those two men have defended their nation in battle--one in the Navy, \none in the Marines. I speak as one who was involved. I was in 20 years, \naltogether, before being discharged. I have to grant, I was not aware \nthat I was discharged, but it turned up later in the file somewhere.\n  Our oath is solemn, and it is binding, and they--Senators Robb and \nKerrey--stand there as witness to what it requires of us. If we cannot \ndo this on this floor, what can we expect Americans to do on \nbattlefields, in the skies, under the seas, and on the land in the \nyears ahead?\n  Please, I say to all Senators, heed them and walk away from this \ntrivializing of our most sacred trust. Defeat this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader allow me to make one brief \ncomment before he propounds his unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I came to the floor to thank the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New York, but also my two colleagues, \nSenators Robb and Kerrey, for their extraordinary statements on the \nSenate floor. I hope the American people have had the opportunity to \nhear, and I hope the opportunity to read what they have said is made to \nschoolkids and others who have given a great deal of thought to our \nConstitution and the reason our Founding Fathers wrote as they did.\n  Their eloquence and their power and their extraordinary \npersuasiveness ought to be tonic for us all late in the day on an \nafternoon which has seen a good debate. I am hopeful people have had \nthe opportunity to hear this contribution, above and beyond all of \nthose made so far in this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1807-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wish to make one other point, which \nis not a constitutional argument, but it does have a lot to do with \nveterans. I say that we have spent some time on this, and we should; it \nis not an unimportant matter. But I also hope we will spend time on the \nfloor of the Senate talking about a range of other very important \nissues that affect veterans. I am amazed that every time I meet with \nveterans in Minnesota, or in other parts of the country, I hear about \nthe ways in which veterans fall between the cracks. We have a budget \nthis year that is better than a flatline budget, but Senator Kennedy is \nout here--a health care Senator--and he knows that better than anybody \nin the Senate.\n  The fact is, we have an aging veteran population like we have an \naging population in general, and that is all for the good because \npeople are living longer. We don't have any real way right now of \nhelping those veterans the way we should. We passed the millennium \nbill, but the question is, Will the appropriations be there? We ought \nto be talking about the health care needs of veterans as well. We ought \nto be talking about how we are going to make sure those veterans can \nstay at home and live at home with dignity, with home-based health \ncare.\n  I was at a medical center in Minneapolis, which is a real flagship \nhospital. It is not uncommon, when you go visit with veterans, you will \nsee spouses who are there with their husbands, or maybe out in the \nwaiting room or the lobby relaxing. You can talk to them for 3 minutes \nand realize they are scared to death about their husband going home. \nMaybe they had a knee or a hip operation, or maybe they have cancer. \nThe spouses are mainly women. They don't know how they are going to \ntake care of their husbands.\n  There isn't even any support for respite care. When are we going to \ntalk about that issue? When are we going to talk about the number of \nveterans who are homeless? When are we going to talk about the number \nof them who are Vietnam vets, because they are struggling with \nposttraumatic syndrome and because they are struggling with substance \nabuse and they don't get the treatment? When are we going to be talking \nabout this overall budget for veterans' health care, which is not a \nnational-line budget?\n  There is an increase from the President this year--I am glad for \nthat--but it doesn't really take into account all of the gaps and all \nof the investment we need to make. When are we going to do that?\n  I did not come to the floor to not speak to this amendment. I have \nspoken with as much as I can muster as to why I oppose it. But I also \nwant to say--I want this to be part of my formal remarks because I \ndon't think it is off the Record--colleagues, that I hope we will talk \nabout the whole set of other issues that are very important, not only \nto veterans but to the American people.\n  I can assure you that I have worked with veterans to put together \ntheir independent budget. That is a whole coalition of veterans \norganizations. It is really shocking how many veterans fall between the \ncracks. We have a lot of work to do. We are talking about people's \nlives. It is no way to say thanks to veterans when we don't come \nthrough with the health care we promised them.\n  I want to make it clear that I hope we will soon focus on these \nissues as well. I hope the veterans community will--I know the veterans \ncommunity will--focus on these issues as well. I spend an awful lot of \ntime with veterans. I have a lot of meetings with veterans and with \ncounty veteran service officers. These issues come up over and over \nagain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1807-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1807-S1809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE FREEDOM TO FARM ACT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as much as I hate to recognize this, \nthis is the fourth anniversary of the passage by the House and the \nSenate of the ``freedom to fail'' bill.\n  On this date in 1996, both houses of Congress approved a new farm \nbill, described then as ``the most sweeping change in agriculture since \nthe Depression. It would get rid of government subsidies to farmers \nover the next seven years.''\n  The bill has made sweeping changes in agriculture--it has produced \none of the worst economic crises that rural American has ever \nexperienced. Thanks to the Freedom to Farm, or as I call it the Freedom \nto Fail Act, tens of thousands of farm families are in jeopardy of \nlosing their livelihoods and life savings.\n  The Freedom to Farm bill is not saving tax payers money, in fact we \nhave spent $19 billion more in the first 4 years of the 1996 farm bill \nthan was supposed to be spent through the 7 year life of the law.\n  However, what has resulted is the precipitous loss of family farmers \nbecause this legislation has not provided\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nsmall and moderate sized farmers with a safety net. Instead payment \nloopholes have been inserted in legislation that has allowed the \nlargest argibusiness corporations to receive the lions share of \ngovernment support. This is unacceptable.\n  In my State of Minnesota, family farm income has decreased 43 percent \nsince 1996 and more than 25 percent of the remaining farms may not \ncover expenses for 2000. Every month more and more family farmers are \nbeing forced to give up their life's work, their homes, and their \ncommunities.\n  The primary problem is price. The average price paid to producers for \ntheir crops has plummeted. Farmers suffer from a negative cash flow. In \nMinnesota it costs $2.50 to grow a bushel of corn. Today the price of a \nbushel of corn in Minnesota sells at around $1.75 at the local \nelevator.\n  The forecast for prices is gloom. USDA projections for commodity \nprices are expected to remain low.\n  USDA estimates that farm income will decline 17 percent this year if \nCongress does not act.\n  Wheat prices have dropped $3 in the past 2 years. In May, 1996, \nwheat was selling $5.75 per bushel. Today, wheat is at $2.78 per \nbushel. This is well below the cost of production. Farmers need at \nleast $4 a bushel to break even.\n\n  Soybean prices will probably average under $5 a bushel. Livestock and \ndairy prices are also being impacted. Hog farmers still face market \nprices below their costs of production for the third straight year.\n  Family farmers have struggled to survive as the devastating results \nof the 1996 Farm bill, exacerbated by the lack of a reliable farm \nsafety net.\n  In addition, merger after merger in the agriculture sector leaves \nproducers wondering if they will be able to survive amidst the new \ngiants of agribusiness.\n  As a direct result, rural bankers, implement dealers, and other small \nbusinesses that rely on farm families as their customers have been \nsqueezed as cash flows have dropped. Rural families with shrunken \nincomes have less money to pay for quality health care coverage and \nadequate child care for their children. There is an affordable housing \ncrunch as urgent as in our urban areas. And finally, in our rural \ncommunities there is a lack of good jobs at decent wages.\n  The crisis is real. You can see it in the numbers. You can see it in \nthe eyes of the scores of farmers who are forced to sell off the \nsubstance of their history and their livelihood.\n  Many compare the current farm crisis to the 1980's. We all know there \nwas a massive shake out of family farmers at that time. It changed the \nface of rural America. Many communities were devastated and have not \nrecovered. I assume many use the comparison to remind us that the \ndistressed farm economy in the '80's somehow survived, and so farmers \nwill survive this one too. But the crisis we now face is much graver \nthan in the 80's, and I fear that family farmers and rural America will \nnot survive.\n  The tough farm economy may resemble the agricultural crisis of the \n1980's, but there is a notable difference, and that difference is \nnamely the passage of the Freedom to Farm Act. The Act ignored the fact \nthat family farming is a business both uniquely important and uniquely \naffected by nonmarket forces.\n  The Freedom to Farm has become Freedom to Fail.\n  The 1996 Freedom to Farm bill was suppose to wean rural America from \nsubsidies by introducing a market-driven agriculture. The bill gave \nfarmers flexibility to plant what they wanted, and it was to make \nfarmers able to adapt to a slump in a particular commodity by switching \nto a more profitable crop. But the switch in crops doesn't make a \ndifference if they are all drastically low.\n  We are now witnessing many farmers planting soybeans. Why is that so \nmany farmers are planting soybeans? It isn't because the market demands \nsoybeans. It is because the Freedom to Fail bill capped the loan rate \non soybeans higher than other commodities, and so farmers are planting \nsoybeans to get a better rate than from corn or wheat. This is not \nmarket driven agriculture.\n  The Freedom to Farm bill is not saving tax payers money, as I've said \nwe have spent $19 billion in the first 4 years of the bill than was \nsupposed to be spent through the 6-year life of the law. However, what \nhas resulted is the precipitous loss of family farmers because this \nlegislation has not provided small and moderate sized farmers with an \nadequate safety net.\n  Instead payment loopholes have been inserted in legislation that has \nallowed the largest agribusiness corporations to receive the majority \nof government support. This unacceptable.\n  In order to ensure that family farmers remain a part of this \ncountry's landscape, need a new farm bill now. We simply cannot wait \nuntil reauthorization in 2002 for Congress to act.\n  Congress must act now to address the impact of plummeting farm \nincomes and the ripple effect it is having throughout rural communities \nand their economic base. Farmers are not going to survive if the only \nhelp they get from Washington are inadequate, unreliable, long delayed \nemergency aid bills that are distributed unfairly.\n  We need policies that equip family farmers to withstand the low \nprices and weather disasters that are fueling the current farm crisis, \nso their livelihood is not dependent on the whims of Congress.\n\n  This crisis is a crisis of price. Farmers want and deserve a fair \nprice. Farmers do not want a handout. Yet, the 1996 Freedom to Farm \nbill stripped farmers of their marketing tools, and they have been left \nempty handed.\n  People cannot--they will not--be able to survive right now unless \nthere is some income stabilization, unless there is some safety net, \nunless there is some way they can have some leverage to get a decent \nprice in the marketplace. That is the missing piece of Freedom to Farm \nor Freedom to Fail. Flexibility is good. But that has not worked, and I \nsee it every day in every community that I am in.\n  I'm not talking about AMTA payments, which is severance pay for our \nNation's farmer heritage. Our Nation's family farmers want--they \ndesperately need some leverage in the marketplace to get a fair price.\n  We need to lift the loan rate. The Freedom to Fail Act capped \nmarketing loans at artificial levels so low that they fail to offer \nmeaningful income support. The loan rates have left farmers vulnerable \nto the severe economic and weather related events of the past 3 years, \nresulting in devastating income losses.\n  Family farmers deserve a targeted, countercyclical loan rate that \nprovides a meaningful level of income support when the market price \nfalls below the loan rate, and a loan rate with a CUP rather than a CAP \nso it doesn't merely track prices when they fall. Lifting the loan rate \nwould provide relief to farmers who need it and increase stability over \nthe long term.\n  We also need to institute farmer owned reserve systems to give \nfarmers the leverage they need in the marketplace. And conservation \nincentives to reward farmers who carry out conservation measures on \ntheir land.\n  And finally, unless we address the current trend of consolidation and \nvertical integration in corporate agriculture, nothing else we do to \nmaintain the family size farms will succeed.\n  The farm share of profit in the food system has been declining for \nover 20 years. From 1994 to 1998, consumer prices have increased 3 \npercent while the prices paid to farmers for their products has plunged \n36 percent. Likewise, the impact of price disparity is reinforced by \nreports of record profits among agribusinesses at the same time \nproducers are suffering an economic depression.\n\n  In the past decade and a half, an explosion of mergers, acquisitions, \nand anti-competitive practices has raised concentration in American \nagriculture to record levels.\n  The top four pork packers have increased their market share from 36 \npercent to 57 percent. In fact, the world's largest pork producer and \nprocessor is getting bigger. Smithfield Foods is buying the Farmland \nIndustries plant in Dubuque, Iowa. This deal should be complete by mid-\nMay.\n  The top four beef packers have expanded their market share from 32 \npercent to 80 percent.\n  The top four flour millers have increased their market share from 40 \npercent to 62 percent.\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\n  The market share of the top four soybean crushers has jumped from 54 \npercent to 80 percent.\n  The top four turkey processors now control 42 percent of production.\n  Forty-nine percent of all chicken broilers are now slaughtered by the \nfour largest firms. The top four firms control 67 percent of ethanol \nproduction.\n  The top four sheep, poultry, wet corn, and dry corn processors now \ncontrol 73 percent, 55 percent, 74 percent, and 57 percent of the \nmarket, respectively.\n  The four largest grain buyers control nearly 40 percent of elevator \nfacilities.\n  By conventional measures, none of these markets are really \ncompetitive. According to the economic literature, markets are no \nlonger competitive if the top four firms control over 40 percent. In \nall the markets I just listed, the market share of the top four firms \nis 40 percent or more. So there really is no effective competition in \nthese processing markets.\n\n  But now, with this explosion of mergers, acquisitions, joint \nventures, marketing agreements, and anticompetitive behavior by the \nlargest firms, these and other commodity markets are becoming more and \nmore concentrated by the day.\n  Last week, the Senate passed a resolution 99-1, expressing our \nfeelings on the 1996 Farm bill. It read,\n\n       Congress is committed to giving this crisis in agriculture \n     . . . its full attention by reforming rural policies to \n     alleviate the farm price crisis, [and] ensuring competitive \n     markets . . .\n\n  We are committed to having the debate about what kind of changes we \ncould make that would provide some real help for family farmers, that \nwould enable family farmers to get a decent price, that would provide \nsome income for families, what kind of steps we could take that will \nput some free enterprise back into the food industry and deal with all \nthe concentration of power.\n  Other Senators may have different ideas. I just want us to address \nthis crisis. I don't want us to turn our gaze away from our family \nfarmers. And I say to my colleagues, on this anniversary of the Freedom \nof Fail Bill, we need a new farm bill--and I will come to the floor, \nevery opportunity I have to speak about the economic convulsion this \nlegislation has caused in our rural communities.\n  I say to all of my colleagues who talked about how we were going to \nget the Government off the farm, we were going to lower the loan rate, \nand do this through deregulation and exports, that we have an honest to \ngoodness depression in agriculture. We have the best people in the \nworld working 20 hours a day who are being spit out of the economy. We \nhave record low income, record low prices, broken dreams and lives, and \nbroken families.\n  We had close to 3,000 farmers who came here last week. It was \nriveting. It was pouring rain, but they were down on The Mall. We had \n500 farmers from Minnesota. Most all of them came by bus. They don't \nhave money to come by jet. Many of them are older. They came with their \nchildren and grandchildren. They did not come here for the fun of it. \nThey came here because the reality is, this will be their last bus \ntrip. They are not going to be able to come to Washington to talk about \nagriculture. They are not going to be farming any longer. These family \nfarmers are not going to be farming any longer unless we deal with the \nprice crisis.\n  Right now, the price of what they get is way below the cost of \nproduction. Only if you have huge amounts of capital can you go on. \nPeople eating at the dinner table are doing fine. The IVVs, and the \nCon-Agras and big grain companies are doing fine. But our dairy and \ncrop farmers and livestock producers are going under.\n  This is, unfortunately, again the anniversary, and we have to write a \nnew farm bill.\n  That is my cry as a Senator from Minnesota from the heartland of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1809-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMITMENT TO THE CAPITOL HILL POLICE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

We said we \nnever want this to happen again.\n  We have posts where there is 1 officer with 20 and 30 and 40 people \nstreaming in. We made the commitment that we were going to have at \nleast two officers at every post.\n  I know there are Senators, such as Senator Bennett, who are in key \npositions and who care deeply about this.

One officer at a post \nand not two officers at a post is an untenable security situation.\n  My plea to colleagues is, we need to get this right for the public \nand for the Capitol Hill police.

Mr. President, I thank my friend, the good Senator from \nMinnesota, for an excellent presentation and for reminding us about the \nneeds of our veterans, particularly those who are having some service-\nconnected disability. The problems he has talked about that have \naffected his region are duplicated in my region of the country as well.\n  I received a call just 2 days ago from a very good friend, a person \nwho worked here in the Senate, about his uncle who is 86 years old and \nwho was at Pearl Harbor. He was one of those wounded at Pearl Harbor, \nsurvived, and went on. He was wounded in the Second World War and is \nnow destitute and trying to get into a service home just outside of \nBoston. The waiting line there is 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  I remember very well speaking to those who came back from the war. At \nthat time, they all believed they were fortunate to make it back, and \nthey weren't asking very much of this country. We responded in a way in \nwhich all of us have been enormously appreciative with the GI bill. \nMany of these men and women took 4 or 5 years out of their lives to \nserve their country and risked life and death. We provided the GI bill \nto them so they could get an education. They got an education and went \non to contribute to their country. As the Senator knows, for every $1 \ninvested in that education program, $8 was returned to the Treasury.\n  But there was not a member of the Armed Forces in any of the services \nwho didn't believe in committing this Nation to taking care of those \nwho served this country, who suffered and were wounded in the line of \nbattle. They believed they should live in peace, respect, and dignity \nduring their golden years. They are not, and it is a national disgrace.\n  We tried to join with others in this body. And I tell my good friend \nI will work with him closely, not on those relevant committees, but I \nthink we have been here long enough to know we can make some difference \nin this area. I look forward to working with him. This is a problem \nthat faces us in New England.\n  I see my colleague from Rhode Island chairing the Senate this \nafternoon. I am sure he and his colleague, Senator Reid, have these \nkinds of cases as well. It is a matter of priority. We will join with \nhim at a later time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I recently reviewed a video tape of some \nof the violence that occurred during the labor dispute between Overnite \nTrucking and the Teamsters. I am shocked and disturbed by the violent \nattacks that have been carried out against\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\nOvernite drivers simply because they have decided to work and provide \nfor their families.\n  Under a legal loophole created in federal law, union officials, who \norganize and coordinate campaigns of violence to ``obtain so called \nlegitimate union objectives,'' are exempt from federal prosecution \nunder the Hobbs Act. An update of a 1983 union violence study, released \nby the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School Industrial Research \nUnit entitled: ``Union Violence: The Record and the Response of the \nCourts, Legislatures, and the NLRB,'' revealed some disturbing news. \nWhile the overall number of strikes has been on the decline, union \nviolence has increased. The study also showed the violence is now more \nlikely to be targeted toward individuals.\n  Mr. President, violence is violence and extortion is extortion \nregardless of whether or not you are a card carrying member of a union. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 764, the Freedom from Union Violence \nAct. This legislation would plug the loopholes in the Hobbs Act and \nmake all individuals accountable for their actions. I believe that \npeople should be reprimanded for using violence to obstruct the law. We \nshould not give special treatment to union violence cases or union \nbosses. Senator Thurmond has set out to clarify that union-related \nviolence can be prosecuted. I commend Senator Thurmond for introducing \nthis much-needed legislation.\n  During the 105th Congress, the Judiciary Committee conducted a \nhearing on the Freedom from Union Violence Act. After listening to and \nreviewing the wrenching testimony of victims of union violence at this \nhearing, I am now more certain of the need to eliminate these \nloopholes. For these reasons I respectfully urge my colleague Senator \nHatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to schedule hearings \nand a markup of S. 764, the Freedom from Union Violence Act, as soon as \npossible. I also urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation. It is time to end federally endorsed violence. \nConducting hearings on this issue would be a step in the right \ndirection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1810-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like to make a brief statement \non two arbitration bills that are currently pending in the Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts of the Committee on the \nJudiciary. These bills are S. 1020 and S. 121, both of which would \ncreate exceptions to the Federal Arbitration Act.\n  In general, arbitration is fair, efficient, and cost-effective means \nof alternative dispute resolution compared to long and costly court \nproceedings. The two bills before the subcommittee today raise concerns \nabout the fairness of allowing some parties to opt out of arbitration \nand the wisdom of exposing certain parties to the cost and uncertainty \nof trial proceedings.\n  S. 1020, the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness \nAct would allow automobile dealers and manufacturers to opt out of \nbinding arbitration clauses contained in their franchise contracts and \npursue remedies in court. This is troubling because both parties are \ngenerally financially sophisticated and represented by attorneys when \nthey enter into a franchise contract. S. 1020's enactment would allow \nthese wealthy parties to opt out of arbitration, but would not allow \ncustomers of the dealers to opt out of arbitration. This position is \ndifficult to justify. Indeed, in jurisdictions such as Alabama the \nallure of large jury verdicts serves as a powerful incentive for trial \nlawyers to use S. 1020 to argue against all arbitration. Jere Beasley, \none of the Nation's most well-known trial lawyers, is making this exact \nargument in his firm's newsletter. While abandoning arbitration for \ndealers and manufacturers might increase attorneys fees, I have serious \nconcerns as to whether such a selective abandonment for sophisticated \ndealers and manufacturers would increase the fairness of dispute \nresolution between these parties or would be fair to customers and \nemployees of the dealers.\n  S. 121, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act, would prevent the \nenforcement of binding arbitration agreements in employment \ndiscrimination suits. However, when employment discrimination law suits \ncost between $20,000 and $50,000 to file, many employees cannot afford \nto litigate their claim in court. Arbitration provides a much more \ncost-effective means of dispute resolution for employees. Indeed, \nseveral studies have shown that in nonunion employment arbitration \nemployees prevail between 63 percent and 74 percent of their claims in \narbitration, compared to 15 percent to 17 percent in court. Further, an \nAmerican Bar Association study showed that consumers in general prevail \nin 80 percent of their claims in arbitration compared to 71 percent in \ncourt. Of course, if both employees and employers could avoid \narbitration under S. 121. This would give employers the financial \nincentive to use the $20,000 to $50,000 cost of a trial as a barrier to \nemployees suits. This does not appear to be good policy.\n  I note that the Chamber of Commerce, the Alliance of Automobile \nManufacturers, and the National Arbitration Forum support arbitration \nand have raised concerns concerning the bills pending before the \nsubcommittee. Their concerns must be explored more fully.\n  In sum, I believe that the arbitration process must be fair.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nSenator Santorum and I are introducing, the ``Deposit Insurance \nFairness and Economic Opportunity Act.'' This legislation would \nincrease the amount of money that is available for banks and thrifts to \nlend in their communities.\n  Our financial services industry is incredibly strong, and the public \nbenefits from this strength. Last year, this Senate passed \ncomprehensive banking reform legislation that will increase consumer \nchoice and make our financial institutions more competitive. Throughout \nthe consideration of that measure, I steadfastly supported efforts to \nimprove and increase credit availability to local communities. Though I \nbelieve we achieved this goal, I also said that we could and should do \nmore. The legislation I introduce today with my colleague Senator \nSantorum does just that.\n  This measure would use the extra money that is in the Bank Insurance \nFund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), money \nthat banks and thrifts have paid, to pay the interest on Financing \nCorporation (FICO) bonds. As a result, banks and thrifts will be able \nto use the money they would otherwise pay to\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\nFICO to increase lending in their communities. Right now, a financial \ninstitution of approximately $200 million in domestic deposits could \nexpect to pay roughly $42,000 this year for its FICO obligation. If \nthat $42,000 obligation can be paid out of our excess money in the \ninsurance funds, without compromising the safety and soundness of the \nfunds, it will mean that institution has $42,000 more to lend.\n  Right now, the BIF and the SAIF are beyond fully capitalized. They \nboth contain millions of dollars more than required by federal law. \nThat excess money is sitting here in Washington. The funds keep \ngrowing, and the money keeps sitting here. Now, the trouble with pots \nof money sitting in Washington is that quite often, the money just \nstays here in Washington and doesn't help our communities. This \nlegislation would change that. By relieving some of the financial \nburden on our banks and thrifts through this common-sense legislation, \nwe will be opening up opportunities for these institutions to put that \nmoney to good use.\n  The $42,000 saved in my example could translate into hundreds of \nthousands of dollars more in available credit. This means money \navailable to help folks in eastern North Carolina rebuild their homes \nand lives after Hurricane Floyd. This means money to help revitalize \ninner-city neighborhoods. This means more money to help farmers who \nhave suffered crop damage. And it means money to help more Americans \nknow the joys of home ownership.\n  I would like to say a few words about safety and solvency of the \ninsurance funds. These funds, the BIF and SAIF, are administered by the \nFDIC and are used to pay insured depositors in the event of a bank or \nthrift failure. I am pleased to say that in these booming economic \ntimes, both funds are well above their statutorily required level. \nCurrent law requires each fund to have 1.25 percent of all insured \ndeposits. Right now, the BIF and SAIF are both well above this level, \nand the funds are growing.\n  In this legislation, we take great care to recognize the importance \nof protecting the insurance funds. In fact, we actually build in an \nadditional cushion to help insure the solvency of the funds. Only if \nthe funds are above 1.4 percent will excess money above that level be \nused to pay the FICO obligation. Moreover, we maintain the authority \nand ability of the FDIC to make necessary adjustments to the funds to \nprotect their solvency, should the need arise.\n  Right now, the money is sitting in an account here in Washington. I \nthink it can be put to better use in local communities. This \nlegislation represents a method to help do just that, without \nsacrificing the safety and soundness protections that are currently in \nplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1811-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        RECOGNITION OF WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY ON 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my number one priority as I \nrepresent the people of Washington state in the U.S. Senate is \nprotecting the Northwest way of life. An intricate part of that \nWashington way of life is preserving our healthy and productive forests \nand streams. With that goal in mind, I am delighted to recognize the \nCentennial Anniversary of the Weyerhaeuser Company--an organization \nwhose dedication to sustainable forestry has enriched Washington state \nwith both a vibrant timber industry and a tradition of preservation to \nkeep our forests healthy for generations to come.\n  In 1900, Frederick Weyerhaeuser and fifteen partners began the \ncompany that would revolutionize the timber industry. They purchased \n900,000 acres of Washington forest land from the Northern Pacific \nRailway and began the Weyerhaeuser Company. It quickly grew to become \none of the most vibrant and remarkable companies, not only in \nWashington state, but around the world.\n  The Weyerhaeuser Company had a vision for sustainable and \nenvironmentally responsible forest management before ``green'' became \nfashionable. In 1904, General Manager George Long sponsored a study to \nlook at the impacts of growing timber as a crop--replenishing the \nresource with every harvest. Under Long's leadership, Weyerhaeuser \npioneered many of the conservation, fire protection and reforestation \ntechniques used in forest management today.\n  I am proud of and thankful for the great legacy that Weyerhaeuser has \ngiven to Washington--the Evergreen State. I hope that with balanced \npolicies and responsible stewardship, Weyerhaeuser will continue to \nprosper in the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1811-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1811-S1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SENATOR MIKULSKI'S TRIP TO NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Mikulski recently returned \nfrom a visit to Northern Ireland, where she held productive discussions \nwith both Catholics and Protestants who are working together for \ncommunity and economic development. As columnist Thomas Oliphant wrote \nin a perceptive column on March 19 in the Boston Globe, Senator \nMikulski's trip, and her work for grassroots development and \ncooperation in these communities, are important both symbolically and \npractically.\n  As all of us who share the dream of a permanent and lasting peace are \naware, much remains to be done to carry out the peace process. I \ncommend Senator Mikulski for her initiative and leadership on this \nissue, and I ask that Mr. Oliphant's column about her trip may be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 19, 2000]\n\n                       New Optimism Out of Ulster\n\n                          (By Thomas Oliphant)\n\n       The brain connected to the freshest pair of eyes to look \n     into Northern Ireland in some time was somewhat surprised by \n     two things.\n       The first observation by Senator Barbara Mikulski was that \n     the six counties' political leaders are themselves surprised \n     at their inability to get out of the stalemate-ditches they \n     keep driving into.\n       The second was that during an intensive visit framed around \n     what's really exciting in the North these days--cross-\n     community, practical efforts by Protestants and Catholics to \n     get basic things done together--it was not until she got to \n     the seat of government at Stormont that she heard the word \n     ``decommissioning,'' the absurd euphemism that refers to the \n     turning in of weapons by paramilitary organizations.\n       What this shows is merely how the pull of the violent, \n     unjust sectarian past blocks a settlement that the people \n     want. It has been going on for the two years since the U.S.-\n     brokered Good Friday Agreement put all the building blocks \n     for reconciliation except local political will into place.\n       ``But,'' says the Maryland senator, ``even though the peace \n     process appears to be on hold, there is another informal but \n     absolutely crucial peace process going on at the community \n     and neighborhood level.''\n       Mikulski was referring to the overwhelming majority's \n     intense desire to put the Troubles in their past. That desire \n     is creating a ``social glue'' that has enormous potential for \n     Northern Ireland's long-range evolution.\n       By far the most important example exists under the umbrella \n     of the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust. Beneath this \n     umbrella exists all manner of activities that involve \n     Catholics and Protestants informally in specific tasks. There \n     are groups that include former prisoners as well as families \n     of the victims of violence and their survivors; organizations \n     working on environmental issues as well as community centers \n     and playgrounds; unions and microeconomic development \n     activists; work on mental health issues as well as children's \n     health problems. As Mikulski notes, it is all specific and \n     local--and loaded with implications.\n       The best symbol, in the North Belfast Community Development \n     Council, is the cellular phones in use during the Protestant \n     marching season. Rumors are chased down, Catholics hear that \n     a particular march will halt at a predesignated spot without \n     any triumphalist chanting and should thus be of no major \n     concern, and armed with that assurance, keep their own \n     hotheads in check.\n       A year ago, when some 50 of the trust's most active female \n     activists met with U.S. supporters, they were so fresh to \n     their cause and nervous about the impact that the names of \n     the participants were kept private. Mikulski arranged a \n     meeting for them with women in the U.S. Senate, most of whom \n     came to politics via similar routes of local activism.\n       Mikulski's involvement at this delicate stage is important \n     both because of what she has done and who she is. She got \n     into her business because of her fight against a highway. \n     Years later she remains a grass-roots political leader, able \n     to understand the byzantine nature of Northern Ireland's \n     street-level culture. And she is a powerful Democratic \n     senator on the Appropriations Committee who is comfortable \n     working across party lines.\n       Mikulski notes that the Fund for Ireland, the basic aid \n     network to which the U.S. government commits $20 million, is \n     an excellent\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\n     operation that has been especially useful in economic \n     development and other brick and mortar activities. But she \n     also suggests that the time has come to ``take a fresh look \n     at the U.S. role to think about supporting this cross-\n     communal activity.''\n       She is also blunt about looking at the trust's activities \n     and potential, official U.S. support without blinders. \n     ``Their idea, what makes them so worthwhile,'' she said, ``is \n     their very careful focus on specific needs and projects. This \n     is not some gooshy-poo, Irish sensitivity training where \n     everybody gets in a hot tub and bonds. It's serious work. The \n     fund has done a very good job, but I think we're now at a \n     different place.''\n       What she says about U.S. policy also should spark new \n     thinking about private American support for Ireland. Given \n     the roaring condition of the Irish Republic's economy, \n     traditional charity and philanthropy appears to be less \n     important than the cutting-edge activism across sectarian \n     lines of the trust's participants.\n       They cannot be a substitute for the appalling failure of \n     politicians in the North to transcend the past. But they do \n     demonstrate how much of a difference individuals can make \n     when they band together.\n       There now exist networks of community organizations that \n     personify the broader refusal to regress, and they need all \n     the support they can get. But they can't fill the vacuum \n     without their so-called leaders. ``It's like when you put \n     your VCR on pause,'' said Mikulski. ``It holds for a while, \n     but eventually the old tape starts playing again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1812-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF MR. BRUCE AKERS\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my \ncongratulations to Mr. Bruce Akers on the occasion of his retirement as \nsenior vice president for Civic Affairs at KeyBank in Cleveland, OH. \nBruce's accomplishments are not limited to his 40 years of service in \nthe banking industry, but extend to the difference he has made in the \nlives of countless citizens. His decades of leadership and generosity \nhave helped make Cleveland the great city it is today.\n  Bruce has served the public at many levels--in government, the \nprivate sector, and in civic organizations. From 1975 to 1977, he \nserved as executive secretary to Cleveland Mayor Ralph Perk. Today \nBruce continues to show his dedication to civic responsibility and \naction in local government through his service as mayor of Pepper Pike, \nOH.\n  Bruce is also committed to a number of Cleveland's cultural, \neducational, charitable and civic institutions including service as \nchairman of the KeyFoundation, a trustee of the Cleveland Council on \nWorld Affairs and president of the Cleveland Opera. I don't believe I \nwill ever forget Bruce's ``cameo'' appearance in the Cleveland Opera's \nrendition of Aida in 1984. He gave a tremendous performance that is \nstill talked about to this day.\n  Bruce's community commitment also extends to service as a trustee of \nthe Citizens League Research institute, membership on the Executive, \nCentral, and Policy Committee's of the Cuyahoga County Republican \nParty, membership on the Advisory Council of the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, membership on the Cleveland Leadership Prayer Breakfast \nSteering Committee, and chairman of Cleveland's Promise, the local \nbranch of America's Promise which strives to create an environment for \na better future.\n  Bruce's belief in volunteerism was recently celebrated in ``Cleveland \nLive,'' a news and information ``on-line'' publication serving the \nCleveland community, where he shared his philosophy on volunteering. \nBruce stated, ``volunteering is a four-way win: a win for the \norganization benefitting from the volunteers' services; a win for the \nvolunteers who gain new perspectives and feel self-fulfilled; a win for \nthe employer because the employee-volunteer is a better-rounded \nemployee; and a win for the community whose quality of life is \nimproved, thanks to effective, dedicated volunteers.'' I could not \nagree more with Bruce's assessment.\n  In 1975, Bruce's outreach to others earned him the Big Brother of the \nYear Award from Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Greater Cleveland. In 1993, \nhe received the Volunteer of the Year Award from Leadership Cleveland \nfor his dedication to making Cleveland a better place. Bruce has \nsupported the Salvation Army in a variety of initiatives throughout the \nyears, and for donating his time and energy, in 1997, he received the \nGeneral William Booth Award, the Salvation Army's highest award to a \ncivilian.\n  Bruce's career is an inspiration to those who look to form a better \nfuture through active participation in the community. While I know \nBruce Akers will enjoy his retirement with his wife Barbara, I also \nknow that he will not cease giving of himself in service to his fellow \nman.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Cleveland and of Ohio, I would like to \ncongratulate Bruce Akers and thank him for all he has done for his \ncommunity and his State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1812-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE GOOD FRIDAY PEACE ACCORDS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on March 17, 2000, the Irish \nand the Irish-at-heart around the world celebrated Saint Patrick's Day, \na day to remember the spirit of comradery, friendship, and peace the \npatron saint of Ireland brought to the Emerald Isle. I rise today to \npay tribute to the Irish people and the forty million Irish Americans \nin this country--who are also celebrating Irish-American Heritage \nMonth--and offer my thoughts on an issue close to their hearts and \nmine: peace in Northern Ireland.\n  The signing of the Good Friday Peace Accords on April 10, 1998 was an \nhistoric achievement in the quest for peace. After 32 years of conflict \nand bloodshed, the leaders of the principal Unionist and Nationalist \nparties in Northern Ireland agreed to a new governing structure for the \nprovince, one in which Catholics and Protestants would, for the first \ntime, share power in a new assembly and executive.\n  On May 22, 1998, the people of Ireland, in the North and in the \nSouth, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Accords. Their message was \nclear: it was time for a new era of peace based on reconciliation, \ncompassion, and respect.\n  Thanks in no small part to the tireless work of our former colleague, \nSenator George Mitchell, the power sharing executive finally came into \nexistence on December 1, 1999 and the formal devolution of power from \nLondon to the people of Northern Ireland took place. It appeared that \nthe Irish would finally be able to celebrate the true spirit of Saint \nPatrick's Day.\n  The quest for peace, however, took a step backwards when--on February \n11, 2000--the British government suspended the power sharing \ninstitutions and resumed direct rule of Northern Ireland from London. \nThe Good Friday Peace Accords is now hanging by a thread.\n  As I stated earlier, the people of Ireland, Protestants and \nCatholics, in the North and in the South, have made their feelings \nclear. They support the Good Friday Peace Accords. They support the \npower sharing institutions. They support peace and cooperation. They \nbelieve that the people of Northern Ireland should have the ability to \ngovern their own affairs.\n  Representatives of all parties in Northern Ireland met last week here \nin Washington with British and Irish leaders in an effort to break this \nimpasse and return home rule to Northern Ireland. I am hopeful that \ntheir efforts will prove to be successful.\n  I strongly support the Accords. They represent the best hope for a \nlasting peace in Northern Ireland. I urge all parties to stick to the \nagreement and make it work. They have a responsibility to keep their \nword to the Irish people and stop Northern Ireland from slipping back \nto the ways of the ``Hard Men'': intimidation, violence, and death.\n  On this day, let us reflect on the turmoil the Irish have endured for \nso many years and commend them for their tremendous hope, persistence, \nand hard work. Let us remember the true spirit of Saint Patrick's Day \nand renew our support for the Irish people in the North and the South \nwho desperately want, and deserve, a future of peace and \nprosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1812-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1812-S1813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF JOHN CASTILLO\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

MICHAEL AND SHAINIE SCHUFFLER\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor today to recognize \nthe contributions of two remarkable residents of my state, Dr. Michael \nand Shainie Schuffler, who have dedicated their lives to strengthening \ntheir community, fostering leadership qualities in our young people and \nworking tirelessly to improve the health of countless people.\n  Michael and Shainie met during their college years in Chicago where \nthey both shared a keen interest in medicine. In 1970, the couple moved \nto Seattle and have since continued to make the Seattle area a better \nplace. After their move to Seattle, Shainie became actively involved in \nthe Hadassah Hospital. Hadassah is a volunteer women's organization \nthat works to strengthen a partnership with Israel, ensure Jewish \ncontinuity, and realize their potential as a dynamic force in American \nsociety. In Seattle and around the United States, Hadassah enhances the \nquality of American and Jewish life through its education and Zionist \nyouth programs, promotes health awareness, and provides personal \nenrichment and growth for its members.\n  After joining Hadassah, Shainie found herself inspired by its \nfounder, Henrietta Szold, and has worked tirelessly for the past \nfifteen years on specific projects at both the chapter and regional \nlevels including the Women's Symposium and last year's Bigger Gifts \ndinner and has served as the President of Hadassah's Seattle Chapter.\n  Shainie's dedication to the Seattle community is also evident in her \nmany other involvements such as the Council of Women's Presidents for \nthe Jewish Federation, Jewish Family Service, and the Jewish Federation \nof Greater Seattle.\n  I believe that one of the most important aspects of Shainie's work is \nher dedication to today's youth. Under her leadership as the Seattle \narea's Director of Admissions for the Alexander Muss High School in \nIsrael, hundreds of local students have been given the opportunity to \nattend the Alexander Muss High School in Israel and has become one of \nthe most successful youth programs in Seattle. I applaud her tireless \nefforts and believe that her work has directly impacted the lives of \nthousands of people throughout our state.\n  Michael has been equally dedicated to both his career as a leading \ndoctor of Gastroenterology and as a volunteer in his community. Michael \nis a world authority on the pathology and clinical manifestations of \nneurological disorders of the intestinal tract and has been recognized \nby his colleagues for his many accomplishments.\n  Michael's work does not end, however, when he leaves the hospital. \nLike his wife, he has dedicated countless hours to Hadassah by serving \nas a visiting professor of Gastroenterology and as an Hadassah \nassociate. He has also worked to encourage leadership qualities in our \nchildren through the Jewish Federation's Young Leadership Program, \nserving as its co-chair for three years.\n  One of his greatest loves in life is pro-Israel activism and has \ndedicated his time to furthering this cause through American Israel \nPublic Affairs Committee otherwise known as AIPAC. He served as the \nChairman of AIPAC from 1986 to 1994, strengthening the support of AIPAC \nacross Washington state and furthering its reputation as the leading \norganization on United States-Israel relations.\n  Throughout their different commitments Michael and Shainie have \nalways supported one another and recognized the importance of each \nother's work. Theirs is a true partnership and one that has positively \nimpacted the people of our state. I ask my colleagues to join me as I \napplaud the outstanding and inspiring work of Dr. Michael and Shainie \nSchuffler.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1813-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 2366.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Missouri relative to the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 1034\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States enacted the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (P.L. 94-\n     142), now known as the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA), to ensure that all children with \n     disabilities in the United States have available to them a \n     free and appropriate public education that emphasizes special \n     education and related services designed to meet their unique \n     needs, to assure that the rights of children with \n     disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to \n     assist states and localities to provide for the education of \n     all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the \n     effectiveness of efforts to educate children with \n     disabilities; and\n       Whereas, since 1975, federal law has authorized \n     appropriation levels for grants to states under the IDEA at \n     forty percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in public \n     elementary and secondary schools in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Congress continued the forty-percent funding \n     authority in Public Law 105-17, the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997; and\n       Whereas, Congress has never appropriated funds equivalent \n     to the authorized level, has never exceeded the fifteen-\n     percent level, and has usually only appropriated funding at \n     about the eight-percent level; and\n       Whereas, the Missouri State Plan for Special Education was \n     approved for statewide implementation on the basis of the \n     anticipated federal commitment to fund special education \n     programs at the federally authorized level; and\n       Whereas, Missouri appropriated approximately $240 million \n     for the 2000 fiscal year in support for the state share of \n     funding for special education programs; and\n       Whereas, the State of Missouri received approximately $105 \n     million in federal special education funds under IDEA for the \n     1999-2000 school year, even though the federally authorized \n     level of funding would provide over $313 million annually to \n     Missouri; and\n       Whereas, local educational agencies in Missouri are \n     required to pay for the underfunded federal mandates for \n     special education programs, at a statewide total cost \n     approaching $208 million annually, from regular education \n     program money, thereby reducing the funding that is available \n     for other education programs; and\n       Whereas, the decision of the Supreme Court of the United \n     States in the case of Cedar Rapids Community School District \n     v. Garret F.

Sec. 701) and its implementing regulations (34 C.F.R. \n     104), which prohibit recipients of federal financial \n     assistance, including educational institutions, from \n     discriminating on the basis of disability, yet no federal \n     funds are available under that act for state grants; and\n       Whereas, Missouri is committed to providing a free and \n     appropriate public education to children and youth with \n     disabilities, in order to meet their unique needs; and\n       Whereas, the Missouri General Assembly is extremely \n     concerned that, since 1978, Congress has not provided states \n     with the full amount of financial assistance necessary to \n     achieve its goal of ensuring children and youth with \n     disabilities equal protection of the laws: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Missouri Senate, Second Regular Session, \n     Ninetieth General Assembly, That the President and Congress \n     of the United States are respectfully requested to provide \n     the full forty-percent federal share of funding for special \n     education program so that Missouri and other states \n     participating in these critical programs will not be required \n     to take funding from other vital state and local programs in \n     order to fund this underfunded federal mandate; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate be instructed to \n     prepare properly inscribed copies of this resolution for the \n     President and Vice President of the United States, to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, to the Majority \n     Leader of the Senate, to the Chair of the Senate Committee on \n     Budget, to the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget, to \n     the Chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, to the \n     Chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, to each \n     member of the Missouri Congressional delegation, and to the \n     United States Secretary of Education.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-448.

A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to increase the \nmaximum acreage of Federal leases for coal that may be held by an \nentity in any one State; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                  coal market competition act of 2000\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coal Market \nCompetition Act of 2000. The legislation would amend the Mineral \nLeasing Act to increase the acreage of coal leases. Companies need this \nassurance as they plan and finance their operations into the future. \nNow, more than ever, we need to diversify our Nation's resources. The \ncurrent oil prices are a daily reminder of what occurs when we allow \nthis country to be too dependent on foreign resources. It is time to \nfocus on domestic energy production and this legislation will \nfacilitate development of one of our Nation's abundant natural \nresources, coal.\n  Most of the coal produced in our Nation comes from mines west of the \nMississippi River and the vast majority of that coal is mined in \nwestern states with significant federal ownership of both the surface \nand mineral estates. In fact, my state of Wyoming is home to 11 of the \ntop 12 coal mines based on tonnage. We produced approximately one third \nof the total U.S. coal in 1999, with production exceeding 330 million \ntons last year. Not surprisingly Wyoming is also the leader in federal \ncoal lease acreage with approximately 145,000 federal acres under lease \nto 20 companies.\n  The current federal coal lease limitation under the Mineral Leasing \nAct of 1920 is 46,080 acres per state. An amendment of the Mineral \nLeasing Act in 1976 maintained the per-state limit and added a 100,000-\nacre nationwide limit for any one company. The state coal lease limit \nhas not been changed for 36 years. Coal, sodium, phosphate and oil and \ngas were all assigned identical or similar per state lease acreage \nlimitations in the 1926 amendments to the MLA (2,560 acres per state \nfor sodium, coal and phosphate, 2,560 acres per geologic structure and \n7,680 acres per state for oil and gas). The acreage limitation for each \nof these minerals was increased in the 1946 and 1948 MLA amendments \n(coal, sodium and phosphate to 5,120 per state in 1948; oil and gas to \n15,360 acres per state in 1946). The per state acreage limitation for \noil and gas leases was increased twice more (to 46,080 acres in 1957 \nand 246,080 acres in 1960) and the per state acreage ceiling for coal \n(and phosphate) leases was increased once more to 46,080 acres (and \n20,480 acres for phosphate) in 1964. In my view, it is time to address \nthe coal acreage limitations both on a state and national level.\n  The cap on coal needs to be raised to allow producers to remain \ncompetitive in the world-wide market. In Wyoming, the coal mine sizes \nwill need to increase in order to maintain economic competitiveness. \nOur coal industry has grown and prospered because its economic \ncompetitiveness allowed Wyoming to be the location of choice for new \nlow-sulfur coal capacity to serve much of the world. The scale of \nmining operations is much larger now.\n  In order for this competitiveness to continue, we must raise the \nacreage cap to alleviate concern from several companies in both Wyoming \nand Utah about the effect of the limitation on their planning and \nproduction abilities. Larger lease acreage areas are required to \njustify the significant capital investment necessary for mine \nexpansion. Under current leasing operations, the penalty for violation \nof the acreage limitation is lease cancellation. It is essential during \na time like now--when oil prices are soaring--that we diversify and \ndevelop our Nation's energy sources rather than be dependent on foreign \nsources. Expanding lease acreage will allow coal to be competitive and \nit is essential we have choices for energy here at home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2301. A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the design, planning, and construction of the Lakehaven \nwater reclamation project for the reclamation and reuse of water; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\n          lakehaven utility district water reclamation project\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I join Senator Murray from \nWashington State in introducing legislation that will authorize the \nBureau of Reclamation to develop a water reuse project with Lakehaven \nUtility District in Federal Way, WA.\n  The Lakehaven Utility District is one of Washington State's largest \nwater and sewer utilities, providing 10.5 million gallons of water a \nday to over 100,000 residents in South King County. The utility depends \non a groundwater supply system that is replenished by local \nprecipitation. As development in this Seattle suburb has increased, \naquifer recharge has diminished. The utility district recognizes it \nmust protect its precious resources and has undertaken several projects \nto ensure it will have an adequate water supply for future generations.\n  One of these projects involves extensive treatment of the utilities \neffluent for reuse. Some of the treated water will be used to irrigate \ngolf courses and other facilities, while the rest of the water will be \nreturned to the aquifer through injection wells. The techniques for \nwater reuse are innovative, yet proven, and have been implemented \nthroughout Nevada and California. Currently, the Lakehaven Utility \nDistrict discharges 6 million gallons of treated water into Puget Sound \nevery day. This new program will allow the district to reuse these \ncrucial resources while replenishing its precious groundwater supply.\n  This legislation amends title XVI of the Reclamation Projects \nAuthorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 to authorize the Bureau of \nReclamation to provide the Lakehaven Utility District the technical and \nfinancial assistance necessary to implement its reuse project.\n  I am pleased to support this project, which I believe is crucial to \nmaintaining wetlands and rivers in Washington State. The Northwest is \nfaced with a salmon crisis that demands every available drop of water \nremain in our streams and riparian areas. The Lakehaven Utility \nDistrict water reclamation project will ensure that the South King \nCounty community continues to rely on groundwater resources rather than \nturning to other sources that must be preserved for fish recovery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 2302. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe enhanced deduction for corporate donations of computer technology \nto public libraries and community centers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  community technology assistance act\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk recently \nabout the ``digital divide'' and the differences in the availability of \ninformation between the technological haves and have nots. With the \nemerging digital economy becoming a major driving force of our nation's \neconomic well-being, we must ensure that all Americans have the \ninformation tools and skills that are critical to full participation in \nthe new economy. Access to such tools is an essential step to ensure \nthat our economy grows strongly and that in the future no one is left \nbehind.\n  While we know that Americans are more connected to digital tools than \never before, the ``digital divide'' between certain demographic groups \nand regions of our country continues to persist and in many cases is \nwidening significantly. As a member of the Commerce Committee, \nSubcommittee on Communications, I am alarmed by these developments. \nJust consider:\n  A third of America's economic growth in recent years has come from \ninformation technologies, producing 19 million new jobs. Yet, while \nthirty percent of white Americans are connected to the Internet only 11 \nor 12 percent of African Americans or Hispanic Americans are on-line. \nHouseholds with incomes of at least $75,000 are more than 20 times as \nlikely to have access to the Internet as those at the lowest income \nlevels, and more than 9 times as likely to have a computer at home. \nAdditionally, citizens in rural areas, including large parts of my \nstate of Georgia, are less likely to be connected to the Internet than \nurban users. Regardless of income level, those living in rural areas \nare lagging behind in computer ownership and Internet access.\n  A viable alternative for many of these under served individuals is \nInternet access outside the home and statistics show that computer use \nat public libraries and community centers is on the rise. First of all, \namong all Americans, 17 percent use the Internet at some site outside \nthe home. Secondly, minorities are even more likely to use the Internet \nand pursue online courses and school research at even higher rates. \nThird, those earning less than $20,000 who use the Internet outside the \nhome are twice as likely to get their access through a public library \nor community center. Finally, Americans who are not in the labor force, \nsuch as retirees or homemakers, are twice as likely to use public \nlibraries for access.\n  Given the ``digital divide'' among these demographic groups, and the \ndependence of many Americans on the use of technology outside the home, \nespecially at libraries and community centers, I am introducing today \nthe Community Technology Assistance Act. Currently, the special \nenhanced tax deduction exists in the case of computer equipment donated \nto elementary and secondary schools. My bill would extend for five \nyears the special enhanced tax deduction, currently scheduled to expire \nat the end of this year, and would expand it to include computer \ndonations to libraries and community centers as well as to elementary \nand secondary schools. Consider the many high profile technology and \nInternet related companies, such as Microsoft, Intel and AmericaOnline, \nthat have donated computer equipment and web access to schools and \nuniversities across America. My bill would make it easier for companies \nand individuals to invest in their community and jump start efforts to \nhelp bridge the ``digital divide'' in rural and low income areas \neverywhere.\n  Ensuring access to the fundamental tools of the digital economy is \none of the most significant investments our nation can make. Our \ncountry's most important resource is its people. Our companies are only \nas good as their workers. Highly-skilled, well educated workers make \nfor stellar businesses and create superior products. In a society that \nincreasingly relies on computers and the Internet to deliver \ninformation and enhance communication, we need to make sure that all \nAmericans have access. Our domestic and global economies will demand \nit. Ready access to telecommunications tools will help produce the kind \nof technology-literate work force that will enable the United States to \ncontinue to be a leader in the global economy well into the 21st \nCentury and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2302\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase \nout the taxation of Social Security benefits; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                    older americans tax fairness act\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Older \nAmericans Tax Fairness Act. This legislation would eliminate--yes, \neliminate--the unfair tax on Social Security benefits in this country.\n  Last week, this body, the Senate, took a historic step toward giving \nsenior citizens more financial freedom and retirement security by \npassing legislation to repeal the earnings limit on Social Security \nbenefits. We seized an opportunity to allow seniors to continue to work \nand contribute their skills and knowledge to the most vibrant economy \nin recent memory.\n  While the U.S. economy is currently reporting the lowest unemployment \nnumber in years, employers are finding that labor is difficult to come \nby and they are searching for ways to address this challenge. \nIncreasingly, they are turning to senior citizens to fill the void. \nHowever, many seniors are finding that while they may want to work to \nbetter their standard of living or have to work to make ends meet, they \nare being hit by an additional tax burden, one that taxes their Social \nSecurity benefits--their retirement security, in other words--such that \nworking, in many cases, is not financially beneficial to them.\n  When the Social Security program was first established by Congress, \nCongress did not intend for benefits to be taxed at all. In fact, \nSocial Security benefits were exempt from Federal taxes for half a \ncentury. But because of a financial crisis within the program in the \neighties and President Clinton's desire to fund new programs in 1993, \nseniors who earn a modest wage now find that anywhere between 50 and 85 \npercent of their Social Security benefits are taxed in America. This \ntax on Social Security benefits is misguided, I believe, and only acts \nto penalize hard-working and productive senior members of society. As \nworkers, these senior citizens are taxed when they earn their money, as \nwe all know, they are taxed when the Government returns it in the form \nof Social Security benefits, and if they are smart enough or lucky \nenough to save it to give it to their children or grandchildren, they \nwill have to pay estate taxes, or a death tax, before anyone sees a \npenny, in a lot of cases.\n  Not only is this essentially double taxation to some of our most \nvulnerable citizens, our seniors, it is harmful to many seniors. Many \nseniors need to work in order to pay for costly health insurance \npremiums, prescription drugs, and other expenses which they incur as \nthey grow older. For these seniors, working is not a choice, it is a \nnecessity.\n  If we eliminate the tax on Social Security benefits in America, most \nseniors would have more disposable income to pay for many of these \nnecessities of life. But rather than helping them, I believe we hurt \nthem--that is, the seniors--by taxing their Social Security benefits, \nlowering their standard of living, and decreasing the amount of \ndisposable income they have available to them.\n  What many fail to recognize is, working seniors continue to \ncontribute to the economy not only in terms of knowledge and added \nproductivity but by paying taxes on their earnings and paying into the \nSocial Security trust fund without ever recognizing an additional \nbenefit.\n  Clearly, the benefits seniors provide to our economy in terms of \ninvestment, knowledge, and skills far outweigh the minimal costs to the \nTreasury of repealing this unjust tax on Social Security.\n  This tax on Social Security benefits implies the Federal Government \nthinks senior citizens have nothing to contribute in the way of \neffectiveness, efficiency, experience, or knowledge to the workforce. \nYou know and I know this is not true.\n  Senior citizens are our most valuable resource. They can provide \nknowledge, insight, and experience to our booming economy. And they do. \nWe should treat them fairly and allow them to continue to earn and to \nsave without imposing a discriminatory ``old age tax'' simply because \nthey want to continue to contribute to society.\n  Responsible seniors--who plan for their retirement, who save and \ninvest for the future, and who strive to leave something to future \ngenerations--are finding that it is just not worth it. At a time when \nwe are trying to encourage savings and investment, it does not make \nsense to continue to tax Social Security benefits.\n  I am today encouraging my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nOlder Americans Tax Fairness Act to bring additional fairness and \nfreedom to the lives of millions of our most respected Americans.\n  Let's repeal the tax on Social Security benefits. Let's make it like \nit used to be. It is the right thing for the seniors in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Brownback, and Mr. Roth):\n  S. 2306. A bill to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nFederal Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  Government for the 21st Century Act\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Government \nfor the 21st Century Act, a bill to establish a commission to bring the \nstructure and functions of our Government in line with the needs of our \nNation in the new century. This bipartisan legislation was the result \nof work done by the Governmental Affairs Committee last Congress and is \nvirtually identical to S. 2623, 105th Congress. The bill has been \ncarefully crafted to address not just what our Government should look \nlike, but the more fundamental question of what it should do.\n  Clearly, the time has come to take a comprehensive and fresh look at \nwhat the Federal Government does and how it goes about doing it. \nDespite these good economic times, polls repeatedly show that Americans \nhave little trust or confidence in the Federal Government. They want \nthe Federal Government to work, but they don't think that it does.\n  Unfortunately, our citizens have ample reason for concern. The \nFederal Government of today is a cacophony of agencies and programs, \nmany of which are directed at the same problems. Much of what \nWashington does is inefficient and wasteful. Few would dispute that the \ngovernment in Washington cannot do effectively all it is now charged \nwith doing. When it comes to specifics, however, changing things is\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\nextremely difficult. Virtually every Federal agency and program has an \nentrenched constituency to shield it from scrutiny and fend off \nchallenges to the status quo. Hence, the familiar axiom that the \nclosest thing to immortality is a Washington spending program.\n  Federal agencies and programs have mushroomed over time, evolving in \na largely random manner to respond to the real or perceived needs of \nthe moment. Consequently, duplication and fragmentation abound. There \nis an obvious need to bring some order out of this chaos. As former \nComptroller General Charles Bowsher stated in testimony before the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee in 1995:\n\n       The case for reorganizing the Federal government is an easy \n     one to make. Many departments and agencies were created in a \n     different time and in response to problems very different \n     from today's. Many have accumulated responsibilities beyond \n     their original purposes. As new challenges arose or new needs \n     were identified, new programs and responsibilities were added \n     to departments and agencies with insufficient regard to their \n     effects on the overall delivery of services to the public.\n\n  The situation has not improved since then. Just last month, the \ncurrent Comptroller General, David Walker, recited an all too familiar \nlitany of duplication, waste, mismanagement, and other Federal \nperformance problems in testimony before the Senate and House Budget \nCommittees. The GAO ``high-risk list'' of those Federal activities most \nvulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse has grown from 14 problem areas \nin 1990 to 26 problem areas today. Only one high-risk problem has been \nremoved since 1995. Ten of the 14 original high-risk problems are still \non the list today--a full decade later. Likewise, inspectors general \nidentify much the same critical performance problems in their agencies \nyear after year. Collectively, these core performance problems cost \nFederal taxpayers countless billions of dollars each year in outright \nwaste. They also exact an incalculable toll on the ability of agencies \nto carry out their missions and serve the needs of our citizens.\n\n  Of course, meaningful reform of the Federal Government will not come \nfrom simply reshuffling current organizational boxes and redistributing \ncurrent programs. We need to conduct a fundamental review of what \nWashington does and why. Our Founding Fathers envisioned a government \nof defined and limited powers. Imagine their dismay if they knew the \nsize and scope of the Federal government today. We need to return to \nthe limited but effective government that the Founders intended. This \nmeans divesting the Federal Government of functions it is not well \nsuited to perform. However, it also means ensuring that the Federal \nGovernment does a better job of performing those core constitutional \nfunctions for which our citizens must rely on it.\n  The commission established in the legislation we are introducing \ntoday is a major step in that direction. It will take a hard look at \nFederal departments, agencies and programs and ask such questions as:\n  How can we restructure agencies and programs to improve the \nimplementation of their statutory missions, eliminate activities not \nessential to their statutory missions, and reduce duplication of \nactivities?\n  How can we improve management to maximize productivity, effectiveness \nand accountability of performance results?\n  What criteria should we use in determining whether a Federal activity \nshould be privatized?\n  Which departments or agencies should be eliminated because their \nfunctions are obsolete, redundant, or could be better performed by \nstate and local governments or the private sector?\n  Obviously, these questions involve subjective policy decisions. \nHowever, policy decisions should be the product of honest and open \ndebate that stems from objective and fact-based analysis. I am \nconvinced that this analysis can best be provided by an independent, \nnonpartisan commission that is removed from the normal pressures of \nWashington.\n  The commission will have many information sources available to it. \nThe first cycle of implementation of the Government Performance and \nResults Act of 1993 will be complete by the end of this month when \nagencies submit their first performance reports. The plans and reports \nthat agencies have submitted under the Results Act, while far from \nperfect, should provide a more comprehensive framework for reviewing \nFederal missions and performance than we have had before.\n  I am pleased that Senators Lieberman  and Voinovich are joining me in \nintroducing the bill today, and I thank them for the time and staff \nthey have devoted to the effort. I look forward to working with them on \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Government for the 21st Century Act, \nalong with a brief summary and section-by-section analysis, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2306\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

By December 1, \n     2002, the Commission shall submit to the President and \n     Congress a preliminary report containing recommendations on \n     restructuring the Federal Government.

After 30 days, the bills may be \n     considered by the full House and Senate and are subject to \n     amendment.\n       Implementation: Once legislation effecting the Commission's \n     recommendations is enacted, the Office of Management and \n     Budget shall be responsible for implementing it. The General \n     Accounting Office shall report to Congress on the progress of \n     implementation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Government for the 21st Century Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                   seciton 1. short title and purpose\n\n       This act may be cited as the ``Government for the 21st \n     Century Act.'' Its purpose is to reduce the cost and increase \n     the effectiveness of the Executive Branch. It achieves this \n     by creating a commission to propose to Congress and the \n     President a plan to reorganize departments and agencies, \n     consolidate redundant activities, streamline operations, and \n     decentralize service delivery in a manner that promotes \n     economy, efficiency, and accountability in government \n     programs.\n\n\n                         section 2. definitions\n\n       This section defines ``agency'' to include all Federal \n     departments, independent agencies, government-sponsored \n     enterprises and government corporations, and defines \n     ``private sector'' as any business, partnership, association, \n     corporation, educational institution, nonprofit organization, \n     or individual.\n\n\n                       section 3. the commission\n\n       This section establishes a commission, known as the \n     Commission on Government Restructuring and Reform, to make \n     recommendations to reform and restructure the Executive \n     Branch.

The Commission \n     shall also recommend criteria by which to determine which \n     functions of government should be privatized.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nThompson, Voinovich, Brownback and Roth today to introduce the \nGovernment for the 21st Century Act. This bill provides an opportunity \nto address the challenges our government will face in the new \nmillennium. Our country is undergoing rapid changes--changes brought \nabout by technological advancements, by our expanding and increasingly \nglobal economy, and by the new and more diverse threats to our nation \nand our world. It is essential for our government to be prepared to \nrespond effectively to these challenges.\n  We should take the opportunity now to rethink the structure of our \ngovernment to be sure it can meet the needs of our citizens in the \nyears to come. The Commission that will be established under this bill \nwill have a critical task--to study the current shape of our government \nand to make recommendations about how we can improve its efficiency and \neffectiveness, streamline its operations, and eliminate unnecessary \nduplication.\n  I view the bill we are introducing today as a discussion draft. Our \ngoal is to hear from a wide range of experts on government and \nmanagement. I look\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\nforward to reviewing new ideas that will enhance the value of the \nCommission's work. For example, I intend to recommend that the \nCommission focuses on the enormous potential benefit of ``E-\ngovernment.'' The Commission should consider how government can be \nrestructured to promote the innovative use of information technology. \nAmerican citizens increasingly expect services and information to be \nprovided electronically through Internet-based technology. While the \nfederal government is working to take advantage of the opportunities \ntechnology presents to do its job better, more needs to be done to \nfully integrate these capabilities and to offer services and \ninformation to Americans in a more accessible and cost-effective way.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Thompson, Brownback, Roth and \nVoinovich on this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Johnson, \n        and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 2307. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to encourage \nbroadband deployment to rural America, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    rural broadband enhancement act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am, along with Senator Daschle, \nSenator Baucus and Senator Johnson, introducing the Rural Broadband \nEnhancement Act to deploy broadband technology to rural America. As the \ndemand for high speed Internet access grows, numerous companies are \nresponding in areas of dense population. While urban America is quickly \ngaining high speed access, rural America is--once again--being left \nbehind. Ensuring that all Americans have the technological capability \nis essential in this digital age. It is not only an issue of fairness, \nbut it is also an issue of economic survival.\n  To remedy the gap between urban and rural America, this legislation \ngives new authority to the Rural Utilities Service to make low interest \nloans to companies that are deploying broadband technology to rural \nAmerica. Loans are made on a company neutral and a technology neutral \nbasis so that companies that want to serve these areas can do so by \nemploying technology that is best suited to a particular area. Without \nthis program, market forces will pass by much of America, and that is \nunacceptable.\n  This issue is not a new one. When we were faced with electrifying all \nof the country, we enacted the Rural Electrification Act. When \ntelephone service was only being provided to well-populated \ncommunities, we expanded the Rural Electrification Act and created the \nRural Utilities Service to oversee rural telephone deployment. The \nequitable deployment of broadband services is only the next step in \nkeeping America connected, and our legislation would ensure that.\n  If we fail to act, rural America will be left behind once again. As \nthe economy moves further and further towards online transactions and \ncommunications, rural America must be able to participate. \nHistorically, our economy has been defined by geography, and we in \nCongress were powerless to do anything about it. Where there were \nports, towns and businesses got their start. Where there were railroad \ntracks, towns and businesses grew up around them. The highway system \nbrought the same evolution.\n  But the Internet is changing all of that. No longer must economic \ngrowth be defined by geographic fiat. Telecommunications industries and \npolicy-makers are proclaiming, ``Distance is dead!'' But, that's not \nquite right: Distance will be dead, as long as Congress ensures that \nbroadband services are available to all parts of America, urban and \nrural.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Daschle, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Johnson and my other colleagues in the Senate to pass this \nlegislation and give rural America a fair chance to survive.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Graham, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2308. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nassure preservation of safety net hospitals through maintenance of the \nMedicaid disproportionate share hospital program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n              the medicaid safety net hospital act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleagues, \nSenators Graham and Feinstein, in introducing legislation to ensure \nthat our safety net hospitals continue to be able to care for the poor \nand the uninsured.\n  The Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program provides \nvital funding to safety net hospitals that primarily serve Medicaid and \nuninsured patients. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 placed declining \nstate-specified ceilings on federal Medicaid DSH spending from 1998-\n2002. In 2003, the limits will begin to be adjusted upwards for \ninflation. The Medicaid Safety Net Hospital Act of 2000 would freeze \nthe state-specific caps at this year's limits (thereby preventing \nfurther declines in the limits) and adjust them for inflation beginning \nin 2002.\n  It is essential to provide much-needed support to our safety net \nhospitals. The number of uninsured in the United States increases every \nyear, in part because of declining Medicaid enrollment as a result of \nwelfare reform. There are now 44 million Americans without health \ninsurance who have no choice but to turn to the emergency rooms of \nsafety net hospitals for care. Yet, even as demands on safety net \nhospitals increase, DSH spending per State is being further reduced. \nThe Medicaid Safety Net Hospital Act of 2000 would maintain significant \nsavings achieved by prior reductions but would protect safety net \nhospitals from further DSH cuts. As a result, hospitals would have \naccess to the financing they need for achieving their social mission.\n  Mr. President, Congress should act now to preserve the financial \nability of our safety net hospitals to provide health care to the poor \nand uninsured/\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2308\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicaid Safety Net Hospital \n     Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FREEZING MEDICAID DSH ALLOTMENTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001 \n                   AT LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000.\n\n       Section 1923(f) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396r-4(f)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) in the heading, by striking ``2002'' and inserting \n     ``2001'';\n       (B) in the matter preceding the table, by striking ``2002'' \n     and inserting ``2001 (and the DSH allotment for a State for \n     fiscal year 2001 is the same as the DSH allotment for the \n     State for fiscal year 2000, as determined under the following \n     table)''; and\n       (C) by striking the columns in the table relating to FY 01 \n     and FY 02 (fiscal years 2001 and 2002); and\n       (2) in paragraph (3)--\n       (A) in the heading, by striking ``2003'' and inserting \n     ``2002''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``2003'' and inserting \n     ``2002''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nMedicaid Safety Net Hospital Act of 2000, a bill that would freeze \nMedicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals at \ntheir 2000 level for Fiscal Year 2001 and 2002. I hope the Senate can \nact promptly on this bill.\n  The number of people in our nation who have no medical insurance has \nhit some 44 million. This is tragic. More than 100,000 people join the \nranks of the uninsured monthly. We cannot continue to reduce payments \nto hospitals that provide care for the uninsured. We cannot balance the \nbudget on the backs of poor people who show up at emergency rooms with \nno insurance or on the backs of the hospitals that tend to them.\n  California bears a disproportionate burden of uncompensated care. \nTwenty-four percent of our population is uninsured. Nationwide, the \nrate is 17 percent. Currently, over 7 million Californians are \nuninsured. During the past few months, I have met with many California \nhealth care leaders. They fear that the Medicaid cuts contained in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 have undermined the financial stability of \nCalifornia's health care system, which many believe to be on the verge \nof collapse.\n  As a result of Medicaid reductions in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, California's Medicaid Disproportionate\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\nShare Hospital program could lose more than $280 million by 2002. \nFederal Medicaid DSH payments to California have declined by more than \n$116 million in the past two years and are slated to be cut by an \nadditional $164 million--17 percent--over the next two years.\n  Without this bill, for example, by Fiscal Year 2002 Los Angeles \nCounty- University of Southern California Medical Center will lose \n$13.5 million. San Francisco General will lose $5.2 million. Fresno \nCommunity Hospital will lose $10.5 million. Over 132 California \nhospitals, representing rural and urban communities, depend on Medicaid \nDSH payments. Under this bill, millions of dollars will be restored to \nCalifornia public hospitals.\n  Public hospitals carry a disproportionate share of caring for the \npoor and uninsured. Forty percent of all California uninsured hospital \npatients were treated at public hospitals in 1998, up from 32 percent \nin 1993. The uninsured as a share of all discharges from public \nhospitals grew from 22 percent in 1993 to 29 percent in 1998. While \noverall public hospital discharges declined from 1993 to 1999 by 15 \npercent, discharges for uninsured patients increased by 11 percent. \nLarge numbers of uninsured add huge uncompensated costs to our public \nhospitals.\n  The uninsured often choose public hospitals and frequently wait until \ntheir illnesses or injuries require emergency treatment. This makes \ntheir care even more costly. California's emergency rooms are strained \nto the breaking point. Last week at a California State Senate hearing, \nDr. Dan Abbott, an emergency room physician at St. Jude Hospital in \nFullerton, California said: ``We feel that emergency care in California \nis overwhelmed, it's underfunded and at times, frankly, it is out-and-\nout dangerous.'' Statewide, 19 emergency rooms have closed since 1997 \ndespite an increase in the number of uninsured requiring care. The \nburden to provide care is put on those hospitals who have managed to \nremain open, and many of those hospitals are currently facing financial \nproblems of their own.\n  California's health care system, in the words of a November 15th Wall \nStreet Journal article, is a ``chaotic and discombobulated \nenvironment.'' It is stretched to the limit:\n  Thirty-seven California hospitals have closed since 1996, and up to \n15 percent more may close by 2005.\n  Earlier this month, Scripps Memorial Hospital East County closed its \ndoors due in part to reimbursement problems.\n  Eighty-six California hospitals operated in the red in 1999.\n  Academic medical centers, which incur added costs unique to their \nmission, are facing margins reduced to zero and below.\n  Sixty-two percent of California hospitals are now losing money. Due \nto the large number of Medicare and Medicaid patients, sixty-nine \npercent of California's rural hospitals lost money in 1998, according \nto the California Healthcare Association.\n  Hospitals have laid off staff, limited hours of operation, and \ndiscontinued services.\n  California physician groups are failing at the rate of one a week, \nwith 115 bankruptcies or closures since 1996.\n  In short, restoring Medicaid cuts is crucial to stabilizing \nCalifornia's health delivery system.\n  Circumstances have changed since 1997 when we passed the Balanced \nBudget Act. We have eliminated the federal deficit. Because we have a \nrobust economy, lower inflation, higher GDP growth and lower \nunemployment, we also have lowered Medicaid spending growth more than \nanticipated. This climate provides us an opportunity to revisit the \nreductions contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and to \nstrengthen the stability of health care services, a system that in my \nState is on the verge of unraveling.\n  We need to pass this bill. Without it, we could have a more severe \nhealth care crisis on our hands, especially in California. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in passing this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 2309. A bill to establish a commission to assess the performance \nof the civil works function of the Secretary of the Army; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\nCorps of Engineers Civil Works Independent Investigation and Review Act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, over the last couple of months the \nWashington Post has published a number of very troubling articles about \nthe operations of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  These stories expose the existence of independent agendas within the \nCorps. They suggest cost-benefit analyses rigged to justify billion \ndollar projects; disregard for environmental laws, and a pattern of \ncatering to special interests.\n  The actions described in the Post articles raise serious questions \nabout the accountability of the Corps. And they present a compelling \ncase for a thorough review of the agency's operations and management.\n  And it is not only the Post articles that cause me to believe this.\n  The Corps' current effort to update the Missouri River Master Control \nManual--the policy document that governs the Corps' management of the \nriver from Montana to Missouri--illustrates not only that the Corps can \nbe indifferent to the environment. Too often, it actually erects \ninstitutional barriers that make achieving certain critical ecological \ngoals difficult or impossible.\n  This ought to be a concern to all Americans. It is a deep concern to \nSouth Dakotans. The Missouri runs down the center of our state and is a \nmajor source of income, recreation and pride for us.\n  More than 40 years ago, the Corps built dams up and down the Missouri \nRiver in order to harness hydroelectric power. In return, it promised \nto manage the river wisely and efficiently.\n  That promise has not been kept.\n  Silt has built up, choking the river in several spots.\n  In recent years, studies have been done to determine how to restore \nthe river to health. An overwhelming amount of scientific and technical \ndata all point to the same conclusion.\n  The flow of the river should more closely mimic nature. Flows should \nbe higher in the spring, and lower in the summer--just as they are in \nnature.\n  Yet the Corps proposes to continue doing largely what it has been \ndoing all these years--knowing the consequences, knowing exactly what \nthe practices have produced now for the last 50-plus years.\n  The agency's refusal to change will further jeopardize endangered \nspecies. And, it will continue to erode the recreational value of the \nriver, which is 12 times more important to the economy than its \nnavigational value.\n  Why does the Corps insist--despite all the evidence--on this course?\n  It does it to protect the barge industry--a $7 million-a-year \nindustry that American taxpayers already spend $8 million a year to \nsupport. $8 million. That's how much American taxpayers pay each year \nfor channel maintenance, to accommodate the barge industry.\n  The Washington Post suggests that the Corps handling of the Missouri \nRiver Master Manual is not an isolated case.\n  The Post articles contain allegations by a Corps whistleblower who \nsays that a study of proposed upper-Mississippi lock expansions was \nrigged to provide an economic justification for that billion-dollar \nproject.\n  In response to these allegations, the Corps' own Office of Special \nCounsel concluded that the agency--quote-- ``probably broke laws and \nengaged in a gross waste of funds.''\n  In my own dealings with the Corps of Engineers, I too have \nexperienced the institutional problems recorded so starkly in the Post \nseries.\n  In South Dakota, where the Corps operates four hydroelectric dams, we \nhave fought for more than 40 years to force the agency to meet its \nresponsibilities under the 1958 Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and \nmitigate the loss of wildlife habitat resulting from the construction \nof those dams.\n  For 40 years, the Corps has failed to meet those responsibilities.\n  That is why I have worked closely with the Governor of my state, Bill \nJanklow, and with many other South Dakotans, to come up with a plan to \ntransfer of Corps lands back to the state of South Dakota and two \nIndian tribes.\n  Unfortunately, instead of attempting to work with us, the Corps is \nfighting us.\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\n  The litany of excuses, scare tactics and misinformation the Corps \nemployed to try to defeat our proposal is outrageous. It appears Corps \nofficials are not nearly as concerned with preserving the river as they \nare with preserving their own bureaucracy.\n  After the legislation was enacted, the Chief of the Engineers, \nGeneral Joseph Ballard continued to resist its implementation. In fact, \nmy own experiences with the Corps, and the experiences of other \nmembers, repeatedly demonstrates General Ballard's unwillingness to \nfollow civilian direction and ensure the faithful implementation of the \nlaw.\n  When considered in the context of the litany of problems that have \ncome to light in the Post series, Congress has no choice but to \nconsider seriously moving the responsibilities of the Corps from the \nArmy and placing them within the Department of the Interior. Too much \npower now is concentrated in the hands of the Chief of the Engineers, \nand that power too often has been abused.\n  General Ballard's lack of responsiveness to the law, to meeting \nenvironmental objectives and to civilian direction, has serious \nconsequences for individual projects.\n  Beyond that, it raises very troubling questions about the lack of \nmeaningful civilian control over this federal agency.\n  In a democracy, institutions of government must be held accountable. \nThat is the job of Congress--to hold them responsible.\n  The existence of separate agendas within the Corps bureaucracy cannot \nbe tolerated if our democracy is to succeed in representing the will of \nthe people. Its elected representatives and the civil servants \nappointed by them must maintain control of the apparatus of government.\n  Moreover, contempt for environmental laws and self-serving economic \nanalyses simply cannot be tolerated if Congress is to make well-\ninformed decisions regarding the authorization of expensive projects, \nand if the American taxpayer is to be assured that federal monies are \nbeing spent wisely.\n  The Corps of Engineers provides a valuable national service. It \nconstructs and manages needed projects throughout the country.\n  The size and scope of the biannual Water Resources Development Act is \nclear evidence of the importance of the Corps' civil works mission.\n  Because the Corps' work is so critical, it is essential that steps be \ntaken immediately to determine the extent of the problems within the \nagency--and to design meaningful and lasting reforms to correct them.\n  Our nation needs a civil works program we can depend on. We need a \nCorps of Engineers that conducts credible analysis.\n  We need a Corps that balances economic development and environmental \nprotection as required by its mandate--not one that ignores \nenvironmental laws as it chooses.\n  History does not offer much room for confidence that the Army Corps \nof Engineers can meet these standards under its current management \nstructure. Therefore, I am introducing legislation today to establish \nan independent Corps of Engineers Investigation and Review Commission.\n  The commission will take a hard and systemic look at the agency and \nmake recommendations to Congress on needed reforms.\n  It will examine a number of issues, including:\n  The effectiveness of civilian control in the Corps, particularly the \neffectiveness of the relationship between uniformed officers and the \nAssistant Secretary for civil works with regard to responsiveness, \nlines of authority, and coordination;\n  The Corps' compliance with environmental laws--including the Fish and \nWildlife Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act and NEPA--in the \ndesign and operation of projects;\n  The quality and objectivity of the agency's scientific and economic \nanalysis;\n  The extent to which the Corps coordinates and cooperates with other \nstate and federal agencies in designing and implementing projects;\n  The appropriateness of the agency's size, budget and personnel; and\n       Whether the civil works program should be transferred from \n     the Corps to a civilian agency, and whether certain \n     responsibilities should be privatized.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review this legislation.\n  It is my hope that all those who care about the integrity of the Army \nCorps of Engineers and its mission will support this effort to identify \nand implement whatever reforms are necessary to rebuild public support \nfor its work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 43. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress \nthat the President of the United States should encourage free and fair \nelections and respect for democracy in Peru; read the first time.\n\n\n              support for elections and democracy in Peru\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution urging free and fair elections and respect for democratic \nprinciples in Peru. I join with my colleagues, Senator Leahy, Senator \nHelms, and Senator DeWine to express concern about the transparency and \nfairness of the current electoral campaign in Peru.\n  Several independent election monitors have issued distressing reports \non the conditions surrounding the upcoming April 9 elections in Peru. A \nCarter Center/National Democratic Institute delegation has concluded \nthat conditions for a free election campaign have not been established. \nTheir report states that ``the electoral environment in Peru is \ncharacterized by polarization, anxiety and uncertainties . . . \nIrreparable damage to the integrity of the electoral process has \nalready been done.'' The Organization of American States (OAS) has come \nto similar conclusions. An OAS special rapporteur recently concluded \nthat ``Peru lacks that necessary conditions to guarantee the complete \nexercise of the right to express political ideas that oppose or \ncriticize the government.''\n  These reports, and others, detail the Peruvian Government's control \nof key official electoral agencies, systematic restrictions on freedom \nof the press, manipulation of the judicial process to stifle \nindependent news outlets, and harassment or intimidation of opposition \npoliticians--all with the aim of limiting the ability of opposition \ncandidates to campaign freely. Such reports raise serious concerns \nabout the openness in which the electoral campaign is being conducted \nand whether free and fair elections will actually occur.\n  Mr. President, this is a disturbing, though not necessarily \nsurprising, trend for a government that already has an inconsistent \nrecord on democracy and the rule of law. Despite his many \naccomplishments, President Fujimori has often demonstrated little \nrespect for democratic principles--his infamous ``auto-coup'', or \ndissolution of Congress, and his current bid for a third Presidential \nterm being the best examples. In addition, the current crackdown on \nindependent media highlights Peru's dismal record on press freedom \nunder Fujimori. Freedom House rates only two countries in the \nHemisphere, Peru and Cuba, as having a press that is ``not free.'' \nAccording to Freedom House, since 1992 media outlets have been \npressured into self-censorship or exile by a government campaign of \nintimidation, abductions, death threats, arbitrary detention, and \nphysical mistreatment. The case of Baruch Ivcher is a good example. In \nSeptember 1997, a government-controlled court stripped Ivcher of his \nmedia business and his Peruvian citizenship after the station ran \nreports linking the military to torture and corruption. In 1998, Ivcher \nwas sentenced in absentia to 12 years imprisonment.\n  The continued intimidation of journalists, and the lack of truly \nindependent judicial and legislative branches threaten democracy and \nthe rule of law in Peru. Indeed, Peru, could be said to be undergoing a \n``slow-motion coup.'' Though not under attack in a violent or \nconspicuous manner, democracy and the rule of law in Peru are \nincreasingly in question.\n  Mr. President, if one considers the incredible spread of democracy \naround the world over the last century, and in particular over the last \ntwenty years, such a development is indeed disturbing. Consider the \nfollowing: according to Freedom House, of the 192 sovereign states in \nexistence today, 119 of them are considered true democracies. In 1950, \njust 22 countries were democracies, meaning that nearly 100 nations \nhave made the transition over this half century. Nowhere was there a \nmore dramatic change than in our own back yard. In 1981, 18 of the 33 \nnations in the hemisphere were under some\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\nform of authoritarian rule. By the beginning of the 1990's, all but \none--Castro's Cuba--had freely elected heads of state.\n  Despite these gains, freedom in the hemisphere remains fragile and \nuncertain--Peru being just one example. After 7 years of neglect by the \ncurrent administration, some of the hard-fought victories for freedom \nin Latin America are weakened and in jeopardy. There is no doubt that \nif the elections are not deemed to be free and fair, it will represent \na major setback for the people of Peru and for democracy in the \nhemisphere.\n  Mr. President, we must recommit ourselves to nurturing and protecting \nthe gains of freedom around the world, but with great attention on our \nown hemisphere. A message must be sent to President Fujimori that if \ndemocratic processes are not respected, their economic and diplomatic \nrelations will suffer. This message should be unanimous from every \nnation in the region, and not just from the United States. A breach of \ndemocracy, especially in this hemisphere, must not be allowed to stand.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 43\n\n       Whereas presidential and congressional elections are \n     scheduled to occur in Peru on April 9, 2000;\n       Whereas independent election monitors have expressed grave \n     doubts about the fairness of the electoral process due to the \n     Peruvian Government's control of key official electoral \n     agencies, systematic restrictions on freedom of the press, \n     manipulation of the judicial processes to stifle independent \n     reporting on radio, television, and newspaper outlets, and \n     harassment and intimidation of opposition politicians, which \n     have greatly limited the ability of opposing candidates to \n     campaign freely; and\n       Whereas the absence of free and fair elections in Peru \n     would constitute a major setback for the Peruvian people and \n     for democracy in the hemisphere, could result in instability \n     in Peru, and could jeopardize United States antinarcotics \n     objectives in Peru and the region: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress Assembled, That it \n     is the sense of Congress that the President of the United \n     States should promptly convey to the President of Peru that \n     if the April 9, 2000 elections are not deemed by the \n     international community to have been free and fair, the \n     United States will modify its political and economic \n     relations with Peru, including its support for international \n     financial institution loans to Peru, and will work with other \n     democracies in this hemisphere and elsewhere toward a \n     restoration of democracy in Peru.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am joining Senators Coverdell, \nDeWine and Helms in introducing a Joint Resolution regarding the \npresidential and congressional elections in Peru, which are scheduled \nfor April 9. I want to thank the other sponsors for their leadership \nand concern for these issues.\n  These elections have generated a great deal of attention and \nanticipation, and they have also focused a spotlight on President \nFujimori, who is running for an unprecedented third term. He is doing \nso after firing three of the country's Supreme Court judges, who had \ndetermined that a third term was barred by Peru's Constitution.\n  President Fujimori has often been praised for what he has \naccomplished since he first took office in 1990. He success in \ndefeating the brutal Sendero Luminoso insurgency, combating cocaine \ntrafficking, and curbing soaring inflation has brought stability and \ngreater economic opportunities.\n  These are important achievements. Unfortunately, they have often been \naccomplished through the strong arm tactics of a president who has \nshown a disturbing willingness to run roughshod over democratic \nprinciples and institutions.\n  In the run up to the April 9th election, President Fujimori's and his \nsupporter's disrespect for democratic procedures and the conditions \nnecessary for free and fair elections has rarely been so blatant.\n  Journalists and independent election observer groups cite the \nPeruvian Government's control of key official electoral agencies, \nsystematic restrictions on freedom of the press, manipulation of the \njudicial process, alleged falsification of electoral petitions and \nharassment and intimidation of opposition politicians as just a few of \nthe problems plaguing this process.\n  In February, the National Democratic Institute and the Carter Center \nconcluded that ``extraordinary, immediate and comprehensive measures'' \nwere necessary if the Peruvian elections are to meet international \nstandards. Those measures have not been taken, and NDI and the Carter \nCenter recently reported that ``irreparable damage to the integrity of \nthe election process has already been done.'' The Clinton \nadministration, to its credit, has expressed grave concerns about the \ntransparent attempts by President Fujimori and his supporters to \nmanipulate the election process.\n  Mr. President, the results of the Peruvian elections will not be \nknown until the final ballot is counted. But one thing is already \nclear. If the elections are not deemed to have been free and fair, it \nwill be a major setback for the Peruvian people and for democracy in \nthe hemisphere. And if that happens, the United States must react \nstrongly. We will have no choice but to modify our economic and \npolitical relations with Peru, and work to restore democracy to that \ncountry.\n  That is the message of this resolution, and I urge other Senators to \nsupport it so we can send as strong a message as possible to President \nFujimori and the Peruvian people.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to mention \nanother matter that has caused me and other Members of Congress great \nconcern. The Peruvian Government recently brought to the United States \na former Peruvian Army intelligence officer who was responsible for \ntorturing a woman who was left permanently paralyzed as a result. He \nwas convicted in Peru, but released after a military tribunal reversed \nhis conviction. For reasons that I have yet to get a suitable answer \nto, the U.S. Embassy granted him a visa to come to the United States to \ntestify at a hearing before the Inter-American Human Rights Commission. \nThat was bad enough. But the fact that the Peruvian Government saw fit \nto include such a person in its official delegation to appear as a \nwitness in a human rights forum says a great deal about that \ngovernment, and it should be condemned.\n  Finally, I want to express my personal concern about Lori Berenson, \nwho was convicted by a Peruvian military court and sentenced to life in \nprison. The United States Government, other governments, Amnesty \nInternational and other independent human rights groups, have all \nconcluded that she was denied due process. I and others have called for \nher release or trial by a civilian court in accordance with \ninternational standards.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Ernest M. \nBurgess, a man who has dedicated his life to cleansing sickness from \nthe lives of countless people.\n  When my grandchildren study the events that shaped the development of \nthe twentieth century, the American Century as some call it, they will \nbe learning of the life of Dr. Burgess. I often speak of the admirable \nsacrifices and tremendous foresight of this generation of Americans: a \ngeneration who, more than any before it, left an indelible imprint on \nthe course of human history. Dr. Burgess, like thousands of his \ncontemporaries, was an ordinary citizen who lived an extraordinary life \nof service and accomplishment.\n  Born eleven years into the new century, Ernie was raised in the \ncharacter of the rural American West. Influenced by a remarkable aunt \nwho practiced medicine at a time when most women couldn't vote, he \nbecame attracted to serving and caring for the sick. Upon completion of \nhis medical degree and residency at Columbia and Cornell Universities, \nDr. Burgess served his country in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946.\n  Mr. President, one of the bitterest effects of war visits those who \nsuffer debilitating wounds and then live a life forever altered. As an \northopedic surgeon involved in ground breaking advancements in \nprosthetic surgery, Dr. Burgess has allowed thousands of amputees the \nopportunity to return to activities unimaginable at the time of the \ninjury. He is a pioneer in the field of prosthetic research and \nresponsible for the establishment of Prosthetics Research Study (PRS), \nwhich is one of the leading centers in the world for post-operative \ncare. Through a career that spans six decades, Dr. Burgess has used his \nmedical gifts to improve the health of his fellow humans.\n  As a veteran and amputee, I live with the daily reminder of the costs \nof war. Because of the work of Dr. Burgess, I and thousands of veterans \nhave a more powerful reminder of our service: one where our lives are \ncomplete and rewarding.\n  Through his work with the Prosthetic Research Study, Dr. Burgess \npioneered new surgical techniques that allow amputees to move with more \ncomfort and mobility. The development of lightweight and responsive \nmaterials have permitted thousands of amputees the freedom to \nparticipate in physical activities from skiing to basketball. On a \npersonal note, my passion for running and my ability to ski and play \ngolf and walk these halls could not be a reality without the advances \nspearheaded by the PRS and Dr. Burgess.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Burgess has continued to be at the \nforefront of improving prosthetic techniques. A teacher and author of \nsurgical and rehabilitation texts, he tirelessly emphasizes \nconstructive surgery for amputees. As he often states, ``the way the \nsurgery is performed will affect the rest of his life.'' Dr. Burgess \ntakes this philosophy to heart and I admire his continued pursuit of \nimproving medical care.\n  The effects of war are inflicted mainly on the innocent and young. \nAfter American participation in Vietnam ended we slowly realized the \nbreadth of the war's destruction on so many Vietnamese. The existence \nof thousands of injured civilians highlighted the larger world problem \nof poor medical treatment in many parts of the world--parts that are \nalso the most war-torn. In 1988, at the prompting of United States \nVietnam Veterans who had visited Vietnam, Dr. Burgess and others worked \nto establish the Prosthetics Outreach Center (POC). This clinic has \nprovided thousands of Vietnamese with free limbs and allowed them to \nrediscover the completeness of their lives.\n  Mr. President, as the men and women of America's greatest generation, \nenter a new century, I remain in awe of their continuing achievements. \nThe remarkable career of Dr. Burgess epitomizes the commitment to \nimproving peoples lives through dedicated effort. I am proud to be able \nto submit this Resolution recognizing a great man and paying tribute to \nhis attainments and his goals. Thank you, Dr. Burgess, and I know my \ncolleagues join me in recognition of your accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1828-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1828-S1829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 99, submitted \nearlier today by me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 99) congratulating \n     the people of Taiwan for the successful conclusion of \n     Presidential elections on March 18, 2000, and reaffirming \n     United States policy toward Taiwan and the People's Republic \n     of China.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on March 18 the people of Taiwan went to \nthe polls and chose their next president through a free and fair \nmultiparty election. The winner of a close three-way race, Chen Shui-\nbian of the Democratic Progressive Party, will be inaugurated in May.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr. Chen in Washington in 1997 \nwhen he was the mayor of Taipei. I was impressed by his political \nsmarts and his commitment to building a more democratic and prosperous \nTaiwan.\n  I also found him to be genuinely committed to improving relations \nwith the mainland.\n  I believe that Taiwan's election provides a fresh opportunity for the \npeople of Taiwan and the people of China to reach out and resolve their \ndifferences peacefully through dialog on the basis of mutual respect.\n  I hope that leaders on both sides of the Strait will seize this \nopportunity and begin to lay the foundation of trust, goodwill, and \nunderstanding which must precede true reconciliation.\n  The inauguration of Chen will end the virtual monopoly of power the \nNationalist Party has exercised for most of the past 50 years. This \npeaceful transition of power at the top of Taiwan's political system \nwill mark the maturation of their democracy, and it is an event worthy \nof our profound respect and hearty congratulations.\n  It was only 13 years ago that Taiwan lifted martial law and ushered \nin a new period of open political discourse and expanded civil liberty. \nPrior to that, Taiwan's leaders did not tolerate dissent and moved \nswiftly and sometimes ruthlessly to silence their critics.\n  Taiwan's president-elect knows this well, because he got his start in \npolitics as a young crusading lawyer working to promote transparency, \nfreedom of speech, and freedom of assembly.\n  Taiwan's emergence as a genuine multiparty democracy is a significant \ndevelopment in the long history of China. It is all the more remarkable \ngiven the fact that China's leaders in Beijing have done their level \nbest to intimidate Taiwan's voters and prevent them from exercising \nthis fundamental right.\n  I cannot help but wonder how average Chinese on the mainland must \nview Taiwan's remarkable transformation. On the one hand, the people of \nChina have a deep devotion to national unity and apparently are \nprepared to use force against Taiwan if it were to declare its \nindependence.\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\n  As Zhang Yunling of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing \nexplained to New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Rosenthal on March \n20, ``China was divided when it was weak, and now that it is getting \nstrong again, people's nationalist feeling rises and they feel strongly \nit is time to reunite the country.''\n  On the other hand, the people of China are beginning to form their \nown impressions of Taiwan, no longer content only to listen to the \ngovernment's official propaganda demonizing the island. Some even admit \npublicly to a certain grudging admiration for Taiwan's accomplishments \nand hope their own government will do nothing to precipitate a crisis.\n  As one 22-year-old Beijing University physics major told Rosenthal, \n``I think both sides will have to make adjustments to their policies. \nAfter all Taiwan is democratic now, and the people have exercised their \nright to choose a president.''\n  Let me read the words of that university student again, ``. . . the \npeople have exercised their right to choose a president.''\n  In America, we take democratic transitions of power for granted. But \nin China, and until recently on Taiwan, it was a revolutionary concept. \nAnd yet that is precisely what the people of Taiwan did on March 18. \nThey changed their leadership through a peaceful, orderly, democratic \nprocess. They did so, by all accounts, because they were frustrated \nwith corruption, cronyism, campaign finance abuses, and bureaucratic \ninefficiency.\n  These are all faults that China's communist government has in spades. \nAnd with Internet use exploding in China, and with cross-straits \ncommercial ties now in the tens of billions of dollars, there is no way \nthat the people of China will not discover what is happening on Taiwan.\n  And they may become inspired not only by the island's prosperity, but \nalso by its peaceful democratic revolution. I predict they will begin \nto ask themselves, ``How come we don't enjoy the same standard of \nliving and the same political rights here on the mainland?''\n  Taiwan's people are responsible for the island's miraculous \ntransformation from authoritarian rule and poverty to democracy and \nprosperity. They deserve all of the credit. But the people of the \nUnited States have reason to feel a little bit of pride as well.\n  If Taiwan wins the Oscar for Best Actor, then we at least get a \nnomination for Best Supporting Actor. The United States commitment to \nTaiwan's security under the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act helped \ncreate the stable environment in which Taiwan has thrived.\n  The other critical component of cross-Strait stability has been our \nadherence to a ``One-China'' policy, in which we maintain that disputes \nbetween the two sides of the Taiwan Strait must be settled peacefully, \nand that the future relationship between the People's Republic of China \nand Taiwan must be determined in accordance with the wishes of the \npeople of China and the people of Taiwan.\n  Maintaining a peaceful, stable environment in the Taiwan Strait has \nfostered economic growth throughout East Asia. It has also aided the \nemergence of democratic societies in the Philippines, Thailand, South \nKorea, Indonesia, and Taiwan.\n  In the past decade, more people have come under democratic rule in \nEast Asia than were liberated in Europe by the end of the cold war and \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. This remarkable accomplishment would \nnot have been possible without United States leadership.\n  Given all that Taiwan has accomplished in such a short span, I look \nforward to the future with renewed hope that someday all people of \nChina will enjoy the rights and standard of living enjoyed by those \nfortunate few who live on Taiwan.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 99) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 99\n\n       Whereas section 2(c) of the Taiwan Relations Act (Public \n     Law 96-8) states ``[t]he preservation and enhancement of the \n     human rights of all the people on Taiwan'' to be an objective \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas Taiwan has become a multiparty democracy in which \n     all citizens have the right to participate freely in the \n     political process;\n       Whereas the people of Taiwan have, by their vigorous \n     participation in electoral campaigns and public debate, \n     strengthened the foundations of a free and democratic way of \n     life;\n       Whereas Taiwan successfully conducted a presidential \n     election on March 18, 2000;\n       Whereas President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan has actively \n     supported the consolidation of democratic institutions and \n     processes in Taiwan since 1988 when he became President;\n       Whereas this election represents the first such transition \n     of national office from one elected leader to another in the \n     history of Chinese societies;\n       Whereas the continued democratic development of Taiwan is a \n     matter of fundamental importance to the advancement of United \n     States interests in East Asia and is supported by the United \n     States Congress and the American people;\n       Whereas a stable and peaceful security environment in East \n     Asia is essential to the furtherance of democratic \n     developments in Taiwan and other countries, as well as to the \n     protection of human rights throughout the region;\n       Whereas since 1972 United States policy toward the People's \n     Republic of China has been predicated upon, as stated in \n     section 2(b)(3) of the Taiwan Relations Act, ``the \n     expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by \n     peaceful means'';\n       Whereas section 2(b)(6) of the Taiwan Relations Act further \n     pledges ``to maintain the capacity of the United States to \n     resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that \n     would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic \n     system, of the people of Taiwan'';\n       Whereas on June 9, 1998, the House of Representatives voted \n     unanimously to adopt House Concurrent Resolution 270 that \n     called upon the President of the United States to seek ``a \n     public renunciation by the People's Republic of China of any \n     use of force, or threat to use force, against democratic \n     Taiwan'';\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has consistently \n     refused to renounce the use of force against Taiwan;\n       Whereas the State Council, an official organ at the highest \n     level of the Government of the People's Republic of China, \n     issued a ``white paper'' on February 21, 2000, which \n     threatened ``to adopt all drastic measures possible, \n     including the use of force'', if Taiwan indefinitely delays \n     entering into negotiations with the People's Republic of \n     China on the issue of reunification; and\n       Whereas the February 21, 2000, statement by the State \n     Council significantly escalates tensions across the Taiwan \n     Straits and sets forth a new condition that has not \n     heretofore been stated regarding the conditions that would \n     prompt the People's Republic of China to use force against \n     Taiwan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the people of Taiwan are to be congratulated for the \n     successful conclusion of presidential elections on March 18, \n     2000, and for their continuing efforts in developing and \n     sustaining a free, democratic society which respects human \n     rights and embraces free markets;\n       (2) President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan is to be congratulated \n     for his significant contributions to freedom and democracy on \n     Taiwan;\n       (3) President-elect Chen Shui-bian and Vice President-elect \n     Annette Hsiu-lien Lu of Taiwan are to be congratulated for \n     their victory, and they have the strong support and best \n     wishes of the Congress and the American people for a \n     successful administration;\n       (4) it is the sense of Congress that the People's Republic \n     of China should refrain from making provocative threats \n     against Taiwan and should instead undertake steps that would \n     lead to a substantive dialogue, including a renunciation of \n     the use of force against Taiwan and progress toward \n     democracy, the rule of law, and protection of human and \n     religious rights in the People's Republic of China; and\n       (5) the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law \n     96-8) are hereby affirmed as the statutory standard by which \n     United States policy toward Taiwan shall be determined.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1830-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1830-S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2285\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request which I \nhave communicated to Senator Daschle. He is here to respond. Before I \npropound it, I will say this does have to do with the issue of gasoline \ntaxes, and it is an effort to get a process started so we can have a \ndiscussion and debate about votes on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to Calendar No. 473, \nS.\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\n2285, regarding gas taxes, and that following the reporting of the \nbill, there be 4 hours equally divided for debate under control of the \ntwo leaders or their designees. I further ask unanimous consent that no \namendments or motions be in order and, following the use or yielding \nback of time, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, \nall without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, \nthis bill has never been in committee. It has not had the opportunity \nafforded most legislation to be considered, have hearings, have people \ncome forth and talk about the implications of eliminating the gas tax. \nNormally bills go through committee, and then they come to the floor. \nThat is No. 1.\n  No. 2, what kind of a debate would one have when no amendments are \nmade available? I cannot imagine that on an issue of this import we \nwould want to accelerate the debate, accelerate the consideration, and \nprevent Senators from offering amendments and other ideas.\n  For those reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret the objection from the minority \nleader, but I understand. This agreement would allow the Senate to pass \nand send a message to all Americans that we are trying to do what we \ncan in the short term to alleviate the rising gas prices all Americans \nare paying at the pumps.\n  I would not suggest for a moment that this is the long-term solution, \nand I should emphasize, this legislation would allow for the suspension \nof the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gas tax for the remainder of the year, with a \ntrigger device that says that if the average price nationwide reaches \n$2, then there will be a gas tax holiday for the remainder of the year \nfor the full 18.4 cents a gallon.\n  It is pretty simple and straightforward. There would be time for \ndebate, but I understand.\n  We will get the process started, and we will see how it develops in \nterms of the debate and what votes will occur in order for us to start \nthis process, which looks like we will have to go through a motion to \nproceed to invoke cloture on the bill and then there will be subsequent \nvotes.\n  In order for this to be considered in a timely fashion, which could \ntake as long as a week or two, I thought we needed to get it started.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/28/senate-section/article/S1831-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MOTION TO PROCEED--S. 2285\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I \nthought we had worked out all of the problems. Now, as I understand it, \nthere are some problems on the Republican side. I hope it won't be held \nup too much longer. We need to get on with that legislation, and we \nhave been trying to move this bill to conference now for some time. We \nhad worked out our concerns with regard to representation, and I was \ncertain we would be able to finish that work today.

How do you end debate that you haven't even started? \nThat is what we are being asked to do on Thursday, end debate on a tax \nbill that didn't go to the committee, on a tax bill that hasn't had one \nhearing.\n  How is it that we would limit Senators' rights to offer amendments \nwhen those considerations are paramount as we consider a tax bill--a \ngas tax bill?\n  So we are very concerned about why it is we need to move rapidly to \nthis legislation if it is this important, if it is this much a part of \nfinding ways in which to provide relief.
