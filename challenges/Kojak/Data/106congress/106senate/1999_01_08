ALEXANDER\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, recently Major General Richard C. \nAlexander of Ohio retired as the Adjutant General of the Ohio National \nGuard. I rise today to pay tribute to this remarkable individual and \ndedicated public servant.\n  General Alexander's military career began in 1954 when he joined the \nMarine Corps and served honorably until 1958, when he was discharged \nwith the rank of Sergeant. As a native of Cleveland, General Alexander \nreturned to Ohio and enlisted in the Ohio National Guard and served in \nBattery C, 1st Missile Battalion, 137th Artillery.\n  Continuing his career, General Alexander completed the National Guard \nState Officer School and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant on May \n6th, 1965. Following the completion of many advanced military education \ncourses including graduating from the U.S. Army War College and U.S. \nArmy Command and General Staff Course, General Alexander rose through \nthe ranks within the Ohio National Guard and was selected to serve as \nthe Ohio Adjutant General in December 1987.\n  When I was the Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, I became aware of how \nfortunate the citizens of Ohio were to have an individual such as \nRichard Alexander serving as the Adjutant General of the Ohio National \nGuard. During his tenure as the Adjutant General, he has met many \nchallenges that have tasked the full scope of his ability to manage a \ncitizen soldier force in a world environment of uncertainty and \nchanging global priorities.\n  The Ohio National Guard has found itself a witness, participant and \nbeneficiary to the many changes and successes that occurred under the \nleadership of General Alexander. During the Persian Gulf War, more than \n1,600 Ohio National Guard members were activated in support of military \noperations. In 1993, the Ohio National Guard was called upon to respond \nto an inmate riot at the Lucasville Prison. Since that time Ohioans \nrepeatedly have called upon the services of the Ohio National Guard to \nrespond to various natural disasters involving flood recovery and \nvarious levels of snow emergencies. I have seen first hand the \ntremendous service and professionalism of the National Guard when I \ntoured areas of the state that were damaged by the rain and flooding in \nthe Spring of 1997.\n  In addition to assistance at the local level, defense officials \nrepeatedly have called upon the services of Ohio National Guard members \nto supplement and support our national military defense in a variety of \nmissions throughout the world. The strong leadership that has been \nprovided by General Alexander has benefitted not only the Ohio National \nGuard, it has benefitted all Ohioans and our Nation. These leadership \nskills were recognized by the National Guard Association of the United \nStates, which appointed General Alexander to the position of President \nof the association in 1996.\n  It is with a degree of sadness that I find myself saying ``farewell'' \nto such a strong leader and personal friend. General Alexander has \nserved his country ably and honorably for the past forty-four years. \nThe positive impact he has had on the lives of Ohioans is immeasurable \nand his compassion for people and pride in serving in the military \nepitomize the true meaning of the words--Duty, Honor, Country.\n  I join with all Ohioans in expressing my appreciation for a job well \ndone to Major General Richard C. Alexander. I wish General Alexander, \nhis wife, LaVera, and his entire family all the very best.

Mr. President, Thomas Carlyle remarked, ``A \nwell-written Life is almost as rare as a well-spent one.'' Truer words \nnever were written, if construed as a double entendre, about my rare, \ndear friend, Russell Baker. Baker's last ``Observer'' column appeared \nin the New York Times this past Christmas, ending a 36-year run. Over \nthe course of some 3 million words, by his own reckoning, Russell Baker \nhas displayed grace, gentle wit, decency, and profound insight into the \nhuman condition. Nearly fifteen years ago, I stated that Russell Baker,\n\n       * * * has been just about the sanest observer of American \n     life that we've had. He has been gentle with us, forgiving, \n     understanding. He has told us truths in ways we have been \n     willing to hear, which is to say he has been humorous . . . \n     on the rare occasion he turns to us with a terrible visage of \n     near rage and deep disappointment, we do well to listen all \n     the harder.\n\n  He leaves a huge hole I doubt any other journalist can fill.\n  A life well-spent? He's a patriot, having served as a Navy flyer \nduring World War II. For nearly fifty years, he has been married to his \nbeloved Mimi. They have three grown children. His career has taken him \nfrom the Baltimore Sun's London Bureau to the Times' Washington Bureau. \nHe has covered presidential campaigns, and he has accompanied \nPresidents abroad. He has met popes, kings, queens--and common people, \ntoo, for whom he has such enormous and obvious empathy. And now he is \nthe welcoming presence on Mobil Masterpiece Theatre.\n  A life well-written? The Washington Post's Jonathan Yardley calls \nRussell Baker ``a columnist's columnist,'' writing, ``Baker broke his \nown mold. He was, simply and utterly, sui generis.'' I would not use \nthe past tense, because I doubt Russell Baker is done putting pen to \npaper. But the sentiment is spot on.\n  A life well-written? Baker has won two Pulitzer Prizes--one in 1979 \nfor Distinguished Commentary and another in 1983 for his 1982 \nautobiography, ``Growing Up.'' He has written thirteen other books and \nedited The Norton Book of Light Verse and his own book of American \nhumor. Russell Baker isn't just one of the best newspaper writers \naround; as Yardley puts it, he is ``one of the best writers around. \nPeriod.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that Russell Baker's last regular ``Observer'' \ncolumn, which appeared in the December 25, 1998 edition of the New York \nTimes, appear in the Congressional Record following my remarks. I \nfurther ask that Jonathan Yardley's ``Russell Baker: A Columnist's \nColumnist,'' which appeared in the January 4, 1999 edition of the \nWashington Post, also appear in the Record following my remarks.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 25, 1998]\n\n                         A Few Words at the End\n\n                           (By Russell Baker)\n\n       Since it is Christmas, a day on which nobody reads a \n     newspaper anyhow, and since this is the last of these columns \n     titled ``Observer'' which have been appearing in The Times \n     since 1962, I shall take the otherwise inexcusable liberty of \n     talking about me and newspapers. I love them.\n       I have loved them since childhood when my Uncle Allen \n     regularly brought home Hearst's New York Journal-American \n     with its wonderful comics, Burris Jenkins cartoons and tales \n     of rich playboys, murderous playgirls and their love nests. \n     At that age I hadn't a guess about what a love nest might be, \n     and didn't care, and since something about ``love nest'' \n     sounded curiously illegal, I never asked an adult for \n     edification.\n       On Sundays Uncle Allen always brought The New York Times \n     and read himself to sleep with it. Such a dismal mass of gray \n     paper was of absolutely no interest to me. It was \n     Katenzjammer Kids and Maggie and Jiggs of the King Features \n     syndicate with whom I wanted to spend Sunday.\n       At my friend Harry's house I discovered the New York \n     tabloids. Lots of great pictures. Dick Tracy! Plenty of \n     stories about condemned killers being executed, with emphasis \n     on what they had eaten for their last meal, before walking--\n     the last mile! The tabloids left me enthralled by the \n     lastness of things.\n       Inevitably, I was admitted to practice the trade, and I \n     marveled at the places newspapers could take me. They took me \n     to suburbs on sunny Saturday afternoons to witness the mortal \n     results of family quarrels in households that kept pistols. \n     They took me to hospital emergency rooms to listen to people \n     die and to ogle nurses.\n       They took me to the places inhabited by the frequently \n     unemployed and there taught me the smell of poverty. In \n     winter there was also the smell of deadly kerosene stoves \n     used for heating, though their tendency to set bedrooms on \n     fire sent the morgue a predictable stream of customers every \n     season.\n       The memory of those smells has been a valuable piece of \n     equipment during my career as a columnist. Columnists' \n     tendency to spend their time with life's winners and to lead \n     lives of isolation from the less dazzling American realties \n     makes it too easy for us sometimes to solve the nation's \n     problems in 700 words.\n       Newspapers have taken me into the company of the great as \n     well as the greatly celebrated. On these expeditions I have \n     sat in the Elysee Palace and gazed on the grandeur that was \n     Charles de Gaulle speaking as from Olympus. I have watched \n     Nikita Khrushchev, fresh from terrifying Jack Kennedy inside \n     a Vienna Embassy, emerge to clown with the press.\n       I have been apologized to by Richard Nixon. I have seen \n     Adlai Stevenson, would-be President of the United States, \n     shake hands with a department-store dummy in Florida.\n       I have been summoned on a Saturday morning to the Capitol \n     of the United States to meet with Lyndon Johnson, clad in \n     pajamas and urgently needing my advice on how to break a \n     civil-rights filibuster. I have often been played for a fool \n     like this by other interesting men and, on occasion, equally \n     interesting women.\n       Pope John XXIII included me in an audience he granted the \n     press group en route to Turkey, Iran and points east with \n     President Eisenhower. The Pope's feet barely reached the \n     floor and seemed to dance as he spoke.\n       Newspapers took me to Westminister Abbey in a rental white \n     tie and topper to see Queen Elizabeth crowned and to \n     Versailles in another rental white-tie-and-tails rig to share \n     a theater evening with the de Gaulles and the John F. \n     Kennedys.\n       Thanks to newspapers, I have made a four-hour visit to \n     Afghanistan, have seen the Taj Mahal by moonlight, \n     breakfasted at dawn on lamb and couscous while sitting by the \n     marble pool of a Moorish palace in Morocco and once picked up \n     a persistent family of fleas in the Balkans.\n       In Iran I have ridden in a press bus over several miles of \n     Oriental carpets with which the Shah had ordered the street \n     covered between airport and town to honor the visiting\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\n     Eisenhower, a man who, during a White House news conference \n     which I attended in shirtsleeves, once identified me as \n     ``that man that's got the shirt on.''\n       I could go on and on, and probably will somewhere sometime, \n     but the time for this enterprise is up. Thanks for listening \n     for the past three million words.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 4, 1999]\n\n                 Russell Baker: A Columnist's Columnist\n\n                         (By Jonathan Yardley)\n\n       Christmas 1998 was bright and beautiful here on the East \n     Coast, but the happy day also brought a great loss. The \n     announcement of it was made that morning on the Op-Ed page of \n     the New York Times, under the chilling headline, ``A Few \n     Words at the End,'' and under the byline of Russell Baker.\n       The headline told the story, and the opening of Baker's \n     column confirmed it. ``Since it is Christmas,'' he wrote, ``a \n     day on which nobody reads a newspaper anyhow, and since this \n     is the last of these columns titled `Observer' which have \n     been appearing in the Times since 1962 . . .'' at which point \n     it was all I could do to keep on reading. But read I did, out \n     loud, right to the end--``Thanks for listening for the past \n     three million words''--when I could only blurt out: ``Well, \n     my world just got a lot smaller.''\n       That is no exaggeration. I cannot pretend to have read all \n     3 million of those words, for there were periods when my \n     peregrinations up and down this side of the North American \n     continent put me out of touch with the Times, but I read most \n     of them and treasured every one. Baker's columns were the \n     center of my life as a reader of newspapers, and it is \n     exceedingly difficult to imagine what that life will be \n     without them.\n       Thirty-six years! Has any American newspaper columnist \n     maintained so high a standard of wit, literacy and \n     intelligence for so long a time? Only two come to mind: H.L. \n     Mencken and Walter Lippmann. But Mencken's columns for the \n     Baltimore Evening Sun were on-and-off affairs, and Lippmann \n     struggled through a long dry period during the 1950s before \n     being brought back to life in the 1960s by the debate over \n     the Vietnam War. Baker, by contrast, was, like that other \n     exemplary Baltimorean Cal Ripken Jr., as consistent and \n     reliable as he was brilliant. For all those years he was my \n     idea of what a journalist should be, and I strived--with \n     precious little success--to live up to this example.\n       Not that I tried to imitate him, or not that I was aware of \n     doing so. One of the many remarkable things about Baker is \n     that, unlike Mencken or Lippmann--or Baker's old boss, James \n     Reston, or Dorothy Thompson, or Drew Pearson, or Dave Barry--\n     he really has no imitators. Other journalists may envy what \n     he did, but in a business where imitation is the sincerest \n     form of self-promotion, Baker broke his own mold. He was, \n     simply and utterly, sui generis.\n       This made him, in the cozy and self-congratulatory world of \n     journalists, odd man out. His colleagues and competitors may \n     have admired and respected him, but few understood him. While \n     they chased around after ephemeral scoops and basked in the \n     reflected glory of the famous and powerful, Baker wrote what \n     he once called ``a casual column without anything urgent to \n     tell humanity,'' about aspects of life that journalists \n     commonly regard as beneath what they fancy to be their \n     dignity. Looking back to the column's beginnings, Baker once \n     wrote:\n       ``At the Times in those days the world was pretty much \n     confined to Washington news, national news and foreign news. \n     Being ruled off those turfs seemed to leave nothing very \n     vital to write about, and I started calling myself the Times' \n     nothing columnist.' I didn't realize at first that it was a \n     wonderful opportunity to do a star turn. Freed from the duty \n     to dilate on the global predicament of the day, I could build \n     a grateful audience among readers desperate for relief from \n     the Times' famous gravity.''\n       That is precisely what he did. As he noticed in his \n     valedictory column, Baker's years as a gumshoe reporter \n     immunized him from ``columnists' tendency to spend their time \n     with life's winners and to lead lives of isolation from the \n     less dazzling American realities.'' Instead of writing self-\n     important thumb-suckers--``The Coming Global Malaise,'' \n     ``Nixon's Southern Strategy,'' ``Whither Cyprus?''--he \n     concentrated on ordinary life as lived by ordinary middle-\n     class Americans in the second half of the 20th century. He \n     wrote about shopping at the supermarket, about car breakdowns \n     and mechanics who failed to remedy them, about television and \n     what it told us about ourselves, about children growing up \n     and parents growing older.\n       Quite surely it is because Baker insisted on writing about \n     all this stuff that failed to meet conventional definitions \n     of ``news'' that not until 1979 did his fellow journalists \n     get around to giving him the Pulitzer Prize for commentary. \n     Probably, too, it is because he insisted on being amused by \n     the passing scene and writing about in an amusing way. He was \n     only occasionally laugh-out-loud amusing in the manner of \n     Dave Barry--who is now, with Baker's retirement, the one \n     genuinely funny writer in American newspapers--but he was \n     always witty and wry, and he possessed a quality of which I \n     am in awe: an ability to ingratiate himself with readers \n     while at the same time making the most mordant judgments on \n     their society and culture.\n       There were times in the late years of his column when \n     mordancy seemed to hover at the edge of bitterness. This \n     struck me as inexplicable, but the inner life of another \n     person is forever a mystery, and in any event there is much \n     in fin de siecle America about which to be bitter. But mostly \n     Baker dealt in his stock in trade: common-sensical wisdom, \n     wry skepticism, transparent decency. He wasn't just the best \n     newspaper writer around, he was one of the best writers \n     around. Period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/08/senate-section/article/S54-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S55]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MORTENSEN WINS NATIONAL FINALS RODEO\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention \nto Dan Mortensen's fifth National Finals Rodeo Championship. Dan \nMortensen hails from Manhattan, a small Montana town just off \nInterstate 90 near the headwaters of the Missouri River. He made the \ndecision to ride saddle broncs on the pro rodeo circuit--and Montana is \nproud that he did.\n  In a year when Montana's agriculture community saw many defeats, we \nthank Dan for inspiring us. He gave us a great show and a championship \nto boot. We were there with him for his ten white knuckled rides. \nHowever, we had stationary seats while he had the notorious saddle \nbronc horse of the year, Skoal's Wild Card, trying to buck him off in a \nbreaking 88 point ride in the final round. The 88 point ride earned \nMortenson one more National Finals Rodeo Championship.\n  In winning his fifth world saddle bronc title, Dan is working toward \na record established by the famous Casey Tibbs for consecutive world \ntitles; a record established in the early days of professional rodeo in \nAmerica.\n  I would like to personally thank Mortensen for entertaining us with \nhis breathtaking rides and wish him the best of luck in upcoming \nrodeos. He is truly an inspiration to competitors in any sport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/08/senate-section/article/S55-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S55]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
